It was adapted for the cinema under the title Whisky Galore!. It followed on from an earlier 1943 novel Keep the Home Guard Turning in the same setting, ==Plot summary== During the Second World War, the cargo vessel S.S. Cabinet Minister is wrecked off a remote fictional Scottish island group -- Great Todday and Little Todday -- with fifty thousand cases of whisky aboard. Due to wartime rationing, the thirsty islanders had nearly run out of the \\"water of life\\" and see this as an unexpected godsend. They manage to salvage several hundred cases before the ship sinks. But it is not all clear sailing. They must thwart the efforts of the authorities to confiscate the liquor, particularly in the shape of misguided, pompous Home Guard Captain Paul Waggett. A cat-and-mouse battle of wits ensues. Although the wreck and the escapades over the whisky are at the centre of the story, there is also a lot of background detail about life in the Outer Hebrides, including e.g. culture clashes between the Protestant island of Great Todday and the Roman Catholic island of Little Todday. (Mackenzie based the geography of these islands on Barra and Eriskay respectively, but in real life they are both Catholic islands). There are various sub-plots including those of two couples who are planning to get married. Mackenzie's prose captures the various accents of the area and also includes much common Gaelic that was in use at the time. The book includes a glossary of both the meaning and approximate pronunciation of the language. ==Origins of the story== The story was based on a real-life incident that occurred in 1941 on the Hebridean island of Eriskay when the SS Politician ran aground with a cargo including 28,000 cases of malt whisky as well as other trade goods headed for Jamaica and New Orleans. Official files released by The National Archives show that it was also carrying a sum of cash. In all, there were nearly 290,000 ten-shilling notes, which would be worth the equivalent of several million pounds at today's prices. Not all of this was recovered from the wreck. ==Adaptations== Film Whisky Galore! is a 1949 British comedy film produced by Ealing Studios, starring Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson. It was the directorial debut of Alexander Mackendrick; the screenplay was by Compton Mackenzie, an adaptation of his novel, and Angus MacPhail. Stage A theatrical adaptation of the novel, licensed by the Society of Authors (the managers of Compton Mackenzie's literary estate) and written by Paul Godfrey, was first performed as a \\"bar show\\" at Perth Theatre in the late 1980s. This adaptation, delivered in the manner of a 1940s radio broadcast, has four BBC Radio Rep actors and a studio manager creating all the locations, characters and sound effects as they would have done in a live radio broadcast. This version was also produced by Mull Theatre in the late 1990s, early 2000s, and 2014, touring to theatres throughout Scotland. A musical version of the novel, entitled 'Whisky Galore - a musical!', was performed at the Pitlochry Festival Theatre, Scotland in 2009 and 2011. The book was adapted by Shona McKee McNeil and the music was composed by Ian Hammond Brown. A Gaelic language adaption of the novel was adapted for the stage by Iain Finlay MacLeod for a National Theatre of Scotland, Robhanis and A Play, A Pie and A Pint at √íran M√≥r co-production titled Uisge-Beatha Gu Le√≤r in 2015. ==References== Category:Novels set in the Outer Hebrides Category:Novels by Compton Mackenzie Category:1947 British novels Category:British comedy novels Category:Scottish comedy Category:Chatto & Windus books Category:British novels adapted into films ","title":"Whisky Galore (novel)"},{"id":"1428883","text":"Pavlikeni () is a town in Veliko Tarnovo Province, Northern Bulgaria, about 41 kilometers from the city of Veliko Tarnovo.

Nell Rankin (January 3, 1924 - January 13, 2005) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano. Though a successful opera singer internationally, she spent most of her career at the Metropolitan Opera, where she worked from 1951 to 1976. She was particularly admired for her portrayals of Amneris in Verdi's Aida and the title role in Bizet's Carmen. Opera News said, \\"Her full, generous tone and bold phrasing, especially in the Italian repertory, were unique among American mezzos of her generation.Obituary, metoperafamily.org, January 18, 2005. ==Early life and education== Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Rankin was raised in a musical family. Along with her parents and siblings, Rankin grew up playing various musical instruments. She began performing at the age of four on the radio by singing for commercials.Opera News April 2003 As a teenager she studied voice with Madame Jeanne Lorraine (a ten-year student of vocal pedagogue, Manuel Garcia), at the Birmingham Conservatory. In order to pay for her lessons with Lorraine, Rankin rented the Huntingdon College pool and spent her summers teaching the children of Montgomery to swim. Helen Traubel visited the conservatory to perform a recital in 1943. Determined to succeed in an opera career, Rankin went backstage and persuaded Traubel's accompanist, Coenraad V. Bos, to hear her sing. On Bos's advice, she moved to New York City to continue her studies with Karin Branzell. Her sister, Ruth Rankin, a soprano with similar ambitions, moved with her. An illuminating story of the Rankins is found in the biography of Jussi Bjoerling written by his wife, wherein she tells of Nell singing \\"O don fatale\\" for Maestro Bjoerling in their Montgomery home. Ten years later she knocked on his dressing room door at the Chicago Lyric to reintroduce herself as his Eboli for the evening.12 Bjoerling, Anna- Lisa: Jussi ==Career== Rankin made her professional recital debut at Town Hall, in a joint recital with her sister in March 1947. This was followed by her operatic debut as Amneris in a production of Aida at the Salmaggi Opera Company in Brooklyn, with her sister in the title role. Rankin joined the Opernhaus Z√ºrich in 1948, where she made her debut as Ortrud in Wagner's Lohengrin. She stayed with the company for two years and sang 126 performances with the company during her first year alone. In 1950 she joined Theater Basel, where she performed Amneris in Aida and Dalila in Saint-Sa√´ns's Samson et Dalila. That same year she became the first American singer to win the first prize at the International Music Competition in Geneva, which raised Rankin's profile in the opera world; she soon received invitations to perform at many of the world's best opera houses. In 1951 she debuted at the Teatro alla Scala, the Vienna State Opera, and the Metropolitan Opera, all in the role of Amneris in Aida. That same year she recorded the role of Suzuki in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, opposite Renata Tebaldi, for Decca Records and was a soloist in La Scala's production of Verdi's Requiem under Victor de Sabata, with Renata Tebaldi, Giacinto Prandelli and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. In 1953, she made her debuts at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and the San Francisco Opera, both in the title role of Bizet's Carmen. She also gave a solo recital for Queen Elizabeth II in honor of her Coronation.Profile, USAToday.com; accessed July 10, 2015. Also in 1953, she gave her first solo recital in New York City at Town Hall. The New York Times said of her performance, \\"Not only is Miss Rankin's a voice of power and range, but it is as warm as the red color of the dress she wore. Her voice is beautifully trained so that it flows purely and evenly no matter how long sustained or how quickly stated.\\"Profile, nytimes.org, January 12, 1953. Rankin was one of the singers honored in the Metropolitan Opera's Centennial Concert in 1983. Many veteran singers of the company were asked to sit on the stage for the second half of the performance. In a 2002 Opera News interview, Rankin said that the single most memorable musical event in her career took place in 1952. Her husband was in the Air Force in North Africa, and she was engaged to give a solo concert on the Mediterranean coast, in an open-air theater forty miles outside Tripoli. \\"Imagine\\", says Rankin, \\"Libya was still a kingdom then, and King Idris had a piano flown in from Egypt, while an American cruiser was stationed near the shore to illuminate the stage. The whole thing was unreal and unforgettable.\\" Although Rankin made appearances with several major companies throughout her career, she spent most of her time in New York City performing at the Metropolitan Opera between 1951 and 1976; there she sang the role of Carmen, the Princess di Bouillon in Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur, Madelon in Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier, Santuzza in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Marina in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov (in English), Giulietta in Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Herodias in Richard Strauss's Salome, Maddalena in Verdi's Rigoletto, Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore, Princess Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlo, Ulrica in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, Brang√§ne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Gutrune in Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Fricka in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre and Ortrud in Wagner's Lohengrin among others. Her last performance with the company was as Laura in Ponchielli's La Gioconda on April 16, 1976.Profile, Metropolitan Opera Archives; accessed July 10, 2015. Other notable performances in Rankin's career include the starring role in CBS's television production of Carmen in 1954 and several productions at La Scala, including the role of Cassandra in Berlioz's Les Troyens in 1960. She made her Lyric Opera of Chicago debut in 1959 as Princess Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlo.Lyric Opera of Chicago Archives She also appeared at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples as Adalgisa in Bellini's Norma in 1963. In 1971 she appeared as Carmen in the very first production made by the Lyric Opera Company of Long Island.Profile, New York Times, November 28, 1971. She appeared at the Teatro Col√≥n, Bellas Artes Opera in Mexico City, the Liceu in Barcelona and a score of other companies in Europe and North America. She was an admired recitalist and concert singer throughout her career.Profile, metoperafamily.org, April 2005, vol 69, no. 10. She was asked often asked by Sir Rudolf Bing to look soprano roles such as Elsa in Lohengrin. \\"Mr. Bing, I AM as soprano, but I am a MEZZO soprano.\\" This is advice she would also give her students. After she retired from the Metropolitan Opera, Rankin devoted herself to teaching, first at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, from 1977 to 1984. Among her students were Tenor Richard Burke, Bass-Baritone Lucas Ernst, and Mezzo- Soprano Wanda Brister. She taught privately in New York City until she retired in 1991. ==Recordings== Rankin made few commercial recordings during her career. Although she was under contract with the Decca label, many of her recording projects fell through for various reasons, and her only Decca recording is Suzuki in Puccini's Madama Butterfly with Renata Tebaldi in the title role. She sang in Beethoven's 9th Symphony recorded with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra conducted by Bruno Walter (CBS). She made a magnificent recording of Brahms songs - including the Four Serious Songs - with Coenraad V. Bos for Capitol Records (Capitol P8289.) This is doubly significant as V. Bos was the accompanist for the Serious Songs‚Äô first performance in 1896 with the composer in attendance. Also on Capitol she appears in Vaughan Williams‚Äô ‚ÄúFive Tudor Portraits‚Äù (P8218.) A number of notable live recordings have become available on CD. Among them is a 1951 recording of Rankin's Amneris in Aida that was conducted by Herbert von Karajan for radio broadcast in Vienna, a recording of Verdi's Requiem at La Scala from that same year, and the 1960 La Scala production of Berlioz's Les Troyens. A famous \\"pirated\\" recording of hers is a 1958 performance of A√Øda in Mexico City, with Rankin as Amneris and fellow singers Anita Cerquetti, Flaviano Lab√≤, Cornell MacNeil, Fernando Corena and Norman Treigle. Rankin was among the singers honored at the Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala in 1983. ==Personal life== In 1952 Rankin married Dr. Hugh Clark Davidson, a physician. They were married for fifty- three years until her death of polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disease in 2005, aged 81. She died at Cabrini Medical Center in New York City. The Davidsons had no children; this was a source of sorrow to them, and they became ¬®aunt¬® and ¬®uncle¬® to some of the children of Miss Rankin¬¥s friends. Miss Rankin loved exotic animals and at one time owned a myna bird named Pharaoh and a jaguar named King Tut with which she was photographed as Amneris. Her myna birds loved music too, and sometimes learned her arias as she practiced them at the piano. She would then accompany them, singing a third lower for harmony. ==References== ==External links== *Obituary from The New York Times *Biography at the Alabama Academy of Honor Category:1924 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Academy of Vocal Arts faculty Category:American opera singers Category:Operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:Musicians from Montgomery, Alabama Category:Disease-related deaths in New York (state) Category:20th-century American opera singers Category:20th-century women opera singers Category:20th-century American women singers ","title":"Nell Rankin"},{"id":"1428886","text":"Bruce Graham Bruce John Graham (December 1, 1925 - March 6, 2010) was a Peruvian-American architect.

He attended Colegio San Jose de Rio Piedras in Puerto Rico, and graduated in 1944. He studied at the University of Dayton, Ohio, and Structural Engineering at the Case School of Applied Sciences in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1948 with a degree in Architecture. When he first came to Chicago, he worked for Holabird and Root and joined the Chicago office Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the largest architectural firm in the United States in 1951. ==Career== During his 40-year tenure at SOM, Bruce Graham designed notable buildings all over the world from his home in Chicago, to Guatemala, Hong Kong, London, Cairo, and many other cities. He designed the Willis Tower, tallest building in the world for nearly 36 years, the 100 story tall John Hancock Center, One Shell Plaza etc. He was extremely involved with the University of Pennsylvania, especially the School of Fine Arts. He believed that teachers of architecture should be currently involved in its practice. He was committed to the study of architectural theory and started the SOM Foundation. He also taught an architectural studio at Harvard. Graham was a great collector of art. He befriended Alexander Calder, Joan Mir√≥, Chryssa and Chillida, among others. He invited these artists to create public works of art for the city of Chicago. He believed that to create great work an architect should be informed by philosophy, history, music and literature. ==Design philosophy== Graham had studied structural engineering at Case Western and brought that knowledge and respect of the structure of an edifice to all his buildings. The Hancock building in particular, uses structural design for esthetic expression. Graham later expressed this in Hotel Arts in Barcelona and many other buildings including his buildings in London at Broadgate. Bruce Graham firmly believed that architecture like dance and music were a combination of structure and beauty. He believed that these forms of art represented the highest achievements of culture. Like other forms of Art, Graham believed that Architecture was a result and a reflection of the morals of the culture in which it was built.

The modern city of Hokuto was established on November 1, 2004, from the merger of the towns of Hakush≈´, Nagasaka, Sutama and Takane, and the villages of Akeno, Mukawa and ≈åizumi (all from Kitakoma District). On March 15, 2006, Hokuto absorbed the town of Kobuchisawa (also from Kitakoma District). Kitakoma District was dissolved as a result of this merger. ==Government== Hokuto has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 22 members. ==Economy== The economy of Hokuto is primarily agricultural, with seasonal tourism, precision manufacturing and food processing playing secondary roles. ==Education== *Teikyo-Gakuen Junior College *Hokuto has eight public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government and two public high schools operated by the Yamanashi Prefectural Board of Education. ==Transportation== ===Railway=== *20px Central Japan Railway Company - Ch≈´≈ç Main Line ** - - *20px Central Japan Railway Company - Koumi Line ** - - - ===Highway=== *alt=E19 Ch≈´≈ç Expressway * * ==Sister cities== * - Fukuroi, Shizuoka ‚Äì since March 9, 1987 between former Asaba, Shizuoka and former Akeno, Yamanashi * - Joetsu, Niigata ‚Äì since January 17, 1991 between former Misaka Town and former Kakizaki, Niigata and Sutama, Yamanashi * - Hamura, Tokyo ‚Äì since October 1, 1996 with former Takane Town * - Nishitokyo, Tokyo since February 4, 1999 between former Tanashi, Tokyo and the former town of Sutama, Yamanashi * - Madison County, Kentucky, USA ‚Äì since May 12, 1990 with former municipalities of Takane, Nagasaka, ≈åizumi, and Kobuchisawa * - LeMars, Iowa, USA ‚Äì since July 3, 1993 with former Sutama Town * - Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea ‚Äì since March 21, 2003 with former Takane Town * - Manciano, Tuscany, Italy with former Kobuchisawa Town * - Crowsnest Pass, Alberta (unratified) ==Local attractions== *Kiyosato Plateau *Mus√©e Kiyoharu Shirakaba *Kinsei ruins, a Jomon-period settlement trace and National Historic Site. *Umenoki ruins, a Jomon-period settlement trace and National Historic Site. *Yato Castle, ruins of a Sengoku period castle, and National Historic Site *Kitash≈çji Falls, one of Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Cities in Yamanashi Prefecture ","title":"Hokuto, Yamanashi"},{"id":"1428906","text":"Hokuto may refer to: *Hokuto Shichisei or the Big Dipper, the Japanese name for the asterism *Hokuto (train) the name of train services operating in Hokkaido, Japan *Hokuto Corporation, a Tokyo-based Japanese adult video company *Hokuto (Street Fighter), a character in the Street Fighter EX video game series *Hokuto no Ken or Fist of the North Star, the title refers primarily to \\"Hokuto Shinken\\", a deadly martial art school *Hokuto Bank, a Japanese bank headquartered in Akita == Places == *Hokuto, Yamanashi, a city in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan *Hokuto, Hokkaido, a city in Hokkaido, Japan == People == *, Ainu waka poet and social activist *Hokuto \\"Hok\\" Konishi (born 1984), contestant on So You Think You Can Dance *, Japanese actor and singer *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese politician === Characters === *Hokuto, a character from B'TX *Hokuto Sumeragi, a character in Tokyo Babylon and X/1999 manga *Hokuto Dan, or Dyna Red, a character from Kagaku Sentai Dynaman *Seiji Hokuto, Ultraman Aces alter ego alongside Yuko Minami from the 1972 namesake tokusatsu *Hokuto Kaneshiro, a character from Rosario + Vampire *Hokuto, a character from Street Fighter EX *Hokuto Furukizu, a character in the video game Yandere Simulator Category:Japanese masculine given names ","title":"Hokuto"},{"id":"1428912","text":"White Light Rock & Roll Review is Matthew Good's second album as a solo artist, and was released on June 15, 2004. Though it was not as well-received as his previous solo effort, Avalanche, it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada. Recording sessions for White Light Rock & Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche, making it the shortest time spent between records for Good. Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music, Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who, who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor. To this end, Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences. In fact, many of the record's tracks (including \\"Little Terror\\", \\"North American for Life\\", \\"Blue Skies Over Bad Lands\\", \\"It's Been A While Since I Was Your Man\\", and \\"Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra\\") were written and performed live, well in advance of the album's release. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Matthew Good, except where noted. ==Miscellanea== * \\"In Love With a Bad Idea\\" contains lyrics which were once a part of a short poem by Good entitled \\"Paris Hilton's Vagina\\". * \\"North American for Life\\" came about as a result of impromptu jam sessions between Good and his live bandmembers while on tour for his previous album, Avalanche. * \\"Blue Skies Over Bad Lands\\" was recorded live in one take. Livesey recorded a practice take that the band was performing so that mic levels could be set for the \\"real\\" recording. After listening back to the practice take, Good and producer Warne Livesey felt they had captured \\"something special\\" and that another take wasn't necessary. * \\"Buffalo Seven\\" receives its title from that of a poster displaying a posse of seven cowboys which Good once hung over his bed. * \\"Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra\\", is said to be about fights Good was involved in during his youth. It is said to be a homage to The Who, whose influence was cited by Good as an inspiration for the record. The song bears many similarities to The Who's classic, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". * \\"Hopeless\\" was not included as part of the official track listing, contrary to Good's wishes, as a result of pressure by his record label who felt that the song was too country for the album. * \\"Alert Status Red\\", \\"In Love With A Bad Idea\\", and \\"Buffalo Seven\\" were all added after the initial recording session for the album. This was done at the suggestion of the record label, who were concerned that the record lacked any marketable singles. * Known b-sides for White Light Rock & Roll Review include \\"Dusk\\" and \\"Can't Get Shot in the Back (If You Don't Run)\\". The former was recorded during the early hours of the morning at the Warehouse Studios in Vancouver on an old piano after initial recording sessions for the album were complete. It was eventually offered for purchase via Puretacks, to coincide with the release of the album's first single, \\"Alert Status Red\\". A demo for \\"Can't Get Shot in the Back (If You Don't Run)\\" was recorded after the record had been mixed and was streamed on Good's website. The song was later re-recorded properly in a studio for the Hospital Music sessions and offered as a free download for matthewgood.org community members. ==Personnel== *Matthew Good - vocals, guitar, art direction *Christian Thor Valdson - guitar *Pat Steward - drums, percussion *Rich Priske - bass guitar *Warne Livesey - Producer, engineer, mixer *Scott Ternan - Assistant engineer *Joel Livesey - Assistant engineer *Zach Blackstone - Assistant engineer *Kirk McNally - Assistant engineer *Garnet Armstrong - Album design *Ivan Otis - Photography *Liza Visagie - Cover art (Second Beach Three and Second Beach Four) *Mastered by Tim Young at Metropolis, London, UK ==Controversy== Screenshot from \\"Alert Status Red\\" Alert Status Red is a song about terrorism and violence. The title of the song alludes to the United States terrorist warning system. The video for this single was released on June 1, 2004, on Matthew Good's website. Matthew Good did not direct this video, and after complaints, he took it down, because in addition to footage shot at Centennial School in Coquitlam, British Columbia, it also contained brief flashes of footage from the Columbine High School massacre. After thinking on the matter for a while, Good put the video back on his website, with these comments: :\\"We are members of a violent society. We sell the world the majority of its weaponry; we are the foremost purveyors of nuclear weapons, chemical and biological weapons, and military hardware. And yet we love nothing more than to point the finger at others and claim that they are the cause of the world's love affair with violence. The truth of the matter is that we tend to hide from the fact that we are just as violent, that we are just as capable, that we do not dwell on some higher moral ground from which to cast blame and point fingers. Incidents such as what occurred at Columbine High School demonstrate this, as does the wanton aggression of world superpowers that claim to be acting in self-defense when the truth of the matter is that they're merely reaping the whirlwind of their own abusive conduct. Our responsibility is to wake up and realize these truths.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Alert Status Red at songfacts Category:2004 albums Category:Matthew Good albums Category:Universal Music Canada albums Category:Albums produced by Warne Livesey ","title":"White Light Rock &amp; Roll Review"},{"id":"1428923","text":"Beep the Meep is a fictional alien who appeared in the Doctor Who Weekly comic strip based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. The cute and cuddly appearance of Beep the Meep -- a round, furry biped with large, expressive eyes and long ears -- belies his true nature as a malevolent, homicidal would-be conqueror and dictator. Beep first appeared in the comic strip Doctor Who and the Star Beast, written by Pat Mills and John Wagner and drawn by Dave Gibbons, which ran in issues #19-#26 of Doctor Who Weekly. The Meeps were an advanced and peaceful race, who lived in harmony and happiness until their natures were radically altered by their planet's orbit passing close to the Black Sun. The radiation from the black star mutated them into an aggressive, expansionist species who began to mercilessly conquer and subjugate other planets. Eventually, the Star Council authorized the use of the Wrarth Warriors, a genetically engineered insectoid race who acted as interstellar law enforcers. The war against the Meeps came to an end with the destruction of the Meep armada at the Battle of Yarras, but Beep, the Meeps' ruler, escaped. Beep's ship was pursued and shot down over Earth where it crash landed in the English city of Blackcastle. Beep sought refuge with two schoolchildren, using his fuzzy appearance to masquerade as a hapless, harmless creature being hunted by the ruthless Wrarth. It was in this guise that he encountered the Fourth Doctor, who protected him from the Wrarth until Beep's true nature was revealed to him. He hypnotised some people and tried to use them to repair his spaceship, deciding to take off in a hyper-space jump, even though this would destroy Blackpool. The Doctor then aided the Wrarth in apprehending Beep, and he was taken away to face justice. Beep the Meep's weapon of choice was black star radiation, which he used both as a power source for his spaceship and for brainwashing people by exposing them to it. He also usually kept an energy pistol on his person, in a pouch concealed under his fur. Beep is a memorable and popular villain, mainly due to the contrast between his appearance and his true nature, and his constant fuming at not being taken seriously because of his cute appearance. He has returned to bedevil the Doctor several times, often targeting Earth as well because of the indignities both have heaped on him. Released on parole fifteen years after being taken into custody by the Wrarth, Beep sought revenge in The Star Beast II (published in the 1996 Doctor Who Magazine Yearbook) but the Fourth Doctor used black star energy to trap him inside the children's movie For the Love of Lassie. Eventually, Beep managed to escape. In Doctor Who Magazine #283's TV Action! he traveled to the 1979 of a parallel world where the Doctor was the subject of a television programme titled Doctor Who. Beep tried to take over the BBC Television Centre, planning to broadcast black star radiation into households across Britain in an attempt to turn everyone as evil as himself. However, he mistook the actor Tom Baker for his hated nemesis and, while distracted, was defeated by the Eighth Doctor, his companion Izzy and many other television personalities. Beep left the realm of the comic strip in an audio play produced by Big Finish Productions, The Ratings War, which was on a promotional CD given away with DWM #313. In the play, Toby Longworth provided the voice for Beep, who went up against the Sixth Doctor, voiced by Colin Baker. There, Beep tried much the same ploy as he did in TV Action!, except this time he produced a children's programme called Beep and Friends to effect a conquest by guile rather than by force. He was once again defeated by the Doctor and handed back to the Wrarth. In a cameo appearance, an inebriated Beep tried to kill the Seventh Doctor at a party in the story \\"Party Animals\\" in DWM #173, but simply started a bar brawl instead. A hallucinatory Beep appeared in the Eighth Doctor strip \\"A Life of Matter and Death\\" (DWM #250). The Meeps (although not Beep himself) appeared in the spin- off short story \\"Wish Upon A Star Beast\\" by Steve Lyons, published in the charity anthology Perfect Timing. In March 2019, Big Finish released The Comic Strip Adaptations Volume 1 audio book, one of the stories being Doctor Who and the Star Beast. Beep is voiced by Bethan Dixon Bate. ==References== Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980 Category:Doctor Who aliens Category:Doctor Who audio characters Category:Doctor Who comic strip characters Category:Fictional dictators ","title":"Beep the Meep"},{"id":"1428931","text":"The Association for Industrial Archaeology (AIA) was established in 1973 to promote the study of industrial archaeology and to encourage improved standards of recording, research, conservation and publication. It aims to support individuals and groups involved in those objectives and to represent the interests of industrial archaeology at a national level. It is a non- profit making registered charity (No. 277511) and a company limited by guarantee, its registered office is care of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. == Leadership == The association is currently chaired by Mark Sissons, from September 2014, Keith Falconer OBE. The president is Professor Marilyn Palmer, MA (Oxon), Ph.D. Leicester, FSA, Professor Emeritus of Industrial Archaeology, University of Leicester (University of Leicester, January 2014). Overall administration is carried out by an elected Council of Management, whilst day- to-day operations are overseen by the officers of the association. == Activities == Through its council it has contacts with both traditional archaeology and with those statutory organisations responsible for recording, preserving and funding Britain's historic monuments. The council also has contacts with the International Committee for the Conservation Of Industrial Heritage (TICCIH) and, at the European level, the European Federation of Associations of Industrial and Technical Heritage (E-faith). Since its foundation the association has gathered at an annual conference held at various locations throughout the UK and Ireland. The 2013 conference was held in Dundee, Scotland with the 2014 conference planned for Chester, England in September. Brighton, England is the venue for 2015. Each conference occupies a weekend but is followed by several days of visits and lectures. Additionally, the association organizes a spring weekend conference open to both members and non-members. One important function of the association is to represent the interests of industrial archaeology in the planning process. The AIA is not a Statutory Consultee itself and the association's role in the process is carried out by its Endangered Sites Officer via the Council for British Archaeology (CBA). Thanks to a series of generous donations the AIA has been able over the last five years to make available Restoration Grants for a number of worthwhile projects. To date seventeen grants have been made, examples of which are: *Mellor Archaeological Trust for the restoration of the Wellington wheel pit; *The Waterways Trust for the restoration of Box Boat 337; *The South Yorkshire Trades Historical Trust for their work on Hoylandswaine Nail Forge. The grants are for up to ¬£20,000 and are only for capital projects and not on-going running costs. Applicants must be non-profit organisations, trusts, charities etc. and not businesses or individuals. Full details can be found on the association's web-site, see link below. The AIA also provides an opportunity for taking part in escorted overseas visits that explore engineering history and industrial archaeology. These visits are organized for the association by Heritage of Industry and details of current and pending visits are to be found on the association's web-site. == Publications == Industrial Archaeology Review, a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal, is sent to all members whilst a quarterly newsletter, the Industrial Archaeology News, contains shorter articles, reviews and a calendar of events. Additional occasional publications include regional gazetteers for areas where annual conferences take place. == Membership == The association has some 520 individual members and approximately 50 local societies and organisations affiliated to it.

It flourished from around 2500 BCE to 1500 BCE in ancient Nubia. The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of Nubia, or \\"Upper Nubia\\" (in parts of present-day northern and central Sudan), and later extended its reach northward into Lower Nubia and the border of Egypt. The polity seems to have been one of a number of Nile Valley states during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. In the Kingdom of Kerma's latest phase, lasting from about 1700‚Äì1500 BCE, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt. Around 1500 BCE, it was absorbed into the New Kingdom of Egypt, but rebellions continued for centuries. By the eleventh century BCE, the more-Egyptianized Kingdom of Kush emerged, possibly from Kerma, and regained the region's independence from Egypt. ==Site== Tumulus from Kerma c. 2450 BC, National Museum of Sudan The primary site of Kerma that forms the heart of the Kingdom of Kerma includes both an extensive town and a cemetery consisting of large tumuli. The level of affluence at the site demonstrated the power of the Kingdom of Kerma, especially during the Second Intermediate Period when the Kermans threatened the southern borders of Egypt.Hafsaas- Tsakos, H. (2010). Between Kush and Egypt: The C-Group People of Lower Nubia. pp. 393-394. ==Ecopolitical structure== Until recently, the Kerma civilisation was known only from the townsite and cemeteries of its metropolitan centre and smaller sites in Kerma, Sudan. However, recent survey and excavation work has identified many new sites south of Kerma, many located on channels of the Nile, now dry, which lay to the east of the modern course of the river. This pattern of settlement indicates a substantial population and for the first time provides us with some sort of context in which we can place Kerma itself. Survey work in advance of the Merowe Dam at the Fourth Cataract has confirmed the presence of Kerma sites at least as far upriver as the Abu Hamad/Mograt Island area. Kerma was evidently a sizable political entity - Egyptian records speak of its rich and populous agricultural regions. Unlike Egypt, Kerma seems to have been highly centralized. It controlled the 1st to 4th Cataracts, which meant its domain was as extensive as ancient Egypt. She states, \\"To date, Kerma-culture has been found from the region of the First Cataract to upstream of the Fourth Cataract.\\" Numerous village communities scattered alongside fields of crops made up the bulk of the realm, but there also seems to have been districts wherein pastoralism (goat, sheep and cattle) and gold processing were important industries. Certain Kerma towns served to centralize agricultural products and direct trade. Analysis of the skulls of thousands of cattle interred in royal Kerma tombs suggest that stock were sometimes brought vast distances, from far districts, presumably as a type of tribute from rural communities on the death of Kerma's monarchs. This parallels the importance of cattle as royal property in other parts of Africa at later times. Only the centres of Kerma and Sai Island seem to have had contained sizable urban populations. Possibly further excavations will reveal other regional centres. At Kerma and Sai, there is much evidence of wealthy elites, and a class of dignitaries who monitored trade in merchandise arriving from far-off lands, and who supervised shipments dispatched from administrative buildings. Evidently, Kerma played an important intermediary role in the trade of luxury items from the Central African interior to Egypt. ==History== Vessels from Sai island, Kerma culture. On display at the Mus√©e du Louvre. Daggers of bone and copper, 1750-1450 BCE, Kerma, British Museum EA55442 The last mention of an Old Kingdom of Egypt Pharaoh, Neuserre of the Fifth Dynasty, was in 2400 BC Buhen and the desert west of Toshka, and no Egyptian presence occurs by the subsequent Sixth Dynasty. By 2300 BC, the Early C-Group culture was appearing in Lower Nubia, most likely arriving from Dongola Reach (near Kerma). Thus, by the second millennium BC, Kerma was the center of a large kingdom, probably the first in Sub-Saharan Africa and rivalling Egypt. Egypt began the conquest of Lower Nubia with the start of the 2nd millennium BC. The Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt Pharaoh Senwosret I established forts at Ikkur, Quban, Aniba, Buhen, and Kor. The fort at Qubban protected gold mining operations along Wadi Allaqi and Wadi Gabgaba. The long history of Egyptian military activity in Lower Nubia may indicate that Kerma was perceived as a threat to Pharaonic Egypt at varying times. Principal Egyptian fortifications were built in the middle Nile Valley during the Middle Kingdom.De Mola, Paul J. \\"Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt\\". Ancient History Encyclopedia. http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/. These were to secure the Upper Egyptian border against raids from Kerma, and more than likely and to protect the valuable trade routes between the two regions. Both during the Middle and New Kingdoms, the resources Kerma possessed ‚Äì gold, cattle, milk products, ebony, incense, ivory, etc. ‚Äì were much coveted by Egypt. Its army were built around archers. Yet, Egyptian control weakened during the 13th Dynasty and 2nd Intermediate Period. This became the period of greatest development of Kerma and its greatest extent. Massive royal tombs were built in the city's necropolis, and included a large number of human sacrifices, and secondary burials. Two large tumuli include white quartzite cones. Kushite confrontations also occurred with Egypt in Lower Nubia. During its zenith, Kerma formed a partnership with the Hyksos and tried to crush Egypt. Discoveries in 2003 at the Governor of El Kab's Tomb (near Thebes) show that Kerma invaded deep into Egypt between 1575 and 1550 BCE. It is believed that this was one of Egypt's most humiliating defeats, which later pharaohs had erased from the official historic records. Many royal statues and monuments were looted from Egypt and removed to Kerma, apparently as a gesture of triumph by Kerma's ruler. Ancient Kerma bowl kept at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \\"Bowl with Running-Spiral Decoration\\" Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south,De Mola, Paul J. \\"Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt\\". Ancient History Encyclopedia: http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/ destroying Kerma. This eventually resulted in the Egyptian annexation of Nubia (Kerma/ Kush) c.1504 BC, and the establishment a southern frontier at Kurgus, south of the Fourth Cataract. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly 'Egyptianized' yet rebellions continued for 220 years (till c.1300 BC). During the New Kingdom, Kerma/Kush nevertheless became a key province of the Egyptian Empire - economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major Pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata, which included a large Amun temple. The New Kingdom of Egypt maintained control of Lower and Middle Nubia, with a Viceroy of Kush, or 'King's Son of Kush'. Egyptian settlements were established on Sai Island, Sedeinga, Soleb, Mirgissa, and Sesibi. Qubban continued to play a strategic role in Eastern Desert gold mining operations. The extent of cultural/political continuity between the Kingdom of Kerma and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BCE, around 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. Initially, the Kushite kings continued to use Kerma for royal burials and special ceremonies, suggesting some connection. Moreover, the layout of royal funerary compounds in both Kerma and Napata (the Kush capital) are similarly designed. Caches of statues of Kush's pharaohs have also been discovered at Kerma, suggesting that the Napatan rulers recognized a historic link between their capital and Kerma. ==Language== Mirror. End of Kerma Period, 1700-1550 BC. The linguistic affiliation of the Kerma culture is currently unknown, and membership to both the Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic language families has been proposed. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the Kerma peoples spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic branch. They propose that the Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. It is argued that this in turn suggests that the Kerma population ‚Äî which, along with the C-Group Culture, inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers ‚Äî spoke Afroasiatic languages. Claude Rilly (2010, 2016) on the other hand, suggests that the Kerma peoples spoke Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch, possibly ancestral to the later Meroitic language, which he also suggests was Nilo-Saharan. Rilly also criticizes proposals (by Behrens and Bechaus-Gerst) of significant early Afro-Asiatic influence on Nobiin, and considers evidence of substratal influence on Nobiin from an earlier now extinct Eastern Sudanic language to be stronger. Julien Cooper (2017) also suggests that Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch were spoken by the people of Kerma, as well as those further south along the Nile, to the west, and those of Sa√Ø (an island to the north of Kerma), but that Afro- Asiatic (most likely Cushitic) languages were spoken by other peoples in Lower Nubia (such as the Medjay and the C-Group culture) living in Nubian regions north of Sa√Ø toward Egypt and those southeast of the Nile in Punt in the Eastern dessert. Based partly on an analysis of the phonology of place names and personal names from the relevant regions preserved in ancient texts, he argues that the terms from \\"Kush\\" and \\"Irem\\" (ancient names for Kerma and the region south of it respectively) in Egyptian texts display traits typical of Eastern Sudanic languages, while those from further north (in Lower Nubia) and east are more typical of the Afro-Asiatic family, noting: \\"The Irem-list also provides a similar inventory to Kush, placing this firmly in an Eastern Sudanic zone. These Irem/Kush-lists are distinctive from the Wawat-, Medjay-, Punt-, and Wetenet-lists, which provide sounds typical to Afroasiatic languages.\\" ==Archaeology== ===20th century archaeology=== Excavations at Kerma. When Kerma was first excavated in the 1920s, George Andrew Reisner believed that it originally served as the base for or was a fort of an Egyptian governor, and that these Egyptian rulers evolved into the independent monarchs of Kerma. Reisner's interpretation was predicated on the presence of inscribed Egyptian statues in the large burials, which he thought belonged to those named individuals. In later decades, scholars moved to the view that Kerma was a trading outpost of the Egyptians, being too small and far away from the known borders of ancient Egypt to be more directly linked to it. However, in the past ten to fifteen years, excavations have revealed that Kerma city was much larger and more complex than previously assumed. It was also realized that the material culture and burial practices here are overwhelmingly of local Kerman origin rather than Egyptian. ===21st century archaeology=== Pottery, Kerma Museum, Kerma, Sudan In 2003, archaeologist Charles Bonnet heading a team of Swiss archaeologists excavating near Kerma discovered a cache of monumental black granite statues of the Pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt now exposed in the Kerma Museum. Among the sculptures were ones belonging to the dynasty's last two pharaohs, Taharqa and Tanoutamon, whose statues are described as \\"masterpieces that rank among the greatest in art history.\\" Craniometric analysis of Kerma fossils comparing them to various other early populations inhabiting the Nile Valley and Maghreb found that they were morphologically close to Predynastic Egyptians from Naqada (4000‚Äì3200 BC). The Kermans were also more distantly related to Dynastic Egyptians from Gizeh (323 BC‚Äì330 AD) and Predynastic Egyptian samples from Badari (4400‚Äì4000 BC), followed by the ancient Garamantes of Libya (900 BC-500 AD), who were found to be most closely related to Neolithic sub-Saharan African samples,Marta Miraz√≥n Lahr et al. (2010) \\"Human Skeletal Remains, Fazzan, Libya\\", The Society for Libyan Studies and early osteological series from Algeria (1500 BC), Carthage in Tunisia (751 BC‚Äì435 AD), Soleb in Nubia (1575‚Äì1380 BC), and Ptolemaic dynasty-era samples from Alexandria in Egypt (323 BC‚Äì330 AD). \\\\- cf. Table 6 Dental trait analysis of Kerma fossils found affinities with various populations inhabiting the Nile Valley, Horn of Africa, and Northeast Africa, especially to other ancient populations from the central and northern Sudan. Among the sampled populations, the Kerma people were overall nearest to the Kush populations in Upper Nubia, the A-Group culture bearers of Lower Nubia, and to Ethiopians, followed by the Meroitic, X-Group and Christian period inhabitants of Lower Nubia, and then to the C-Group and Pharaonic era skeletons excavated in Lower Nubia and ancient Egyptians (Naqada, Badari, Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Kharga in Upper Egypt; Hawara in Lower Egypt). Claude Rilly, citing anthropologist Christian Simon, reports that the population of the Kingdom of Kerma was morphologically heterogeneous, with three main clusters in terms of morphological tendencies (A, B, C): Cluster A is similar to a sample of modern Kenyan skeletons. Cluster C is similar to a sample of Middle Empire skeletons from the region of Assuan, and Cluster B, which although distinct from Cluster C, shares many common features with it. He notes that clusters A and B were present in Early Kerma in (\\"Kerma ancien\\") but became the majority in the following Middle Kerma (\\"Kerma moyen\\"), and that Cluster C was mainly present in early Kerma and \\"possibly represents the descendency of the Pre-Kerma population that founded Kerma 4 km away from the original settlement, when the Nile riverbed shrunk...\\" Rilly continues: \\"However, the fact that their cemetery remained on the ancestral site might indicate cultural and ethnical continuity between Pre-Kerma and the new city. Cluster A and B were already present in Kerma ancien, but become majoritary in the following stage.\\" ==See also== * List of monarchs of Kerma ==References== ==Further reading== *Reisner, G.

A Democrat, he served as the 48th Governor of Missouri from 1977 to 1981.Joseph P. Teasdale-National Governors Association ==Early life and education== Teasdale was born in Kansas City, Missouri to William and Adah (Downey) Teasdale. Teasdale's father was a prominent Kansas City attorney, His grandfather, William B. Teasdale, was also an attorney, prosecutor, and member of the Missouri State Senate and considered \\"One of the men who made Kansas City.\\" Joseph Teasdale and his three sisters were raised as devout Catholics. Teasdale was a multi-sport athlete while attending Rockhurst High School and would later be inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. Following graduation from high school he attended St. Benedict's College in Atchison, Kansas where he was a member of the school‚Äôs 1954 NAIA National Champion basketball team. Teasdale later earned an undergraduate degree from Rockhurst University, and a law degree from Saint Louis University School of Law. ==Professional life== From 1962 to 1966, Joe Teasdale served as Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, where among his other duties he led the organized crime division. It was also in the early 1960s that he enlisted in the United States Air Force Reserve, with his primary duty being at Whiteman Air Force Base where Airman 3rd Class Teasdale performed legal staff duties for the 442nd Military Airlift Wing. Teasdale was elected Prosecuting Attorney for Jackson County, Missouri in 1966, becoming the youngest person to ever hold that office. He ran his first statewide campaign in the 1972 election, seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Although he was defeated in the primary by Edward L. Dowd, his innovative campaign style earned him name recognition around Missouri and a nickname, \\"Walkin' Joe\\". The name came about due to his habit of walking door- to-door all across the Show-Me state greeting potential supporters. It is thought that Teasdale appropriated the tactic from Florida politician \\"Walkin' Lawton Chiles. Teasdale campaign officials estimated that he had walked over 1,000 miles in the months leading up to the primary. Even though he lost the primary to Ed Dowd it set the stage for Teasdale to make another, successful, run in 1976. The 1976 Missouri gubernatorial election provided one of the most surprising upsets in the state's history. Running on a platform of working for common Missourians and vowing to fight big utility company rate hikes, Teasdale painted first-term incumbent Kit Bond as being too friendly to big business interests. The tactic proved successful with many voters angered at Bond's approval of rate hikes, and in what many considered an upset Teasdale was elected governor by 13,000 votes. The victory prompted CBS News anchorman Dan Rather to quip on the air \\"..the story in the Midwest is not Jimmy Carter, it's Walkin' Joe Teasdale!\\" ===As governor=== True to his word on the campaign trail once in the governor‚Äôs office Teasdale fought against utility companies by appointing new members to the Missouri Public Service Commission, the state agency tasked with approving or denying rates. Among other accomplishments were establishing the state's first Division of Aging, boosting funding for the Department of Mental Health, and overseeing the rewriting of numerous health laws. Teasdale also advocated strongly for the Nursing Home Reform Act and removal of sales tax on prescription drugs. He proved willing to reach across party lines as well, supporting Republican Mel Hancock's amendment to limit state taxes. Teasdale also came out strongly against the Meramec Dam project which would have greatly affected rivers in areas southwest of St. Louis. He signed legislation reinstating the death penalty in Missouri in 1977, but later regretted the decision. In 1980 Teasdale made state history by becoming the first Missouri governor in 140 years to have a veto overridden by the state legislature. He angered many in his own party by opposing the cost of constructing the Harry S. Truman state office building in Jefferson City. That anger manifested itself again in 1980 as Teasdale faced a tough Democratic primary challenge from then-State Treasurer Jim Spainhower. He was successful in holding off Spainhower but lost a bitter rematch in the November 1980 general election with Kit Bond. After leaving the governorship in early 1981 Joe Teasdale returned to the Kansas City area and established a law practice. One of his most notable cases was representing victims and surviving family of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. An avid outdoorsman all his life, he often spent time on hunting and fishing trips. Teasdale largely avoided state politics after his defeat, telling one newspaper reporter in 1993 \\"I wanted to become a normal person again, and I really wasn't normal before. For 20 years I was completely consumed by politics.\\" In the late 1990s, his position on capital punishment having changed, he worked to achieve clemency for David Leisure, a man convicted of murder for a 1980 car bombing in St. Louis. ==Personal life== In 1973, Teasdale was wed to the former Theresa Ferkenhoff. The couple had three sons, Bill, John, and Kevin. His middle son, John, was a multisport standout at Rockhurst High School like his father before him, and later played offensive tackle at the University of Notre Dame. Teasdale died on May 8, 2014, in Kansas City, Missouri, of complications from pneumonia. ==Election History== ==References== - Category:1936 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Assistant United States Attorneys Category:Benedictine College alumni Category:Governors of Missouri Category:Missouri Democrats Category:Missouri lawyers Category:Politicians from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Rockhurst University alumni Category:Saint Louis University School of Law alumni Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Lawyers from Kansas City, Missouri Category:United States Air Force airmen Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Joseph P.

New York: Oxford University Press. Though macrosociology does concern itself with individuals, families, and other constituent aspects of a society, it does so in relation to larger social system of which such elements are a part. The approach is also able to analyze generalized collectivities (e.g. \\"the city\\", \\"the church\\").Scott, John, and Gordon Marshall, eds. 2000. Dictionary of Sociology. New York: Oxford University Press. In contrast, microsociology focuses on the individual social agency. Macrosociology, however, deals with broad societal trends that can later be applied to smaller features of society, or vice versa. To differentiate, macrosociology deals with issues such as war as a whole; distress of Third-World countries; poverty on a national/international level; and environmental deprivation, whereas microsociology analyses issues such as the individual features of war (e.g. camaraderie, one's pleasure in violence, etc.); the role of women in third-world countries; poverty's effect on \\"the family\\"; and how immigration impacts a country's environment. A \\"society\\" can be considered as a collective of human populations that are politically autonomous, in which members engage in a broad range of cooperative activities.Lenski, Gerhard. 1982. Human societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology. McGraw-Hill. . The people of Germany, for example, can be deemed \\"a society\\", whereas people with German heritage as a whole, including those who populate other countries, would not be considered a society, per se. ==Theoretical strategies== There are a number of theoretical strategies within contemporary macrosociology, though four approaches, in particular, have the most influence: *Idealist Strategy: Attempts to explain the basic features of social life by reference to the creative capacity of the human mind. \\"Idealists believe that human uniqueness lies in the fact that humans attach symbolic meanings to their actions.\\"Sanderson, Stephen K. 1988. Macrosociology: An Introduction to Human Societies. Harper & Row. *Materialist Strategy: Attempts to explain the basic features of human social life in terms of the practical, material conditions of their existence, including the nature of a physical environment; the level of technology; and the organization of an economic system. *Functionalist Strategy (or structural functionalism): Functionalism essentially states that societies are complex systems of interrelated and interdependent parts, and each part of a society significantly influences the others. Moreover, each part of society exists because it has a specific function to perform in contributing to the society as a whole. As such, societies tend toward a state of equilibrium or homeostasis, and if there is a disturbance in any part of the society then the other parts will adjust to restore the stability of the society as a whole. *Conflict Theoretical Strategy (or conflict theory): Rejects the idea that societies tend toward some basic consensus of harmony in which the features of society work for everyone's good. Rather, the basic structure of society is determined by individuals and groups acquiring scarce resources to satisfy their own needs and wants, thus creating endless conflicts. == Historical macrosociology == Historical macrosociology can be understood as an approach that uses historical knowledge to try and solve some of the problems seen in the field of macrosociology. As globalization has affected the world, it has also influenced historical macrosociology, leading to the development of two distinct branches: * Comparative and Historical Sociology (CHS): a branch of historical macrosociology that bases its analysis on states, searching for \\"generalizations about common properties and principles of variation among instances across time and space.\\"Arrighi, Giovanni. 2000. Globalization and Historical Macrosociology. Sociology for the Twenty-First Century. pp. 117‚Äì33. As of recently, it has been argued that globalization poses a threat to the CHS way of thinking because it often leads to the dissolution of distinct states. * Political Economy of the World-Systems (PEWS): a branch of historical macrosociology that bases its analysis on the systems of states, searching for \\"generalizations about interdependencies among a system's components and of principles of variation among systemic conditions across time and space.\\" Historical macrosociologists include: * Charles Tilly: developed theory of CHS, in which analysis is based on national states. * Immanuel Wallerstein: developed world systems theory, in which analysis is based on world capitalist systems. == Linking micro- and macro-sociology == Perhaps the most highly developed integrative effort to link micro- and macro- sociological phenomena is found in Anthony Giddens's theory of structuration, in which \\"social structure is defined as both constraining and enabling of human activity as well as both internal and external to the actor.\\"Borgatta, Edgar F. 1992. Encyclopedia of Sociology 3. Simon & Schuster Macmillan. Attempts to link micro and macro phenomena are evident in a growing body of empirical research. Such work appears to follow Giddens' view of the constraining and enabling nature of social structure for human activity and the need to link structure and action. \\"It appears safe to say that while macrosociology will always remain a central component of sociological theory and research, increasing effort will be devoted to creating workable models that link it with its microcounterpart.\\" ==See also== * Base and superstructure * Cliodynamics * General systems theory * Modernization theory * Sociocybernetics * Structure and agency * Systems philosophy == References == ==Further reading== *Tilly, Charles. 1995. \\"Macrosociology Past and Future.\\" In Newsletter of the Comparative & Historical Sociology 8(1&2):1,3‚Äì4.

Problematics of Sociology.. Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation,Goffman, Erving. 1972. Relations in Public. and shares close association with the philosophy of phenomenology. Methods include symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as micro-linguistical research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. Macrosociology, by contrast, concerns the social structure and broader systems. == Theory == Microsociology exists both as an umbrella term for perspectives which focus on agency, such as Max Weber's theory of social action, and as a body of distinct techniques, particularly in American sociology. The term was conceived by Georges Gurvitch in 1939, borrowing the term from the micro-physics and referring to the irreducible and unstable nature of everyday forms of sociality. It also provided an extra dimension between the studies of social psychology, sociology, and social anthropology‚Äîfocusing more on individual interaction and thinking within groups, rather than just large social group/societal behaviour. At the micro level, social status and social roles are the most important components of social structure. Microsociology forms an important perspective in many fields of study, including modern psychosocial studies, conversational analysis and human-computer interaction. Microsociology continues to have a profound influence on research in all human fields, often under other names. ==Competing frames of reference== Some have considered that face-to-face interaction can be studied in at least three distinct (if overlapping) ways: psychology; intersubjectivity; and microsociology. Erving Goffman however saw a central tension between Durkheimian approaches, and those drawn from ethology, especially in respect of interpersonal ritual; while followers of him have seen in a Durkheimian microsociology the key to the understanding of large-scale social conflict as well.Collins, Randall. 2004. Interaction Ritual Chains. Erving Goffman's theories of social interaction challenged other sociologists to redirect their focus to the questionable aspects of social behavior. Contrary to Erving Goffman's theory, √âmile Durkheim believed that advanced methodological principles should guide sociologists and that they should research social fact. ==Influences== Sartre, in his work on the phenomenology of social dynamics, Critique of Dialectical Reason, written in the late 1950s, called microsociology the only valid theory of human relations.Stack, George J. 1977. Satre's Philosophy of Social Existence. p. 56 J√ºrgen Habermas and Pierre Bourdieu are two more recent theorists who have put microsociological concepts to good use in their works.Calhoun, Craig, et al. 2012.

The Politics of Experience. p. 86. Another famous English writer/polymath who is greatly influenced by the ideas of studying the minutiae of human social action is Jonathan Miller.Michael B. Scher. Soliloquy or Psychosis? A Cultural Look at Schizophrenia. ==(Humanistic) social work== Key issues, categories and principles of the microsociology, such as human relations, face-to-face interaction, interpretive/qualitative analysis, attachment and empathy, micro-level analysis, human behavior, micro-community, everyday human life, human context, microculture, focus on agency, have influenced and still influences today the social work theory and practice, having a crucial role in the emergence of humanistic social work (Petru Stefaroi),Stefaroi, Petru. 2012. \\"Humanistic Paradigm of Social Work or Brief Introduction in Humanistic Social Work.\\" Social Work Review 10(1):161‚Äì74. as response to the structural and systemic social work, which theoretically originates from macrosociology or mesosociology.

The Bhotiya are also related to several dispersed groups in Nepal and the adjacent areas of India including the Tibetans and Sherpas. In Nepal, Bhotiya are 0.1 percent of the population. They live in villages throughout the Himilayas.Gellner D. et al (ed.) \\"Nationalism and Ethnicity in a Hindu Kingdom: The Politics and Culture of Contemporary Nepal.\\" Routledge, 2012 , 9781136649561. Accessed at Google Books 23 November 2015. ==Language of the Bhotiya people== The language of the Bhotiya people is Ladkahi (Bhoti) and Bhotia. It is usually written in the Tibetan alphabet. Bhoti and Bhotia is spoken in Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet, and parts of Pakistan and West Bengal. Bhoti is not included in the languages with official status in India. On 27 February 2011, however, a resolution introduced by the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh, for the inclusion of the language in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India passed without opposition. ==Population== Selected ethnic groups of Nepal:, , , , , , , , , The Bhotiya, tribe people are native (indigenous) people belonging to Himalayan Belt. In Nepal they live in the northern and eastern regions of Nepal, where they and other Tibetans are the region's autochthonous (indigenous) people. By the 2001 census of Nepal, they number 27,230.Includes Bhote (19,261) and Bote (7,969). The Bhotiya also live in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. In Uttar Pradesh, the Bhotiya live in the Bahraich, Gonda, Lakhimpur, Lucknow, Barabanki, Kanpur Nagar, Kanpur Dehat, and Kheri districts. Bhotiya have six recognisable sub-groups: the Bhot, Bhotiya, the Bhutia of Sikkim, the Tibbati (of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh), the Bhut, the Gyakar Khampa of Khimling, Bhidang of Uttarakhand. Bhotiya tribe are also natives of other countries outside India and they are in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. In Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, the Bhotiya people have Scheduled Tribe status. In Uttarakhand, the Bhotiya are a Scheduled Tribe under the \\"Schedule caste order 1950, the constitutional Scheduled tribe (Uttar Pradesh) 1967 SC/ST.\\" The Constitution of India recognizes the Bhotiya. ==Traditions== === Weddings === Bhotiya marriages are similar to Hindu weddings. When the bride's palanquin arrives at her husband's house, gods are worshipped and then she is admitted to the house. Rice, silver or gold is put in the hands of bridegroom, which he passes on to the bride. She places them in a winnowing fan, and hands them as a present to the wife of the barber. This ceremony is known as Karj Bharna. A man may have not more than three wives. The first wife is the head wife, and she inherits an additional one tenth of the husband's estate. === Funerals === The Bhotiyas have distinctive funerary traditions. Young children who die of cholera or snakebite are buried while others are cremated. There is no fixed burial ground, and no ceremonies are performed at the time of burial. The wealthy keep the ashes for lowal to several streams, while others bury them. After cremation, a stalk of kusha (grass) is fixed in the ground near a tank of water and sesamum is poured on it for ten days. This makes it a refuge for the deceased's spirit until the rites are completed. ==Religion== Bhotiya Tribe, the natives of the Himalayan belt are maximum Buddhist followers along with followers of other religion. Though most of Bhotiya practice a combination of Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism. (The word Bhotiya is derived from the word Bhot, the ancient name for \\"Tibet.) Ancestor worship is prevalent. ==Economy== In Uttarakhand, particularly Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Uttarkashi, the Bhotiya are nomadic, migratory pastoralists, moving about the border lands between India and Tibet.\\"The Social Economy of the Himalayans: Based on a Survey in the Kumaon Himalayas.\\" Mittal Publications 1988 p51 Accessed at Google Books 23 November 2015. They are also traders in the Himilayas for products such as, cereal, wool and salt. Now, some are farmers and others are merchants of stones, gems and herbs. The Bhotiya are experienced in the use of medicinal plants. The local fermented beverages are jan (a local beer), and daru. A local fermented food stuff is sez. The traditional catalyzing agent used in the preparation of fermented foods and beverages is called balam in the Kumaon Division and balma in Garhwal Division. A cottage wool industry employs many Bhotiya. Women weave pattu, a coarse woolen serge. Plants are collected to make natural dyes for colouring the wool. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Bhutan Category:Ethnic groups in India Category:Ethnic groups in Nepal Category:Buddhist communities of Bhutan Category:Buddhist communities of India Category:Buddhist communities of Nepal ","title":"Bhotiya"},{"id":"1429044","text":"The C-Group culture is an archaeological culture found in Lower Nubia, which dates from ca. 2400 BCE to ca. 1550 BCE. It was named by George A. Reisner. With no central site and no written evidence about what these people called themselves, Reisner assigned the culture a letter. The C-Group arose after Reisner's A-Group and B-Group cultures, and around the time the Old Kingdom was ending in Ancient Egypt. ==Overview== While today many scholars see A and B as actually being a continuation of the same group, C-Group is considered as the product of Saharan pastoralist distinct. The C-Group is marked by its distinctive pottery, and for its tombs. Early C-Group tombs consisted of a simple \\"stone circle\\" with the body buried in a depression in the centre. The tombs later became more elaborate with the bodies being placed in a stone lined chamber, and then the addition of an extra chamber on the east: for offerings. The origins of the C-Group are still debated. Some scholars see it largely being evolved from the A/B-Group. Others think it more likely that the C-Group was brought by invaders or migrants that mingled with the local culture, with the C-Group perhaps originating in the then rapidly drying Sahara. The C-Group were farmers and semi-nomadic herders keeping large numbers of cattle in an area that is today too arid for such herding. Originally they were believed to be a peaceful people due to the lack of weapons in tombs; however, daggers, short swords and battle-axes were found in C-Group graves. Their settling around the forts built by the ancient Egyptians was seen as further evidence. Pottery of the C-Group people, 2300-1600 BCE, Faras. Most of what is known about the C-Group peoples comes from Lower Nubia and the Dongola Reach. The northern border of the C-Group was around el- Kubanieh near Aswan. The southern border is still uncertain, but C-Group sites have been found as far south as Eritrea. During the Egyptian Sixth Dynasty, Lower Nubia is described of consisting of a number of small states, three of which are named: Setju, Wawat, and Irjet. At this same time in Upper Nubia the Kingdom of Kerma was emerging. The exact relation between the C-Group and Kerma are uncertain, but early Kerma shows definite similarities to the C-Group culture and the Pan-Grave culture. Under the Middle Kingdom much of the C-Group lands in Lower Nubia were conquered by Egypt; after the Egyptians left, Kerma expanded north controlling the region. Starting with the conquest of Nubia by Egypt under Tuthmosis I in the late 16th century BCE, the C-Group merged with the Egyptians. ==Language== According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the C-Group peoples spoke Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. Behrens championed a now criticized view that the C-Group people spoke a variety of Berber, but this thesis rests on somewhat sketchy and numerically insufficient lexical evidence. Recent evidence suggests that the C-Group peoples spoke an Afro- Asiatic language of the Cushitic branch (with peoples to the south in Upper Nubia possibly speaking Nilo-Saharan languages), and that the closest relative of the C-Group language is the Beja language spoken in the Red Sea coast. Research cannot point to Beja specifically as a descendant language, but rather it is proposed to search in Beja lexical material for the closest common ancestor and thence delineates a related Cushitic language existing in pre-Meroitic Lower Nubia. The disappearance of the C-Group language is somewhat of a mystery. It is possible that with successive phases of Egyptian, Kushite, and Meroitic suzerainty in Lower Nubia that this language became demographically and politically marginalized well before the arrival of Nile Nubian speakers.Cooper, Julien (2017) \\"Toponymic Strata in Ancient Nubia Until the Common Era,\\" Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies: Vol. 4 , Article 3.

Wolfe Island is an island at the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River in Lake Ontario near Kingston, Ontario. Wolfe Island is part of Frontenac County, Ontario and the Township of Frontenac Islands. It is the largest of the Thousand Islands. The largest community on the island is Marysville. The island was part of the traditional hunting lands of the Tyendinaga Mohawk people and the original name of the island is Ganounkouesnot (\\"Long Island Standing Up\\"). It was called Grand Island (Grande √Æle by the French). In a proclamation by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe on 16 July 1792, the island was renamed from Grand island to Wolfe island, after British General James Wolfe. The island is about long, with its width varying from around to a few hundred metres at some points; its area is about . The resident population is about 1400 people, but this can double or triple in summer. Wolfe Island has its own post office (K0H 2Y0) and telephone exchange (+1-613-385-). Wolfe Island can be reached by ferry from both Canada and the United States. The ferry from Kingston (Wolfe Islander III) is operated by the Ministry of Transportation and is free of charge. This ferry operates from two locations: the Summer Dock located in Marysville and the Winter Dock located at Dawson Point. This route includes an underwater air bubbler system that stretches to the Barrack Street Dock in Kingston, Ontario, whose purpose is to prevent ice buildup along the ferry's route in winter. This ferry service is currently being examined in an ongoing transportation study. The seasonal Horne's Ferry (May to October) toll ferryhttp://hornesferry.com to Cape Vincent, New York, first licensed in 1802, is still operated by the descendants of the first licence-holder and is one of the rare Canada-US international border crossings to be privately operated (the others are the Windsor-Detroit's Ambassador Bridge and Sombra‚ÄìMarine City (Bluewater) Ferry). A third ferry runs seasonally to join Wolfe Island to Simcoe Island. ==Flora and fauna== Snowy owls are frequently seen on the island during winter. It is also an important stopover location for migrating waterfowl including swans in spring and fall. Wolfe Island is also home to a growing population of wild turkeys, and well as deer and other fauna. It is designated an Important Bird Area. The Big Sandy Bay Management Area on Wolfe Island is a 404-hectare property, classified as a provincially significant life sciences Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. Sand dunes and wetlands allow rare plant species to flourish here. Rare trees and birds deemed to be significant either regionally or provincially are also found here. The environmental area is protected and no motorized vehicles are allowed, though there is ample free parking provided at the entrance. A well-marked and level walking trail leads to a large, secluded sand beach with shallows reaching out well into Lake Ontario. The beach is safe and family-friendly, but there are no services, so visitors are encouraged to bring their own refreshments and must carry out all garbage and recyclables to dispose of at home. ==Recreation and other facilities== 1878 map of Wolfe Island There is one golf course on Wolfe Island, a corn maze and three marked bicycle routes and country roads. The town of Marysville includes a bakery, restaurants and various other shops and services, as well as the largest church in the Thousand Islands (Sacred Heart of Mary Church). A new medical clinic opened in the spring of 2010. There is a volunteer fire and ambulance service on the island.Wolfe Island Business and Tourism Association.

The limestone Wolfe Island Town Hall is a National Historic Site of Canada. ==Development== Wolfe Island Wind Farm A scheme to ship goods from Cape Vincent, New York to Kingston in the mid 19th century by connecting Canadian and American railway systems required a canal to be dug across the island. The two channels to the north and south of Wolfe Island needed to be bridged. Since there was no direct railway link, boats were needed to ship the goods and so a system of steamships towing barges carrying railway cars was planned. Construction started in 1852. Although completed, the canal did not serve its intended purpose and stopped being used by 1892. Wolfe Island is the site of most Kingston radio transmitters; CKWS TV and radio, CKLC, CIKR and CFRC transmit from the island. It also had historically been the site of various cheese factories, including one once operated by Kraft Foods. A feature of Wolfe Island is the Wolfe Island Wind Project, a wind farm developed by Canadian Hydro Developers and now owned and operated by TransAlta. The 197.8 MW wind plant consists of 86 wind turbines,Wolfe Island Wind Project (197.8 MW) - Wolfe Island which have been in commercial operation since June 26, 2009.

Luke Bradnam also presents Beach and Fishing reports each Friday and Saturday evening. Regular fill-in presenters for the bulletins include news presenters Wendy Kingston, Samantha Heathwood, Alison Ariotti and Aislin Kriukelis. The bulletin is simulcast in Brisbane on commercial radio station River 94.9, across regional Queensland on Southern Cross Nine and throughout remote eastern and central Australia on Imparja Television. As of September 2017, weekend bulletins also air in Darwin.

He returned to presenting weeknight sport during the 2007/2008 summer period, and also files sports reports. Chris Bombolas was the weekend sports presenter who preceded Steve Haddan, before resigning to become a politician.

Mike London formerly presented alongside Heather Foord until he resigned in June 2003, following allegations that he had arrangements for a female fan to complain about weeknight presenter Bruce Paige, who was co-presenting with Jillian Whiting at the time. London had swapped roles with Paige in the mid 1990s following the latter's return to the Nine Network. Paige and Foord presented on weekdays between 2004 and 2008. In December 2008, Foord announced that she would step down from presenting weeknights to spend more time with her family. Weekend news presenter Melissa Downes replaced her with Eva Milic and Andrew Lofthouse replacing Downes as weekend news presenters. The Queensland bulletin was the last news program to date in Australia to use the dual-presenter format on weekends (when London was presenting with Foord), until the Perth bulletin revived it in early 2008. ===2011 \\"Choppergate\\" incident=== On the bulletins of Nine News Queensland aired on 20 and 21 August 2011, newsreader Eva Milic conducted two crosses, one on each night, to reporters Melissa Mallet and Cameron Price, respectively, in the station's helicopter which claimed to be \\"near Beerwah\\", where the remains of murdered schoolboy Daniel Morcombe had been found earlier that month. The crosses were revealed to be fake when, on the second night, rival station Channel Seven filmed footage of the Nine helicopter sitting on the helipad outside their studios at Mount Coot-tha at the time of the broadcast. Radar footage also revealed that, on the first night, the helicopter was actually hovering over Chapel Hill, 70 km away from Beerwah. Both Mallet and Price, as well as news producer Aaron Wakeley, were sacked by the Nine Network following the incident, while news director Lee Anderson resigned in protest over the faked crossings.

It was known as Nansemond County until 1972. From 1972 to 1974, a period of eighteen months, it was the independent city of Nansemond. It is now part of the independent city of Suffolk. English colonists named it for the Nansemond, a tribe of Native Americans who had long been living along the Nansemond River, a tributary of what the English later named as the James River. They encountered the English colonists after they began arriving in 1607 at Jamestown. Although disrupted by being forced off their land and through armed confrontation with colonists, the Nansemond Indian Nation continues to be based in Virginia and was granted state (1985) and federal recognition (2018). ==History== === 17th century === Under the Virginia Company of London, in 1619, the area which became Nansemond County was included in Elizabeth Cittie , one of four large \\"boroughs\\", or \\"incorporations\\". In 1624, the Virginia Company lost its proprietary charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. In 1634, the King of England directed the formation of eight shires (or counties) in the colony. One of these was Elizabeth River Shire, which included land area on both sides of Hampton Roads, as had the earlier Elizabeth Cittie. Two years later, New Norfolk County was formed in 1636 from Elizabeth River Shire. It included all the area in South Hampton Roads that is now incorporated in the five independent cities located there in modern times. The following year, in 1637, New Norfolk County was divided into Upper Norfolk County and Lower Norfolk County. Upper Norfolk County was officially redesignated the County of Nansimum by the House of Burgesses in March 1646; by the October session, this was also being spelled as Nansimund. The English named it for the indigenous Nansemond people whom they encountered in the area along the Nansemond River. Among the several Algonquian-speaking coastal peoples in the Tidewater, the Nansemond continue in the 21st century as a federally recognized tribe. === 18th century === In the 1720s, John Constant settled along the Nansemond River (in what is now Suffolk) and built a home, wharf, and warehouse. This site became known as \\"Constant's Warehouse.\\" Tobacco was the commodity crop in the Virginia colony and there was strong demand for it in England and Europe. Under the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, three of the 40 tobacco inspection warehouses were chartered in Nansemond County, under two inspectors, as follows: > At Waynwright's Landing, Isle of Wight; and Laurence's, in Nansemond County, > under one inspection. At the widow Constance's [sic], at Sleepy-Hole Point, > in Nansemond County, under one > inspection.https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27117/27117-8.txt In 1742, the Virginia House of Burgesses chartered a new town at Constant's Wharf and renamed it as Suffolk.http://hamptonroads.com/2012/01/whats-name- constants-wharf-suffolk In 1750, the county seat of Nansemond County was moved from Jarnigan's or Cohoon's Bridge to Suffolk. This new town was founded in 1742 at Constance's Warehouse at Sleepy Hole Point on the Nansemond River. It was named for the English hometown of Royal Governor William Gooch.VA Guide, XRoads, University of Virginia ===19th century=== Suffolk became an incorporated town in 1808 and an independent city in 1910. Even after Suffolk became politically independent of Nansemond County, the county seat and courts remained at Suffolk. ===20th century=== { align=\\"center\\" border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + Presidential Elections Results - bgcolor=lightgrey !

The county was merged into the city of Virginia Beach on January 1, 1963, ceasing to exist. == Historical Population == == Shires, Counties == When Admiral Christopher Newport and the colonists of the Virginia Company arrived in 1607, George Percy and his fellow Englishmen's \\"first landing\\" was at Cape Henry in what was to become Princess Anne County. They named the spot in honor of Henry Frederick Stuart, the elder of two surviving sons of King James I of England. A few days later, they travelled up the James River and established Jamestown. During the early 17th century, English settlers explored and began settling the areas adjacent to Hampton Roads. By 1610, the English colonists had established a permanent settlement in the Kecoughtan area of what was to become Elizabeth Cittie (sic) in 1619. Today a part of Hampton, it is the oldest known continuously occupied English settlement in North America. Adam Thoroughgood was an early leader in the area which became Princess Anne County, settling along the Lynnhaven River. In 1634, the King of England directed the formation of eight shires (or counties) in the colony of Virginia. One of these was Elizabeth City Shire, which included land area on both sides of Hampton Roads. New Norfolk County was formed in 1636 from Elizabeth City Shire. New Norfolk County included all the area in South Hampton Roads. Only a year later, New Norfolk was split roughly in half into Upper Norfolk County (most of which is now the present-day city of Suffolk) and Lower Norfolk County. In 1691, Lower Norfolk was split roughly in half. The western half became Norfolk County, while the eastern half became Princess Anne County. The latter was named for Anne Stuart prior to her accession to the throne in 1702. The County of Princess Anne, Virginia was governed by a Board of Supervisors. Each Supervisor represented one of six Magisterial Districts. ==Loyalist insurrection during the Revolutionary War== After the American colonies declared their independence in 1776, Loyalist opposition in various forms with different motives was present for the duration of the war. In Princess Anne and Norfolk Counties, organized criminals took advantage of the sudden power vacuum created in part by the ineffectiveness of the newly formed local authorities. A native of Princess Anne County named Josiah Philips, led one such group. They used intimidation, the county's rough, swampy terrain and disaffected local sympathizers to rob, kill and terrorize the area for several years.Steilen at 4-13 After Philips' capture and subsequent escape, a writ of attainder, perhaps drafted by Thomas Jefferson, was passed by the Virginia General Assembly naming Philips and his followers in an effort to end what it described as an \\"insurrection\\" in the counties. Philips was tried and executed in June 1778.Steilen at 13 == Virginia Beach Resort (late 19th century ‚Äì 1963)== Beginning in the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach along the Atlantic Ocean at the north eastern portion of the county's vast expanse of shoreline grew, particularly after 1888 with the arrival of rail service and electricity. It was incorporated as a town in 1906 and became an independent city on January 1, 1953, but Princess Anne (Courthouse) remained the county seat. However, in the mid 20th century, the western borders of Princess Anne County lost territory to annexation suits by Norfolk, Virginia which adjoined it after annexing all of the northern portion of Norfolk County. A merger with the tiny city of Virginia Beach became seen as a way to prevent the independent City of Norfolk from annexing more (or potentially all) of Princess Anne County. The original western border of Princess Anne County started in East Beach (present day Norfolk, Virginia) where 1st Bay Street meets the Chesapeake Bay. The county line traveled south down the inlet to Bi-County Road and continued between Moose Avenue and Buffalo Avenue, across East Little Creek Road, between the trailer park and Rugby Street to meet North Military Highway. Follow North Military Highway south to Azalea Garden Road and Miller Store Road intersect. Travel southeast on Miller Store Road, to the end of Pritchard Street and follow the river under Interstate 64, to Cornick Road. From here simply follow the Broad Creek south. == Consolidation with City of Virginia Beach (1963) == { align=\\"center\\" border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border- collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + Presidential Elections Resultshttp://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS - bgcolor=lightgrey !

The Belvedere name was first used for a new hardtop body style in the Plymouth Cranbrook line for the 1951 model year. In 1954 the Belvedere replaced the Cranbrook as the top trim and became a full model line with sedans, station wagons and convertible body styles. The Belvedere continued as Plymouth's full-sized car until 1965, when it became an intermediate, and was replaced after the 1970 model year by the Satellite, a name originally used for the top-trim level Belvederes. == Cranbrook Belvedere 1951‚Äì1953 == Introduced on March 31, the 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook Belvedere is a two-door pillarless hardtop. It was Plymouth's first such body design and was introduced in response to the 1950 Chevrolet Bel Air, and the Ford Victoria, the first two-door hardtop in the low-priced American market. The Cranbook Belvedere was the name for the two- door hardtop version of the Cranbrook and built on the same wheelbase. Powering the Belvedere is the Chrysler flathead straight-6 engine with a 7.00:1 compression ratio producing (SAE gross). For 1952, Plymouth kept the Cranbrook Belvedere largely unchanged. The biggest alteration was to the color scheme; to further distinguish the top-level Belvedere from other Plymouths, the two tones now flowed from the roof over the beltline onto the trunk, which has been referred to as the \\"saddleback\\" treatment. Two-tone color schemes were \\"sable bronze\\" over suede, black over \\"mint green\\", and gray over blue. Overdrive was made available as optional equipment in the 1952 Plymouth. In overdrive, the engine made three revolutions for each rear wheel revolution and four without overdrive. The engine was a complete carryover from 1951. Production for 1951 and 1952 totalled 51,266 units. The Belvedere remained a part of the Cranbrook series through the 1953 model year, which saw all Plymouth models completely restyled. Major style changes include a shorter wheelbase, a one-piece windshield, flush rear fenders, and a lower hood line. In April 1953, Plymouths received the Hy-Drive semi-automatic transmission. The engine was carried over from 1952 with the only enhancement being a slight increase in the compression ratio to 7.10:1, which yielded a rating of . A total of 35,185 1953 Belvederes were sold. == Belvedere full-size series == ===1954=== The Belvedere replaced the Cranbrook as the top-line offering for 1954. Now, a separate model instead of just a two-door hardtop, it was also available as a convertible, two-door station wagon, and four-door sedan. The two-door hardtop version was now called the \\"Sport Coupe\\". 1954 Belevederes featured full-length rocker sill moldings. Minor styling updates adorned the carry-over body design. For the first time, small chrome tailfins appeared on the rear fenders. In March 1954, Plymouth finally offered a fully automatic transmission, the Chrysler PowerFlite two-speed. Also new was a larger standard engine: a I6 that was also used by the Dodge Division. Power was now rated at . Belvedere production totaled 32,492 for the year.

This was the first year of Chrysler Stylist Virgil Exner's \\"Forward Look.\\" The Belvedere returned as top-of-the-line. For 1956, Plymouth styling evolved from that of the 1955s. Most notable would be the introduction of the first push-button automatic transmission to appear in an American automobile, and a more dramatic rear-end treatment highlighted by a pair of rakish tail-fins. In early 1956, the Fury joined the Belvedere line as a special-edition high-performance coupe. Belvedere remained the top full-line series through 1958. In 1956, Plymouth added seat belts. In 1956, Chrysler's chief engineer in a public relations campaign took a Belvedere and had a turbine engine fitted instead of the standard gasoline engine, and was driven across the US.\\"We Drove A Turbine Car Coast-To-Coast.\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1956, pp. 72-76/252.

Plymouth's design was so revolutionary that Chrysler used the slogan \\"Suddenly, it's 1960!\\" to promote the new car. Standard on all body styles except the convertible was the \\"Powerflow 6\\" L-head engine. The convertible was only V8 powered and V8s were available in other Belvederes with an optional \\"Fury\\" version as well as a \\"High-Performance PowerPAC\\" at extra cost. A manual transmission was standard with the push-button two-speed PowerFlite optional and the push-button three-speed TorqueFlite automatic also optional on V8 cars. The Belvedere would once again return as a top level trim for 1958 for the last time. Styling was a continuation from the 1957 models. A big block \\"B\\" engine of 350 in3 V8 with dual four-barrel carburetors dubbed \\"Golden Commando\\" was optional on all models. For 1959, the Fury became the top range with a full array of sedans and coupes, and the Belvedere became the middle range. The Savoy became the least expensive model, and the Plaza was discontinued. The convertible was only available in the Belvedere model between 1956 and 1958. The 1957-58 Belvedere two-door hardtop gained notoriety from the movie Christine (1983) based on the novel by Stephen King. In the opening scene, which the titles set as \\"Detroit, 1957\\", Christine appears near the end of the assembly line as a lone bright red car in a long line of Buckskin Beige Furys being built for the new model year (1958). (In the novel it is revealed that her first owner, Roland Lebay had ordered her with custom paint, as the standard 1958 Fury came only in beige.) For the movie Christine is painted \\"toreador red\\" with an \\"iceberg white\\" top.

Colloquially known as the Slant Six, it displaced , featured overhead valves, and a block that was inclined 30 degrees to the right to permit a lower hood line with maximum displacement. This engine used a single- barrel Holley carburetor, and became known for its extremely rugged construction, exceptional reliability and longevity. V-8 engines continued to be optionally available, in displacements of and . Unit body construction was introduced throughout the line, though it appeared on certain Plymouths in earlier years such as the 1953 hardtop coupe. This eliminated the frame, and was advertised as Unibody. Under Chrysler president William Newberg, Virgil Exner's styling team was encouraged to go \\"over the top\\" with distinctive styling, leading the 1960 models to be popularly dubbed the \\"jukebox on wheels\\" and the 1961 models to be widely considered among the ugliest cars ever mass-produced. Despite being remarkable cars in performance, handling, modest weight, and appealing interiors, sales suffered, and Plymouth yielded third place in sales to Rambler. The \\"Texas Whale,\\" is a 1960 Plymouth Belvedere station wagon ===1962‚Äì1964=== The 1962 model year full-size Plymouths were \\"downsized\\", with more compact outside dimensions. American car buyers at the time were in the thought mode of \\"bigger is better\\", and sales of these models suffered. However, the smaller Plymouth provided greater owner approval in their actual use. A Plymouth Belvedere with six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission was compared to the intermediate-size Ford Fairlane and the compact-size Chevrolet Chevy II in an economy test by Popular Mechanics and the road test concluded that the Belvedere was \\"a very pleasant transportation package.\\" Another advantage of the smaller and lighter body was in drag racing. The 1963 and 1964 models used the same unibody platform as the 1962s, but were restyled to look longer and wider. The 1964 Belvedere (and corresponding Fury hardtop coupes) featured a new \\"slant-back\\" roofline that proved to be popular, and sales improved significantly over the previous design. The 1964 Belvedere was also the car used to introduce the 426 Chrysler Hemi engine, which used a canted large-valve arrangement. This was such a significant high-RPM breathing improvement that Hemi-equipped Plymouth Belvederes won first, second, and third at NASCAR's 1964 Daytona race. One of the winning drivers was Richard Petty. 1963 Plymouth Belvedere (13867644073).jpg1963 Plymouth Belvedere 4-Door Sedan File:1964 Plymouth Belvedere (26283578931).jpg1964 Plymouth Belvedere 4-door sedan == Belvedere intermediate series == ===1965‚Äì1967=== In 1965 Plymouth once again made the Fury a full-size car, and Belvedere ostensibly became the intermediate size offering, though in fact the Belvedere was little changed, and most dimensions and weights remained the same‚Äîthe Fury was merely enlarged, restoring a full- sized line which Plymouth had been sorely lacking. The Belvedere line was divided into the Belvedere I, Belvedere II and Satellite subseries, the latter available only as hardtop coupe and convertible, and featuring the \\"LA block\\" V-8 as standard equipment. The line was restyled in 1966, and the high- performance GTX was added in 1967. The pilot episode for the television show Adam-12 featured a 1967 Belvedere as the standard LAPD police cruiser. File:Plymouth Belvedere Wagon 1965.jpg1965 Plymouth Belvedere II wagon File:1966 Plymouth Belvedere II (15452021665).jpg1966 Plymouth Belvedere 2-door hardtop ===1968‚Äì1970=== In 1968, the Belvedere - along with the rest of Chrysler's B-body offerings - was reskinned with \\"Coke bottle styling.\\" The Belvedere II was dropped, but the Sport Satellite was added to the overall lineup, using the same sheetmetal. The new LA-style lightweight 318 engine was introduced for this year and would remain available on the Belvedere through its life. The Plymouth Road Runner was introduced as a low-price, high- performance alternative to the GTX, and Richard Petty won the Grand National championship in NASCAR in a Belvedere. However the GTX came standard with the 440 CID engine and the Road Runner with the 383 Magnum, with the only engine options being the 440 six barrel or the 426 HEMI engines. The Belvedere name was dropped at the end of the 1970 model year, replaced by the Satellite name originally reserved for higher-end Belvederes. It lasted only through 1974, becoming the Fury in 1975 when the longer-wheelbase Fury model became the Gran Fury. ==Police== Belvederes were used in police service from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, when they were replaced by the Plymouth Gran Fury. They were prominent in both the LAPD and New York Police Department. ==Australian production== Chrysler Australia also produced the 4 door Hardtop in 1958 The Plymouth Belvedere was also produced by Chrysler Australia. The first model, based on the 1953 US Plymouth, featured a high level of Australian content, with body panels pressed in Chrysler Australia's Keswick facility in South Australia and matched with a 217.8 cubic inch (4107cc) side-valve six-cylinder engine, imported from Chrysler UK.David Brimble, Chryslers before the Chrysler Royal, Restored Cars, No 87 (July / August 1991), pages 14-15 It was produced as a four-door sedan and as a locally developed two-door coupe utility,Larry O'Toole, The Good Old Aussie Ute, page 192 along with similar Cranbrook and Savoy models, until it was replaced by the Chrysler Royal in 1957. The Belvedere was reintroduced to the Australian market in early 1958 when Chrysler Australia began assembling the current model Belvedere four-door hardtop which was imported from the US in knocked-down form.Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 74 The 1959 model was equipped with a 318 cubic inch V8 engine and push-button automatic transmission.News Review, Three Chryslers, Australian Motor Sports, August 1959 Chrysler Australia replaced their Plymouth Belvedere, Dodge Custom Royal and De Soto Firesweep models with the Dodge Phoenix in 1960.Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 77 ==Oklahoma centennial== During Oklahoma's 50th anniversary, a new 1957 Plymouth Belvedere was sealed in a concrete enclosure as a time capsule in downtown Tulsa on the grounds of the brand new county courthouse. It was unearthed June 14, 2007http://www.unburiedcar.com during the state's centennial celebrations, and was publicly unveiled on June 15. In line with the Cold War realities of late 1950s America, the concrete enclosure was advertised as having been built to withstand a nuclear attack.CNN: link broke. The concrete enclosure, however, was not airtight and allowed water to leak in, which caused significant damage to the vehicle. The controversial televised vehicle customizer Boyd Coddington was to have been the first to start the unburied car, had it been operable. The car was the prize of a 1957 contest to guess the population of Tulsa in the year 2007. The winning entrant, one Raymond Humbertson, guessed 384,743 versus the actual figure of 382,457. However, Humbertson died in 1979 and now only distant relatives remain. A second such car, this one a Plymouth Prowler, was encased in a vault in Tulsa's Centennial Park (formerly Central Park) 1998 to celebrate the city's centennial. After it was discovered what had become of the 1957 Belvedere, the Prowler was moved above ground, and a mound was formed over it. It is to be revealed after the same period of time as the Belvedere, in 2048. ==Notes== ==External links== * Allpar: Plymouth Satellite, Plymouth GTX, and Plymouth Belvedere * View the Unburied Plymouth Belvedere * Plymouth Belvedere in television and film * Plymouth sales brochures at www.oldcarbrochures.com Belvedere Category:Cars introduced in 1954 Category:1960s cars Category:1970s cars Category:Convertibles Category:Coup√©s Category:Full-size vehicles Category:Mid-size cars Category:Police vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons ","title":"Plymouth Belvedere"},{"id":"1429108","text":"The buccinator muscle is a muscle at the side of the face.

Schafer also served as the 29th United States Secretary of Agriculture from 2008 to 2009, appointed by President George W. Bush. From January to July 2016 he served as interim president of the University of North Dakota. ==Early life, education and family== Schafer was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota, and is the son of Marian Nelsen and businessman Harold Schafer. He is of German descent.Brooke, James. . The New York Times. March 2, 1996. Retrieved December 10, 2012. He has one sister, Pamela (Pam). Schafer attended the University of North Dakota, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1969. There he became a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. He earned an M.B.A. degree from the University of Denver in 1970. Schafer is married to the former Nancy Jones. They have two children: Thomas \\"Tom\\" Schafer and Ellie Schafer. Schafer has two stepchildren: Eric Jones and Kari (Jones) Hammer. His sister, Pam Schafer, was the first wife of former Democratic-NPL U.S. Senator Kent Conrad. ==Gold Seal Company== Schafer took a full-time job after graduation with his family's firm, the Gold Seal Company. Gold Seal was a North Dakota-based manufacturing company founded by his father, Harold Schafer, in 1942. Gold Seal was the distributor of \\"Mr. Bubble\\" bubble bath, \\"Glass Wax\\" glass cleaner and \\"Snowy Bleach\\". Ed Schafer rose through the ranks at Gold Seal, working in several divisions of the company until serving as company president from 1978 to 1985. At its height Gold Seal generated more than $50 million in annual revenues, making it one of North Dakota's largest privately held firms. ==Junkyard Wars engineering game show TV competition== Schafer has long had an interest in building machinery and equipment from used, scrap materials. He was selected as a contestant on the Discovery Channel's engineering game show Junkyard Wars. His team worked to build a machine from junked components. In 2003 Schafer competed during the show's fifth season, when he also served as the captain of the \\"High Flyers\\" team. His team took 2nd place in the competition, losing to the \\"Jet Doctors\\" in the season finale. ==Governor of North Dakota== Schafer was elected twice and served as the 30th governor of North Dakota, holding office from 1992 to 2000. He is a Republican and a self- styled conservative. In 1990 Schafer unsuccessfully challenged then-U.S. Congressman Byron Dorgan as Dorgan ran for reelection. Schafer captured 35% of the vote to Dorgan's 65%. He entered the 1992 North Dakota gubernatorial campaign as the Republican nominee. He and Republican lieutenant governor nominee Rosemarie Myrdal defeated the Democratic nominee for governor, former North Dakota Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth, and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Julie Hill. Schafer and Myrdal captured nearly 58% of the vote, to 41% for Spaeth and Hill. When Schafer became governor, North Dakota was facing major budgetary and financial hurdles. This continued, on and off, throughout his two terms. \\"As governor, Schafer had to deal with budget crunches during his eight years as state budget maker in the Capitol,\\" according to the Bismarck Tribune. While governor, Schafer oversaw annual state budgets that exceeded $4.5 billion and a state employee workforce of more than 12,000. Schafer prioritized the expansion and diversification of North Dakota's economy. For example, he worked with the private sector to expand the production and distribution of value-added agricultural products such as corn sweeteners and pasta. During his time in office, he helped to build a closer trading relationship with China in concert with other North Dakota government officials, federal government trade specialists and private sector business leaders. These efforts assisted in the development of China into a primary export market for North Dakota's products and services in the 1990s. As governor during the rise of the global internet and its introduction to broader society, Schafer realized the need for internet access across North Dakota. He worked with both government and business leaders, implementing various efforts \\"to upgrade North Dakota's communications infrastructure and make high-speed voice and data networks available to farmers, ranchers and rural businesses\\", and to individual households. In 1995 Schafer served as Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. When Schafer ran for reelection in 1996, he and Myrdal defeated Lee Kaldor, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, and Barbara Pyle, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. Schafer and Myrdal received about two-thirds of the vote. Schafer's long-held interest in conservation led him to help arrange the U.S. Forest Service's May 2007 purchase of the 5,200-acre Elkhorn Ranch in North Dakota. The Elkhorn Ranch was established by former United States president Theodore Roosevelt as his main working ranch in the North Dakota Badlands, and is now protected as a unit of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. In 1999-2000 Schafer served as chair of the Republican Governors Association. He did not seek reelection in 2000. ==Work life and political activities in the 2000s== Schafer was co- founder and CEO of Extend America, a start-up wireless communications company he founded after leaving office as governor. In 2002 Schafer was appointed as civilian aide to the United States Secretary of the Army. Schafer acted as a frequent guest host of the \\"Hot Talk\\" radio program on WDAY-AM in Fargo, North Dakota. Before his appointment as Secretary of Agriculture, Schafer served as an advisor and occasional spokesperson for the North Dakota chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group backed by the Koch Brothers. Ed Schafer became a supporter of the North Dakota Taxpayers' Association, serving as an advisor and a keynote speaker. ==U.S. Secretary of Agriculture== In October 2007 Schafer was nominated by then-President George W. Bush to be the next Secretary of Agriculture. Schafer had wide support in the Senate. His hearing was originally scheduled for January 30, 2008, but was moved up by request of North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad so that Schafer could attend the State of the Union address as a cabinet member.Jalonick, Mary Clare. Schafer hearing to be held . AP. January 12, 2008. Accessed 2008-01-25. \\"I was talking to Gov. Schafer, and he said it'd be nice if he could be confirmed earlier so he could go to the State of the Union address as a member of the president's cabinet,\\" Conrad said. \\"That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\\" That confirmation hearing was held on January 24,Pates, Mikkel. Schafer gets a warm reception in Washington. Grand Forks Herald. January 25, 2008. Accessed 2008-01-25. \\"Schafer, who served as North Dakota governor from 1992 to 2000, made it through a decidedly friendly Senate Agriculture Committee confirmation hearing Thursday on Capitol Hill.\\" with senators asking Schafer questions on various topics such as US beef exports to Japan and South Korea, the Department of Agriculture's ability to deliver on programs passed by Congress, policy on sugar, and cotton prices.Tonneson, Lon. Senate Ag Committee Quizzes Schafer . Dakota Farmer. January 25, 2008. Accessed 2008-01-25.\\" On January 28 he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Later that day, as Secretary of Agriculture, Schafer attended the State of the Union Address with other members of the President's cabinet. Schafer was in office for less than two days when a major scandal erupted concerning animal cruelty and unsafe food practices by Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company, the nation's second-largest supplier of ground beef to the National School Lunch Program, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture. This led to the largest recall of meat in the history of the United States. The issues of how best to handle the problems of unsafe food practices and animal cruelty by USDA-inspected meat processing plants became a major focus of Schafer's administration. The Humane Society of the United States received video showing multiple instances of workers abusing and torturing cattle who had fallen and were unable to walk into kill pens on their own, videographed in October and November 2007. The Humane Society and many meat animal experts, ethicists and nutritionists objected to the use of downer cattle, or non-ambulatory cattle for human food, because of health, food safety, and because the cruelty showed ethical lapses on Hallmark's part in overseeing its employees' behavior. The company recalled massive quantities of beef and voluntarily shut down the plant where the videos were taken. According to the Cattlemen's Beef Promotions Board, \\"The 143 million pound recall of beef from Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company triggered significant coverage and renewed skepticism about the safety of the nation's beef supply and the competency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\\" At issue for USDA, under Schafer, and the Senate was whether these sick, injured and/or aged non-ambulatory cattle were safe for humans to eat. In his February 28, 2008, testimony before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, Schafer said he \\"would not endorse an outright ban on 'downer' cows entering the food supply or back stiffer penalties for regulatory violations by meat-processing plants in the wake of the largest beef recall in the nation's history.\\" Specifically, \\"the penalties are strong and swift, as we have shown,\\" Schafer said. \\"Financially, I don't see how this company can survive. People need to be responsible and, from USDA's standpoint, they will be held responsible. . . . They broke the rules. That does not mean the rules are wrong. I believe the rules are adequate.\\" Under Schafer's leadership, the Agriculture Department promised to improve animal welfare and human food safety. On August 27, 2008, the USDA announced a proposed change in the rule regarding the treatment and handling of downer cattle. In a reversal of his February testimony to the Senate, Schafer said that \\"to maintain consumer confidence in the food supply, eliminate further misunderstanding of the rule and, ultimately, to make a positive impact on the humane handling of cattle, I believe it is sound policy to simplify this matter by initiating a complete ban on the slaughter of downer cattle.\\" As Schafer had predicted in his February 2008 testimony, Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company subsequently went out of business. Based in part on the initial work USDA personnel did during Schafer's tenure as Agriculture Secretary, the U.S. government sued Hallmark/Westland for farm animal cruelty (to downer cattle), misrepresentation and fraud, winning a massive final judgment of $497 million. This was the largest judgment ever entered for agriculture-related fraud and farm animal cruelty in federal court history. In this first-of-its-kind fraud case, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), at the USDA's behest, joined a lawsuit with the Humane Society against Hallmark. The lawsuit alleged that the Hallmark defrauded the federal government by misrepresenting its compliance with the terms of its federal school lunch program contracts requiring the humane handling of animals. Most of the $497 million judgment was not recovered by the DoJ because of Hallmark's bankruptcy and cessation of business. The amount was reduced to $155 million as part of the final settlement with the remaining defendants. Part of the judgment amount was paid personally by company executives and members of the Hallmark family in structured settlements. The DoJ and Agriculture Department intended these huge judgments and settlements in the government's favor to deter future animal cruelty and fraud by the nation's slaughterhouses. Schafer left the Secretary of Agriculture position at the end of the Bush administration in January 2009. == Interim president of the University of North Dakota == Schafer was appointed interim president of the University of North Dakota on November 9, 2016, by the Board of Higher Education. He said he had no intention to apply to become the next permanent president. Schafer signed a contract on December 2, 2015, to fill in for former University of North Dakota president Robert Kelley upon Kelley's retirement, which took place on January 14, 2016. This interim position Schafer accepted with \\"some hesitancy\\", he said. Schafer's appointment as interim president \\"did not sit well with a significant portion of the university faculty, according to the faculty representative on the Board of Higher Education.\\" This lack of support by that portion of the university faculty was in large part because Schafer did not have an earned doctorate or any administrative experience at a research university, according to Eric Murphy, the advisor to the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education. \\"The faculty voice is in opposition to\\" Schafer's selection, Murphy said. Schafer's working life was spent primarily in business and politics. Despite his lack of academic leadership experience, Schafer became the highest-paid administrator in the state's entire higher education system history to that time. He was paid $33,216 per month for his work from January 15 to June 30, 2016. Schafer's contract paid him $2,250 per month more than retiring President Kelley had been earning after more than seven years in that position. Among the tasks Schafer inherited was overseeing the final stages of the Fighting Sioux naming issue that erupted over objections by various tribes, ethnic groups, and First Nation peoples identifying as Sioux, as well as many other groups and thought leaders, because of the University's use of the Sioux name for its sports teams. On Schafer's first day as interim president, the University's Graphic Identity RFP Evaluation and Recommendation Team met to begin reviewing the 16 proposals from design firms for a new logo design for the Fighting Hawks. Five months later, near the end of his interim term, Schafer revealed the new logo at a news conference on June 22, 2016, calling the logo's debut a \\"historic moment\\". On March 15, 2016, the selection of Mark Kennedy as the 12th president of the University of North Dakota was announced. Kennedy's term began on July 1. ==Electoral history== *1996 Race for Governor **Ed Schafer (R) (inc.), 66% **Lee Kaldor (D), 34% *1992 Race for Governor **Ed Schafer (R), 58% **Nick Spaeth (D), 41% *1990 Race for U.S. House of Representatives - At Large **Byron Dorgan (D) (inc.), 65% **Ed Schafer (R), 35% ==References== ==External links== *USDA biography of Secretary Schafer * - - - - Category:1946 births Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American businesspeople Category:American Episcopalians Category:American people of German descent Category:Candidates in the 1990 United States elections Category:George W.

They were criminal codes that protected African- Americans‚Äô right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws. Passed under the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, the laws also allowed the federal government to intervene when states did not act to protect these rights. The acts passed following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which gave full citizenship to anyone born in the United States or freed slaves, and the Fifteenth Amendment, which banned racial discrimination in voting. At the time, the lives of all newly freed slaves, as well as their political and economic rights, were being threatened. This threat led to the creation of the Enforcement Acts. ==Goal== The main goal in creating these acts was to improve conditions for blacks and freed slaves. The main target was the Ku Klux Klan, a racist organization, which was targeting blacks, and, later, other groups. Although this act was meant to fight the KKK and help blacks, and freedmen, many states were reluctant to take such relatively extreme actions, for several reasons. Some politicians at the state and federal levels were either members of the Klan, or did not have enough strength to fight the Klan. Another goal of these acts was to achieve national unity, by creating a country where all races were considered equal under the law. ==Regulations of the Acts== The Enforcement Acts did many things to help freedmen, the main purpose under this act was the prohibited use of violence or any form of intimidation to prevent the freedmen from voting and denying them this right. There were many provisions placed under this act, many with serious consequences. The Enforcement Acts were created as part of the reconstruction era in the United States following the American civil war, and in order for full national unity, all citizens had to be accepted and viewed equally and violence must be prohibited. ===Enforcement Act of 1870=== The Enforcement Act of 1870 prohibited discrimination by state officials in voter registration on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It established penalties for interfering with a person's right to vote and gave federal courts the power to enforce the act. The act also authorized the President to employ the use of the army to uphold the act and the use of federal marshals to bring charges against offenders for election fraud, the bribery or intimidation of voters, and conspiracies to prevent citizens from exercising their constitutional rights. The act banned the use of terror, force or bribery to prevent people from voting because of their race.The Patriot Act: issues and controversies, Cary Stacy Smith, Li- Ching Hung, pg. 224 Other laws banned the KKK entirely. Hundreds of KKK members were arrested and tried as common criminals and terrorists. The first Klan was all but eradicated within a year of federal prosecution. ===Enforcement Act of 1871=== The Enforcement Act of 1871 (formally, \\"an Act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of this union\\"), permitted federal oversight of local and state elections if any two citizens in a town with more than twenty thousand inhabitants desired it. The Enforcement Act of 1871 (second act) and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 are very similar to the original act as they all have the same goal, but revised first act with the intention of being more effective. The Act of 1871 has more severe punishments with larger fines for disregarding the regulations, and the prison sentences vary in length. The final act, and the most effective, was also a revision. Although the fines lowered again, and the prison sentences remained approximately the same, this act was the best enforced by the government. ===Ku Klux Klan Act=== The Enforcement Act of 1871, the third Enforcement Act passed by Congress and also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act (formally, \\"An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes\\"), made state officials liable in federal court for depriving anyone of their civil rights or the equal protection of the laws. It further made a number of the KKK's intimidation tactics into federal offenses, authorized the president to call out the militia to suppress conspiracies against the operation of the federal government, and prohibited those suspected of complicity in such conspiracies to serve on juries related to the Klan's activities. The Act also authorized the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus if violence rendered efforts to suppress the Klan ineffective. It was passed at the request of Ulysses S. Grant. ==Response and effects== As a response to this act, Klansmen in South Carolina were put on trial, in front of juries mainly made up of blacks. Amos T. Akerman was largely involved with the prosecutions of these Klansmen. He worked to make America aware of Klan violence and how much of a problem it was becoming. His work led to trials and jail sentences of a few hundred members of the KKK. Many others who were put on trial either fled or were only given a warning. By 1872, the KKK as an organization was officially broken. Enforcement Acts were a series of acts, but it wasn't until the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, the third Enforcement Act, that their regulations to protect blacks, and to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were really enforced and followed. It was only after the creation of the third Enforcement Act that trials were conducted, and perpetrators were convicted for any crimes they had committed in violation of the Enforcement Acts. ===Judicial interpretations=== After the Colfax massacre in Louisiana, the federal government brought a civil rights case against nine men (out of 97 indicted) who were accused of paramilitary activity intended to stop Black people from voting. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the men because the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments provide only for redress against state actors. However, in Ex Parte Yarbrough (1884) the Court allowed individuals who were not state actors to be prosecuted because Article I Section 4 gives Congress the power to regulate federal elections. In Hodges v. United States (1906) the Court addressed a possible Thirteenth Amendment rationale for the Enforcement Acts, and found that the federal government did not have the authority to punish a group of men for interfering with Black workers through whitecapping. ===Later uses=== In 1964, the United States Department of Justice charged eighteen individuals under the Enforcement Act of 1870, with conspiring to deprive Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman of their civil rights by murder because Mississippi officials refused to prosecute their killers for murder, a state crime. ==See also== *Civil Rights Act of 1866 *Civil Rights Act of 1875 ==References== ==Further reading== * Kaczorowski, Robert J. \\"Federal Enforcement of Civil Rights During the First Reconstruction.\\" Fordham Urban Law Journal 23 (1995): 155+ online. * Kaczorowski, Robert J.

Getty Publishing, 2011, p 161. ==Early life and training== Moronobu was the son of a well-respected dyer and a gold and silver-thread brocade artisan in the village of Hodamura, Awa Province, near Edo Bay in present-day Kyonan, Chiba Prefecture. After moving to Edo, Moronobu, who had learned his father's craft, studied both Tosa and Kan≈ç-style painting. He thus had a solid grounding in both decorative crafts and academic painting, which served him well when he then turned to ukiyo-e, which he studied with his mentor, the Kanbun Master. ==Work== Panel from a series of 12, in abuna-e style Late 1670s‚Äìearly 1680s; Hishikawa Moronobu (1618-1694); Woodcut, sumi ink on paper His first known signed and dated works were book illustrations from 1672, although earlier works may yet surface. By the mid-1670s Moronobu had already become the most important ukiyo-e printmaker, a position he maintained until his death. He produced more than 100 illustrated books, perhaps as many as 150, though it is difficult to attribute to him many unsigned examples (for example, the scholar Kiyoshi Shibui established, in 1926, a basis for crediting some of the designs previously given to Moronobu as the work of Sugumura Jihei). Very few of Moronobu's single-sheet prints have survived, and most, if not all, are unsigned. Among these single sheets are erotic album prints. Moronobu was not the \\"founder\\" of ukiyo-e, as some early scholars surmised. Instead, he made an assimilation of inchoate ukiyo-e designs by previous artists, a consolidation of genre and early ukiyo-e painting and prints. It was Moronobu who created the first truly mature form of ukiyo-e, in a style of great strength and presence that would set the standards for generations of artists who followed. Moronobu's mastery of line has often been cited in assessments of his oeuvre, as well as the interactive arrangement of figures, which seem always to serve a dramatic function not usually seen in the work of his predecessors. Beauty looking back Some of Moronobu's prints are found with hand coloring, but this specimen is a sumizuri-e (:ja:Â¢®Êë∫Áµµ) (print with black pigment only) in its original, uncolored state. There is something almost elemental in Moronobu's line work and figure placements in black and white, which most often was diminished into more decorative effects when colors were applied by hand. The black and gray lines and solid areas contrast boldly with the white paper to produce a range of tonal values, with emphasis on the shape and movement of the lines and the \\"positive\\" values of the white spaces. As in many other designs by Moronobu, the artist was inventive in his use of curvilinear forms juxtaposed against straight diagonals. Groupings of 12 images had been common for centuries in court and genre paintings. Among the more famous surviving early specimens were the painted single sheets by the master Tosa Mitsunobu (1434‚Äì1525). Thus Moronobu's adoption of a grouping of 12 was conventional enough, particularly as such an arrangement afforded a context in which to alter the furnishings, clothing, and design patterns, matched more or less to the months of the year. However, it cannot be said that much shunga (erotic art) strictly adhered to seasonal progressions or 12-step narratives. Moronobu's print qualifies as an abuna-e (\\"risqu√© print\\"), a non-explicit erotic design of a type often found as the frontispiece to shunga sets or occasionally interspersed among the explicit sheets. Moronobu's formalism is evident here, with curves and straight lines balanced in near perfect proportion. As for the amorous couple, the seduction has just begun with the loosening of the obi (the woman's sash). Erotic signifiers enhance the scene. For example, the young beauty raises her right sleeve toward her mouth in a gesture of suppressed emotion. Water imagery evokes the woman's sexuality, with feminine or \\"yin\\" erotic symbols in the garden stream behind the lovers and in the waves on the robe of the young gallant, while the flowering ume on the standing screen serves as a metaphor for male or \\"yang\\" sexuality. Despite his popularity with ukiyo-e prints, his illustrations found in collaborations with other artists and in printed books are kicked off his career. In some cases Moronobu would take the images and subjects from other prints and illustrations made in Kyoto but would replace the images with his own illustrations to make it his own. A common subject Moronobu worked with was the depiction of women in their daily lives. He did this right up until the end of the 19th century, or in other words, the end of the Edo period. An example would be his contribution of illustrations for Hyankunin isshu z≈çsansh≈ç (One Hundred Poets with Portraits and Commentaries). This publication produced an argument on whether is was designed for women or not. Moronobu's illustrations can also be found in The Pictorial Survey, drafted by Ochikochi D≈çin. The images depicted include long military processions and travelers of all ages and stations. As he continued to do prints the subjects, scenes, colors, composition, and even his line work changed with adaptation of techniques and the audience that was interested in the current activities displayed. Courtesans parading with servants while holding umbrellas Moronobu's work is held in numerous museum collections around the world, and in the Library of Congress. ==Works== File:Hishikawa-Moronobu-woodblock-print-1680.jpgLobby of a brothel from Yoshiwara no tei series, ca. 1680.

The film features interviews with several small groups of young heavy metal fans gathered for a tailgate party in the parking lot outside the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland on May 31, 1986, as they prepare for a Judas Priest/Dokken concert being held there later that evening. ==Reputation== By the early 1990s, Heavy Metal Parking Lot had become an underground cult-classic, usually traded on bootleg VHS videotapes. It was reportedly a favorite on the Nirvana tour bus, among many other bands. Due to growing popularity of the film, music copyright issues arose between the producers and Judas Priest, though they were eventually resolved. The film has been referred to as the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of Wasted Teenage Metal. ==Sequels== Krulik and Heyn attempted to follow up Heavy Metal Parking Lot with Monster Truck Parking Lot in 1988, which showed fans of a monster truck rally, but the film was unfinished and unreleased. They then created Neil Diamond Parking Lot (1996) which showed fans before a Neil Diamond concert at the same Capital Centre parking lot, ten years after the original. In 1999, they created Harry Potter Parking Lot. Krulik and Heyn created and co-produced the 2004 TV series Parking Lot in association with Radical Media, which was broadcast on Trio. The series showed enthusiasts of various bands (like Phish) and activities (like surfing). Eight episodes were produced. In 2006, a sequel of sorts was released by SnagFilms, entitled Heavy Metal Parking Lot Alumni: Where Are They Now. The 19-minute film looks at the adult lives of several of the young people featured in the original 1986 film. ==2006 DVD release== In May 2006, the documentary was released on DVD, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of its filming. The DVD version contains the original 17-minute film, as well as 2 hours of bonus features that were left out of the original version and finally an interview with the infamous \\"Zebra-man\\" (a 22-year-old at the time), whom Krulik and Heyn tracked down and interviewed in the summer of 1999, 13 years after the original filming. ==Cultural references== * The music video for the 2000 song \\"Flavor of the Weak\\" by American Hi-Fi is a conscious homage to Heavy Metal Parking Lot, featuring the band members and others dressed as specific people from the documentary, and spouting variations on some of the same dialogue. * The music video for the 2005 song \\"Just Want You to Know\\" by the Backstreet Boys also references Heavy Metal Parking Lot. * The 2019 Steel Panther album Heavy Metal Rules is named after the \\"philosophy\\" of the \\"Zebra-man\\" ==See also== * The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years ==References* *DVD release *filmmaker Jeff Krulik's website *Review by Lucas Stensland *Q&A;: Heavy Metal Parking Lot 20th Anniversary by Metroblogging DC *Q&A; with director Jeff Krulik *Heavy Metal Parking Lot novelty trading cards Category:1986 films Category:American short films Category:Documentary films about heavy metal music and musicians Category:Judas Priest Category:Prince George's County, Maryland Category:Films shot in Maryland Category:Films set in Maryland Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:1986 documentary films Category:Films set in 1986 Category:Documentary films about Maryland ","title":"Heavy Metal Parking Lot"},{"id":"1429141","text":"Andrew (Andy) Miller (born 13 September 1972) is a former professional rugby player from New Zealand who played fly half and represented the Japan national rugby union team.

He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. A 7-foot-4 phenom, three-time College Player of the Year, and first selection in the 1983 NBA draft, Sampson brought heavy expectations with him to the National Basketball Association (NBA). The NBA Rookie of the Year, Sampson averaged 20.7 points and 10.9 rebounds for his first three seasons with the Houston Rockets before injuries began to take their toll. Three knee surgeries later he retired as a four-time All-Star, an NBA Rookie of the Year, and an NBA All-Star Game MVP (). One of his many career highlights was a buzzer- beating shot to dethrone the Los Angeles Lakers as Western Conference champions in 1986, derailing their hopes for coveted back-to-back NBA titles, and sending the Rockets to their second NBA Finals in the team's history. ==Early life== Sampson was already tall by ninth grade, reaching in high school in Harrisonburg, Virginia. He averaged nearly 30 points, 19 rebounds, and 7 blocked shots as a senior (after averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds as a sophomore, and 19 points and 17 rebounds as a junior), at Harrisonburg High, leading the team to state AA basketball championships in 1978 and 1979. His senior year he lost the high school player of the year award to another talented center, Sam Bowie. However, he did get a form of revenge against Bowie, outplaying him in the Capital Classic, getting 23 points and 21 rebounds with 4 blocks in a game styled \\"Battle of the Giants\\". ==College== Sampson was arguably the most heavily recruited college basketball prospect of his generation and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated six times in a span of fewer than four years (December 17, 1979; December 1, 1980; March 30, 1981; November 29, 1982; December 20, 1982; and October 31, 1983). Playing center for the University of Virginia, he led the Cavaliers to an NIT title in 1980, an NCAA Final Four appearance in 1981, and an NCAA Elite Eight appearance in 1983. He earned three Naismith Awards as the National Player of the Year, only the second athlete to do so (Bill Walton was the first), and a pair of Wooden Awards. Sampson considered leaving Virginia after his junior year and declaring for the 1982 NBA draft. The San Diego Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers would flip a coin to determine who would draft first overall, but the deadline for Sampson to make himself available came before the scheduled coin flip. Rather than risk playing for the Clippers (who ended up losing the toss), Sampson stayed in school. ==NBA career== ===Houston Rockets=== With his size and agility Sampson was expected to score like Wilt Chamberlain and win championships like Bill Russell when he reached the National Basketball Association. The Houston Rockets picked him first overall in the 1983 NBA draft. As a rookie, he averaged 21.0 points and 11.1 rebounds, played in the All-Star Game, and won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. The Rockets managed only a 29‚Äì53 record in 1983‚Äì84, which qualified them to pick first in the 1984 NBA draft. Houston selected fellow center Hakeem Olajuwon out of the University of Houston. Many observers criticized the Rockets' choice, believing the two 7-footers (known as the Twin Towers) would not be effective playing together, while others thought the combination could be overpowering. Sampson, playing a new style of power forward, had new expectations placed upon him. At the time, Dallas Mavericks Coach Dick Motta said, \\"That front line, when history is written when they've grown up, might be the best-assembled on one team. Ever.\\" Houston guard John Lucas said of Sampson's move to forward, \\"He'll revolutionize the game.\\" In 1984‚Äì85 the Rockets improved by 19 games to 48‚Äì34 and made the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. Sampson had his best individual campaign, averaging 22.1 points and 10.4 rebounds and earning a berth on the All-NBA Second Team. He and Olajuwon both played in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game, and Sampson, after scoring 24 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, earned the game's MVP Award. On March 5, 1985, in a loss against the Denver Nuggets, Sampson recorded 30 points, 15 rebounds, 8 assists, and 5 steals and was the first player in NBA history to record at least 30 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists and 5 steals since the league started recording steals.https://www.basketball- reference.com/play- index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match;=game&is;_playoffs=N&age;_min=0&age;_max=99&pos;_is_g=Y&pos;_is_gf=Y&pos;_is_f=Y&pos;_is_fg=Y&pos;_is_fc=Y&pos;_is_c=Y&pos;_is_cf=Y&c1stat;=pts&c1comp;=gt&c1val;=30&c2stat;=trb&c2comp;=gt&c2val;=15&c3stat;=ast&c3comp;=gt&c3val;=5&c4stat;=stl&c4comp;=gt&c4val;=5‚Ñ¥_by=pts The next season Houston won the Midwest Division with a 51‚Äì31 record. In the playoffs, the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings, but faced a stiffer challenge against Alex English and the Denver Nuggets in the Conference Semi- Finals, eventually winning the series 4‚Äì2, with the sixth and deciding game going to double overtime. Against the defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals, the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the season. The Rockets lost game 1, but the Rockets fought back, winning four straight to take the series four games to one. In- Game 5 of that series, Sampson provided one of the most memorable moments in NBA Playoff history. With the score tied at 112, Olajuwon having earlier been ejected, and with only one second remaining on the clock, Sampson took an inbounds pass and launched a twisting turnaround jumper that sailed through the hoop at the buzzer, giving the Rockets a 114-112 victory and a shocking series upset. In the NBA Finals the Rockets faced the Boston Celtics. Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, but the matchup was interesting with the young frontcourt challenging the old guard of the Celtics. During the season at the Boston Garden, the Rockets were playing the Celtics well until Sampson suffered a jarring fall on his back. At the start of the Finals, Sampson quickly found himself in foul trouble early in Game 1 as Boston easily went up 2-0 going back to Houston. The Rockets won a close Game 3 under the leadership of Sampson. Game 4 also went down to the wire with the Celtics pulling it out on late Larry Bird 3-pointer heroics and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitch Wiggins. In a similarly close Game 5 in Houston, (under the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 format) Sampson succumbed to taunting by Boston's much smaller 6-foot-1 backup guard Jerry Sichting resulting in Sampson taking a swing and earning an ejection from the game. Strangely, this fired up the Rockets, who won Game 5 by 15 points without Ralph thanks to the inspired play of Olajuwon, Jim Petersen, and Robert \\"Bobby Jo\\" Reid. Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtic frontcourt of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. After the series, Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets, \\"the new monsters on the block\\" with the future looking very bright for the Rockets. During the six-game championship series loss against the Celtics, Sampson averaged 14.8 points on .438 shooting, 9.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. ===Later stops=== Injured halfway into the 1987‚Äì88 season, Sampson fell out of favor with Rockets Coach Bill Fitch and was traded, along with guard Steve Harris, to the Golden State Warriors for Eric \\"Sleepy\\" Floyd and Joe Barry Carroll. Sampson's knee and back troubles worsened, and he never played a full season in the remaining years of his NBA career. He averaged 6.4 points and 5.0 rebounds with Golden State in 1988‚Äì89 and was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Jim Petersen. Sampson's injury issues continued in Sacramento as he totaled just 51 games in two seasons, averaging 4.2 and 3.0 points, respectively, in 1989‚Äì90 and 1990‚Äì91. Released by the Kings, Sampson played a 10-game stint with the Washington Bullets in 1991‚Äì92 before being waived. He played 441 games in 10 NBA seasons, slightly more than half the 820 scheduled. ==Post-NBA life== Sampson played eight games for Unicaja Ronda of the Spanish League during the 1991‚Äì92 season. He also would play for the Rockford Lightning in the Continental Basketball Association during the 1994‚Äì95 season before ultimately retiring for good. Returning to the States, he spent the 1992‚Äì93 season as an assistant to head coach Lefty Driesell at James Madison University before coaching a minor league professional team in Richmond, Virginia. Reflecting on his career and its three knee surgeries, Sampson admitted that he had attempted to come back too quickly from them, and said that he tried not to think about what could have been. In 1996, Sampson was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In 2002, he was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team as one of the 50 best players in Atlantic Coast Conference history ‚Äì one of only three Virginia Cavaliers so honored. In 2005, Sampson pleaded guilty to owing more than $300K in back child support for two children from different mothers in the Northern Virginia area. In 2006, he was sentenced to two months in prison for mail fraud associated with the purchase of an SUV.\\"Ralph Sampson jailed for mail fraud \\". NBC Sports. Retrieved on July 22, 2012.

Among the duties of the Presiding Patriarch are to preside in council meetings, ordain other patriarchs, and administer patriarchal blessings. Originally, the office of Presiding Patriarch was one of the highest and most important offices of the church's priesthood. The role was equated by Joseph Smith with Biblical patriarchs from Adam to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it was expected that the office would descend through lineal succession from father to son. This precedent was set when Hyrum Smith, Joseph's brother, became the second Presiding Patriarch because he was the eldest surviving son of the first Presiding Patriarch, Joseph Smith, Sr. When the office was given to Hyrum, he was given \\"keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth, even the Church of the Latter Day Saints.\\" Thus, some have argued that Presiding Patriarch is an office of the Patriarchal Priesthood. However, the existence and meaning of the Patriarchal Priesthood is controversial and uncertain. ==Community of Christ== In the major denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, the role of the Presiding Patriarch diminished substantially after the death of Hyrum Smith. Today, Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), ordains a Presiding Evangelist who plays an important role as a world church leader, but it is not required that the person be a descendant of Joseph Smith's family. That tradition was discontinued in 1958 when RLDS Prophet-Presidents W. Wallace Smith, a grandson of Joseph Smith, presented Roy Cheville as a successor to Elbert A. Smith. Unlike Elbert A. Smith, Cheville was not a descendant of Joseph Smith, Sr. Prior to 1984 Presiding Patriarch and Presiding Evangelist were used interchangeably for the one presiding over the Order of Evangelists. In 1984, the Community of Christ dropped its use of the name Presiding Evangelist for this role, along with the change of name of the local office from Evangelist- Patriarch to simply Evangelist. The current Presiding Evangelist of Community of Christ is Jane M. Gardner. ===Role within Community of Christ=== Within the international leadership Councils, Quorums, and Orders of the Community of Christ, the Presiding Evangelist serves as a spiritual companion, counselor and guide to the church and its leaders, and to the Order of Evangelists in fulfilling the significant ministry they provide, especially what the church considers \\"a time of transformation and change.‚Äù According to the church, Evangelists are ordained to be ministers of blessing, witnessing of Jesus Christ and responsive to the reconciling and redeeming influence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of persons, serving in multiple ministries according to the unique gifts and callings of each evangelist. ====Chronology of the Presiding Patriarchs/Evangelist of Community of Christ==== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - bgcolor=#DCDCFF ! style=\\"width:72px\\"  ! style=\\"width:275px\\"  Date ! style=\\"width:150px\\"  Presiding Patriarchs/Evangelist ! style=\\"width:550px\\"  Notes -  70px  18 December 1833 ‚Äì 14 September 1840  Joseph Smith Sr.  Father of Joseph Smith -  70px  14 September 1840 - 27 June 1844  Hyrum Smith  Oldest surviving son of Joseph Smith Sr. -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  70px  24 May 1845 ‚Äì 19 October 1845  rowspan=\\"2\\"  William Smith  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Oldest surviving son of Joseph Smith Sr. William Smith was patriarch to the church until his name and positions were read at the 19 October 1845 general conference.

In the church's history, there have been eight Presiding Patriarchs, three Acting Presiding Patriarchs, and one Patriarch Emeritus. The LDS Church effectively discontinued the office of Presiding Patriarch in 1979, indicating enough local patriarchs existed so that the church-wide position was no longer needed. However, E. Gary Smith, the eldest son of the final patriarch, Eldred G. Smith, rejected this explanation, suggesting instead that the dissolution of the office was the inevitable result of longstanding tensions rising from the incompatibility of a hereditary position with the broader church hierarchy based in \\"office charisma,\\" consistent with the Weberian model of bureaucracy. Until that time, the role and duties of the office had varied. The Presiding Patriarch sometimes appointed local patriarchs in the church's stakes and presided over them as a loose \\"Quorum of Patriarchs.\\" Like the local patriarchs, the Presiding Patriarch was also empowered to give patriarchal blessings. === Chronology of the Presiding Patriarchs of the LDS Church === { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - bgcolor=#DCDCFF ! !

(Mari, 25th century BC) ===Ancient History=== From the discoveries of Dura-Europos to the southeast of Deir Ezzor. Archaeological findings in Deir Ezzor indicate that the area has been inhabited since the ninth millennium BC, however, the current location of the city has not seen a strong and significant city in the past, It was always an urban central subordinate to the neighboring regions and kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Mari, which rose in the third millennium BC. During the third millennium BC, the Amorites settled the area and established the kingdom of Yamhad, one of whose urban centers was the city of Deir ez-Zor alongside Mayadeen, Qars, and Tarka and its capital is Aleppo. The city had not seen significant incidents with the succession of major empires such as Akkadian or Assyrian over the region, However, some military campaigns by the emperors were destroying entire urban centers for fear of its future rebellion, but, Deir al-Zour at that time, was too small to have the ability to rebel. In the third century BC Alexander the Great crossed the region and built the city of Dura-Europos, which was followed by Deir ez-Zor. and although influenced by Greek culture, the Aramaic language remained prevalent in the city. When Syria entered Roman rule in 64 BC, Deir ez-Zor was a small, marginal village known as \\"Azdra\\" follow to Circesium, which the Romans made it the center of the region, and they founded in it a strong military garrison. Deir Ezzor also followed the reign of Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in the third century within an autonomous federation of the Roman Empire. === Islamic Invasion === A map showing the march of Khalid ibn al-Walid's army from Iraq to the Levant. al- Jazira region (Upper Mesopotamia) in the 8th century. Iyad played a leading role in the Muslim conquest of the region. After the end of the wars of apostasy and stability in the Arabian Peninsula, Abu Bakr sent four armies to open to the Levant, and the leaders of the armies were Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Amr ibn al-Aas, Shurahbil ibn Hasana. And because of the difficulties that was faced by these armies due to the strength of the armies of the Byzantine Empire and its huge numbers, Abu Bakr ordered Khalid ibn al-Walid to march with a half of the Iraqi army towards fronts of the Levant and command the armies there. Khaled set off with his army towards Sham and opened Bosra and then defeated the Romans at the Battle of Ajnadayn and after Umar ibn Al-Khattab took over the Islamic caliphate in 13 AH (22 August 634 AD) Isolated Khalid ibn al-Walid from the leadership of the Levant armies and replaced him with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and ordered him to complete the conquest, and then Damascus opened and after that Baalbek then Homs, Hama and Latakia. After the successive defeats of Byzantine forces,The Byzantine Emperor Heraclius requested the help of the Arab Christians in Mesopotamia who had mobilized a large army and headed towards Homs where the base of Abu Ubaidah in northern Syria, and Heraclius sent to them a soldiers across the sea from Alexandria, Omar ibn al-Khattab wrote to Saad ibn Abi Waqqas to support Abu Ubaidah of muslims from the people of Iraq, So he sent armies with the commanders, including Iyad ibn Ghanm, When the Romans who were besieging Homs heard about the muslims army that was coming from Iraq, withdrew from Homs and returned to their country, Saad wrote to Iyad to invade The Euphrates Island and he conquered in 17 AH and during his march conquered Deir Ezzor, where its people were on that day on the religion of Christianity and Judaism, There was a Christian monastery in the city called Monastery of the Hermits, later built in its place Omari Mosque, Since then, Muslims had come to the city of Deir ez-Zor from Iraq and other countries because of its good location, which combines the purity of air and the abundance of water, and christians had started increasingly disperse, and some of them had converted to Islam. During the Abbasid era, The city has seen great urbanization and agricultural prosperity as a result of security and irrigation development and because of the commercial Euphrates road that was going through it. The small town called \\"Deir Al-Rumman\\" did not record any significant events during the decline of the Abbasid state and The Mamluk period except for the volatility of the semi-independent states on its rule, that appeared in the Abbasid state, and later its destruction by the Mongols in the thirteenth century. ===Ottoman Era=== The extent of the Ottoman Empire in 1566, upon the death of Suleiman the Magnificent. ====First Ottoman Era (1517‚Äì1864)==== Ibrahim Pasha, the ruler of Syria (1831-1840). The first Ottoman era extends from the date the Ottomans entered Syria in 1517 until 1864, where the Ottomans found Deir ez-Zor a small town on the upper Euphrates and chose it as a center for their employees and settled in some of tribal sheikhs to protect the trade route between Aleppo and Baghdad and The tribesmen began to visit it to communicate the men of power and buy their needs. Some Arab and European travelers visited it and describe its construction, economy and the nature of its inhabitants. According to the description: \\"Its houses are adjacent over an artificial hill and its inhabitants are strong, polite and they welcome guests. Their crops were wheat, barley, cotton and corn, along with orchards full of fruit species, including palm trees, lemons and oranges, the chess game is common among elders\\". Deir ez-Zor has repeatedly been subjected to Bedouin attacks for looting and has been greatly affected by these attacks, including the attacks of Wahhabis in 1807, It was repeatedly plundered and destroyed by the Bedouin, because the Ottoman Empire had not subdued them as it was preoccupied with its wars and the corruption of its sultans and officials. The people of the city armed themselves with guns and organized a national army to defend the city resulting in decline the Bedouin attacks, but its negative effects were the shrinking of the city, But the isolation benefited the people of the city, because they relied on themselves to make many of their needs and those of neighboring villages such as axes, spears, swords, gunpowder and weaving the cotton. When security was relatively stable, the commercial convoys started passing through the area and Deir Ezzor was a station for them, providing them with food, feed, and comfort. The khans were established in it and the road between Aleppo and Baghdad began to revive it and get it out of isolation, and young people start traveling to Horan with the beginning of the spring for trading or work and then return in the early fall, they also travel to Aleppo, Baghdad, Mardin and Urfa for trading. In 1831 Ibrahim Pasha took over Deir Ezzor and annexed it to Hama Sanjak and appointed Maejun Agha governor of the city, Egyptian rule remained until 1840 when the authority of the Ottoman returned to the city, Perhaps the most prominent feature of Ibrahim Pasha's rule is the proliferation of weapons among the city's inhabitants, especially the rifles, known as \\"Brahimiyat\\", which constituted a major tool to defend the city and repel Bedouin attacks. ====Second Ottoman Era (1864‚Äì1918)==== Zor Sanjak Ottoman Syria until World War I. Present borders in grey. On 2 January 1858, the Ottoman government launched a military campaign under the command of Omar Pasha (Croatian) comprised 500 soldiers to subdue the tribes in the Euphrates region. The campaign reached Deir ez-Zor city and fought against the residents of the city where 16 Ottoman soldiers were killed. After the Ottoman army subdued the city, Omar Pasha recruited 16 young men from the city to replace the Ottoman soldiers who had been killed. In 1864 the city revolted against Ottoman rule, and Soraya Pasha, the governor of Aleppo, sent a military force to suppress it. After the campaign, Soraya Pasha came to Deir Ezzor and made it the center of the district's headquarters (Qaimakamiyya) and he returned to Aleppo after appointing Omar Pasha governor, whose rule did not last more than 6 months. Khalil Bey Saqib was appointed as Kaymakam of Deir Ezzor after it was annexed to Aleppo. During his reign, it established the government house (Dar Al Saraya), a military barracks, a hospital and some trade markets. Some of the arrivals from Urfa settled in the city to help Khalil Bey Saqib with the administration, as well as starting campaigns to settle the Bedouin in urban centers on the Euphrates. In 1868, the Qaimakamiyya was transformed to the Zor Sanjak, which did not report to the wali but reported directly to the Grand Vizier in Istanbul. Its ruler (Mutasarrƒ±f) was granted wide powers and its area was extended to include the city of Raqqa and Hasakah. The rulers (Mutasarrƒ±fs) solidified security, especially during Arslan Pasha's reign, and were interested in organizing and planning the city, building schools and streets and established the first public park. They also built bridges on the Euphrates and some mosques and encouraged afforestation and they used boats to cross the Euphrates. They reformed the tax system and introduced European uniforms into the city and did not generalize it. The era of the Zor Sanjak lasted 54 years, where 29 Mutasarrƒ±fs successively ruled it, the most recent being Hilmi Bey, who left the city with the Ottoman army on 6 November 1918. The continuous change of rulers (Mutasarrƒ±fs) and lack of resources and disruption of conditions in the Ottoman Empire affected negatively on the urban, economic, cultural and social activity of the city. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 brought calamities, with many young people being recruited, famine and disease spread, livelihoods were confiscated, trade stopped and agriculture declined. However, in the opinion of historian Abdul Qadir Ayyash, Deir Ezzor owed its civilization to the Ottoman rulers despite their mistakes. ===Armenian genocide=== At the beginning of World War I in 1914 the Ottoman Empire began systematic campaigns to kill and displace Armenians. This was carried out through massacres, forced deportations and displacement, which were marches under harsh conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees. Researchers estimate the number of Armenian victims as between 1 million and 1.5 million. Deir Ezzor was the last destination of the forced displacement of Armenian convoys, and the scene of killings and slaughter by the Turkish gendarmerie, where the Ottoman authorities planned to exterminate Armenians by the Arabs. But their plans failed because the people of Deir ez-Zor regretted what happened to the Armenian men, women and children, prompting Haj Fadel Al-Aboud who was mayor of Deir Ezzor to help and protect them and provide them with food, housing, all livelihoods and safety. If the Armenian forced migration had a tragic side, it had a positive side on the city of Deir Ezzor, reflected in the high population of the city and consequently the high rate of population growth. Historically, the city of Deir Ezzor has a special place for Armenians in Syria and Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora. The Armenian Genocide Memorial Church, which was officially built in 1991, includes a museum containing some remains, collectibles and maps for memory of the martyrs who died in that area by the Ottoman Turks. The city later became a pilgrimage destination for hundreds of thousands of Armenians on 24 April each year, after being declared in 2002 by Catholicos Aram I of the Armenian Orthodox of Cilicia as a pilgrimage to the Armenians. ===Post World War I=== ====The first government of Haj Fadel==== Fadel Al-Aboud President of Deir al-Zour government in 1918 and 1920. King Faisal in 1920. Trouble broke out in the city of Deir al-Zour after the Ottomans left on 6 November 1918, where people began looting and stealing from each other across the area, so it was necessary to have a strong authority for protecting the city and its people and that led Al-Hassan who was the mayor to form his first government in the city and asking all tribal leaders in the villages and surrounding districts to support him and pledge allegiance to him. One of the priorities of this government was maintain the security and running the affairs of the city. This government later known as the \\"Haj Fadel Government\\".Bukhapur revolution with dates and evidenceÿå Website Al-Muhasan City..

The government continued until the arrival of Sharif Nasser, the cousin of prince Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, on 1 December 1918, and Mar'i Pasha al-Mallah on 7 December 1918. ====British period==== On 11 January 1919, the British army occupied the city via the Iraqi border and annexed it to Iraqi territory. The British government took care of the security and cleanliness of the city and set up a primary school that started teaching English. Fadel Al-Aboud remained mayor, During this period, Fadel Al-Aboud and a number of leaders of the Baggara tribe, Agedat and other tribes represented the Euphrates region at the Syrian National Congress held in late June 1919 Which declared on 8 March 1920 the independence of Syria and establishment of Arab Kingdom of Syria and the appointment of Faisal Ibn Al-Sharif Hussein as King. The people of Deir Ezzor sought to get rid of British rule and wrote their wish to the Arab government in Damascus, The Iraqi officers of the Iraqi \\"Al-'Ahd Party\\" in Damascus wanted to occupy Deir Ezzor to make it a base to liberate Iraq from the British occupation. So they appointed Ramadan al-Shallash as governor of Raqqa to be a step to liberate Deir Ezzor, Officer Ramadan al-Shallash came and occupied Deir Ezzor with the help of her people and \\"Albu Saraya\\" clan and British troops withdrew on 27 December 1919 to the Iraqi border. ====The Second government of Haj Fadel==== On 27 December 1919, Ramadan al-Shallash took over the administration of Deir ez-Zor as a military ruler and his authority was nominal and the real ruling was to the notables of the city, and they were not satisfied with his actions so they took him out of the city after two months. After the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920 and occupation of Damascus by French forces, The city of Deir ez-Zor was in a state of chaos and insecurity, which prompted Al-Hassan to form his second government, Which has done great services in protecting the city and maintaining the security of its people despite its limited capabilities. This government continued its work until 23 November 1920, when it was dissolved by a decision of the French occupation authorities.Alayyashÿå Abdul Qaderÿå Prepare: Walid al-Mashouhÿå Hadarat Wady Alfurat ÿåAl Ahali for printing publishing and distributionÿå First Editionÿå 1989ÿå P 154..Alshamary, Anwar, Biggest Baggara Tribe, Dar Almaref, Homs, 1996, Page: 363.. King Faisal left Syria for Horan then Haifa and from there to Como in Italy then to London in October 1920 at the invitation of the British royal family, Upon his departure, the monarchy in Syria ended and began the French Mandate era. ===French Mandate=== General Yusuf al-Azma Henri Gouraud In July 1920, French General Henri Gouraud issued an ultimatum to the government of King Faisal, known as the \\"Gouraud ultimatum \\", I set four days to accept it. Although the Syrian government accepted the ultimatum and accepted the demands of General Gouraud to demobilize the Syrian army and withdraw the soldiers from the mounds of the village of Majdal Anjar in violation of the decision of the Syrian National Congress, on 24 July 1920, French troops began to march on the orders of General Goubeier (By order of General Gouraud) towards Damascus, While the Syrian army stationed on the border was retreating, and when General Gouraud) asked about this matter, replied that Faisal's message by accepting the ultimatum had reached him after the deadline. on 24 July 1920, the Battle of Maysalun ended with the loss of the Syrian army and the martyrdom of the Minister of War Yousef Al-Azma, After its control over the entire Syrian territory, France resorted to the fragmentation of Syria into several independent states or entities: * State of Damascus (1920). * State of Aleppo (1920). * Alawite State (1920). * The State of Greater Lebanon (1920). * Jabal Druze State (1921). * Sanjak of Alexandretta (1921). The city of Deir Ezzor, Raqqa and Al-Hasakah were followed to Aleppo. When the French colonial forces entered Deir ez-Zor on 9 November 1921 the region was locally ruled by Fadel Al-Aboud, a member of an aristocratic family, After a while protests and demonstrations against occupation broke out, A group of French armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers encircled the house of Fadel Al-Aboud, where he was arrested and transferred to the military airport of Deir al-Zour and then transported by military aircraft to Aleppo, where he was imprisoned in the castle and during his imprisonment he met with the leader Ibrahim Hanano, In June 1922 he was released and returned to Deir ez-Zor.Fattouh, Issa, Abdul Qader Ayyash Researcher and Historian, Almarifa Magazine, Ministry of Culture in the Syrian Arab Republic, No 646, year 56, July 2017, p 155.. Later, Fadel Al-Aboud was sentenced to exile to the city of Jisr al-Shughour after he was accused of preparing a revolt against French colonialism in protest against the military campaign by the French army against the Bukhabur tribes that refused to pay taxes to the French colonizer, and insulting Wali Deir al-Zour Khalil Isaac, who was cooperating with the French.Alnigressÿå Mahmoudÿå Bo Jimaa Bottelÿå Furat newspaperÿå 2005..Sabbagh, Rend, Deir al-Zour city on the banks of Paradise, Al Quds Al Arabi, Twenty-eighth year, 09/04/2017 number 8789, page 34..Al-Saqal, Fathallah, wholesale execution, Manarat al-Furat magazine, 09/2009, p. 29.. In June 1922, under the pressure of the Syrian people and the continued demonstration, Gouraud declared the creation of a Syrian federation on a federal basis between Damascus, Aleppo, and Alawite state, Provided that the Federation should have a president elected for one non-renewable year, The council of the Federation held its first meeting in June 1922 in the city of Aleppo and issued resolution No. / 1 / to form the federal Government, Subhi Barakat, who is close to the French colonial authorities, was elected president of the federation. ====The struggle against the Mandate==== Ayyash Al-Haj French General Maurice Sarrail, The High Commissioner of the French Mandate of Syria Hassan Al-Abed Al-Salamah, the moment of his execution by the French occupation Sultan Ibrahim al-Adham mosque in Jableh. There were contacts between the leaders of the Great Syrian Revolution and some patriots of Syrian east area as Mohammed ŸêAl-Ayyash, who met in Damascus with Dr. Abdul Rahman Shahbandar, leader of the People's Party, and discussed with him the issue of extending the revolution to the Euphrates region and opened a front against the French to disperse their forces, and ease the pressure on the rebels of Ghouta and Jabal al-Arab, after returned Al-Ayyash from Damascus he started to arouse the enthusiasm of the people of Deir ez-Zor and invite them to fight, and agreed with his brother Mahmoud to go to the villages of the Albu Saraya clan that living west of Deir ez-Zor and which have a strong friendship with his father Ayyash Al-Haj, to form revolutionary groups with them to strike the French forces. Alt URL Al-Ayyash managed to form a revolutionary group of thirteen armed men who were ready to take any military action against the French forces, They are: # Mahmoud Al-Ayyash # Hakami Al- Abed Al-Salameh (Al-Shumaitiya Village). # Aziz Al-Ali Al-Salamah (Al- Shumaitiya Village). # Haji Ali Al-Abed Al-Salama (Al-Shumaitiya Village). # Hassan Al-Abed Al-Salamah (Al-Shumaitiya Village). # Hamza Al-Abed Al-Salama (Al-Shumaitiya Village). # Aslibi Masoud Al-Abdul Jalil (Al-Shumaitiya Village). # Khaleef Al-Hassan Al-Muhammad (Al-Kuraitia Village). # Lions of Hamdan (Al-Kuraitia Village). # Ahmed Al-Hassan (Al-Kuraitia Village). # Hameed Al-Sultan (Al-Kuraitia Village). # Abdullah Al-Khalaf Ibrahim (Deir ez- Zor city). # Hamad Bin Rdaini - Al-Baggara tribe. Some people was working with the French at translation centers and others, but they were at the service of the revolutionaries which They were bringing news to Mohammed ŸêAl-Ayyash about the situation and movements of the French and their activities and the timing of their military operations and Al-Ayyash guides the revolutionaries to strike the French forces. In early June 1925, the translators informed Mohammed Ÿêbey Al-Ayyash that a military vehicle carrying four French officers who had come from France to inspect the French military construction departments in Syria and Lebanon, accompanied by their French driver, would leave Deir ez-Zor on its way to Aleppo. He instructed his brother Mahmoud to set up an ambush in the area of Ain Albu Gomaa on the road to Deir ez-Zor Al- Raqqa, where the highway runs through very deep valley and has a narrow stone bridge. When the military vehicle arrived, the revolutionaries attacked and arrested the officers and took them with their car after they took their weapons to a desert called \\"Al-Aksiyya\\", and threw them with their driver in one of the abandoned wells where they died. Alt URL The French were mad for losing the contact with their officers, and began a big campaign included planes to search for them and when they found their bodies and inquired from the informants about the names of the revolutionaries, the sent a large military force equipped with heavy guns and planes to attack Albu Saraya clan and blockade it. French planes began bombing the villages of the clan, it was a horrific and devastating bombardment where the houses destroyed on the heads of children and women and killed the livestock and burned farms and crops, Some civilians were killed and among them were \\"Hanash Al-Mousa Al-Ani\\", \\"Ali Al-Najras\\", and a woman who was pregnant, and many were wounded by bullets and shrapnel from Airplane bombs, All of this was to pressure on the people to surrender the revolutionaries. When the French convinced that the bombing did not work, they resorted to a despicable means where they threatened to arrest the women of the revolutionaries, their mothers and sisters until the revolutionaries surrender themselves to the French, when the news arrived to the revolutionaries, they emerged from their hideouts and surrendered themselves to avoid arresting their women.Mohammed Alayiesh, Souriatna Journalÿå Second yearÿå 7/10/2012ÿå Issue Number: 55ÿå Page 11. Revolutionaries were tried in Aleppo, where The family of Ayyash Al-Haj appointed lawyer Fathallah Al-Saqqal to defend her, The court heard (officer Bono) head of the French intelligence in Deir ez-Zor, who said: If each of the criminals, who committed this terrible offense deserve dying once, the gang leader Mohammed Al-Ayyash is deserve hanging twice. The French High Commissioner in Beirut, Maurice Sarrail, issued Decision No. 49S / 5 in August 1925, which ordered the exile of all members of the Ayyash Al-Haj family to the city of Jableh, Mahmoud ŸêAl-Ayyash and 12 of his companions were sentenced to death. The execution was carried out by firing squad on 15 September 1925 in the city of Aleppo. Mohammed ŸêAl-Ayyash was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on the island of Arwad in Tartous city. Shortly after Ayyash Al-Haj family's living in Jableh, The French authorities assassinated Ayyash Al-Haj in a cafe outside the city by poisoning his coffee, and prevented the transfer of his body to Deir ez-Zor city for reasons of public security, He was buried in Jableh in the cemetery of Sultan Ibrahim ibn Adham Mosque where the absent prayers held for the spirit of this martyr mujahid in all the Syrian cities. ====Independence==== Flag of Independence in the Syrian Republic 1946. Former Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge crossing the Euphrates. The city was neglected during the reign of the first ŸçSyrian republic and illiteracy was rampant by 95%, however, some achievements were belong to that stage, such as building the suspension bridge and the establishment of the first bank in addition to the palace of justice, the national library and the city museum and the municipal stadium, during this period, literary and cultural clubs increased, electricity was existed and cafes became widespread. The city participated strongly in the sixtieth strike in 1936, and has seen a large march on 10 February 1936, This strike led to the signing of the independence agreement between Syria and France and the arrival of the national bloc to power after parliamentary elections held at the end of the year in which the city was represented by three deputies. In 1941, the twenty-fifth government was formed in the modern history of Syria and the tenth in the era of the first Syrian Republic, and the first after Taj al-Din al-Hassani became president. which gathered the various pillars of politics in Syria, during which the independence of Syria was proclaimed and the federal rule recognized the financial and administrative independence of Lattakia and Sweida. in this government Mohammad Bey al-Ayesh took over the Ministry of National Economy to be the first minister from Deir Ezzor and the Eastern Province. after his tenure, it dedicated the tradition of allocating a ministerial seat to a bourgeoisie in Deir ez-Zor in successive Syrian governments. And in the same year (1941) British-led forces defeated the Vichy French during the Syria- Lebanon campaign, which included a battle over Deir ez-Zor, and they handed administration of the region to the Free French.Mackenzie, Compton (1951). Eastern Epic. London: Chatto & Windus. OCLC 1412578.P.122 The city has maintained its struggle and political role in addition to its civil activity even during the independence phase, in 1946, the wheat uprising against Governor Makram al-Atassi began due to the monopoly of the authority with the good wheat in the city and the people succeeded in obtaining their rights. In 1952 cotton cultivation was widespread and automated pumping engines were introduced which resulting in increase the area of arable land and cotton became the first crop of the city instead of wheat, and the discovery of oil and salt during the reign of the second Syrian republic near the city helped to develop and expand urbanization and the increase the number of public and private companies that working in it, as well as increasing migration from the countryside towards it. ===Protests (2011‚Äì2012)=== Deir Ezzor was one of the first cities that saw large demonstrations. The demonstrations began in the city on 15 March 2011, which was the first day in the movement of protests demanding the overthrow of the Syrian regime. On 15 April 2011, a large demonstration was launched from the city's stadium despite of using the live bullets by the regime forces and the militias supporting it. In the demonstrations on Friday, 22 April 2011, (the sixth Friday in the history of the Syrian revolution) the statue of Basil al-Assad was shot down, until then, the Syrian regime had been cautious about the protests in Deir Ezzor, because of their clan nature and the size of their area and the presence of quantities of weapons in it stored from the days of the Iraq war. When the demonstrators headed towards the statue of Basil al-Assad, the security forces fired only in the air. It is said that the demonstrators were not shot and prevented from dropping the statue because the security commanders did not know or appreciate the reaction that could be issued by the people of the city if one of the demonstrators was killed. Syrian regime forces took full control of the city in August 2011, but the Free Syrian Army (associated with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces) returned to take control in June 2012. ===ISIL takeover=== By the beginning of 2014, ISIS announced its annexation to what it called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and a part of Syrian regime forces remained besieged in a small part of the city. Deir Ez Zor district for more than two years remained one of the few Syrian Government strongholds in eastern Syria. Islamic State militants launched an offensive in May 2015, capturing Palmyra and cutting off the remaining supply line to Deir ez-Zor. The city was then effectively under siege by ISIS, leaving supplies to be solely delivered by transport helicopters. ISIS attempted to stop the supplies by daily attacking the Deir ez-Zor Airbase. However, their attempts failed due to the presence of elite Republican Guards of the 104th Airborne Brigade led by Brigadier General Issam Zahreddine. From 10 April 2016 to 31 August 2017 the World Food Programme supplied the city with food and basic relief items through a high altitude airdrop service. With a Russian contracted Il-76 aircraft and parachute systems supplied by Canada, USA and Russia, a total of 8015 pallets, with an average weight of 754 kg each were dropped into the besieged city of Deir- Ezzor. 309 were the flights performed during the operational period. In early September 2017, the Syrian Army moving from al-Sukhnah, reached the stronghold and joined the besieged garrison. Shortly thereafter, the siege of both the city as well as the city's airport were lifted.Syrian army breaks Isis' three- year-long siege of Deir Ezzor: Liberating the city will mean relief for its 70,000 residents as Isis, feeling the pressure, begins to conscript female fighters The Independent, 5 September 2017.Syrian Army breaks ISIS‚Äô siege on Deir Ezzor Airport and Hrabesh and Tahtouh neighborhoods SANA, 9 September 2017. By 3 November 2017, the SAA had fully liberated the city.Isil facing endgame after fall of last city in its caliphate The Telegraph, 3 November 2017. Concurrently to its operations to capture Deir ez-Zor, the Syrian Army launched a campaign to secure the whole western bank of the Euphrates which ended on 17 December 2017. From 8 September 2017 to 23 March 2019 a military operation east of the Euphrates River led by the Syrian Democratic Forces and the CJTF‚ÄìOIR took place against the last bastion of the Islamic State in Syria. The campaign ended with a decisive victory for the SDF and its allies and resulted in the capture of all of ISIL territory in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate after finishing the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani. ==Economy== The city and its rural surrounding is a fertile and prosperous farming area, with livestock-breeding (for awassi sheep), cereals and cotton crops. Many agribusiness institutions work there as well. Since the discovery of light crude petroleum in the Syrian desert it has become a centre for the country's petroleum extraction industry.International Energy Agency. World Energy Outlook. Petroleum Economist. Institute for the Study of War. Oil infrastructure across Syria and Iraq (map). in BBC News. (18 May 2015). \\"Battle for Iraq and Syria in maps\\". Retrieved 18 May 2015. BBC News website It is also a minor centre for tourism with many tourist facilities such as traditional French-style riverbank restaurants, up to 5-star hotels, a hub for trans-desert travel and an airport (IATA code: DEZ) in Al-Jafra suburb. There are salt mines nearby. ==Culture== Armenian Genocide Museum in Deir ez-Zor The majority of Deiries (from Deir ez-Zor) are Arab Muslims, with few Armenian and Assyrian/Syriac families. Deir ez-Zor was the final concentration place for Deir ez-Zor Camps for annihilating the Armenian deportation caravans. Tens of thousands of surviving men, women and children were systematically killed on the banks of the Euphrates River. The Armenian Genocide Memorial church commemorated the memory of Genocide victims who lost their lives, but it was destroyed on 21 September 2014 by Islamic State militants. Successive waves of new settlers from surrounding countrysides and provinces were heavily related to severe drought in late 1950s and 1990s most of them looking for standard jobs and giving up their farming and herding lifestyle. The Mesopotamian variety of Arabic is used in the city; a slight influence of the Aleppo dialect can be noticed as well. Dominated by Sunni Muslims, Christianity in Deir ez-Zor can be traced back to the Apostolic Age, with few active churches and chapels belong to different congregations. The city was also famous for the Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge () which spanned the Euphrates and was destroyed in 2013 during the civil war. The Deir ez-Zor Museum keeps thousands of antiquities collected from nearby archaeological sites in Northern Mesopotamia. Main campuses of Al-Furat University and Aljazeera University are also located there.Al Jazeera University . Jude.edu.sy. Retrieved on 29 October 2013. Many other polytechnic schools and professional institutes provide tertiary education are based in the city as well. The local daily newspaper Al Furat and few other publications are published there and circulated in neighbouring Al-Hasakah and Raqqa governorates. ==International relations== Deir ez-Zor is home to the third Armenian diplomatic mission in Syria; the Honorary Consulate of Armenia, opened on 11 February 2010.Thawra news (in Arabic) Deir ez-Zor Airport is an under-developed domestic and international terminal and important hub mostly connecting with Damascus and destinations in the Persian Gulf region. ===Twin cities=== * Armavir, Armenia, since October 2010.Al-Baath news (in Arabic) ==Climate== K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies it as hot desert (BWh). ==See also== * Fadel Al-Aboud * Ayyash Al-Haj * The epic of Ain Albu Gomaa * Haj Fadel Government * Armenian Genocide Memorial Church, Der Zor * Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge * Deir ez-Zor Camps * Al-Baggara == References == ==External links== * Short history of Deir Ezzor * Furat Cham Hotel Palace * Badia Cham Hotel *watch \\"Isti'mariyah ‚Äì windward between Naples and Baghdad\\" Category:Cities in Syria Category:Populated places on the Euphrates River Category:Armenian communities in Syria Category:Levant Category:Populated places in Deir ez-Zor District ","title":"Deir ez-Zor"},{"id":"1429152","text":"Rugby Southland is the provincial rugby union who govern the Southland Region of New Zealand. Their headquarters are at Rugby Park Stadium in Invercargill, which is also the home ground of the union's professional team, the Southland Stags who compete in the Mitre 10 Cup Championship Division and challenge for the Ranfurly Shield. Despite their proud history, no Southland team has ever won the top division of the New Zealand National Provincial Championship since organised competition began in 1976. However, they have won the NPC second division title five times and held the Ranfurly Shield seven times, most recently in 2011 where they defended the shield twice before losing it to Taranaki. Southland also plays for the Donald Stuart Memorial Shield against rivals Otago in what is the longest tenured provincial rivalry in New Zealand first-class rugby, with 229 matches. ==History== ===Formation and Early Years=== Founded in 1887 after splitting from Otago, Southland and its former stablemate went on to forge what is New Zealand's longest inter-provincial rugby rivalries. The two sides have played more games against each other than any other representative teams in New Zealand. They played their first game against Otago, losing in a close affair. The Southland region already had strong club rugby teams with Invercargill competing in the Dunedin based competition. The Invercargill club had already produced two All Blacks. They were outside back, Henry Braddon and wing forward, James O'Donnell. In 1885 these two players were recognised as Otago All Blacks as they played their rugby for neighbouring province. It was not until 1896 when Southland hooker, Nisbet McRobie was selected in the New Zealand team to play Queensland. The side won 9-nil and it was McRobie's only game in the 'black jersey', however he occupies a special place in Southland Rugby history as the provinces first of over 50 All Blacks. Billy Stead became the provinces first test All Black in 1903 and also captained the All Blacks 12 times. ===Production of Talent=== Southland is renowned for producing a high number of quality players despite the small population of the province shown by the over 50 All Blacks who have come from Southland. This continued following the war with players such as Leo Connolly and Jack Hazlett followed by Leicester Rutledge and Frank Oliver. But as rugby in New Zealand was organised into structured annual competition to replace tours and series which Southland had played in previously Southland Rugby struggled to retain their local talent. With Southland in the NPC Second Division from 1976, talented Southlanders began heading north in search of top level rugby. Southland continued to produce homegrown talent over 1980s and 1990s which led them to five Second Division titles, namely Brian McKechnie, Steven Pokere, Geoff Valli, Paul Henderson and Simon Culhane who was the shining light for Southland over this period, it was the talent that was lost that continues to haunt Southland fans. Southland at this time was used as a kickstart for many successful players careers. Valli moved to North Auckland in 1981, Pokere left Southland for Auckland in 1984 and Henderson spent what most consider to be his best years as a footballer in Otago from 1987-91. This worsened as Southland neared the millennium and led to embarrassing results where victories were few and far between as Southland was promoted to the NPC First Division after their 1996 championship. Considered one of Southland's best ever athletes, it pains many Southland fans to think that Jeff Wilson played only a season for Southland whilst still attending Cargill High School before heading to Otago to attend university and play his provincial rugby and cricket both of which he would represent New Zealand in before turning 20, going on to play 60 tests for the All Blacks. Justin Marshall who was Southland's halfback left after the winning the 1994 Second Division title and went on to become one of New Zealand's greatest halfbacks playing 81 All Black tests from 1995-2005 and winning every major trophy in New Zealand rugby excluding a Rugby World Cup. 2002 Southland captain Corey Flynn left the province for Canterbury and the Crusaders in 2003 and went on to play 70 games for Canterbury, 150 for the Crusaders and 15 for the All Blacks which would have been far greater if not for multiple broken arms from 2003-2014. Others who kickstarted their career in Southland before moving where they became All Blacks Norm Hewitt, Pita Alatini, David Hill and Paul Miller. All Blacks such as Anton Oliver, Damian McKenzie and Mils Muliaina (with the latter going on to become the second ever All Blacks centurion), who left the province for their schooling would not return with rugby's increasing professionalism to represent the province like their family had in the past. ===Southland vs International Teams=== For a province of its size, Southland's record against international teams is unmatched. Rugby Park has not been a happy hunting ground for foreign sides many of whom have come to grief at the hands of determined Southland sides over the years. Australian national and state sides have had a particularly miserable time in Invercargill, losing on 13 occasions. The British Lions were defeated in 1950 and 1966 and France were put away in 1979 and 1989 along with Italy more recently in 2003. ===Ranfurly Shield=== Southland were the first South Island province to win the coveted Ranfurly Shield in 1920 when they beat Wellington. Their first shield reign was brief, losing the Shield back to Wellington in 1921 after two defences. They next won the Shield in 1929 off Wairarapa, this time defending it four times before again losing to Wellington. Southland then won the Ranfurly Shield in 1937 and 1938 when they retained the Shield for 12 challenges before losing it to bitter rivals Otago in 1947. With Ranfurly Shield rugby not played from 1939 to 1945 due to World War II, Southland's nine years with the Shield remains the longest in terms of time period although it did reside under a bed for much of this time. The Southland side during this period boasted All Blacks George Purdue, Bill Hazlett, Art Wesney, Les George and All Black Captains Frank Kilby and Brushy Mitchell in the Shield winning sides. Their next Shield victory over Taranaki in 1959 would be their last for 51 years before the 2009 Southland side broke the drought by beating Canterbury 9-3 in Christchurch. Their six defences of the Shield proved to be some of the more iconic Shield games in the professional era including a 16-12 victory over arch-rivals Otago in front of a sold-out Rugby Park, and a 9-6 victory over Auckland days after the biggest snow storm ever recorded in the province led to fans having to shovel snow off the field the day before the game. After losing the Shield to Canterbury, the Stags again claimed the shield from their South Island rivals in 2011 in their most recent tenure which lasted two games. These Southland sides were not headlined by regular All Blacks like the teams from the 1930s and 1940s, instead they were made up mostly of locally grown talent educated at Southland Boys' High School such as captain Jamie Mackintosh, centurions Jason Rutledge, David Hall, Josh Bekhuis and Tim Boys, and future Scotland international John Hardie. ===Name change=== In 1998 the Southland Rugby Football Union Incorporated changed its name to Rugby Southland IncorporatedIncorporated Societies Register number 225354, Rugby Southland Incorporated, Incorporated 16 April 1937 as Southland Rugby Football Union Incorporated, New Zealand Companies office, retrieved 17 August 2017 ==Club Rugby== When Robert Galbraith stepped down as the Southland Rugby Football Union secretary the union handed him a donation which the long- serving Southland rugby administrator promptly spent on a shield he donated back to the union as a prize for Invercargill's top club rugby competition. The Galbraith Shield has been the prize for Southland's premier club rugby competition since 1908. There are six teams currently in Southland's premier competition which was most recently won by the Marist club, in what was their sixth title. The other five clubs are Blues, Pirates-Old Boys, Star, Woodlands and the Eastern Northern Barbarians whose players come from the clubs in the Eastern/Northern sub union.

He is of mixed African-American and Honduran descent. He attended Adelphi University. He first displayed his work by tagging local billboards, storefronts, and playgrounds using HYPE as his graffiti tag. His graffiti style was influenced by artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. His big break came when he began working with Classic Concepts Video Productions. Lionel \\"Vid Kid\\" Martin and VJ Ralph McDaniels created Williams's first opportunity with the Filmmakers With Attitude moniker (FWA), which was Williams's first video company. ==Career== ===Music videos=== Awards Williams has received for his video work include the Billboard Music Video Award for Best Director of the Year (1996), the Jackson Limo Award for Best Rap Video of the Year (1996) for Busta Rhymes's \\"Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check\\", the NAACP Image Award (1997), the 8th annual Music Video Production Association Award for Black Music Achievement (1997), MTV Video Music Award in the Best Rap Video (1998) category for Will Smith's \\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\\", MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video (1999) for TLC's \\"No Scrubs\\", and the BET Award for Best Director (2006) for Kanye West's \\"Gold Digger\\". In 2006, Williams was honored by MTV with its Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, presented in honor of his achievements as a filmmaker. In the December 2007 issue of Playboy magazine, Williams shot the photographs for cover subject Kim Kardashian. In 2008, Williams directed Kanye West's video for \\"Heartless\\". He also directed the music video for his single \\"All of the Lights\\" featuring Barbadian singer Rihanna and Kid Cudi, which premiered on February 19, 2011 on BET. As of 2014, Kanye West holds the artist record for working all times with Williams; the two have collaborated on 20 music videos, beginning in 2005 with the music video for \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\\". Busta Rhymes is second behind West, collaborating with Williams on 16 music videos, beginning with debut solo music video \\"Everything Remains Raw\\" / \\"Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check\\". ===Feature and short films=== In 1998, he directed his first and so far his only feature film to date, Belly, starring rappers Nas and DMX, the film released by Artisan Entertainment. In 1999, Williams signed a two-year overall deal with New Line Cinema to produce and direct feature films. His first film with New Line, Mothership died in development. Later that year, Williams was in negotiations with MTV to develop an animated series which was described as a behind-the-scenes look at the world of music and celebrities. The project also died in development. In 2000, Williams was hired to direct the Warner Bros. family film Speed Racer. He left the project the following year, with the film being released in 2008 under the direction of The Wachowskis. In 2003, Walt Disney Studios purchased a zombie horror film Thrilla, which Williams wrote. The project died in development, with Gavin Polone attached to produce. In 2010, Williams was the writer for the Kanye West-directed short film Runaway. ==Styles== A signature style used by Williams throughout the vast majority of his videos (shot mostly with cinematographer John Perez) was the Fisheye lens which distorted the camera view around the central focus. This was used by the tandem Williams/Perez in \\"Gimme Some More\\" by Busta Rhymes and \\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\\" by Missy Elliott; however, it was dropped by 2003, when he experienced his lowest level of production activity since the beginning of his career as a music video director. Another \\"signature style\\" involves placing shots in regular widescreen ratio, while a second shot is split and placed in the upper and lower bars. Videos that use this style include \\"Diamonds on My Neck\\" by Smitty, \\"I Ain't Heard of That\\" by Slim Thug, \\"So Sick\\" by Ne-Yo, \\"Gold Digger\\" by Kanye West, \\"My Hood\\" by Young Jeezy, \\"Gomenasai\\" by t.A.T.u., \\"Check on It\\" by Beyonc√©, \\"Freeze\\" by LL Cool J, \\"Snap Yo Fingers\\" by Lil Jon and many others. In addition to this, he frequently utilizes aerial and tracking shots which often move backwards or forwards, some techniques which can often be seen in \\"Rock the Boat\\" by Aaliyah, \\"She's a Bitch\\" by Missy Elliott, \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" by Christina Aguilera and \\"Only U\\" by Ashanti. Further style traits include the use of slow motion action, deep focus, and smooth cutting. Since 2003, Williams has adopted a signature style combining a center camera focus on the artist or actor's body from the torso upward and a solid color background with a soft different-colored light being shown in the center of the background, so as to give a sense of illumination of the background by the foreground subject. This has been displayed in \\"Gold Digger\\" by Kanye West, \\"Digital Girl\\" (Remix) by Jamie Foxx, \\"Video Phone\\" by Beyonc√©, and ‚ÄúBarbie Dreams‚Äù by Nicki Minaj. ==Videography== ==References* Hype Williams at mvdbase.com * Hype Williams at Clipland Category:Adelphi University alumni Category:African-American film directors Category:American music video directors Category:American people of Honduran descent Category:American male screenwriters Category:Living people Category:People from Queens, New York Category:1970 births Category:Film directors from New York (state) Category:People involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Film directors from New York City Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) ","title":"Hype Williams"},{"id":"1429168","text":"G4 Media, LLC is a company within the Comcast Corporation which maintains the archived programming of G4, a defunct 24-hour cable and satellite channel originally dedicated to video games, along with its former competitor, TechTV/ZDTV. NBCUniversal holds a controlling interest in G4 Media, with Dish Network holding a minority interest of approximately 12% because its former parent company held a minority interest in TechTV and owned Dish Network. Prior to the Comcast/NBC merger, Comcast owned the network, previously named G4 Media, Inc. ==History== In early 2004, G4 Media (at the time owned entirely by Comcast) announced the purchase of a controlling interest in TechTV. On May 28, 2004, G4 and TechTV merged into a hybrid network called G4techTV. EchoStar (which held a minority interest in TechTV and owned Dish Network) retained partial ownership of the combined entity. The new network leaned more toward the gaming programming that was featured on G4 than the technology side that was featured on TechTV, prompting petitions and complaints from disaffected TechTV fans. On February 15, 2005, TechTV was officially dropped from the network name in the United States, leaving only three TechTV shows, X-Play, Anime Unleashed (removed indefinitely as of March 2006) and The Screen Savers (later rebranded as Attack of the Show!). The channel's programming direction eventually was directed towards men with mostly acquired programs mixed with several original productions. G4 Media used to hold a 33.3% minority interest in G4's Canadian counterpart. On October 13, 2006, Comcast announced that it will consolidate G4, bringing it E!, and the Style Network into a new combined entity later known as the Comcast Entertainment Group. G4's executive staff moved into E!'s Los Angeles offices and layoffs occurred. E! likewise began using G4's former facility to produce their own content, including the early seasons of Chelsea Lately. There had been reports of G4TV rebranding itself in Summer 2013 into an upscale men's channel previous to the recent programming changes. It was announced on December 7, 2012 that G4 will in fact be rebranded as the Esquire Network (previously Esquire Channel) after NBCUniversal closed a deal with Hearst Corporation (the owner of Esquire). Any and all in-house productions for the G4 network have ended as of January 23, with the exception of American Ninja Warrior in the summer of 2013 after the pushback of the Esquire Network launch to September 23, 2013. Due to its DirecTV coverage, the Style Network was chosen as the slot for Esquire Network. G4 Media, and its main network are expected to \\"remain as is for the foreseeable future, though it's highly unlikely the company will invest in more original programming.\\" Dish Network, which was a part owner of G4 Media, dropped the network from its lineup on November 1, 2013. ===G4 Media becomes defunct, so does G4=== After the fifth season of American Ninja Warrior was completed, control of production for the series for future seasons shifted from G4 Media to NBCUniversal Television, leaving G4 Media as a defunct production company maintaining the archives of TechTV and G4 within the Comcast organization and licensing the G4 trademark to their Canadian counterpart. According to a statement sent by NBCUniversal Cable to the remaining providers carrying the network, G4 would end all operations on November 30, 2014,.Source: Notice from Golden Belt Telephone accessed 11/14/2014 On December 31, 2014 at 11:59pm EST, G4 ceased broadcasting. ===Revival=== On July 24, 2020, the Twitter accounts of G4TV and G4's Attack of the Show! and X-Play, reactivated to post a teaser video of a G4 revival in some form, slated for 2021. The teasers were timed for Comic-Con@Home, the first virtual streaming edition of the annual fan convention, San Diego Comic- Con International (which was one of many events that were canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). Consequently, G4's website reopened as a playable game of Pong (which if won, redirects to a mailing list sign up for updates), once again reflecting back to the network's original launch in 2002 and their shutdown in 2014. On August 12, 2020, Olivia Munn, the former co-host of the show, Attack of the Show! is reportedly in final talks for a multi-year deal at the revival. The agreement deal will include a development deal and has both on- and off-air components. ==Programs produced by G4 Media== *2 Months 2 Million (2009) *American Ninja Warrior (2009-2013, transferred to Esquire Network) *Arena (2002-2005) *Attack of the Show!

The house was built in 1908 for Mr. Burton J. Westcott, his wife Orpha, and their family. The Westcott property is the only Prairie style house designed by Wright in the state of Ohio. The grounds include the main house and a garage with stables connected by an extensive pergola. ==Early history== In 1903, as part of a merger, Burton J. Westcott came to Springfield, Ohio as Treasurer of The American Seeding Machine Company. He would hold the position for 21 years. In 1916, Burton brought the Westcott Motor Car Company to Springfield, Ohio, from Richmond, Indiana. He was president of the company until 1925. Wright designed a detached garage which included a design for a large turntable (never installed), similar to at a railroad yard. The garage also included two pony stables and was connected to the main house by a pergola. Burton's wife, Orpha, was from Hamilton, Ohio. The Westcotts had two children: Jeanne born in Richmond, Indiana, in 1895, and John born in Springfield, Ohio, in 1903. Orpha L. Westcott was considered one of Springfield, Ohio's most prominent and progressive women, and is credited with suggesting the selection of Frank Lloyd Wright as the architect for their new home. In 1918, the Westcotts built the only addition to their home, a summer porch on the second floor and a room below in keeping with the original design of the Prairie style architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. By 1920, Jennie was no longer living in the Westcott House; she married Richard Rodgers from Springfield, Ohio. Their wedding was held at the house. The only other residents of the house were a cook named Nora and a housemaid named Margaret, both middle-aged and originally from Ireland. The 1920s proved to be unhappy years for the Westcott family. Orpha died suddenly in April 1923 following a minor surgical procedure in Philadelphia. At the same time Burton's company was failing. He resigned as treasurer of the American Seeding Machine Company in order to invest more time for the failing Westcott Motor Car Company. Attempts to save the ailing car company had exhausted his finances. With no other option Burton sold out. The severe stress in his life took its toll on his health. In 1926 at 57 years of age, he died in his home on East High Street while under the care of his sister from Richmond, Indiana. Funeral services were held at the Westcott residence; he was buried in Richmond, Indiana. Burton J. Westcott was a true leader, Renaissance man, innovator, and a manufacturing pioneer of the 20th century. Following the death of Burton in 1926, the Westcott House was sold to Roscoe Pierce. He lived in the house until his death in 1941. Eva Linton bought the house in 1944. She subsequently sub-divided the main house into five apartments. Linton also had the stables remodeled, adding a kitchen and bathroom, and converted the garage into her place of residence. Over the next 37 years the house fell into a state of disrepair and decline. Eva Linton died in 1980, and her estate was passed to her niece Dorothy Jane Snyder. Dorothy inherited the property in 1981 and maintained it until 1988 when she sold it to her son Ken Snyder and his wife Sherri. ==Westcott House Foundation== In 1991, Ken died unexpectedly in a car accident. Sherri struggled to manage and maintain the house until she sold the house in 2000. The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy acquired the decaying Westcott House from Mrs. Snyder for $300,000 through the use of their Lewis-Haines revolving loan program, and as part of the predefined purchase arrangement the house was subsequently sold on May 11, 2001, to the newly formed non-profit The Westcott House Foundation. The Westcott House Foundation was organized by a devoted group of Springfield preservationists and benefactors, bolstered with a multi-year $3.5 million grant from the local Turner Foundation, they bought the house from the Conservancy and committed to restore the all-but-lost historic residence. Chambers, Murphy and Burge of Akron, Ohio, and Schooley Caldwell Associates of Columbus, Ohio, were secured to be the lead architectural firms for the project. The nearly 5-year, $5.8 million, restoration of the Westcott House was completed in 2005, and was governed by goals and objectives set forth by the Westcott House Foundation and the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. More than four hundred architects, engineers, craftspeople and volunteers contributed to the effort. The Westcott House opened to the public on October 15, 2005. As of 2019, the Westcott House Foundation sponsors a lecture series, an array of educational programs for student, adults and educators, design exhibits, immersive art/multi-media events, design workshops, and social activities. The foundation strives to promote a greater understanding of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, particularly about Wright's concept of organic architecture, design process thinking, and design education. Guided tours are offered Wednesdays through Sundays. ==References== * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

Kemp became the editor of Option in 1991, the year Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind stormed the pop charts. Option's visibility in the early '90s led to Kemp's hirings at Rolling Stone and MTV. During Kemp's tenure at Rolling Stone, several acts made first-time appearances on the magazine's cover including Beck, Marilyn Manson, The Prodigy and Sean Combs. Kemp also was responsible for assigning a controversial investigative cover story on Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, reported by a team of three journalists, staff writers John Colapinto (now at The New Yorker), Matt Hendrickson (Garden and Gun) and Eric Boehlert (Media Matters), and without Vedder's cooperation. At MTV Kemp was part of a team responsible for launching the popular daytime music-video series Total Request Live; he also helped develop shows for MTV's sister station VH1. Kemp left MTV in 2000 to focus on writing his social/cultural memoir Dixie Lullaby, in which he revisited the southern rock of his youth and examined its social and psychological impact on young Southerners in the years following the civil rights movement. In 2002 he returned to his home state of North Carolina, where he served as entertainment editor of The Charlotte Observer and editor in chief of the alternative weekly Creative Loafing. From 2014 to 2016, Kemp served briefly as the editor of Acoustic Guitar (magazine) and SF Weekly in the San Francisco Bay Area, but returned to North Carolina where he serves as senior editor at Our State. ==References== *Currin, Grayson. \\"Home is where the South is: A city boy returns to Dixie to reconnect with his music roots.\\" Independent Weekly.

The band was best known for its 1988 UK number 3 hit single \\"Mary's Prayer\\". The band served as a launchpad for the career of Gary Clark, who also played in the 1990s bands King L and Transister before becoming a successful songwriter for other artists including Natalie Imbruglia, Liz Phair, Nick Carter, k.d. lang and former Spice Girls Melanie C and Emma Bunton. Other former members of the band have played in Simple Minds, Deacon Blue and Swiss Family Orbison. ==History== ===Background and early history=== Gary Clark and Ged Grimes grew up together in Dundee, Scotland and played together in school bands. Influenced by soul and pop artists such as Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder and Bacharach and David, they eventually moved to London, where they played in the bands Perfect Strangers and Dream Kitchen during the early 1980s. Neither band met with success: circa 1984, while still in London, Clark and Grimes noticed that talent scouts and journalists were beginning to follow the soul and pop scenes in Scottish cities. Returning to Dundee, they teamed up with Gary Clark's younger brother Kit Clark to form a new band called Spencer Tracy (after the film star of the same name). Initially spotted busking around Dundee, Spencer Tracy signed to Virgin Records in 1986. After objections from the estate of the actor Spencer Tracy, the band was obliged to change its name. Gary Clark recalls this as \\"a real last-minute crazy, fearful moment... The album was done, the artwork was done... We were just told, 'If you try and use this, you will be sued.' And so the label just went 'Nope. Change it. Now.'\\" For their new name, the band chose Danny Wilson, taken from a 1952 Frank Sinatra film called Meet Danny Wilson (itself a favourite film of the Clark brothers' father). All three members of Danny Wilson played a variety of instruments and had a grounding in production. The band would later summarise their approach as follows: \\"Whoever has an idea can play it and we'll record it. However that means that it's pretty impossible to document who played what on what track. Sometimes Ged might be playing an instrument (usually a rented ethnic one) and Kit would jump in for the middle eight.\\" Generally speaking, Gary Clark played most of the guitar and piano parts on album while Grimes played all of the bass parts. Kit Clark functioned as a multi-instrumental wild card (including accordion, guitar and found percussion) and provided unorthodox musical ideas. The band once summarised his contribution as \\"if you hear something mental and think to yourself \\"What the f**k was that?\\" then it's probably Kit.\\" The band remained a trio throughout its lifetime, hiring in other members (drummers in particular). Lead vocals were shared between the Clark brothers: Gary, as the band's main songwriter, took the majority of these, but over time Kit would sing more of them. ===Meet Danny Wilson=== The band's debut album Meet Danny Wilson, written entirely by Gary Clark, was released in 1987. An acclaimed mix of sophisti-pop with elements of soul, jazz and bossa nova, it included an appearance by Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy among others. The lead single, \\"Mary's Prayer\\", issued in the spring, was initially unsuccessful in the United Kingdom, missing the official UK Top 75 and peaking at number 86. However the US release of \\"Mary's Prayer\\" that summer afforded Danny Wilson a surprise US Top 40 hit, peaking at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 The band toured the United States in the autumn of 1987, supporting Simply Red and proving successful with that group's fans. The US success of \\"Mary's Prayer\\" led to its UK re-release with a resultant number 42 UK chart peak. After \\"Mary's Prayer\\" topped a BBC Radio 1 phone-in poll of listeners' nominations for 1987 singles which had undeservedly failed to reach the upper UK chart, Virgin Records UK gave the single a second re-release with a resultant number 3 UK chart peak. Meet Danny Wilson generated two more singles: \\"Davy\\" and \\"A Girl I Used To Know\\", both of which preceded the successful reissue of \\"Mary's Prayer\\" but neither of which matched its success. ===Bebop Moptop=== The band released its second album, Bebop Moptop the following year. Gary Clark was no longer the band's only songwriter, as Ged Grimes and Kit Clark co-wrote \\"I Can't Wait\\" and Kit also contributed \\"N.Y.C Shanty\\", both of which Kit sang on the record. The first single released from the album was \\"Never Gonna Be The Same\\", but this was overshadowed by its successor, the hit single \\"The Second Summer of Love\\", which reached number 23 in the British charts. The song had originally been written by Gary Clark as a joke about the rise of acid house and its associated culture and media impact. As initially written it was barely more than a minute long, so when Virgin Records picked the song for single release the band extended it via a long harmonica solo. Three more singles were released from Bebop Moptop ‚Äì \\"If Everything You Said Was True\\", the slow ballad \\"If You Really Love Me (Let Me Go)\\", and \\"I Can't Wait\\", but in spite of Virgin Records' promotional efforts, none of them were hits. Gary Clark has subsequently suggested that this was simply down to airplay problems: \\"Virgin were really great at that time, and, y'know, we didn't really fit what was on the radio at any time. We kind of got lucky with \\"Mary's Prayer\\", in the sense that it just happened to fit, whereas the records were pretty eclectic. And Virgin, even though they loved the band and loved the stuff, they obviously had trouble at radio. It didn't fit with what was going on.\\" ===Split=== By the time the band began to demo the third Danny Wilson album in 1991, all three members had written more songs than would fit onto the album, leading to arguments and frustration. Kit Clark made an attempt to solve the situation by persuading Virgin Records to let him record a solo album, but was rebuffed - following this, he decided to leave the band. Deciding that Danny Wilson would be too much reduced without Kit's contribution (\\"he was kind of a really good force just in terms of ideas and the flavour of things\\"), Gary Clark opted to break up the band, maintaining its creative integrity and the friendships between all members before both were spoiled. A second reason cited for Danny Wilson's dissolution was the three members' collective frustration with the way the band itself overshadowed the people in it. The band name was often mistaken for that of a non-existent frontman, for whom Grimes and the Clark brothers were simply sidemen. Kit Clark once commented \\"We felt like three men in one grave.\\"Sleevenotes from Sweet Danny Wilson compilation album The split was amicable, with all three members supporting ‚Äì and sometimes playing on ‚Äì each other's future projects. A compilation album, Sweet Danny Wilson, was released by Virgin Records in 1991 (containing a bonus album of live recordings called Three-In-A-Bed Romp). The songs which Clark had written for the unrecorded third Danny Wilson album ended up on his 1993 solo album Ten Short Songs About Love (on which both Ged Grimes and Kit Clark performed). ===Post-band activities=== Following the relative commercial failure of Ten Short Songs About Love, Gary Clark abandoned solo work to form first the rock band King L (with American bass player Eric Pressly and former Bible guitarist Neill Maccoll) and then the pop band Transister (with Pressly and lead singer Keeley Hawkes). Clark then stepped down from performing to turn his attention to writing and producing for other artists. In 2001, he worked on Natalie Imbruglia's second album White Lilies Island, and co-wrote most of the album's songs with her, including the single \\"Wrong Impression\\"; He continued to collaborate with her until 2009. Gary Clark has also worked as a songwriter or producer for Liz Phair, Nick Carter, Ashley Parker Angel, k.d. lang, Ferras, The Wanted, Demi Lovato, Delta Goodrem and Spice Girls Melanie C and Emma Bunton. Following spells living in London, France and Los Angeles, he has recently returned to live in Dundee. In 2016, Clark composed the score for the Irish film Sing Street and either wrote or co-wrote all of the original songs featured in the film. In 1991, Kit Clark released a solo EP called Lovedung on Reverb Records. He went on to play with his own bands Pony and Swiss Family Orbison during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2010 he began to perform as a solo artist. Having spent time as a music writer for computer games, Ged Grimes is currently the bass player for Simple Minds (and has also played with another high-profile Scottish rock band, Deacon Blue). ===Occasional reunions (1993, 2014)=== On 30 October 1993, Gary Clark and former Bible frontman Boo Hewerdine (who were friends and songwriting collaborators) played a full- length concert at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, sharing the stage throughout while alternating songs written by one or the other or by both together. Both Ged Grimes and Kit Clark played in the five-piece concert band, which played a number of a number of Danny Wilson songs. In effect, this was a version of Danny Wilson fronted by both Clark and Hewerdine, although the evening was billed very much as friends playing together rather than a formal reunion. The Danny Wilson trio would not reunite on stage for another twenty-one years. In mid-2014 (around the time Gary Clark returned to live in Dundee following many years of being based in London or Los Angeles), the band briefly and secretly reformed to play a short set at a friend's wedding in Dundee. Clark announced afterwards that there were no plans to extend the reunion and that it had taken place as a favour. On 24 September 2014 the band reunited for their first true public performance in twenty-five years, playing \\"Mary's Prayer\\" at the opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup at Glasgow Hydro (alongside other performers including Texas, Amy Macdonald, Twin Atlantic, Eddi Reader and Midge Ure). Emphasizing Kit Clark's solo career and Ged Grimes' ongoing work with Simple Minds, Clark once again stated that the performance was \\"unlikely to herald a permanent reunion\\". ==Group members== ===Core band=== *Gary Clark - vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards, harmonica, programming, etc. *Kit Clark - vocals, guitar, percussion, keyboards, accordion, harmonica, etc. *Ged Grimes - bass guitar, double bass, keyboards, backing vocals, etc. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Meet Danny Wilson (1987, UK number 65) *Bebop Moptop (1989, UK number 24) *Sweet Danny Wilson / Three-In-A-Bed Romp (1991, UK number 54) ===Singles=== *\\"Mary's Prayer\\" (1987/1988, UK number 3, US number 23, AUS number 64 *\\"Davy\\" (1987/1988, UK number 83) *\\"A Girl I Used to Know\\" (1988, UK number 81) *\\"The Second Summer of Love\\" (1989, UK number 23) *\\"Never Gonna Be the Same\\" (1989, UK number 69) *\\"I Can't Wait\\" (1990, UK number 92) *\\"If You Really Love Me (Let Me Go)\\" (1991) ==References== ==External links== *Gary Clark and Danny Wilson discography *Swiss Family Orbison Category:Scottish buskers Category:Scottish pop music groups Category:British musical trios Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Sophisti-pop musical groups ","title":"Danny Wilson (band)"},{"id":"1429193","text":"Policy appliances are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy rules (information use rules) and to ensure accountability in information systems. The use of policy appliances in this context was first described in K. A. Taipale, \\"Designing Technical Systems to Support Policy: Enterprise Architecture, Policy Appliances, and Civil Liberties\\", in Emergent Information Technologies and Enabling Policies for Counter Terrorism (Robert Popp and John Yen, eds., Wiley-IEEE Press, Mar. 2006) Policy appliances can be used to enforce policy or other systems constraints within and among trusted systems. The emerging global information society consists of many heterogeneous but interconnected systems that are governed or managed according to different policies, rules, or principles that meet local information management needs. For example, systems may be subject to different international, national or other political subdivision information disclosure or privacy laws; or different information management or security policies among or between government agencies, government and private sector information systems, or producers and consumers of proprietary information or intellectual property, etc. This interconnected network of systems (for which the Internet as we currently know it serves as the transport layer) increasingly requires dynamic agreement (negotiation) and technical mediation as to which policies will govern information as it flows between or among systems (that is, what use policies will govern what information goes where, under what constraints, and who has access to it for what purposes, etc.). The alternative to developing these mediating mechanisms to provide automated policy negotiation and enforcement across interconnection between disparate systems is the increased \\"balkanization\\" or fragmentation of the Internet. Internet panel: \\"Balkanization\\" looms, ars technica (Oct. 12, 2006) Because no single policy can govern all systems or information needs, methods of reconciling differences between systems and then enforcing and monitoring agreed policies are necessary in order to share useful information and keep systems interconnected. Current static methods based on all-or-nothing access control are insufficient to meet variable information production and consumption needs, particularly when there are potentially competing policies (for example, the conflict between disclosure and privacy laws) that are contextually dependent. Access control mechanisms that simply control who has access between systems result in stove-piped information silos, \\"walled gardens\\", and increased network fragmentation. Policy appliance is a general term to describe dynamic, contextually-aware control mechanisms currently being researched and developed to enforce use policies between systems. Although policy development and enforcement itself is a political or cultural process, not a technological one, technical systems architecture can be used to determine what policy opportunities exist by controlling the terms under which information is exchanged, or applications behave, across systems. In order to maintain the open transport, end-to-end principles embedded in the current Internet design ‚Äì that is, to avoid hard-coding policy solutions in the transport layer or using strict access control regimes to segment the network ‚Äì policy appliances are required to mediate between systems to facilitate information sharing, data exchange, and management process interoperability. Policy appliances -- a generic term referring to any form of middleware that manages policy rules -- can mediate between data owners or producers, data aggregators, and data users, and among heterogeneous institutional systems or networks, to enforce, reconcile, and monitor agreed information management policies and laws across system (or between jurisdictions) with divergent information policies or needs. Policy appliances can interact with smart data (data that carries with it contextual relevant terms for its own use), intelligent agents (queries that are self- credentialed, authenticating, or contextually adaptive), or context-aware applications to control information flows, protect security and confidentiality, and maintain privacy. Policy appliances support policy-based information management processes by enabling rules-based processing, selective disclosure, and accountability and oversight. Examples of policy appliance technologies for rules-based processing include analytic filters, contextual search, semantic programs, labeling and wrapper tools, and DRM, among others; policy appliance technologies for selective disclosure include anonymization, content personalization, subscription and publishing tools, among others; and, policy appliance technologies for accountability and oversight include authentication, authorization, immutable and non-repudiable logging, and audit tools, among others. Control and accountability over policy appliances between competing systems is becoming a key determinant in policy implementation and enforcement, and will continue to be subject to ongoing international and national political, corporate and bureaucratic struggle. Transparency, together with immutable and non-repudiable logs, are necessary to ensure accountability and compliance for both political, operational and civil liberties policy needs. Increasingly, international and national information policy and law will need to rely on technical means of enforcement and accountability through policy appliances. ==References== ==See also== See also, Technology, Security, and Privacy: The Fear of Frankenstein, the Mythology of Privacy, and the Lessons of King Ludd, 7 Yale J.

Nigh served as the 17th and the 22nd Governor of Oklahoma and as the 8th and 10th Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma. He was the first Oklahoma governor to be re-elected and the first to win all 77 counties in the state. Additionally, short term vacancies in the governor's office twice resulted in Nigh assuming gubernatorial duties while serving as lieutenant governor. Following his service as governor, Nigh served on the board of directors of J. C. Penney and as President of the University of Central Oklahoma and as director and public relations advisor for International Bank of Commerce. Prior to holding statewide offices, he worked as a teacher and legislator. ==Early life and career== Nigh was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, and was the son of Wilbur R. and Irene Crockett Nigh. He served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946 and graduated from East Central State College in Ada, Oklahoma in 1951.Governor George P. Nigh, 100 Years of Oklahoma Governors (accessed May 27, 2013) Nigh had remained a bachelor until after he left public office for the first time. He then met and married Donna Mashburn, who had a young son. The Nighs later had a daughter. ==Political career== Nigh in 1972, during his time as Lieutenant Governor From 1951 to 1959, he alternated between service in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, and as a teacher in McAlester public schools. During his tenure in the state legislature, he introduced legislation designating \\"Oklahoma!\\" as the state song.George Nigh CareerTech Hall of Fame Bio (accessed June 30, 2013) Nigh ran for Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma in 1958; he finished second in the Democratic primary behind Cowboy Pink Williams with 80,727 votes (18.77%) to Williams' 176,171 votes (40.97%). Nigh defeated Williams in the runoff with 302,050 votes (61.32%) to 190,530 (38.68%). Williams himself had finished second behind incumbent Lieutenant Governor James E. Berry in the 1954 Democratic primary, before besting him in the runoff. In the general election, Nigh beat Republican George B. Sherritt in a landslide by 384,431 votes (76.86%) to 100,068 (20.01%). Nigh served from January 12, 1959 to January 3, 1963. Taking office at age 31, he became the youngest lieutenant governor in the United States. Democratic Governor J. Howard Edmondson was term-limited in the 1962 election, so Nigh ran to succeed him. He came fourth in the Democratic primary with 84,404 votes (15.80%), behind National Commander of the American Legion Preston J. Moore, businessman W. P. Atkinson and former Governor Raymond Gary. Atkinson went on to win the runoff and lose the general election to Republican Henry Louis Bellmon, but Nigh would get a chance to serve as governor. Democratic U.S. Senator Robert S. Kerr died in office on January 1, 1963 and Edmondson resigned his office 5 days later; Nigh succeeded him as governor for the remaining days of the term only to appoint him to the vacant Senate seat. On 14 January, Bellmon took office as governor. Nigh ran for Lieutenant Governor again in 1966. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary in this and his re-election efforts, winning in 1966 with 328,580 votes (51.50%); in 1970 with 382,249 votes (57.41%) and in 1974 with 545,686 votes (72.36%). In 1970 he beat future district judge Ralph Gordon Thompson. Nigh served as the tenth lieutenant governor from January 9, 1967 to January 3, 1979, making him the second longest-serving Oklahoma lieutenant governor in state history with 16 years of service. When incumbent and not term-limited governor David Boren chose not to seek reelection, Nigh ran for Governor again in 1978. He came first in the Democratic primary with 276,910 votes (49.94%), narrowly short of avoiding a runoff against Oklahoma Attorney General Larry Derryberry, who took 208,055 votes (37.53%). However, in the runoff, Nigh defeated him easily, with 269,681 votes (57.73%) to Derryberry's 197,457 (42.27%). Nigh defeated Republican Ron Shotts in the general election with 402,240 votes (51.74%) to Shotts' 367,055 (47.22%) and thereby became the first Oklahoma Governor to serve a second term. Nigh took office five days early, as a result of outgoing Governor David Boren's swearing-in as a U.S. Senator. He ran for a second term in 1982 becoming the third Governor to do so, and defeated token opposition in the Democratic primary with 379,301 votes (82.63%) as well as Republican State Auditor Tom Daxon in the general election by 548,159 votes (62.07%) to 332,207 (37.62%), carrying all 77 of the state's counties. It was the first reelection of an Oklahoma Governor. At the inaugural address for his second full term, Nigh quoted the Pogo comic strip \\"We have found the enemy, and he is us.\\" ===Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986=== Nigh appointed the Nigh Commission to recommend changes to state government. During his two consecutive terms of office, Nigh signed the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986, which regrouped the executive branch into agency function categories, although stopping short of consolidation of the more than 250 agencies, boards, and commissions. Nigh also signed into law the Oklahoma Franchise Tax Code, which established the franchise tax in Oklahoma. ===Other accomplishments=== Nigh is also credited with increasing the numbers of minorities serving on state boards and commissions, as well as management of state agencies. He appointed the first two women, Yvonne Kauger and Alma Wilson to serve as Justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. ==Later life== Following his term as governor, he served as President of the University of Central Oklahoma from 1992 to 1997. During his tenure as UCO president, Nigh supervised construction projects that transformed the institution from a mostly commuter institution to much more of a regional university with residential dormitories. In 1990, he was inducted into the Oklahoma CareerTech Hall of Fame and in 1992, he received the Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award. From November, 2005 to April, 2006, he served as Interim Director of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation, during the agency's search for a permanent director. Nigh and his wife Donna appeared in walk-on roles in episode # 19 of the NBC soap opera Texas (playing themselves as Governor and First Lady of Oklahoma). The episode aired in August 1980. Cast member Lisby Larson (Paige Marshall) serenaded the couple with a rendition of \\"Oklahoma!\\". On April 28, 2010, Nigh and his wife were robbed at gunpoint in the driveway of their northwest Oklahoma City home. They were uninjured, though Nigh's wallet was taken.

Where the agency shop is illegal, as is common in labor law governing American public sector unions, a \\"fair share provision\\" may be agreed to by the union and the employer. The provision requires non-union employees to pay a \\"fair share fee\\" to cover the costs of the union's collective bargaining activities. The \\"fair share\\" is similar to the agency shop, but usually more restrictive as to what may be charged to the non-member.

Williams, former owner and co-founder of the Wedell-Williams Air Service Corporation. ==Design and development== Derived from an original proposal made in 1932, the XP-34 was based on a design by air racer Jimmy Wedell, who was considered, \\"one of the most noted race plane designers of its day\\".Jones 1975, p. 80. The aircraft was a direct result of the development of Wedell's most successful designs, the Model 44 and Model 45. The forward fuselage was intended to be metal, the after part and control surfaces covered in fabric. The interest expressed from the USAAC was based on the success of the private racing aircraft in the 1930s that were reaching 300 mph speeds in competition, a performance level not achieved by standard aircraft types in service in the U.S. military.Dorr and Donald 1990, p. 61. On 1 October 1935, the USAAC ordered a full set of drawings and issued the XP-34 designation. It soon became apparent, however, with its original 700 hp (522 kW) Pratt & Whitney R1535 Twin Wasp engine, the anticipated performance of the XP-34 would be insufficient compared to designs already in production. Wedell-Williams suggested substituting the 900 hp (671 kW) XR-1830 instead. Although the promise of high speed was still there, other considerations such as the complete redesign of the airframe to accommodate a heavier and more powerful engine were considered impractical with the new design subsequently rejected by the Air Corps before any aircraft were built. ==Specifications (proposed)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Dorr, Robert F. and Donald, David.

Edwards now coaches at his alma mater, Greene Central High School in Snow Hill, North Carolina. ==Biography== Edwards' hometown was Walstonburg, North Carolina. He attended Greene Central High School, in Snow Hill, North Carolina. He started his college career at Louisburg College in Louisburg, North Carolina where he played from 1984 to 1986. Louisburg College participates in Region X of the NJCAA. He also played for East Carolina University in 1986‚Äì87 and 1988‚Äì89. In 1988‚Äì89 Edwards recorded the most points in a single season for ECU (773) and finished sixth in the nation in scoring (26.7). Edwards also led the Colonial Athletic Association in scoring (26.7) and steals per game (1.6). Edwards recorded the second highest career scoring average (20.7) of any player to ever play at East Carolina. Edwards was suspended for the entire 1987‚Äì88 season along with several other people after being found guilty of breaking and entering.ECU pirates website explaining Edwards breaking-in incident In 1994 Edwards was selected to be a member of the East Carolina University Athletics Hall of Fame. He was selected by the Utah Jazz with the 21st overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft out of East Carolina University and was a member of the 1990 NBA All-Rookie 2nd team. He was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1992 and tied for scoring with Frank Brickowski for the Milwaukee Bucks during the 1992‚Äì93 season with 16.9 points per game (although at 16.85, Edwards' average was slightly lower than Brickowski's 16.89). He recorded the first triple-double in the history of the Vancouver Grizzlies (also his first) on March 1, 1996, against the Dallas Mavericks with 15 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. In the Grizzlies' first season, he ranked fourth overall in points per game (12.7). Edwards was a quality player, and won several games with last-second shots, including a game winning bucket against the Minnesota Timberwolves that ended the Grizzlies' 23-game losing streak. The shot prevented the Grizzlies from tying the National Basketball Association record for most consecutive losses. He also hit a last-second game winning shot against the Philadelphia 76ers. He was also the only Grizzly to play and start all 82 games. Due to Edwards' dunking ability, he was invited to the 1990 NBA Slam Dunk Contest in which he did not take part due to injury, and was replaced by David Benoit. However, he did take part in the 1991 event, placing 6th. Edwards wore number 30 throughout his career until he moved to the Miami Heat where he wore 32 as 30 was in use by Terry Porter. After his NBA career, Edwards played overseas.Day of the underdog - 'small team' players make it big in A1 league ==Child custody issue== At the end of 2001, Edwards was involved in a highly publicized child custody case in Canada. While playing for the Vancouver Grizzlies in the spring of 1996, Edwards, who was married, started an affair with Canadian citizen Kimberly Van de Perre. He had at least two other affairs. During the affair with Kimberly, she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy named Elijah, in June 1997. When Elijah was three months old, Ms. Van de Perre began proceedings for custody and child support, naming Edwards as the father of the child. Edwards responded initially by seeking joint custody and liberal access, but later changed his response to seek sole custody.His 'rock' of a wife swayed the judges After a lengthy trial that ran from the fall of 1998 to early 1999, the trial judge released his decision and awarded sole custody to the mother. Edwards was given considerable access ‚Äî four one-week periods quarterly throughout the year, shared time at Christmas and on Elijah's birthday and additional access upon short notice when he was in Vancouver. Edwards appealed this decision. During the hearing at the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the Court invited Mrs. Edwards to apply to be admitted as a party and to request joint custody of Elijah with her husband. Mrs. Edwards is also an African American. This new, joint application for custody was successful, and Elijah was placed in the custody of Edwards and his wife. The Court of Appeals' decision was stayed to allow the mother the opportunity to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the result that Elijah remained primarily in his mother's care throughout these proceedings. In 2001 the Supreme Court of Canada restored the trial decision and awarded custody to Elijah's mother; the Court concluded that in this case there was no evidence introduced that race should be \\"an important consideration\\".http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/09/28/scoc_0100928.html After the Supreme Court affirmed that the mother should have sole custody, the father ceased visiting and paying child support. In 2009, the Canadian Television Network produced and aired a made-for-TV movie based on the custody battle story entitled \\"Playing for Keeps\\", which is released in the US under the title \\"What Color Is Love?\\".http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2009/12/c8343.htmlhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1299377/ ==References== *Van de Perre v.

In July 1849, Barlow Granger began the paper in an abandoned log cabin by the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon River. In 1854, The Star became the Iowa Statesman which was also a Democratic paper. In 1857, The Statesman became the Iowa State Journal, which published 3 times per week. In 1870, The Iowa Statesman became the Iowa State Leader as a Democratic newspaper, which competed with pro-Republican Iowa Daily State Register for the next 32 years. In 1902, George Roberts bought the Register and Leader and merged them into a morning newspaper. In 1903, Des Moines banker Gardner Cowles, Sr. purchased the Register and Leader. The name finally became The Des Moines Register in 1915. (Cowles also acquired the Des Moines Tribune in 1908. The Tribune, which merged with the rival Des Moines News in 1924 and the Des Moines Capital in 1927, served as the evening paper for the Des Moines area until it ended publication on September 25, 1982.) Under the ownership of the Cowles family, the Register became Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, eventually adopting the slogan \\"The Newspaper Iowa Depends Upon.\\" Newspapers were distributed to all four corners of the state by train and later by truck as Iowa's highway system was improving. ===Nationwide development=== In 1906, the newspaper's first front-page editorial cartoon, illustrated by Jay Norwood Darling, was published; the tradition of front-page editorial cartoons continued until December 4, 2008 when 25-year veteran cartoonist Brian Duffy was let go in a round of staff cuts. The Register employed reporters in cities and towns throughout Iowa, and it covered national and international news stories from an Iowa perspective, even setting up its own news bureau in Washington, D.C. in 1933. During the 1960s, circulation of the Register peaked at nearly 250,000 for the daily edition and 500,000 for the Sunday edition‚Äìmore than the population of Des Moines at the time. In 1935, the Register & Tribune Company founded radio station KRNT-AM, named after the newspapers' nickname, \\"the R 'n T.\\" In 1955, the company, renamed Cowles Communications some years earlier, founded Des Moines' third television station, KRNT-TV, which was renamed KCCI after the radio station was sold in 1974. Cowles eventually acquired other newspapers, radio stations and television stations, but almost all of them were sold to other companies by 1985. In 1943, the Register became the first newspaper to sponsor a statewide opinion poll when it introduced the Iowa Poll, modeled after Iowan George Gallup's national Gallup poll. Sports coverage was increased under sports editor Garner \\"Sec\\" Taylor ‚Äì for whom Sec Taylor Field at Principal Park is named ‚Äì in the 1920s. For many years the Register printed its sports sections on peach-colored paper, but that tradition ended for the daily paper in 1981 and for the Sunday Register's \\"Big Peach\\" in 1999. Another Register tradition ‚Äì the sponsorship of RAGBRAI ‚Äì began in 1973 when writer John Karras challenged columnist Donald Kaul to do a border-to-border bicycle ride across Iowa. The liberal-leaning editorial page has brought Donald Kaul back for Sunday opinion columns. Other local columns have faded and given way to Gannett-distributed material. ===Under Gannett ownership=== In 1985, faced with declining circulation and revenues, the Cowles family sold off its various properties to different owners, with the Register going to Gannett. At the time of sale, only The New York Times had won more Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting. In 1990, the Register began to reduce its coverage of news outside of the Des Moines area by closing most of its Iowa news bureaus and ending carrier distribution to outlying counties, although an \\"Iowa Edition\\" of the Register was still being distributed throughout most of the state. Many of the Register's news stories and editorials focus on Des Moines and its suburbs. The Register opened a new printing and distribution facility on the south side of Des Moines in 2000. The news & advertising offices remained in downtown Des Moines. After 95 years in the Des Moines Register Building at 715 Locust Street, the Register announced in 2012 that they would move to a new location in 2013, settling for Capital Square three blocks to the east.. On June 15, 2013, the Register moved to its new location from 715 Locust Street to 400 Locust Street. In 2014, the old building has been sold for $1.6 million and will be redeveloped into a combination of apartments and retail space. In 2019, the Register switched from two print editions - a State and Metro edition - to one edition statewide. The Register came under scrutiny in September 2019 after uncovering a pair of controversial tweets made by Carson King, a 24-year-old Iowa man whose beer sign on ESPN College GameDay resulted in over $3 million in contributions to a children's hospital. King was 16 at the time of the posts. According to Carol Hunter, the paper's executive editor, the Register elected to include the information toward the end of a story about King. \\"Reasonable people can look at the same set of facts and disagree on what merits publication. But rest assured such decisions are not made lightly and are rooted in what we perceive as the public good,\\" she explained after receiving complaints from readers. Some readers later found social media comments previously made by the reporter, Aaron Calvin, which contained racial slurs and condemnation of law enforcement. The Register defended its decision and announced that they would launch an investigation into the \\"inappropriate social media posts\\" made by a staff member, though it did not name anyone involved. On September 27, the Register announced that Calvin was no longer employed by the newspaper.\\"Des Moines Register Responds to Outcry Over Carson King Article; Reporter No Longer with Paper,\\" WHO-DT, September 27, 2019. Accessed 09-27-2019. Calvin later wrote an op-ed in the Columbia Journalism Review blaming Gannett and the Register for what he considered to be an \\"unfair\\" firing. ==Editorial philosophy== In the three decades before the Cowles family acquired the Register in 1903, the Register was a \\"voice of pragmatic conservatism.\\"William B. Friedricks, \\"Covering Iowa: The History of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company, 1849-1985,\\" pp. 40-44 (Blackwell Pub. 2000), . However, Gardner Cowles Sr., who served as a Republican in the Iowa General Assembly, was a delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention, and served in the administration of President Herbert Hoover,Herbert Strentz, \\"Gardner Cowles, Sr.,\\" at Cowles Family Publishing Legacy, Drake University (accessed 2009-03-08). was an advocate of progressive Republicanism. The new owners presented a variety of viewpoints, including Darling cartoons that frequently made fun of progressive politicians.Editorial Cartoons of J.N. 'Ding' Darling (Iowa Digital Library: University of Iowa Libraries) - Cartoons referencing or depicting progressivism or progressives (accessed 2009-03-09). During the Cowles family's ownership, the Registers editorial page philosophy was generally more liberal in its outlook than editorial pages of other Iowa newspapers, but there were notable exceptions. The publishers strongly supported Republican Wendell Willkie's 1940 presidential campaign against Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt.Herbert Strentz, \\"Gardner (Mike) Cowles, Jr.,\\" at Cowles Family Publishing Legacy, Drake University (accessed 2009-03-08). The newspaper also supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower's campaigns for the Republican nomination and general election in 1952, and again in 1956.

In October 2008, it endorsed Barack Obama for president in the general election.Register editorial board endorses Obama for President, Des Moines Register, 2008-10-25 (accessed 2009-03-08). In 2011, 24 days before the 2012 Iowa caucuses, the newspaper endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican Iowa Cucuses. The Register endorsed Romney over Obama ten days before the general election on October 27, 2012, the first time that it supported a Republican for president since 1972. On July 24, 2015, the newspaper announced that it had been denied press credentials to cover a Donald Trump presidential campaign family picnic in Oskaloosa, Iowa, because of an editorial the previous week that had called on Trump to drop out of the race. On January 23, 2016, it endorsed Republican Senator Marco Rubio for the GOP nomination and Hillary Clinton for the Democratic candidate. On October 13, 2018, the Register endorsed all Democratic candidates standing for the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections and stated that Republicans have \\"failed to govern.\\" On January 25, 2020, the newspaper endorsed Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren for her party's presidential nomination. ==Register and Tribune Syndicate== In 1922, Gardner Cowles' son John launched the Register and Tribune Syndicate. At its peak, the syndicate offered other newspapers some 60 to 75 features, including editorial cartoonist Herblock and commentaries by David Horowitz, Stanley Karnow, and others. The cartoons and comic strips included Spider-Man. Will Eisner's The Spirit was part of a 16-page Sunday supplement known colloquially as \\"The Spirit Section\\". This was a tabloid-sized newsprint comic book sold as part of eventually 20 Sunday newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. The most successful comics feature was The Family Circus, eventually distributed to more than 1,000 newspapers. In 1986, the Register and Tribune Syndicate was sold to Hearst and the King Features Syndicate for $4.3 million.Strentz, Herb. \\"John Cowles,\\" Cowles Family Publishing Legacy: Drake University, Cowles Library.

Formed by a political conversion of the former Warwick County, Virginia (1634-1952), it is now part of the independent city of Newport News, Virginia. ==History== Warwick River Shire, named for the Warwick River, was established in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I in 1634. Soon thereafter, it was renamed Warwick County, and eventually became one of the smaller and lesser populated counties in Virginia as the colony grew and after Virginia became a state. Warwick County remained a primarily farming area until the arrival of the Peninsula Extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in late 1881. At rural Newport News Point, on the harbor of Hampton Roads, a small community of farms was transformed into a major port for shipping coal. Virginia has had an independent city political subdivision since 1871. Newport News became an independent city in 1896 from Warwick County by an act of the Virginia General Assembly, one of the few cities in Virginia to have never been first incorporated as a town. An important feature of independent city status was that it guaranteed protection against annexation of territory by adjacent communities. In 1952, the remaining 71 sq mi (184 km¬≤) of Warwick County became an independent city. On July 1, 1958, after approval of voters in both jurisdictions, the City of Warwick was consolidated with the independent city of Newport News, reuniting the two communities legally and assuming the latter's name. At a ribbon cutting ceremony, the widow of Philip W. Hiden, the first mayor of Newport News to serve under a new City Council-City Manager form of government from 1920 to 1924 whose family developed the Hidenwood community Hidenwood Historical Marker in Newport News, VA joined the widow of Homer L. Ferguson, who had been a President of Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company and is credited with initiating development of Hilton Village, as the Guests of Honor. These elderly ladies helped formalize the reunification of the area which had previously been one single unit of local government from 1634 to 1896. The union formed the third largest city in Virginia at the time with a area. It is one of the major cities of Hampton Roads which is linked by the Hampton Roads Beltway encircling the harbor of Hampton Roads. With the exception of several minor boundary adjustments with Elizabeth City County and York County, and the annexation by Newport News of the incorporated town of Kecoughtan (formerly in Elizabeth City County) in the 1920s, the boundaries of the city of Newport News as of 2008 are essentially those of Warwick River Shire when it was established in 1634. == See also == * Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia ==References== Category:Former municipalities in Virginia Category:History of Newport News, Virginia Category:Neighborhoods in Newport News, Virginia ","title":"Warwick, Virginia"},{"id":"1429232","text":"Fat Larry's Band was an American R&B; and funk band from Philadelphia, which enjoyed some commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly in the United Kingdom. ==Career== Formed by drummer and vocalist \\"Fat\\" Larry James (August 2, 1949 ‚Äì December 5, 1987) in 1976, the band included trumpeter/flautist Art Capehart, guitarists Ted Cohen and Tony Middleton, vocalists Freddie Campbell (1952 ‚Äì January 19, 2013) and Darryl Grant, saxophonist Doug Jones, bassist Larry La Bes, trombonist/alto saxophonist Jimmy Lee, and keyboardist Erskine Williams.

The opening drum break from \\"Down on the Avenue\\", from the band's first album, Feel It (WMOT Records, 1976), has been sampled by many musicians, including N.W.A, Ice-T, Jungle Brothers, Depeche Mode, and Run-D.M.C. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Feel It (1976) * Off the Wall (1978) * Spacin' Out (1978) * Lookin' for Love (1979) * Stand Up (1980) * Breakin' Out (1982) ‚Äì No. 58 UK * Tune Me Up (1983) * Straight from the Heart (1983) * Nice (1986) * The Best of Fat Larry's Band (1994) * Fat Larry's Band ‚Äì Greatest Hits (1995) * I Like Eating Chocolate ‚Äì Greatest Hits (1999) * Memories (2019) ===Singles=== *1976: \\"Center City\\" - No. 31 UK *1976: \\"Fascination\\" - No. 39 U.S. Dance *1977: \\"Peaceful Journey\\" - No. 94 U.S. R&B; *1978: \\"We Just Can't Get It Together\\" *1979: \\"Boogie Town\\" - No. 43 R&B;, No. 46 UK *1979: \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" - No. 44 U.S. R&B;, No. 39 U.S. Dance *1979: \\"Lookin' for Love\\" - No. 47 U.S. R&B; *1979: \\"Lookin' for Love Tonight\\" - No. 46 UK *1980: \\"Can't Keep My Hands to Myself\\" *1980: \\"How Good Is Love\\" - No. 78 U.S. R&B; *1982: \\"Act Like You Know\\" - No. 67 U.S. R&B;/Funk, No. 24 U.S. Dance *1982: \\"Be My Lady\\" *1982: \\"Traffic Stopper\\" *1982: \\"Zoom\\" - No. 2 UK, No. 10 AUS No. 89 U.S. R&B; *1983: \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" - No. 83 UK *1983: \\"Straight from the Heart\\" - No. 88 UK *1983: \\"Don't Let It Go to Your Head\\" - No. 93 UK *1986: \\"Nice\\" *1986: \\"Sunrise Sunset\\" *1986: \\"Teach Me (There Is Something About Love)\\" ==See also== *List of disco artists (F-K) *Post-disco *Ultimate Breaks and Beats ==References== Category:Musical groups from Philadelphia Category:Musical groups established in 1976 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:American funk musical groups Category:Stax Records artists ","title":"Fat Larry's Band"},{"id":"1429233","text":"E*Trade Financial Center, San Francisco E*TRADE Financial Corporation (stylized as E*TRADE), a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, offers an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets including common stocks, preferred stocks, futures contracts, exchange-traded funds, options, mutual funds, and fixed income investments. It also provides services for employee stock ownership plans, student loan benefit administration, advisor services, margin lending, online banking, and cash management services. The company has approximately 5.2 million retail brokerage accounts and a total margin receivables balance of $9.6 billion. The company receives revenue from interest income, commissions for order execution, payment for order flow, and management services. The company has 30 branches. ==History== In 1982, William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb founded TradePlus in Palo Alto, California, with $15,000 in capital. In 1991, Porter and Newcomb founded E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E*TRADE offered its trading services via America Online and Compuserve. In 1994, its revenues neared $11 million, up from $850,000 in 1992. By June 30, 1996, the company had 73,000 accounts and processed 8,000 trades per day, with quarterly revenue of $15 million. On August 16, 1996, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. In 2000, the company acquired Telebanc. In May 2001, the company acquired Web Street Securities for $45 million in stock. In January 2004, Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its TD Waterhouse discount brokerage with E*TRADE, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity. TD Waterhouse instead merged with Ameritrade to form TD Ameritrade. After the merger, E*TRADE continued talks to merge with TD Ameritrade but the two sides could not agree on price and governance rights. 2001 MetroCard advertisement for DLJdirect (later known as Harrisdirect prior to acquisition by E-Trade) In August 2005, the company acquired Harrisdirect (known under previous owners as DLJdirect and CSFBdirect) from Bank of Montreal. Two months later, E*TRADE acquired Brown & Company (aka BrownCo) from JPMorgan Chase for $1.6 billion in cash. As a result, E*TRADE closed its office in Rancho Cordova, California, on August 31, 2006 and terminated 500 employees. In July 2007, E*TRADE Australia, which was a separately operated company owned 6% by the company, was purchased by ANZ Bank for $432 million. On November 29, 2007, E*TRADE announced a transaction in which Citadel LLC invested $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for the company's securitized subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and second lien loans, as well as 12.5% senior unsecured notes, and 84,687,686 shares of common stock (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on the company's balance sheet. Citadel received a seat on the board of directors of the company and Mitch Caplan resigned as CEO. In November 2007, the company revoked the brand name license from SBI E*Trade Securities in Japan. In March 2008, E*TRADE named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E*TRADE's board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel LLC deal. In September 2008, the company sold its Canadian division to Scotiabank for CAD$444 million. In December 2009, Robert Druskin, a former chief operating officer of Citigroup was named interim CEO and chairman. On March 22, 2010, Steven Freiberg was named CEO. Freiberg was the former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of its credit card unit. On January 17, 2013, Paul T. Idzik was appointed CEO. Idzik had previously been Group Chief Executive of DTZ and also served ten years at Barclays bank. On September 12, 2016, E*TRADE acquired OptionsHouse for $725 million and leter that month Karl A.

In October 2020, the company was acquired by Morgan Stanley. ==\\"E*TRADE Baby\\" advertising campaign (2008-2014)== E*TRADE Baby was an integrated advertising campaign that featured a baby that talked about finance. The goal was to make the audience believe that E*TRADE was easy to use. The campaign, which appeared online, on television, and in print, was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group. At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work. In January 2008, during Super Bowl XLII, the company debuted advertisements featuring the baby, voiced by comedian Pete Holmes, discussing investing in an adult voice in front of a webcam. In February 2009, during Super Bowl XLIII, the company once again aired a 30-second advertisement featuring the baby, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube. As a result of the advertisement, the company realized a 19% increase in online applications and an 86% increase in website traffic in the week after the game. In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called ‚ÄúEnzo the Tailor‚Äù, in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany. In January 2013, the company aired an advertisement during Super Bowl XLVII featuring the baby. In the advertisement, the baby focuses on how much money is at stake in 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: \\"come to E*TRADE, and Save It\\". On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*TRADE baby via a commercial which aired during the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. ==See also== * Ajaxo Inc. v.

He served as the 20th Governor of Oklahoma from January 11, 1971 to January 13, 1975. Prior to winning election as governor, Hall served as county attorney for Tulsa County and as a law professor at the University of Tulsa. After leaving office, Hall was convicted of bribery and extortion. He became the first Oklahoma governor to be convicted of criminal acts committed during his tenure. He served 19 months of a three-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Safford.100 Years of Oklahoma Governors Biography ==Early life== David Hall was born in Oklahoma City, and was the son of William Arthur \\"Red\\" Hall and Aubrey Nell French. Hall attended Classen High School in Oklahoma City, where he played on the 1948 Class A high school basketball State Championship team. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Oklahoma in 1952; he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Hall was a member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps in college and after graduating he joined the United States Air Force. He completed his initial training at Lackland Air Force Base, then was assigned as a flight navigation instructor at San Marcos Air Force Base in Texas. Hall served until 1954, when he transferred to the Air Force Reserve, in which he served until 1956. He attended Harvard Law School for a year, then transferred to the University of Tulsa College of Law, from which he graduated in 1959. From 1959 to 1962, he served as assistant county attorney for Tulsa County, Oklahoma, and as county attorney from 1962 to 1967. From 1968 to 1971, he served as a law professor at the University of Tulsa. ==Governor of Oklahoma== In the 1966 election, Hall finished a close third in the Democratic primary for governor. Four years later, he defeated incumbent Republican Governor Dewey F. Bartlett in the closest gubernatorial election in state history, and took office only after a recount confirmed his victory. As governor, he championed education and transportation issues. His administration issued a landmark public policy analysis book of Oklahoma's education system entitled \\"Measuring up and Moving On.\\" Hall and his appointees to the state highway commission and turnpike authority were committed to expanding the state's roads. During his term as governor, the state drastically expanded the vocational technical (later renamed career-tech) system of facilities offering low or no cost training certificates for residents. As governor, he signed into law the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, which enacted Oklahoma's income tax code. Hall's administration and policy initiatives were opposed and attacked on a regular basis by the state's largest newspaper, the Daily Oklahoman, and its powerful publisher, billionaire Edward Gaylord. Gaylord had supported Hall's opponent, former Governor Dewey Bartlett. ==Unsuccessful re-election bid== Hall was unsuccessful in his quest for re-election in the 1974 election. He obtained only 27 percent of the vote, a third-place finish in the Democratic primary. He trailed U.S. Congressman Clem McSpadden and State Representative and Oklahoma Baptist University professor David Boren, who eventually won the nomination (in a runoff) and the general election over Republican Jim Inhofe. == Charges and retirement == Three days after leaving office in 1975, Hall was indicted on federal racketeering and extortion charges, in a conspiracy involving Hall and Oklahoma Secretary of State John Rogers willfully steering State of Oklahoma employee retiree funds to investment funds controlled by Dallas, Texas, businessman W. W. \\"Doc\\" Taylor. At Hall's trial, Rogers testified that he became an informant after Hall offered him a bribe. Hall was convicted of bribery and extortion, and became the first Oklahoma Governor to be convicted of criminal acts committed during his tenure. After exhausting all appeals, he served 19 months of a three-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Safford. (John Ehrlichman, of Watergate fame, was also housed at the same time at Safford.) Upon his release from prison in 1978, he was disbarred by the Oklahoma Bar Association, which effectively prevented him from practicing law in Oklahoma. Leaving the public spotlight, he moved to La Jolla, California, where he worked in real estate and other ventures. == Return to Oklahoma == On February 13, 2007, Hall made his first appearance in the state of Oklahoma since he left office over thirty years before. He appeared at the Oklahoma History Center to help launch a new exhibit that features all of the Governors of the State of Oklahoma. Hall remarked that it was \\"like coming back to heaven.\\" He authored a memoir, 2012's Twisted Justice: A Memoir of Conspiracies and Personal Politics which features his recollections of his time in office, and his reflections on his prison sentence and subsequent career.Chris Casteel, News OK, Former Oklahoma Gov. David Hall's Book Tells His Side of the Bribery Story, February 3, 2012 == Death == Hall died at a San Diego area hospital on May 6, 2016. He had earlier been implanted with a pacemaker and had expected to be discharged, but then developed a blood clot that ultimately went to his brain and caused a fatal stroke.Rick Green, \\"Former Oklahoma Gov.

Daystar is headquartered in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex in Bedford, Texas. ==History== In 1984, Marcus and Joni Lamb (n√©e Trammel) moved to Montgomery, Alabama to launch the state's first full-power Christian television station, WMCF-TV. The Lambs built the station for the next five years, and sold it in 1990 to the Trinity Broadcasting Network. They next moved to Dallas, Texas, where, in 1993, they purchased the formerly defunct KMPX. In 1996, with a large contribution from Kenneth Copeland Ministries, the Lambs purchased a station in Colorado, officially turning their television ministry into a network. In August 1997, the small staff moved into a facility that included production studios; Daystar was officially launched on New Year's Eve 1997. On March 21, 2011, Daystar announced that it would downsize its production studios in Ashland, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; and Denver, Colorado, effective the following month; the facilities would continue to be used as transmitters, but not broadcasting centers. This, with studios now run by a limited technical staff, led to the layoff of an unknown number of Daystar employees. ==Controversies== ===FCC investigation=== In 2003, Daystar was investigated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), centering on allegations that Daystar sold air time on its non-commercial educational stations to for-profit groups. The investigation complicated Daystar's US$21.5 million bid for KOCE-TV, a PBS station in Huntington Beach, California which at the time mainly served the suburban area of Orange County, and other license renewals. After a lengthy process, Daystar and KOCE-TV eventually came to an agreement where Daystar leased a digital subchannel of KOCE, and broadcast network programming over KOCE-DT3 into Orange County and the Los Angeles area. This agreement remained in place , with KOCE since becoming the flagship Los Angeles area member station of PBS in January 2011, replacing KCET after that station defected from the network. On December 22, 2008, the FCC and Daystar entered into an agreement whereby Daystar would continue to utilize a multi-level review process for all content aired and would make additional good faith efforts to review all content received from external providers before broadcasting it on Daystar's non-commercial educational stations. Daystar agreed to make a voluntary contribution of $17,500 to the United States Department of Treasury.Consent Decree between FCC and Daystar. Retrieved on December 23, 2008. On March 13, 2012, the FCC questioned whether Daystar, through associated nonprofit companies, was qualified to purchase former PBS outlets KWBU-TV in Waco, Texas (which was renamed KDYW) and WMFE-TV in Orlando, Florida. The WMFE deal was canceled two days later; the station was later resold and returned to PBS as WUCF-TV. On September 7, 2012, KDYW's licensee, the Brazos Valley Broadcasting Foundation, informed the FCC that it would request the dismissal of the license assignment application and the cancellation of the KDYW license, with the cancellation becoming final on September 27. ===Israel=== Daystar faced controversy in Israel when it became the first foreign Christian network to be given a broadcast license by its government in 2006. The announcement drew criticism from Jewish leaders in both Israel and the United States, who believed the network aimed at converting Israeli Jews through its numerous Messianic Jewish programs. In 2007, Israeli cable provider HOT announced it would drop Daystar from its lineup, stating that the decision was made after the company received complaints about Daystar's content. Daystar filed a petition with the Israeli Supreme Court to hear the case, accusing HOT of religious discrimination. Two years later, HOT reversed its decision and resumed carrying Daystar. ===Lawsuits=== On November 30, 2010, Marcus Lamb appeared on Celebration and admitted to having had an extramarital affair several years before, telling viewers that unidentified individuals had attempted to extort money from him over the incident. He said that he had since reconciled with Joni over the matter; the Lambs subsequently appeared on Good Morning America and Dr. Phil to discuss their experiences with marriage counseling.Televangelist says he cheated on wife, CNN.com, December 1, 2010. Lamb's confession sparked a series of legal actions against Daystar. Former Daystar executive Jeanette Hawkins filed a lawsuit against the network, claiming that her knowledge of the affair caused \\"great emotional pain\\". In February 2011, Jennifer Falcon, a former Daystar employee, filed a lawsuit claiming to have suffered sexual harassment, as well as demotion and defamation by the Lambs. The following month, Karen Thompson, a former producer for Joni, sued Daystar for wrongful termination, claiming to have been harassed and fired for dating a male co-worker. An October 2011 decision, entered after a contested hearing by a Dallas court, dismissed the Hawkins fraud claim. All of the suits were withdrawn two months later when Falcon and Thompson withdrew their suit against the network, and no parties received compensation for the dispute. ==Availability== Daystar is available on broadcast and cable television in the United States and worldwide on direct broadcast satellite systems such as DirecTV and Dish Network, and as an unencrypted Free to Air satellite channel. The network is composed of two VHF and 37 UHF television stations, which each broadcast all or part of Daystar's program lineup. Daystar owns a number of television stations in the U.S., either directly or through its parent company, Word of God Fellowship, Inc. On June 13, 2013, Daystar entered into a strategic partnership with Canadian-based religious network Grace TV, in which the network's non-Canadian content (constituting 65% of programming) would be supplied by Daystar. Additionally, Daystar picked up You Are Loved, a program hosted by Grace TV's CEO, Peter Youngren. The network ultimately re-branded as Daystar Canada.

The concept was originally proposed by Andrei Sakharov in 1967. ==Overview== Sakharov observed that many condensed matter systems give rise to emergent phenomena that are analogous to general relativity. For example, crystal defects can look like curvature and torsion in an Einstein‚ÄìCartan spacetime. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a world crystal model of spacetime in which the lattice spacing is of the order of a Planck length. Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background pseudo-Riemannian manifold (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any gravitational dynamics explicitly. This gives rise to an effective action which to one-loop order contains the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action with a cosmological constant. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge cosmological constants. Some argue that the particular models proposed by Sakharov and others have been proven impossible by the Weinberg‚ÄìWitten theorem. However, models with emergent gravity are possible as long as other things, such as spacetime dimensions, emerge together with gravity. Developments in AdS/CFT correspondence after 1997 suggest that the microphysical degrees of freedom in induced gravity might be radically different. The bulk space-time arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time. According to some prominent researchers in emergent gravity (such as Mark Van Raamsdonk) spacetime is built up of quantum entanglement. This implies that quantum entanglement is the fundamental property that gives rise to spacetime. In 1995, Jacobson showed that the Einstein field equations can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics applied at local Rindler horizons. Thanu Padmanabhan and Erik Verlinde explore links between gravity and entropy. The Einstein equation for gravity can emerge from the entanglement first law. ==See also== *AdS/CFT correspondence *Mark Van Raamsdonk *Abraham‚ÄìLorentz force *Beyond black holes *Entropic force *List of quantum gravity researchers *Gravitation *Entropic gravity == References == ==External links== *Carlos Barcelo, Stefano Liberati, Matt Visser, Living Rev.Rel. 8:12, 2005. *D.

He was educated in military preparatory schools in Kobe and Osaka and graduated from the 20th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1908, whereupon he was assigned to the IJA 28th Infantry Regiment. He graduated from the 28th class of the Army Staff College. ===Career in China=== In 1928, Sakai was stationed in Jinan, Shandong Province, China with the IJA 12th Infantry Regiment during the Jinan Incident and is believed by some Chinese historians to be responsible for the murder of Kuomintang army emissaries during negotiations on May 4, 1928. He was transferred to the Tientsin Garrison from 1929 to 1932. In 1932, Sakai was promoted to colonel and was assigned to the 5th Section military intelligence of the 2nd Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1932 to 1934. As Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Garrison Army from 1934 to 1935, Sakai orchestrated a series of armed conflicts, which resulted in an armistice with the Chinese government which resulted in the He‚ÄìUmezu Agreement which effectively gave Japan control of Hebei Province. He became commander of the IJA 23rd Infantry Regiment in 1936. Sakai was promoted to major general in 1937 and was appointed commander of the IJA 28th Infantry Brigade. He became a lieutenant general in 1939, and was assigned to the Coordination Bureau, Asia Development Group, Mengjiang Board from 1939 to 1940. He was also assigned to the Mongolia Garrison Army at this time. Recalled to Japan in 1940, Sakai was briefly appointed commander of the Imperial Guards Depot Division. ===World War II=== Sakai was commander of the IJA 23rd Army stationed in Canton in November 1941. He was ordered to use the IJA 38th Division, which was normally under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group to capture Hong Kong, and was given a 10-day time limit. On December 8, 1941, a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces commanded by Sakai, and his Chief of Staff Tadamichi Kuribayashi, invaded Hong Kong. However, the subsequent Battle of Hong Kong did not proceed as quickly or as smoothly as Sakai had planned, and he was forced to request an extension to his deadline. Sir Mark Young, the Governor of Hong Kong, surrendered all British forces in Hong Kong on Christmas Day, after 18 days of fighting. Sakai‚Äôs frustrations over the unexpectedly strong British resistance may have been reflected by the extreme brutality which characterized the campaign and subsequent occupation.Budge, Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Sakai served as Japanese Governor of Hong Kong until February 20, 1942. He was recalled to Japan, and retired from active service in 1943.Fuller, Shokan, Hirohito‚Äôs SamuraiHe was recalled to active service in February 1945, and was ordered to go to Beijing; however, the war came to an end before he departed Japan. ===Execution=== After the end of the war, Sakai was apprehended by the American occupation authorities at the request of the Chinese government and was extradited to China, where he was accused of war crimes. He was convicted at the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal on August 27, 1946 of command responsibility for the extrajudicial murder of Chinese civilians and was executed by firing squad on September 30.Stein, Trial of Takashi Sakai == References == === Footnotes === === Sources === ; Books * * ==External links== * * * Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:1887 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Japanese occupation of Hong Kong Category:Japanese people convicted of war crimes Category:Executed military personnel Category:Executed Japanese people Category:People executed by the Republic of China by firing squad Category:Japanese people executed abroad Category:Governors of Hong Kong Category:People executed for war crimes Category:Military personnel from Hiroshima Prefecture Category:20th-century Hong Kong people Category:Heads of state convicted of war crimes ","title":"Takashi Sakai"},{"id":"1429255","text":"Save the Children Australia is an aid and development agency dedicated to helping children in Australia and overseas. It is an independent, not-for- profit and secular organisation. Save the Children Australia is a member of the Save the Children Association (registered in Geneva, Switzerland), a group of 30 organisations sharing a global vision and strategy for improving the lives of children worldwide. Save the Children Australia, and the other members of the Save the Children Association, focus on responding to humanitarian emergencies, reducing infant and child mortality, protecting children from violence, and ensuring all children have access to a quality basic education. In 2014, Save the Children Australia responded to 18 humanitarian emergencies, and ran 149 projects that reached 12 million people in 29 countries. ==History== Save the Children was founded in England by Eglantyne Jebb, a teacher and sociologist, in 1919. Known then as the International Save the Children Fund, the organisation's first goal was to supply food to starving children in Austria immediately after World War I. Jebb had a strong vision and dedication to children's rights and developed five directives that she believed were the fundamental rights of every child. She lobbied the League of Nations until they adopted these rights in 1924. They have since formed the basis of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1959) and inspired the current Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990). These rights remain the foundation of Save the Children's vision and values. In the same year, Save the Children began in England, its first Australian branch was opened by Cecilia John in Melbourne, Australia, to assist refugees affected by war in Europe. This was soon followed by branches opening in Queensland in 1920 and South Australia in 1922. Over the next 50 years, more branches were established in every state across Australia to assist children in Europe and the Middle East. In 1951, the health and education of children in Australia became a priority for Save the Children branches across the country. Welfare centres and pre-schools for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Victoria were among the first of its Australian programs. In 2004, the branches started a process of consolidation to create a single, national organisation called Save the Children Australia. On 20 May 2015, Save the Children Australia and Good Beginnings Australia announced their plans to merge. Good Beginnings Australia specialises in providing early intervention and practical parenting programs for children and their families in disadvantaged communities. The merger came into force on 1 July 2015 and Good Beginning Australia's programs are now part of Save the Children Australia. ==Structure== Save the Children Australia's national office is located in Melbourne, Victoria. It also has regional offices in Queensland, Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory, running programs and events that support communities at a local level. Save the Children Australia is a member of the Save the Children Association, a group of 30 child-focused organisations supporting children in more than 124 countries. The members of the Save the Children Association work through a single operational structure, Save the Children International (registered in London, United Kingdom), when implementing projects internationally. Save the Children Australia's international projects, except for those in the Pacific, are implemented through Save the Children International and local Save the Children partners. ==Humanitarian emergencies== A large part of Save the Children Australia's work is responding to emergencies in Australia and overseas, providing humanitarian aid such as water, food, shelter, temporary learning spaces and emotional support for children. In 2014, Save the Children Australia responded to 18 humanitarian crises and reached 808,000 people. In 2015, Save the Children Australia has responded to Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu (March) and the Nepal earthquakes (April/May), as well as continuing its response to longer term emergencies such as the South Sudan Crisis and the Syria Crisis. ==Programs== Save the Children Australia runs development programs across Australia and overseas, with a particular focus on Asia and the Pacific. The agency partners with local non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community- based organisations, local and national governments, and international non- governmental organisations (INGOs) to deliver projects in-country. ===International programs=== In 2014, Save the Children Australia reached more than 12 million children and adults in 29 countries focusing on: * Fighting inequality * Helping children in emergencies * Protecting children from harm * Providing education * Providing healthcare * Tackling climate change * Standing up for child rights ===Australian programs=== In 2014, Save the Children Australia reached more than 34,000 Australian children and adults in more than 150 sites across the country, focusing on: * Helping children in emergencies * Helping children learn * Protecting children from harm ==Advocacy and campaigns== In addition to its humanitarian and development programs, Save the Children Australia campaigns for long-term change to improve children's lives. ===Australian aid=== Save the Children Australia supports the Campaign for Australian Aid, which is a joint initiative of the Make Poverty History and Micah Challenge coalitions. There have been successive cuts made to Australia's foreign aid budget, reducing Australia's national contribution to international development. The campaign aims to create a movement of people pushing for a stronger commitment to foreign aid from the Australian government. ===Children in detention=== Australia has a policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers, including children. Save the Children Australia's Kids in Detention campaign calls for children and the families to be immediately released from immigration detention. ==Fundraising== Save the Children fund-raises from the public through regular giving propositions such as I Save the Children and Children in Crisis, as well as single appeal donations. It also has a number of community fundraising initiatives such as Run to Save and fundraising in celebration. In 2015, Save the Children Australia launched its inaugural Christmas in July fundraising campaign. ==Op Shops== Save the Children Australia has Op Shops in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. It also has an online shop. ==Nauru Detention Centre== In October 2012, Save the Children began providing services to children at the Australian Government‚Äôs offshore asylum seeker detention centres, first on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and then on Nauru at the Nauru Detention Centre in August 2013. Services are no longer provided on Manus Island, following the removal of children from detention there. In Nauru, Save the Children Australia provides welfare, education and recreation services to asylum seekers in the detention centre. On 2 October 2014, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) issued Save the Children Australia with a notice of the removal of nine members of staff after claims the aid workers were coaching detainees to self- harm and fabricate abuse claims to achieve evacuations. An independent review into the allegations was carried out by former Integrity Commissioner Philip Moss. The review was released on 20 March 2015 and found no evidence to support the allegations against the nine Save the Children staff members. The child rights agency reported that it was \\"deeply troubled\\" by the evidence provided in the report supporting claims of sexual and physical assaults against children and adults in mandatory immigration detention on Nauru. The agency's CEO, Paul Ronalds, stated that \\"there was never any need for fabrication or exaggeration by Save the Children staff ‚Äì the evidence is clear.\\" A week after the release of the Moss Review, the Australian Senate announced an inquiry into the review's findings. Save the Children Australia's submission to the inquiry calls on the Australian government to eliminate prolonged and mandatory detention of children and work towards a genuine regional framework that protects children fleeing conflict and persecution. ==Accountability== The Board of Save the Children Australia delegates the responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the company to its chief executive officer (CEO) who, together with its Executive team, is accountable to the Board. The role of Save the Children Australia's CEO and its chairman are separate. With a maximum of 14 directors, Save the Children Australia must have at least one director resident in each State. Each year, the Save the Children Australia publishes an Annual Report, detailing successes and challenges in its programs, governance, financial statements and an independent auditor's report. In 2014, for every dollar donated to Save the Children Australia, 84 cents was invested in its development, campaigning and humanitarian response programs; 9 cents was spent on fundraising; 5 cents was spent on staff, infrastructure and systems; and 2 cents was invested in commercial activities such as its retail stores. Save the Children Australia is a member of the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct. ==See also== * Save the Children * Save the Children International * Save the Children USA * Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report * Declaration of the Rights of the Child * Convention on the Rights of the Child ==References== ==Further reading== * Clare Mulley, \\"The Woman Who Saved the Children: A biography of Eglantyne Jebb, Founder of Save the Children\\" (Oneworld Publications, 2009) . ==External links== * Save the Children Australia website * Save the Children Australia ‚Äì Latest News * Save the Children Australia ‚Äì Online Shop * Save the Children International website * Good Beginnings Australia website * Campaign for Australian Aid Category:1919 establishments in Australia Category:Organizations established in 1919 Category:Organisations based in Melbourne Australia Category:Children's charities based in Australia Category:Organisations serving Indigenous Australians Category:Non-profit organisations based in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Save the Children Australia"},{"id":"1429261","text":"\\"Four on the floor\\" on the bass drum and Four-on-the-floor (or four-to-the- floor) is a rhythm pattern used primarily in disco and electronic dance music.

Sometimes the term is used to refer to a 4/4 uniform drumming pattern for any drum.Miller, Michael. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing Drums, 2004. A form of four-on-the- floor is also used in jazz drumming. Instead of hitting the bass drum in a pronounced and therefore easily audible fashion, it is usually struck very lightly (referred to as \\"feathering\\") so that the sound of the drum is felt instead of heard by the listener. Typically, this is combined with a ride cymbal and hi-hat in syncopation. When a string instrument makes the rhythm (rhythm guitar, banjo), all four beats of the measure are played by identical downstrokes. In reggae drumming, the bass drum usually hits on the third beat but sometimes drummers play four on the floor. Sly Dunbar from Sly and Robbie was one of the reggae drummers who played mostly in this style. Also Carlton Barrett from Bob Marley and the Wailers played four on the floor on several hits by the Wailers like \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Exodus\\". In reggae, four on the floor usually goes by the hand with a low end and powerful bassline. Four on the floor can be found in more modern reggae derivative styles such as dancehall, while it is less common to find it in roots reggae. In the roots context, it is generally referred to as a \\"steppers\\" rhythm. == References == Category:Electronic dance music Category:Disco Category:Rhythm and meter ","title":"Four on the floor (music)"},{"id":"1429265","text":"Sony Entertainment Television (abbr.

He was born at Ratzeburg. Entering the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1843, he soon began to devote his attention to the history of the German language and literature, and in 1848 went to Munich, where he remained five years, and diligently availed himself of the use of the government library for the purpose of prosecuting his historical studies. In 1856 he was appointed secretary of the German museum at Nuremberg, and in 1859, keeper of the manuscripts. With the aid of the manuscript collections in the museum he now turned his attention chiefly to political history, and, with Johann H. M√ºller, established a historical journal under the name of \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsche Kulturgeschichte\\" (4 vols., Nuremberg, 1856-1859). To this journal he contributed a history of German taxation and commerce. On the latter subject he published separately Geschichte des deutschen Handels (2 vols., Leipzig, 1859-1860) and Die Hansa als deutsche See- und Handelsmacht (Berlin, 1862). In 1862 he was appointed secretary of the state archives at Dresden, and, a little later, keeper. There he began the study of Saxon history, still devoting his attention chiefly to the history of commerce and economy, and published Die Geschichte des Kurf√ºrsten August von Sachsen in volkswirthschaftlicher Beziehung (Leipzig, 1868) and Geschichte des deutschen Zollwesens (Leipzig, 1869).

Tracing its origins to the birth of video art in the 1970s, it has increased in popularity as digital video production technology has become more readily accessible. Today, video installation is ubiquitous and visible in a range of environments‚Äîfrom galleries and museums to an expanded field that includes site-specific work in urban or industrial landscapes. Popular formats include monitor work, projection, and performance. The only requirements are electricity and darkness. One of the main strategies used by video-installation artists is the incorporation of the space as a key element in the narrative structure. This way, the well-known linear cinematic narrative is spread throughout the space creating an immersive ambient. In this situation, the viewer plays an active role as he/she creates the narrative sequence by evolving in the space. Sometimes, the idea of a participatory audience is stretched further in interactive video installation. Some other times, the video is displayed in such a way that the viewer becomes part of the plot as a character in a film. A pioneer of video installation was Korean/American Nam June Paik whose work from the mid-sixties used multiple television monitors in sculptural arrangements.Edith Decker-Phillips, Paik Video, ed. George Quasha (Station Hill Arts, Barrytown, Ltd.: Barrytown, New York, 1998). Paik went on to work with video walls and projectors to create large immersive environments. Wolf Vostell is another pioneer of video installation. He showed his 6 TV D√©-coll/ageWolf Vostell, 6 TV D√©-coll/age, 1963 in 1963 at the Smolin Gallery in New York. Other Americans include Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Tony Oursler. Bill Viola is considered a master of the medium. His 1997 Survey at the Whitney Museum in NY, along with the 1994-95 Gary Hill survey created by the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle, and traveling to Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles and Kansas City, amounted to a watershed mark in the history of video installation art marking both a period on the sentence of the first generation and a beginning of the next. Gary Hill, another master of the medium, has created quite complex and innovative video installations using combinations of stripped down monitors, projections and a range of technologies (from laser disk to DVD and new digital devices) so that the spectator can interact with the work.An Art of Limina: Gary Hill‚Äôs Works and Writings, George Quasha & Charles Stein ( Barcelona: Ediciones Pol√≠grafa, 2009); also: Chrissie Iles, Into the Light: The Projected Image in American Art 1964-1977, p. 55. For instance in the 1992 piece Tall Ships, commissioned by Jan Hoet for Documenta 9, the audience enters a dark hall-like space where ghostly images of seated figures are projected onto a wall.George Quasha and Charles Stein. Tall Ships: Gary Hill‚Äôs Projective Installations‚ÄîNumber 2. Barrytown, NY: Station Hill Arts, 1997. Also: Gary Hill. Amsterdam: Stedelijk Museum and Vienna: Kunsthalle, Wien, 1993. The approach of a viewer causes a seated figure to stand up and move forward toward the viewer, creating an eerie effect of the dead in the underworld (rather suggestive of Odysseus' descent into the Underworld in The Odyssey). Tony Oursler's work exploited the technology developed in the early 1990s of very small video projectors that could be built into sculptures and structures as well as improvements in image brightness so that images could be placed on surfaces other than a flat screen. David Hall and Tony Sinden exhibited the first multi-screen installation in Britain, 60 TV Sets, at Gallery House, London in 1972. Subsequently British video installation developed a distinctive pattern following the seminal international Video Show at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1975, and later thanks in part to the existence of regular festivals in Liverpool and Hull and public galleries such as the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford that routinely showcased the work. Sam Taylor-Wood's early installation pieces are good examples where specially filmed elements are shown as a series of serial projections.

Struggling with his performances in the English Premiership, he went on loan back to Silkeborg IF, to aid their fight against relegation in the last part of the 2001‚Äì02 season. He returned to Bolton for the 2002‚Äì03 season and became an important part of the Bolton squad. At the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season he showed his versatility by playing at left-back in an emergency. He is known for his \\"peacock\\" goal celebration, a treat he developed with fellow Danish player Martin Retov. ===Hull City=== He left Bolton Wanderers in May 2007 and signed for Hull City on 13 August 2007. In an injury-hit season, he mainly played on the left of midfield when fit, and also deputised at left-back. In July 2008, Pedersen left Hull City, citing family reasons. ===Return to Silkeborg=== Having left Hull City Pedersen re-signed for his third stint at Silkeborg. ==Personal life== In Denmark he is known by his nickname, T√∏mrer, which means Carpenter.Gary Slater, Pedersen working to get Bolton out of the woods, UK Telegraph, accessed 11 October 2008 He remains popular in England with Bolton due to his six-year spell there.

Although isolated from most of the major centers of musical activity, he was a polished composer in the style of Lassus and penned an extremely influential treatise on the rhetorical application of compositional devices. ==Life== Nucius was born in G√∂rlitz, in Lower Silesia. He studied at the Gymnasium in G√∂rlitz with Johannes Winckler, who was so influential in his development that he referred to him reverentially in his later writings. In 1586 he became a monk in the monastery in Rauden, in Upper Silesia; there he received a humanistic education to supplement the considerable musical training he had received under Winckler. He rose in the hierarchy at the monastery, becoming a deacon, and later an abbot at Himmelwitz; however in 1598 he turned over most of his duties to his assistants in order to compose and write his musical treatise. He died at Himmelwitz (now Jemielnica, Poland), near the town of Strehlitz, in Upper Silesia (now Strzelce Opolskie, Poland). ==Works and influence== Nucius's music shows the influence of Lassus above all. He published two collections of motets, containing a total of 102 pieces, as well as several masses; his works were published in Prague and Liegnitz. The writing is homophonic but with an abundance of expressive devices, the exact application of which he later described in detail in his major treatise, . It was his which gained him his fame, and his resulting reputation lasted at least until the 18th century; this treatise was influential on three of the most famous German Baroque treatises of all, the (1618) of Michael Praetorius, the (1722-1723) of Johann Mattheson, and Johann Gottfried Walther's of 1732. is a guide to composition. It focuses primarily on counterpoint, and includes nine chapters, which cover topics as diverse as the definition of music, the definition of sound, intervals which are concords and discords, the proper succession of Consonance and dissonance, musical modes, cadences, composed versus improvised counterpoint, and proper techniques of composition for differing numbers of voices. The most famous chapter is the 7th, with its unique list of specific musical devices which can be used to express different feelings. It is the first in a German Baroque tradition of comparison of musical devices with rhetorical devices, an idea which was to be later expanded by Joachim Burmeister and Mattheson. Some of the devices named are: (passing note dissonances), (melodic imitation of varying kinds), (the repetition of a section for dramatic effect), climax (passages in parallel thirds or tenths), (the reprise of an opening passage at the end to make a cohesive statement), (the dramatic use of silence by inserting a sudden rest for rhetorical effect) (in this Nucius is one of the first music theorists to recognize the powerful musical use of silence, an idea which was to attain fame in modern times in the work of John Cage), and (syncopation, for rhythmic enhancement). All of these devices are presented with suggestions for their employment, with examples of texts they can set effectively. Nucius, though he represented an aspect of early Baroque practice, looked mainly to the past‚Äîand sometimes the distant past‚Äîfor his examples of rhetorical devices in music. He considered John Dunstaple to be the earliest composer of expressive music (though earlier music may not have been available to him), and other composers he wrote about included Gilles Binchois, Antoine Busnois, Johannes Ockeghem, Heinrich Isaac, Ludwig Senfl, Josquin des Prez, and of course Lassus. While some of his book is based on previous writings by Heinrich Glarean and Franchinus Gaffurius, the section on the rhetorical devices in music is original, and signifies the rapidly changing practice during the transitional period between Renaissance and Baroque styles. ==References and further reading== *George Buelow: \\"Johannes Nucius\\" and \\"Rhetoric and Music,\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

He played college football at East Carolina University. ==Early years== Smith attended Statesville High School. As a senior, he received All-state honors at defensive tackle in football and also in baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from East Carolina University. As a sophomore, he was a backup defensive lineman and posted 2 interceptions. As a junior, he was converted into an inside linebacker and became a starter, leading the team with 116 tackles. As a senior, he collected 118 tackles (led the team) and 2 interceptions. Smith finished his college career with 294 tackles, 4 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. In 2003, he was inducted into the East Carolina University Athletics Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== ===Atlanta Falcons=== Smith was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Falcons after the 1988 NFL Draft on May 2. On August 29, he was placed on the injured reserve list with an elbow injury. He was activated on November 5, but only played in 3 games. On December 10, he was placed on the injured reserve list for the last 2 weeks of the season. ===Pittsburgh Steelers=== On February 28, 1989, he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a Plan B free agent. He broke his right foot during preseason and was placed on the injured reserve list on August 29. ===Dallas Cowboys (first stint)=== Although he didn't have many regular season games, Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wannstedt remembered his playing days at East Carolina University, and signed him as a Plan B free agent on March 3, 1990. He played mainly on special teams. He replaced an injured Ken Norton, Jr. at weakside linebacker in the 15th game against the Philadelphia Eagles. That performance earned him his first career start and game MVP honors, in the team's next game against the Atlanta Falcons, when he had 11 tackles and recovered one fumble. He finished the season with 22 special teams tackles (second on the team), 23 defensive tackles, 2 fumble recovered and one forced fumble. In 1991, he started 12 games at weakside linebacker, although he contracted hepatitis, which forced the team to place him on injured reserve for 3 games (week 10 through week 12), and have Dixon Edwards replace him in the starting lineup. He registered 71 tackles (sixth on the team), one tackle for loss, 3 quarterback pressures, one pass defensed and one forced fumble. In 1992, he started 13 games at strongside linebacker, posting 69 tackles (fifth on the team), 3 tackles for loss, 13 special teams tackles (fourth on the team), one sack and one and one quearterback pressure. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXVII with him as a starter and contributing to the goal-line stand, that stopped the Buffalo Bills inside the Cowboys 1-yard line. On August 17, 1993, after defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt became the head coach for the Chicago Bears, he traded for Smith, linebacker Barry Minter and a sixth-round draft pick, in exchange for linebacker John Roper, tight end Kelly Blackwell and safety Markus Paul. ===Chicago Bears=== In 1993, he started 13 games at strongside linebacker and had 83 tackles, including 49 solo. In 1994, he played in 12 games (10 starts), he entered the season as the starter at strongside linebacker, but was limited with knee and ankle injuries that affected his production, finishing with 48 tackles, one sack and one forced fumble. He suffered a knee injury in the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and missed the next 2 games. He sprained his ankle in the fifth game against the Buffalo Bills and missed the next 2 games. He was replaced in the starting lineup with Ron Cox. On March 1995, the Bears signed him to a new two-year contract. He posted 111 tackles (fifth on the team), 4 sacks (tied for third on the team), one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. He had 14 tackles (12 solo) against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He had 10 tackles and one fumble recovery against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

He had 14 tackles against the Kansas City Chiefs. He had 10 tackles and one fumble recovery against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He missed the game against the San Diego Chargers with an ankle injury. ===Dallas Cowboys (second stint)=== On July 18, 1997, he signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys. His preseason performance allowed the team to release Alan Campos, keeping only 5 linebackers, with Smith backing up all three linebacker positions, in order to make room for cornerback Deion Sanders under the salary cap. He appeared in 14 games with 3 starts, missing 2 games with a broken jaw. He posted 22 tackles (8 solo), one sack, 14 special teams tackles (fifth on the team). He had 5 special teams tackles against the Carolina Panthers.

Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer (10 December 1790 - 26 April 1861) was a German Tyrolean traveller, journalist, politician and historian, best known for his controversial and long-disprovedDream Nation: Enlightenment, Colonization, and the Institution of Modern Greece, Stathis Gourgouris p.142-143Sociolinguistic Variation and Change, Peter Trudgill, p.131The Fragments of Death, Fables of Identity: An Athenian Anthropography, Neni Panourgia - Social Science - 1995, p. 28 discontinuity theory concerning the racial origins of the Greeks, and for his travel writings. == Biography == ===Education=== Fallmerayer was born the seventh of ten children in Pairdorf (), a village in Tsch√∂tsch () near Brixen in Tyrol. At the time of Fallmerayer's birth, the region was subject to the Habsburg Monarchy, in 1805 it became a part of Bavaria, and it is today located in Italy. His parents were small farmers. From the age of seven Fallmerayer attended the local school in Tsch√∂tsch and worked as a shepherd. In 1801 the family moved to Brixen, where Fallmerayer's father found employment as a day-laborer. Fallmerayer was enrolled in the Volksschule, where he impressed the priests with his talents. In 1803 he entered the cathedral school as a Gymnasiast, whence he was graduated in 1809 with a diploma in metaphysics, mathematics, and the philosophy of religion. (The Gymnasium in Brixen today bears Fallmerayer's name).http://www.schule.suedtirol.it/rg- bx/unsere%20Schule/stimmen_der_schueler.htm#Fallmerayer He then left Tyrol, at the time in the midst of a freedom struggle against Bavaria, for Salzburg. In Salzburg Fallmerayer found employment as a private tutor, and enrolled in a Benedictine seminary, where he studied classical, modern, and oriental philology, literature, history, and philosophy. After a year's study he sought to assure to himself the peace and quiet necessary for a student's life by entering the abbey of Kremsm√ºnster, but difficulties put in his way by the Bavarian officials prevented the accomplishment of this intention. At the University of Landshut (today the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich), to which he removed in 1812, he first applied himself to jurisprudence, but soon devoted his attention exclusively to history and classical and oriental philology. His immediate necessities were provided for by a stipendium from the Bavarian crown. ===Early career=== In the fall of 1813, in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, Fallmerayer decided to seek his fame in military service and joined the Bavarian infantry as a subaltern. He fought with distinction at Hanau on October 30, 1813, and served throughout the campaign in France. He remained in the army of occupation on the banks of the Rhine until the battle of Waterloo, when he spent six months at Orl√©ans as adjutant to General von Spreti. Two years of garrison life at Lindau on Lake Constance convinced him that his desire for military glory could not be fulfilled, and he devoted himself instead to the study of modern Greek, Persian and Turkish. Resigning his commission in 1818, he was engaged as a teacher of Latin and Greek in the gymnasium at Augsburg, where his students included the young Napoleon III. In Augsburg his liberal, anti-clerical, tendencies, which had already begun to develop during his student years, expressed themselves in opposition to the growing ultramontanism of the Bavarian state. In 1821 Fallmerayer accepted another position at the Progymnasium in Landshut, where he continued to teach classical languages, in addition to religion, German, history, and geography. Landshut was at the time still a great university city, and Fallmerayer took advantage of its resources to continue his study of history and languages. In February 1823 Fallmerayer learned of a prize offered by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to encourage research into the history of the Empire of Trebizond. This late medieval kingdom, located on the south coast of the Black Sea, was at the time known only through scattered references in Byzantine and Turkish chronicles. Fallmerayer began to collect additional sources in a number of languages, including Arabic and Persian, from libraries across Europe, and corresponded with various scholars, including Silvestre de Sacy and Carl Benedict Hase. In December of the same year Fallmerayer submitted the resulting manuscript to the Danish Academy, and in 1824 he was awarded the prize. Fallmerayer's study, the Geschichte des Kaisertums von Trapezunt, was however not published until 1827. Fallmerayer attempted to convert his success into professional advancement in the Bavarian educational system. In the fall of 1824 he was named Professor at the Landshut Gymanasium, but in a series of letters to the kings of Bavaria, first to Maximilian I and then, following his death, to Ludwig I, Fallmerayer requested further funding for his research and a position as a professor at the University of Landshut. These requests were however denied, perhaps on account of Fallmerayer's liberal political views. In 1826 the University of Landshut was moved to Munich, the capital of the Bavarian state, while the Munich Lyceum was moved to Landshut. Fallmerayer was named Professor of History at the latter institution. In the academic year 1826-27 he offered a lecture course on universal history. His inaugural lecture was marked, once again, by his anti- clericalism and reformist-liberal political views. He returned to these themes in his final lecture, in which he presented a vision of a unified Europe under \\"the rule of public virtues and of laws.\\"Er pr√§santiert dort seine Vision eines liberalen, geeinten Europas, das sich durch \\"Gerechtigkeit in der Staatsverwaltung nach unterdr√ºckender Willk√ºr, und die Herrschaft der √∂ffentlichen Tugenden und der Gesetze\\" auszeichne: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 45. These lectures, together with his distinctly \\"unpatriotic\\" lectures on Bavarian history, began to draw criticism from the more conservative elements of the academic establishment. In 1827 the Geschichte des Kaisertums von Trapezunt was finally published, and met with universal praise from its reviewers, including Barthold Georg Niebuhr and Carl Hase. The reaction of the Bavarian establishment was somewhat cooler, in part due to the book's preface. Here Fallmerayer had stated as a \\"law of nature\\" that the attainment of earthly power by priests leads to the \\"deepest degradation of the human race.\\"Folglich sei die \\"tiefste Erniedrigung des menschlichen Geschlechtes jedes Mal der H√∂hepunkt geistlicher Allmacht\\": Leeb, Fallmerayer, 49. ===The Greek theory=== Following the publication of his Trebizond study, Fallmerayer devoted his scholarly activities to another Greek region of the late Middle Ages, namely, the Morea. In particular, he developed his theory that the ancient, \\"Hellenic\\", population of the south Balkans had been replaced during the Migration Period by Arvanitic, Aromanian, Slavic and Turkic peoples, a theory which he advocated with characteristic zeal. The first volume of Fallmerayer's Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea w√§hrend des Mittelalters appeared in 1830, and he expressed his central theory in the foreword as follows: > The race of the Hellenes has been wiped out in Europe. Physical beauty, > intellectual brilliance, innate harmony and simplicity, art, competition, > city, village, the splendour of column and temple ‚Äî indeed, even the name > has disappeared from the surface of the Greek continent.... Not the > slightest drop of undiluted Hellenic blood flows in the veins of the > Christian population of present-day Greece.Das Geschlecht der Hellenen ist > in Europa ausgerottet. Sch√∂nheit der K√∂rper, Sonnenflug des Geistes, Ebenma√ü > und Einfalt der Sitte, Kunst, Rennbahn, Stadt, Dorf, S√§ulenpracht und > Tempel, ja sogar der Name ist von der Oberfl√§che des griechischen Kontinents > verschwunden.... auch nicht ein Tropfen echten und ungemischten > Hellenenblutes in den Adern der christlichen Bev√∂lkerung des heutigen > Griechenlands flie√üet: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 55. This phenomenon was further interpreted by Fallmerayer as an indication of the potential of the \\"Slavic\\" nations to overwhelm the \\"Latin\\" and the \\"German\\", a line of thought which he would later develop in his political writings. He further argued that the Great Powers who had supported the Greek War of Independence which was led by Arvanites and Aromanians had been led by a \\"classical intoxication\\" to misjudge the character of the modern Greek state. The Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea set Fallmerayer at loggerheads with the European Philhellenes in general, and with the Bavarian King Ludwig I in particular, a convinced Philhellene who already in 1829 had begun to advance the candidacy of his son, Otto, for the Greek throne (Otto became King of Greece in 1832). Ludwig's philhellenism was in fact grounded in the conviction that the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule represented the return of antique Hellenic virtue.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 58. Ludwig's displeasure with Fallmerayer led to a long delay in the confirmation of Fallmerayer's election to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The earliest scholarly reviews of Fallmerayer's work were likewise negative. He was accused of philological errors by the Slovenian linguist Jernej Kopitar, and of misreading the historical sources by the historians Johann Zinkeisen and Karl Hopf. Fallmerayer's ideas caused fierce reaction from various scholars of the newly established Greek state and triggered a search for continuity within Greek historiography, in an attempt to prove the existence of links between modern Greeks and the ancient Greek civilization.\\"Veloudis, Giorgos, 1982. Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer and the birth of the Greek historicism, Athens: Mnimon. On March 8, 2017, an international scientific research was published in the European Journal of Human Genetics, which proposed that, despite their genetical variations, the Greeks of Peloponnese are genetically connected with Sicilians and Italians of Southern Italy and have almost no connection with modern North Slavic DNA.Stamatoyannopoulos, George; Bose, Aritra; Teodosiadis, Athanasios; Tsetsos, Fotis; Plantinga, Anna; Psatha, Nikoletta; Zogas, Nikos; Yannaki, Evangelia et alii.

ISSN 1476-5438. ===Travels=== Inscription from Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer inside the Great Temple of Ramses II, Abu Simbel, Egypt Upset by the critical reaction to his Morea study, Fallmerayer resolved to travel abroad to collect material for the projected second volume. An opportunity presented itself when the Russian Count Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy arrived in Munich, seeking a learned companion for an eastward journey. Fallmerayer applied for and received a year-long leave from his teaching duties, and in August 1831 departed from Munich with Ostermann-Tolstoy. The two sailed first from Trieste to Alexandria, planning to arrive in Jerusalem by Christmas. Instead they remained in Egypt for nearly a year, leaving for Palestine in the summer of 1832. Early in 1833 they sailed for Constantinople by way of Cyprus and Rhodes. In November 1833 Fallmerayer finally set foot in the Morea, where the party remained for a month before travelling north to Attica. There Fallmerayer claimed he was struck by the preponderance of Arvanitika, an Albanian dialect. The party arrived in Italy in February 1834, and returned to Munich in August of the same year. Upon his return Fallmerayer discovered that the Landshut Lyceum had in the meantime been moved to Freising, and that his position had been eliminated. Behind this early \\"retirement\\" lay Fallmerayer's \\"known convictions, which, particularly in religious matters, are incompatible with the teaching profession.\\"Letter of Count Seinsheim to the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior, bekannte - besonders in religi√∂ser Hinsicht f√ºr den Lehrberuf nicht geeignete Gesinnungen: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 70. He was instead offered an Ordinarius position as a member of the Bavarian Academy, where his first lecture concerned the \\"Albanisation\\" of the population of Attica. His lecture was answered with an attack on his theories by Friedrich Wilhelm Thiersch, and the two opposing lectures led to a controversy in Munich academic circles, as well as in the popular press. The controversy had a pointedly political dimension, with Thiersch representing the \\"Idealpolitik\\" position, according to which Bavaria should support the Greek state, and Fallmerayer advocating a hands-off \\"Realpolitik.\\" This political polemic was further provoked by the preface to the second volume of Fallmerayer's Geschichte, published in 1836, in which he wrote that the Greek War of Independence was a \\"purely Shqiptarian (Albanian), not a Hellenic Revolution.\\"rein schkypitarische, nicht eine hellenische Revolution: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 74. He advocated furthermore the replacement of the German monarchy in Greece by a native regime. 1839 marked the beginning of Fallmerayer's career as a correspondent for the Allgemeine Zeitung, where he would continue to publish until his death. Fallmerayer's contributions to the AZ included travel essays, book reviews, political columns, and Feuilletons. Fallmerayer's sketch (1841) of the founding document of the Dionysiou monastery, Mount Athos, with portraits of Emperor Alexios III of Trebizond and Empress Theodora. Fallmerayer soon after left the country again on account of political troubles, and spent the greater part of the next four years in travel, spending the winter of 1839-1840 with Count Tolstoy at Geneva. Between July 1840 and June 1842 Fallmerayer embarked on his second major journey, setting out from Regensburg and travelling along the Danube and across the Black Sea to Trapezunt. After long stays in Trapezunt, Constantinople, Athos- Chalkidiki and the rest of Macedonia, and Athens, he returned to Munich via Trieste and Venice. Fallmerayer published numerous reports from this journey in the AZ, in which he offered a mix of political observations, restatements and further developments of the Greek theory, and \\"charming descriptions of Anatolian and Turkish landscapes [that] bear comparison with the best examples of 19th-century Reisebilder (travel images).\\"Kindlers neues Literatur-Lexkion, vol. 5, p. 388. During his year-long stay in Constantinople (October 10, 1841 through October 24, 1842), Fallmerayer began to advocate European support of the Ottoman Empire as a bulwark against the growing influence of the Russian Empire in the Balkans.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 113. These articles were collected and published in 1845 as the Fragmente aus dem Orient, the work on which Fallmerayer's fame as a litt√©rateur largely rests. Fallmerayer's anti-Russian sentiments were not yet fully developed, and upon his return to Munich in 1842, he was befriended by the Russian poet and diplomat Fyodor Tyutchev. This latter had been entrusted by Karl Nesselrode and Alexander von Benckendorff to find a new spokesperson for Russian interests in Germany. Fallmerayer's Greek thesis had aroused interest in Russian circles, and it was perhaps for this reason that Tyutchev approached Fallmerayer and proposed that he should serve as a journalistic mouthpiece for Czarist policy. Fallmerayer declined, and it has indeed been suggested that his growing opposition to Russian expansionism was provoked by this encounter.R. Lauer, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer und die Slaven\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 133-34. By 1845, when the Fragmente were published, Fallmerayer's distrust of the Tsars had led him to a view of world-historical development that was opposed to the idealistic accounts of Hegel and of Fallmerayer's most vocal opponent, Thiersch. Instead of steady progress toward freedom, Fallmerayer perceived a fundamental polarity between \\"East\\" and \\"West\\": > For nearly eighteen aeons [√Ñonen], all history has been the result of the > struggle between two basic elements, split apart by a divine power from the > very beginning: a flexible life-process on the one side, and a formless, > undeveloped stasis on the other. The symbol of the former is eternal Rome, > with the entire Occident lying behind her; the symbol of the latter is > Constantinople, with the ossified Orient.... That the Slavs might be one of > the two world-factors, or if one prefers, the shadow of the shining image of > European humanity, and therefore that the constitution of the earth might > not admit philosophical reconstruction without their assent, is the great > scholarly heresy of our time.Alle Geschichte ist seit bald achtzehn √Ñonen > nur Resultat des Kampfes der beiden Grundelemente, in welche diese eine > g√∂ttliche Urkraft von Anbeginn auseinanderging: beweglicher Lebensproze√ü auf > der einen Seite und formlos unausgegorenes Insichverharren auf der andern. > Sinnbild des ersten ist die ewige Roma mit dem ganzen dahinterliegenden > Okzident, Sinnbild des andern Konstantinopel mit dem erstarrten > Morgenland.... Da√ü aber die Slaven der eine der beiden Weltfaktoren, oder > wenn man lieber will, der Schatten des gro√üen Lichtbildes der europ√§ischen > Menschheit seien und folglich die Konstitution des Erdbodens ohne ihr Zutun > im philosophischen Sinne nicht rekonstruiert werden k√∂nne, ist die gro√üe > wissenschaftliche H√§resie unserer Zeit: quoted in Kindlers neues Literatur- > Lexkion, vol. 5, p. 388. Certificate of honor, presented to Fallmerayer by the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I in 1848. Thiersch once more replied to these polemics in an article, also published in the AZ, arguing that the placement of western- European rulers on the thrones of the new Slavic states in the Balkans would be sufficient to prevent the rise of a \\"new Byzantine-Hellenic world empire.\\"Leeb, Fallmerayer, 114. Fallmerayer's essays in the AZ drew the attention of the Bavarian Crown Prince Maximilian, whose political views were significantly more liberal than those of his father. Between 1844 and 1847 Fallmerayer served Maximilian as a mentor, and occasionally as a private tutor, on historical and political questions.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 161-73. His analysis of Balkan politics, commissioned by Maximilian in 1844, is preserved.Titled Die gegenw√§rtigen Zustande der europ√§ischen Turkei und des freien K√∂nigreiches Griechenland (The present conditions of European Turkey and of the free Greek Kingdom), it is published in Thurnher, Jahre der Vorbereitung, 17-34. In May 1847 Fallmerayer set out on his third and final eastern journey, leaving from Munich for Trieste, whence he sailed to Athens, where he had an audience with King Otto. By June he had arrived in B√ºy√ºkdere, the summer residence of the Constantinople elite, where he remained for four months before travelling south to the Holy Land via Bursa and ƒ∞zmir. In January 1848 he sailed from Beirut back to ƒ∞zmir, where he stayed until his return to Munich. Fallmerayer's contributions to the AZ from this period emphasized the strength of Ottoman rule and reformist tendencies in the Turkish government, which he contrasted to the \\"desolate\\" condition of the Kingdom of Greece.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 116. ===1848=== Already in 1847 Ludwig I of Bavaria had initiated a liberal-leaning reform of the Bavarian educational system, and on February 23, 1848, he appointed Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer Professor Ordinarius for History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he was to replace the recently deceased Johann Joseph von G√∂rres.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 132-35. Fallmerayer, still in ƒ∞zmir, received the news in March and, completely surprised, returned immediately to Munich.Thurnher, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer in seiner und in unserer Zeit\\", in Thurner, ed., Fallmerayer, 13; Leeb, Fallmerayer, 135. Fallmerayer never offered a single class at the University, however, for on April 25, before the beginning of the summer semester, he was chosen as a Bavarian delegate to the Frankfurt Parliament, a product of the Revolutions of 1848.On the complicated political circumstances surrounding Fallmerayer's selection, see Leeb, Fallmerayer, 187-98. In May, Fallmerayer's former pupil Maximilian II, King of Bavaria since the abdication of his father in March, called on Fallmerayer to serve as his political advisor, in which role he served until the end of 1848.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 173-86. As the parliamentary debates turned in August toward the relationship between church and state, Fallmerayer assumed an uncompromising anti-clerical stance, and his reputation among the left delegates increased.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 203-4. In October he supported a series of motions put forward by the far-left faction.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 204-5. In January 1848 he again supported the far-left proposal according to which the new, united Germany was to be led by a democratically elected president.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 206. In June, finally, he followed the radical Rumpfparlament, which represented the last attempt to preserve the parliamentary structure that had been established in 1848, to Stuttgart.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 209-11. On the Rumpfparlament see the article in the German Wikipedia. The Bavarian regime had forbidden its delegates to participate in the Stuttgart Parliament, and following its forcible break-up on June 18 by W√ºrttembergian troops, Fallmerayer fled to Switzerland.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 211-13. In September 1849 his appointment to the faculty of the University of Munich was revoked by Maximilian II.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 140. In December 1849 the Bavarian members of the Stuttgart Parliament were offered amnesty, and in April 1850 Fallmerayer returned to Munich.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 214-15. ===Late years=== Shortly after Fallmerayer's return to Munich, in November 1850, the Munich Professor Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis delivered an \\"explosive\\" lecture at a public session of the Bavarian Academy, where he denounced the arrival in Bavaria of a \\"philosophical Left\\", marked by liberalism and irreligiosity, that viewed all religion as a \\"pathological condition.\\" Fallmerayer was present at the lecture and viewed it as an opportunity to reenter the public sphere. His reply was published in January in the Leipzig Bl√§tter f√ºr literarische Unterhaltung, a liberal journal that had been founded by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus. There he not only responded to Ringseis' account, but furthermore expressed his general opinions on the function of academic institutions, and advocated the \\"Right to Free Research and Free Speech.\\"Recht der freien Forschung und freien Rede:Leeb, Fallmerayer, 147. He also made a number of unflattering remarks regarding Ringseis' personal appearance.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 143-149. Fallmerayer's tombstone, Alter S√ºdfriedhof, Munich. In reaction the ultramontanist party in Munich launched an organized offensive, in both the press and in official circles, to discredit Fallmerayer. An article published in the Tiroler Zeitung claimed that, as a result of unspecified transgressions committed in Athens, Fallmerayer had been punished by rhaphanidosis.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 155. The punishment, attested for ancient if not for modern Athens, involved the insertion of a radish into the offender's anus; see J. Davidson in the London Review of Books, August 24, 2000 (available online). On January 25, Peter Ernst von Lasaulx proposed the formation of a commission to consider Fallmerayer's expulsion from the Academy; despite a spirited defense of Fallmerayer by Leonhard von Spengel, the motion was passed with a vote of 10 to 8. The commission was formed in March, and while it declined to expel Fallmerayer, resolved to compose an official rebuke, which was published in the AZ on March 12.Leeb, Fallmerayer,150-54. In his last decade Fallmerayer continued to publish a stream of political and cultural articles, in particular in the journals Donau and Deutsches Museum. With the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, Fallmerayer's activity as correspondent for the AZ once more increased.Leeb, Fallmerayer, 93. In this conflict he naturally supported the European-Ottoman coalition against the Czar.Brief account in Lauer, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer und die Slaven\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 156-57. He also returned to more academic pursuits, devoting particular attention to a series of publications on the medieval history of Albania. Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer died in Munich on April 26, 1861, as a result of weakness of the heart.Leeb, Fallmerayer, xxvi. The last entry in his diary, written the previous evening, reads Fahle Sonne (meaning \\"pale sun\\").E. Thurnher, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 15. == Contributions == Fallmerayer is considered one of the great 19th-century intellectuals in the German-speaking world and was adored by the Nazi regime.Jakob Philpp Fallmerayer geh√∂rt zu den gro√üen Geistern des 19. Jahrhunderts im deutschsprachigen Raum: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 1. He is remembered as \\"a co-founder of Byzantine studies, as discoverer of the divisive Greek theory, as a prophet of the world-historical opposition between Occident and Orient, and finally as a brilliant essayist.\\"So gilt er als Mitbegr√ºnder der Byzantinistik... als Entdecker der umstrittenen Griechentheorie... als Prophet des welthistorischen Gegensatzes zwischen Okzident und Orient... und schlie√ülich als brillianter Essayist: Leeb, Fallmerayer, 1-2. Fallmerayer has been described as \\"one of the greatest German stylists,\\"Speck, \\"Philhellenism\\", 284 and the Fragmente aus dem Orient is a classic of German travel literature.Kindlers neues Literatur-Lexikon Vol. 5, pp. 387-88. Fallmerayer was one of three scholars (together with Gottlieb Lukas Friedrich Tafel and Georg Martin Thomas) who laid the foundation for Byzantinistik (Byzantine studies) as a self-sufficient academic discipline in Germany. Their achievements were crowned in the following generation by the establishment of the first German Lehrstuhl for Byzantinstik at Munich, whose first occupant was Karl Krumbacher.A. Hohlweg, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer und seine geistige Umwelt\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 47-52. On Fallmerayer's importance for the foundation of Byzantine studies, see also, e.g. C. Mango, \\"Byzantinism and Romantic Hellenism\\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 28 (1965), 40. Among Fallmerayer's scholarly contributions to Byzantine studies, only the History of the Empire of Trebizond is still cited as an authority. His general characterization of Byzantine society has also on occasion been revived, most notably by Romilly Jenkins.R.J.H. Jenkins, Byzantium and Byzantinism (Cincinnati, 1963). Cf. C. Mango, \\"Romilly James Heald Jenkins (1907‚Äì1969)\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23 (1969), 7-13, esp. 9-10: \\"[Jenkins] saw that Byzantium was, on the one hand, the direct ancestor of Russian absolutism, both Czarist and Communist, and, on the other, of nearly everything that he found objectionable in modern Greece.... In this conclusion he had been anticipated by the great German scholar Jacob Philipp Fallmerayer, and to him he proceeded to pay homage in his two famous lectures Byzantium and Byzantinism. His Greek theory was already widely disputed in his lifetime, and is not accepted today. Its primary significance was as a \\"strong impetus for research in Byzantine as well as in modern Greek studies.\\"starke Impulse f√ºr die byzantinistische ebenso wie f√ºr die neogr√§zistische Forschung: Hohlweg, \\"Fallmerayer\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 65. For a contemporary assessment of the theory, cf. ibid., 64: \\"His theory is indeed not entirely false, that is to say, it contains a grain of truth. Only its statement in general and absolute terms, to which Fallmerayer so stubbornly adhered, is false... There were indeed Slavic incursions into Greece and the Peloponnese, but not of the magnitude and also not with the consequences that were alleged by Fallmerayer.\\" (Seine theorie ist ja nicht g√§nzlich falsch, d.h. sie enth√§lt einen historischen Kern. Nur die Verallgemeinerung und Verabsolutierung, an welcher Fallmerayer so hartn√§ckig festgehalten hat, ist falsch.... Zwar hat es Slaveneinf√§lle in Griechenland und auf der Peloponnes gegeben, aber nicht in dem Ma√üe und auch nicht mit den Konsequenzen, wie Fallmerayer das behauptet hat.) Early criticisms were published by the Slovene scholar Jernej Kopitar,In K. Hopf, ed., Geschichte Griechenlands vom Beginn des Mittelalters bis auf unsere Zeit (Leipzig, 1867-68). Friedrich Thiersch, Johann Wilhelm Zinkeisen,J.W. Zinkeisen, Geschichte Griechlands vom Anfage geschichtlicher Kunde bis auf unsere Tage Vol. 1 (Leipzig, 1832). and by George Finlay.G. Finlay, History of the Byzantine Empire, numerous editions (e.g. London, 1908). In general on the early reception of Fallmerayer's theor by Western European scholars, see Veloudis, \\"Fallmerayer\\", 67. Fallmerayer's work played a decisive role in the development of Byzantine history as a discipline in Greece, where a number of late 19th- and early 20th-century scholars sought to disprove the thesis of Greek racial discontinuity (notable examples include Kyriakos Pittakis and Constantine Paparrigopoulos; Paparrigopoulos demonstratedŒ†ŒµœÅŒØ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ Œ£ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÑŒπŒΩœéŒΩ œÜœÖŒªœéŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ†ŒµŒªŒøœÄœåŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒøŒΩ (in Greek) in 1843 that Fallmerayer's theory had many pitfalls).Veloudis, \\"Fallmerayer\\", 68-89. On account of his insistence on the Slavic origin of the modern Greeks, Fallmerayer was considered a pan-Slavist by many in Greece, a characterization which in any case stood in opposition to his actual writings on contemporary politics.Veloudis, \\"Fallmerayer\\", 65; Curta, \\"Dark-age Greece\\", 114. Fallmerayer's name eventually became \\"a symbol for hatred of the Greeks\\", and Nikos Dimou wrote (only partly in jest) that he had been raised to imagine Fallmerayer as a \\"blood-dripping Greek-eater\\" (Œ±ŒπŒºŒøœÉœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒÆ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒøœÜŒ¨Œ≥Œø).Symbol des Griechenhasses: Veloudis, \\"Fallmerayer\\", 89. Dimou: Cited in Speck, \\"Philhellenism\\", 292. In the twentieth century the charge of \\"neo-Fallmerayerism\\" was occasionally used by Greek scholars in an attempt to discredit the work of certain Western European scholars, including Cyril Mango, whose work bore no actual relation to Fallmerayer's.Veloudis, \\"Fallmerayer\\", 90. (The charge was also heard outside of Greece, for example, in the course of a debate between Kenneth Setton and Peter Charanis.Setton accused Charanis of reviving Fallmerayer's theory. See the summary in Curta, \\"Dark-age Greece\\", 113-14.) The first modern Greek translation of Fallmerayer's work appeared in 1984.Curta, \\"Dark-age Greece\\", 114 and 136 n. 11: \\"The first Greek translation of Fallmerayer's work is (Athens, 1984).\\" Fallmerayer's account of the split between \\"Occident\\" and \\"Orient\\" hinged on his interpretation of the Russian Empire, which he perceived as a powerful blend of Slavic ethnic characteristics, Byzantine political philosophy, and Orthodox theology. Although he initially perceived this constellation with admiration, and viewed Russia as the potential savior of Europe from Napoleon, his view changed in the mid-1840s, perhaps as a result of his encounter with Fyodor Tyutchev, and he soon came to see Russia as the major threat to Western Europe. By the late 1840s he was convinced that Russia would conquer Constantinople and the Balkans, and perhaps further the Slavic lands of the Habsburg and Prussian Empires. In the mid-1850s he was overjoyed by the success of the European/Ottoman coalition in the Crimean War.R. Lauer, \\"Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer und die Slaven\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 154-57. Fallmerayer's account of East and West represented a crucial break from Hegel's idealistic philosophy of history,Lauer, \\"Fallmerayer\\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 155 and has been characterized as a precursor to Samuel P. Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" thesis.Aurenheimer, \\"Fallmerayer.\\" See also the critical response of Wenturis, \\"Bemerkungen.\\" == Political impact of Fallmerayer's racial theories == In the 1830s, philehellenes who had recently supported the creation of the modern Greek kingdom suspected political motivations in his writings; namely an Austrian desire for expansion southwards into the Balkans, and Austrian antagonism to Russian interests in the area reflected in his other writings. In this context, the calls by English and French intellectuals for a revival of \\"the glory that was Greece\\" were seen by Austrians in a very negative light, and any Austrian theory on the Greeks was looked on with suspicion by the philhellenes in the West. Fallmerayer was first among his contemporaries to put forward a ruthless Realpolitik on the Eastern Question and the expansionist designs of Czarist Russia. He was a Slavophobe and \\"argued vehemently that only a strong Ottoman State could prevent Russian expansion into Western Europe.\\" Danforth, Loring M., 1984. \\"The Ideological Context of the Search for Continuities in Greek Culture\\", Journal of Modern Greek Studies, (May 1984): 53-85. Fallmerayer's theory was popular as part of the Nazi propaganda in Axis occupied Greece (1941‚Äì1944) during World War II, when classically educated Nazi officers used it as an excuse to commit numerous atrocities against the Greek population. ==Selected works== *1827: Geschichte des Kaisertums von Trapezunt (History of the Empire of Trebizond) (Munich).

A native of San Francisco, California, he settled in Eugene, Oregon, where he entered politics. A Democratic politician, he served in the Oregon State Senate, as the Oregon State Treasurer, and one term as the 31st Governor of Oregon from 1975 to 1979. Like his perennial opponent for governor, Tom McCall, he was a noted environmentalist. ==Early life== Robert William Straub was born on May 6, 1920, in San Francisco. His parents were Thomas J. and Mary Tulley Straub, staunch Republicans. During World War II, he served in the Army's Quartermaster Corps. Straub earned a bachelor of arts degree from Dartmouth College in 1943, and then a masters of business administration from the school in 1947. Between degrees he married Pat Straub (n√©e Stroud) in 1943, and they had two sons and three daughters. In 1946, the family moved to Springfield, Oregon, when Straub accepted a job at the new Weyerhauser facility there. At Weyerhauser he worked with former classmate and later Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Richard Eymann. Straub also established a construction firm. He became independently wealthy by investing in the stock market, in real estate development, and trading in timber. ==Political career== He worked at his construction firm until beginning his political career when he was elected to the Lane County Board of Commissioners in 1954. Straub served on the commission from 1955 to 1959. He represented Lane County in the Oregon State Senate from 1959 to 1963. During his time in the senate, Straub established his reputation as an advocate for natural resource management and conservation. He was one of the state's first leaders to voice concern about air and water pollution. In 1964, Straub was elected to a four- year term as the Oregon State Treasurer. Two years later he ran unsuccessfully for the Governor's Office, losing to Tom McCall. As State Treasurer, Straub worked to create the Local Government Investment Pool and the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). He also opposed construction on U.S. Highway 101 planned for an area south of Tillamook where the highway was planned to go across the Nestucca River, up the sandspit past Cape Kiwanda along the ocean front. He helped lead those opposed to the plan and was able to get the highway built closer to its previous location inland. Straub served two terms in the office, from 1965 to 1973, and lost a second bid against McCall in 1970. ===Governor of Oregon=== McCall was prohibited by the state constitution from seeking a third consecutive term in the 1974 election. Straub was finally able to win the state's top job that year, defeating then- State Senator Victor G. Atiyeh, winning the largest margin in an Oregon gubernatorial race since 1950. Straub's tenure as governor saw the state's energy and land use laws strengthened. He also worked to increase property tax relief and to provide utility rate relief for senior citizens. He appointed more women, minorities and disabled people to head state agencies than any previous Oregon governor. Other accomplishments included reducing the unemployment rate to 5% from 12% and working to end plans for the proposed Mount Hood Freeway. Straub was defeated in his re-election bid in 1978 in a rematch with Atiyeh. ==Later years== Following his reelection defeat, he owned and operated farms in Salem, Springfield, Curtin, and Willamina. In addition, he also operated a ranch in Wheeler County. Straub considered running against Bob Packwood in 1986 for Packwood's U.S. Senate seat, but decided not to challenge the Republican. In 1987, Nestucca Spit State Park near Pacific City was renamed Bob Straub State Park in his honor, and a conference room at Lane County's government offices was named in his honor in 2001. In 1999, he announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He died on November 27, 2002 of complications from the disease in the Gateway Living Center nursing home in Springfield, Oregon at the age of 82. ==References== ==External links== * Genealogy of Robert William Straub * Notable Oregonians: Bob Straub - Governor, Treasurer * Category:1920 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Governors of Oregon Category:State treasurers of Oregon Category:Oregon state senators Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:People from Springfield, Oregon Category:Politicians from Eugene, Oregon Category:Politicians from San Francisco Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American environmentalists ","title":"Robert W.

Self-described by the genre \\"edu-core\\", the group played short songs with lyrics consisting of biographical and bibliographical information, observations, and abstractions of science fiction, fantasy, and seminal horror authors. ==History== Bl√∂√∂dHag was formed in 1996 as a 2-piece, 4-track recording project with Dr. J.M. McNulty on guitar and Professor Jake Stratton singing but soon added Sir Zachary Orgel on bass and a drum machine dubbed \\"Philthy 'The Drum Machine' Taylor\\". After playing local Seattle clubs for 2 years, Bl√∂√∂dHag added live drummer Rodd Karp who was subsequently replaced by Ambassador Brent Carpenter. Bl√∂√∂dHag was accredited by the King County Library System as fitting the criteria for a literacy program. Bl√∂√∂dHag has embarked on several tours of libraries in the Pacific Northwest, as well as playing in traditional music venues. Bl√∂√∂dHag has since toured libraries all around the country including Chicago, Boston, New York City (Queens), Athens, Austin, Oklahoma City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Oakland, and New Orleans. The band played at the 2004 Nebula Awards in Seattle, Washington. In 2006, the band was signed to the Alternative Tentacles label who released their full- length CD and record entitled Hell Bent For Letters. Members of the band have subsequently had some of their short fiction published in the compendium, MeccaMettle, a collaboration with Thomas M. Disch and Hugo-winning artist Tim Kirk. MeccaMettle is published by Payseur & Schmidt. From 2009-2010, Bl√∂√∂dHag stopped touring and slowed their schedule of live performances. Their last show was held on April 9, 2010, at the Seattle club, The Funhouse, alongside the groups Captured! by Robots from San Francisco and Stovokor from Portland. ==Media== The documentary, Bl√∂√∂dHag: The Faster You Go Deaf‚Ä¶The More Time You Have To Read, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in 2001. It won the Audience Award for best short at the San Francisco Independent Documentary Film Festival and was chosen by The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) as one of the top DVDs and Videos for Young Adults for 2003. The documentary has been shown on PBS stations in the United States and Canada.

He graduated in 1985 from Saint Martin's School of Art, where he studied painting and fine art film. He co-founded Sankofa Film and Video Collective in 1983, and was a founding member of Normal Films in 1991. == Education == In 1980, Julien organised the Sankofa Film and Video Collective with Martina Attille, Maureen Blackwood, Nadine Marsh-Edwards, and Robert Crusz in response to the social unrest in Britain. Sankofa was \\"dedicated to developing an independent black film culture in the areas of production, exhibition and audience\\". He received a BA in fine-art film from Central Saint Martins School of Art, London (1984) where he worked alongside artists including Sandra Lahire, Malcolm Le Grice, Lis Rhodes, Vera Neubauer, Tina Keane and completed his postdoctoral studies at Les entrepreneurs de l'audiovisuel europ√©en, Brussels (1989). ==Career== Julien came to prominence in the film world with his 1989 drama-documentary Looking for Langston, gaining a cult following with this poetic exploration Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance. This following was expanded when his film Young Soul Rebels won the Semaine de la Critique prize for best film at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991. One of the objectives of Julien's work is to break down the barriers that exist between different artistic disciplines, drawing from and commenting on film, dance, photography, music, theatre, painting and sculpture, and uniting these to construct a powerfully visual narrative. Thematically, much of his work directly relates to experiences of black and gay identity (he is himself gay), including issues of class, sexuality, and artistic and cultural history. He was nominated for the Turner Prize in 2001, and in 2003 he won the Grand Jury Prize at the Kunstfilm Biennale in Cologne for his single screen version of Baltimore. Julien is also a documentary filmmaker ‚Äì his work in this genre includes BaadAsssss Cinema, a film on the history and influence of blaxploitation cinema. Julien was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. ===Collaborations=== Julien readily cites cultural theorist and sociologist Stuart Hall as an important influence on his filmmaking. Hall narrates a portion of Looking for Langston. Julien involves Hall in his work once more in the 1996 film Frantz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask, which tells the story of Frantz Fanon, the theorist and psychiatrist from Martinique. As a member of the Sankofa Film and Video Collective, Julien made The Passion of Remembrance (1986), \\"which attempts to deal with the difficulties of constructing a documentary history of black political experience by foregrounding questions of chauvinism and homophobia.\\" ==Personal life== Julien currently divides his time, living and working in London, England and Santa Cruz, California. He was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University's Departments of Afro-American and Visual Environmental Studies, and was a visiting seminar leader in the MFA Art Practice programme at the School of Visual Arts, and a visiting professor at the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York City. He was also a research fellow at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and in September 2009 he became a professor at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design. In 2018, Julien joined UC Santa Cruz where he is the distinguished professor of the arts. Julien is a patron of the Live Art Development Agency. == Selected bibliography == === Installation pieces === Playtime at the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in the Netherlands * Vagabondia (2000) * Paradise Omeros (2002) * Baltimore (2003) * Lost Boundaries (2003) * Radioactive (2004) * True North (2004) * Fant√¥me Afrique (2005) * Fant√¥me Cr√©ole (2005) * WESTERN UNION: Small Boats (2007) * Dungeness (2008)* Te Tonga Tuturu/True South (Apparatus) (2009) * TEN THOUSAND WAVES (2010) * PLAYTIME (2013) === Filmography === *Who Killed Colin Roach?

Scranton served as the 38th Governor of Pennsylvania from 1963 to 1967, and as United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1977. Born into the prominent Scranton family, he graduated from Yale Law School and served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. After the war, he practiced law and became active in the Pennsylvania Republican Party. He won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1960 and gained a reputation as an outspoken moderate during his time in Congress. He won the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania's 1962 gubernatorial election, defeating Democrat Richardson Dilworth in the general election. As governor, Scranton presided over sweeping reforms to Pennsylvania's education system, including the creation of the state's community college system. Scranton entered the race for the 1964 Republican presidential nomination after the collapse of Nelson Rockefeller's candidacy, but Barry Goldwater won the nomination. Scranton was term-limited out of office in 1967 but remained active in politics. He chaired the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, served as a member of the transition team for President Gerald Ford, and served as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1977. He also served on the boards of several high-profile corporations and was associated with the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. ==Early life== William Scranton was born on July 19, 1917 while the Scranton family was on vacation at a cottage in Madison, Connecticut. He was the son of Worthington Scranton, a wealthy Pennsylvania businessman, and Marion Margery (Warren) Scranton, a member of the Republican National Committee for over two decades. Despite her own involvement in politics, his mother tried to dissuade him from entering politics because of his childhood struggles with asthma. She feared that the stress of campaigning would be detrimental to his frail health. She died just before her son's election to Congress in 1960. Scranton family members, George W. Scranton and his brother Selden, were the founders and patriarchs of the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He was the grandnephew of Joseph A. Scranton, a Representative from Pennsylvania. He was also a nephew by marriage of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Davis, a confidante of President Abraham Lincoln. His maternal ancestors came to America on the Mayflower. Scranton's father was the son of William Walker Scranton (1844-1916) and Katharine Maria Smith (1851-1935). His father was an industrialist, general manager of the Lackawanna Iron & Coal Company founded by George W. Scranton, among other interests in Scranton. Katherine Smith was the daughter of Worthington Curtis Smith, who served as a Congressman from Vermont. Katherine M. Smith's uncle was J. Gregory Smith, who served as Governor of Vermont. Her cousins included Edward Curtis Smith, who also served as governor. Her grandfather, John Smith, also served as a Congressman from Vermont. Scranton's genealogical line runs from John Smith (great-great-grandfather) to Worthington C. Smith (great- grandfather) to Katherine Maria Smith Scranton (paternal grandmother) to Worthington Scranton (father) to Scranton. ==Education== He began his education at the Scranton Country Day School, which had been founded by his parents, completing his basic schooling at the Fessenden School in Newton, Massachusetts, and attended the prestigious Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Scranton graduated from Yale University in 1939. While at Yale, he was a member of the Yale Political Union and the Chi Psi fraternity, where he became friends with another fraternity brother from Delta Kappa Epsilon, future U.S. President Gerald Ford, and of the Berzelius Secret Senior Society (pictured with his Berzelius Class of '39 as ==Military service== He attended Yale Law School from 1939 to 1941, dropping out in advance of World War II, enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps and serving as an Air Transport Command pilot during the war. Although he did not serve in combat, he was assigned to aircraft mobilization and pilot training duties, and was stationed on three different continents during his tour of duty, including South America, Africa, and Asia. On July 6, 1942, he married Mary Lowe Chamberlain (1918-2015). The couple had four children, a daughter and three sons, Susan, William Worthington, Joseph Curtis and Peter Kip. He was honorably discharged from the military as a captain, but was active in the U.S. Air Force Reserves for two decades thereafter. Following the war, he resumed his studies at Yale Law School. He graduated in 1946 and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in August of that year. ==Early career== Scranton's official congressional photo Scranton practiced law and then entered the business community after the war becoming successful in several firms in northeastern Pennsylvania. He joined the largest correspondence school in America (International Correspondence Schools) in 1949 as its Vice President for legal affairs. He left in 1954 (but later served on the Board of Directors, as had his father). He became active in Republican Party politics in the 1950s and came to the attention of President Dwight Eisenhower. In 1959, Eisenhower appointed Scranton as a special assistant to U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and later Christian Herter. Scranton served a little over a year before resigning to run for Congress. Scranton's name recognition and family connections helped him win a 17,000 vote victory over incumbent Stanley Prokop in a largely Democratic district in 1960. Scranton represented Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1961 to 1963. Though a freshman Republican, he quickly gained a reputation as an outspoken moderate and supported much of President John F. Kennedy's social agenda including his legislative agenda for the Civil Rights Movement and the Peace Corps. The media quickly dubbed him a \\"Kennedy Republican.\\" ==1962 gubernatorial election== In 1962, the Republican Party in Pennsylvania, which had lost the two previous gubernatorial elections and seen the state's electoral votes go to Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, became convinced that a moderate like Scranton, would have enough bipartisan appeal to revitalize the party. He ran for governor against Richardson Dilworth, the mayor of Philadelphia. The ticket added Raymond Shafer, who would succeed him as governor, as his running mate. After one of the most acrimonious campaigns in state history, Scranton and Shafer won a huge victory in the election against their opponents by nearly half a million votes, out of just over 6.6 million cast. ==Governor of Pennsylvania== As governor, he signed into law sweeping reforms in the state's education system including creation of the state community college system, the state board of education and the state Higher Education Assistance Agency. Furthermore, he created a program designed to promote the state in national and international markets and to increase the attractiveness of the state's products and services. The Chester school protests in Chester, Pennsylvania in the spring of 1964 led by George Raymond of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP) and Stanley Branche of the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN) against the de facto segregation of public schools prompted Scranton to implement the Pennsylvania Human Relations commission. All protests were discontinued while the commission held hearings during the summer of 1964. Scranton also supported the formation of the Greater Chester Movement, an umbrella organization intended to coordinate activities of groups working toward the betterment of Chester While he was governor, the largest manhunt in the history of Pennsylvania until then took place. On May 11, 1966, Peggy Ann Bradnick was kidnapped near Shade Gap. Pennsylvania State Police, FBI agents, local law enforcement, and civilian volunteers scoured the mountains around Shade Gap and Burnt Cabins. On May 17, the kidnapper, William Diller Hollenbaugh, shot and killed FBI Agent Terry Ray Anderson. On May 18, Hollenbaugh shot and wounded Cambria County Deputy Sheriff Francis Sharpe. There was a shootout at Rubeck's farm in Burnt Cabins and Hollenbaugh was killed; Peggy Ann Bradnick was rescued without serious injury. ==1964 presidential election== San Francisco cable car during the 1964 Republican National Convention Although he did not actively seek the 1964 Republican nomination for President of the United States in the beginning, a \\"Draft Scranton\\" movement quickly gathered momentum among moderate and liberal Republicans who saw him as an alternative to conservative frontrunner, Senator Barry Goldwater, and other Republicans who feared that Goldwater's polarizing views would lead to defeat, after the campaign of Goldwater's liberal opponent, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had lost steam. Early in the campaign, he announced that he would be willing to accept the nomination for Vice President. Scranton first declined to enter the race but later threw his hat into the ring on June 12, 1964. Scranton won the support of ten state delegations, but Goldwater went on to win the nomination on the first ballot. Republican National Committee Chairman and US Representative William E. Miller of New York was nominated for Vice President. ==Later career== Under the then-existing Pennsylvania law, Scranton was limited to a single term and could not run for reelection in 1966. That same year, he announced that he would never again seek elected office. After his term in office, Scranton attended the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-1968 and helped write a new constitution for the state, which included a provision allowing future governors to seek a second term. Following the 1968 United States presidential election, President-elect Richard Nixon asked Scranton to become Secretary of State, but he declined. He did serve as a special envoy to the Middle East but when he said the Nixon Administration should be \\"more evenhanded\\" in managing the problems of the Middle East, some in the American Jewish community regarded this as antisemitic and Nixon quickly distanced himself from the former governor. In accordance with his 1966 pledge never to seek elected office, he rebuffed a draft movement encouraging him to run for the U.S. Senate. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, Scranton was asked to chair the President's Commission on Campus Unrest to investigate this and other incidents of campus violence and protest. The committee's conclusions came to be known as the \\"Scranton Report\\". Following Nixon's resignation from the Presidency in 1974, he was appointed as a transition team member for incoming President Gerald Ford. Scranton swearing-in as US Rep to the UN Scranton reentered the business world and served on the boards of several high-profile American corporations such as A&P;, IBM, The New York Times, Pan American Airways, and the H.J. Heinz Company and was president of Northeastern National Bank and Trust Company. He was also associated with the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a trustee of Yale University, his alma mater. In 1976, Scranton was chosen by President Ford to become United States Ambassador to the United Nations. His measured approach to diplomacy and genuine interest in human rights earned him much respect in his short time in office. Some in the Republican Party pushed for Scranton to be named Ford's running mate for the 1976 presidential election, but Ford chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas instead. After his term as UN Ambassador, Scranton retired to his home in Dalton, Pennsylvania. Scranton's son, William Scranton III, served as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania under Richard Thornburgh. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in the 1986 election and was for a while considered a leading candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the 2006 election but ultimately dropped out of the race. ==Death== Scranton died on July 28, 2013 at the age of 96, from a cerebral hemorrhage at a retirement community in Montecito, California where he lived with his wife. His widow, Mary Scranton, the former First Lady of Pennsylvania, died from Alzheimer's disease on December 26, 2015, at the age of 97. ==In popular culture== In Jeff Greenfield's alternate history book If Kennedy Lived, Scranton is featured as Senator Barry Goldwater's running mate in the 1964 presidential election, instead of William E. Miller. ==References== ==External links== * Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Biography * - - - - Category:1917 births Category:2013 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American Presbyterians Category:Ford administration cabinet members Category:Governors of Pennsylvania Category:Hotchkiss School alumni Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:People from the Scranton‚ÄìWilkes-Barre metropolitan area Category:People from Montecito, California Category:American people of English descent Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Permanent Representatives of the United States to the United Nations Category:Presbyterians from Pennsylvania Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:Military personnel from Pennsylvania Category:United States Air Force officers Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:Candidates in the 1964 United States presidential election Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:Fessenden School alumni ","title":"William Scranton"},{"id":"1429360","text":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) is a public academic health science center in Houston, Texas.

In response to the need for graduate public health education in other geographic areas of the state, UTHealth School of Public Health established regional campuses in San Antonio (1979), El Paso (1992), Dallas (1998), Brownsville (2000) and Austin (2007). Each campus was established to meet the public health education and research needs of its community. The regional campuses have their own resident faculty and on-site course offerings. Interactive video courses originate from and connect all six of the school's campuses. The school has four academic divisions: Biostatistics and Data Science; Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences; Health Promotion and Behavioral Sciences; and Management, Policy and Community Health; as well as 14 research centers. UTHealth School of Public Health offers graduate education leading to proficiency in the skills needed for public health careers. The main campus in Houston offers four degree programs: M.P.H., Dr.P.H., M.S. and Ph.D. The regional campuses provide masters- and doctoral-level education to individuals in areas geographically distanced from Houston. This allows faculty and students to target public health issues of particular relevance to the communities in which they are located. The school is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). The dean is Eric Boerwinkle, Ph.D. ===UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics=== UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI), formerly known as the School of Health Information Sciences, was founded in 1972 as the School of Allied Health Sciences and is the newest of the six UTHealth schools. In 1992, UTHealth determined it would focus on graduate education in the health sciences. At that time, the school began to shift from traditional allied health baccalaureate programs toward the development of graduate programs to join the other professional and graduate schools in the university. In 1997, the school created the Department of Health Informatics and began to offer a Master of Science in health informatics. In 2001, the school name was changed to the School of Health Information Sciences, which also subsumed all faculty and students in the department. The school offered a Master of Science in health informatics, a Doctor of Philosophy in health informatics and a certificate program in Health Informatics for non-degree seeking students. In 2010, the school underwent another name change and became UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics. It currently offers certificate programs in health informatics, a Master of Science in Health Informatics with two tracks: a traditional research track and an applied health informatics track; and a Doctor of Philosophy in Health Informatics and dual-degree programs with UTHealth School of Public Health. The dean is Jiajie Zhang. ==Notable faculty== *James \\"Red\\" Duke, trauma surgeon and professor at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, where he worked on-site since 1972. * Ferid Murad, 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner for his research on nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system. * Palmer Beasley * Stanley Schultz * Lex Frieden, disability rights activist ==University housing== The university has three student housing properties, one at 7900 Cambridge (Phase I) and two at 1885 El Paseo (Phase II and III).\\"School of Nursing 2009 ‚Äì 2011 Catalog .\\" University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. 49.

It was created by the Militia Act of 1903. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, elevated the National Guard to a joint function of the Department of Defense. This act also elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from Lieutenant General (Three Stars) to General (Four Stars) with the appointment of General Craig R. McKinley, U.S. Air Force. The National Guard Bureau holds a unique status as both a staff and operation agency. ==Militia Act of 1903== United States Secretary of War Elihu Root militated for reform of the militia, in annual reports of 1901 of 1903 and in public letters. He argued that state militias should be more like the Army in discipline, uniforms, equipment, and training, to mitigate problems that arose in the U.S. Civil War and the recent Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. The Militia Act of 1792 was obsolete. The resulting Militia Act of 1903 (or Dick Act) became law. It gave federal status to the militia and required the organized militia of the States to conform to Regular Army organization and standards. It dramatically increased federal funding of the militia: between 1903 and 1916, the federal government spent $53 million on the Guard, more than the total of the previous hundred years. The 1903 act authorized the creation of a separate section responsible for National Guard affairs. Located in the Miscellaneous Division of the Adjutant General's office, this small section, headed by Major James Parker, Cavalry, with four clerks, was the predecessor of today's National Guard Bureau. This section remained under the supervision of the Adjutant General's Office until War Department Orders on February 12, 1908 created the Division of Militia Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of War. The Division remained a part of the Office of the Secretary of War until July 25, 1910 when the Chief was directed to report directly to the Army Chief of Staff. The Division continued to perform under the direct jurisdiction of the Chief of Staff until the passage of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916. Then the Division of Militia Affairs became the Militia Bureau of the War Department, under the direct supervision of the Secretary of War. ==Division becomes a bureau== The National Defense Act of 1916 stated that all units would have to be federally recognized, and that the qualifications for officers would be set by the War Department. It increased the number of annual training days to 15, increased the number of yearly drills to 48, and authorized pay for drills. The 1916 act transformed the Division of Militia Affairs into a separate Militia Bureau, increasing its autonomy and authority. Eight new civilian positions were authorized, something which the various Chiefs had been requesting for years; the number of military assigned to the Bureau had grown to 13. The National Defense Act also authorized the President to assign two National Guard officers to duty with the Militia Bureau. The inclusion of National Guard officers in the Militia Bureau was an important step towards creating a centralized planning organization for the National Guard headed by its own officers. The first National Guard officer assigned to the Bureau was Major Louis C. Wilson of Texas in 1916. On September 11, 1917, War Department General Order 119 stated that the jurisdiction of the Militia Bureau includes \\"coordination through the office of the Chief of Staff, of the organization, equipment, and instruction of the National Guard under department commanders in a manner similar to the coordination by the Chief of Staff of the organization, equipment, and training of the Regular Army under department commanders.\\" Thus the National Guard Bureau was charged with the responsibility of maintaining high standards in the National Guard. Prior to 1910 the Chief of the Militia Bureau was a Regular Army officer. This situation changed on June 4, 1920, when Congress passed an amendment to the National Defense Act of 1916. One of the amendment's conditions stated that effective January 1, 1921, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau would be selected from lists of present or former National Guard officers. The act reads: > The Chief National Guard Bureau shall be appointed by the President, by and > with the advice and consent of the Senate, by selection from the lists of > officers of the National Guard of the United States recommended as suitable > for such appointment by their respective Governors, and who have had ten or > more years commissioned service in the National Guard ... The Chief of the > National Guard Bureau shall hold office for four years unless sooner removed > for cause, and shall not be eligible to succeed himself ... Upon accepting > his office, the CNGB shall be appointed a Major General in the National > Guard of the United States, and commissioned in the Army of the United > States, and while serving shall have the rank, pay, and allowances of a > Major General. The act was later amended so that the Chief could succeed himself. The first appointee under these provisions was Major General George C. Rickards of Pennsylvania. The amendment also provided for the creation of a General Staff committee of National Guard officers, which could recommend policies affecting the Guard. The Bureau was known as the Militia Bureau until it was designated as the National Guard Bureau by an amendment to Section 81 of the National Defense Act on June 15, 1933. Furthermore, this amendment worked towards settling the issue of the National Guard as a reserve component. It stated that there would be two National Guards: the National Guard of the several states, and the National Guard of the United States. The former would be the individual state militias, employed in local emergencies and national defense. The latter would be considered a deployable reserve component of the regular United States Army. ==National Guard Bureau during World War II== The National Guard began mobilization on September 16, 1940, and a total of 18 National Guard Divisions (plus one more assembled from National Guard units), as well as 29 National Guard Army Air Forces observation squadrons saw action in both the Pacific and European Theatres. The National Guard Bureau also experienced changes during the war years. The first of these changes occurred on March 2, 1942, under War Department Circular number 59. This order reorganized the War Department and Army under the authority of the first War Powers Act. It specifically affected the Bureau by designating it as a part of the Adjutant General's Office. On April 27 of the same year, General Orders No. 9, Headquarters, Service and Supply, established the National Guard Bureau as an \\"independent administrative service of the Services of Supply,\\" under the jurisdiction of the Chief of Administrative Services. The third major order affecting the National Guard Bureau was Army Service Forces (ASF) circular No. 118, which came on November 11, 1943. It stipulated that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau was directed to report to the Commanding General, Army Service Forces. Finally on May 17, 1945, General Order No. 39 stated that the National Guard Bureau was removed from the jurisdiction of the Commanding General Army Service Forces, and established it as a war Department Special Staff activity. With the entire National Guard on federal service, the mission and functions of the Bureau were reduced. A large part of the Bureau's wartime work consisted of managing the State Guards which in wartime took over a great deal of the Guard's state mission, and keeping up the personnel records of federally recognized National Guard officers on active duty. The number of military officers assigned to the Bureau declined sharply, and the number of the Bureau's civilian personnel went from 140 in 1940 to 49 in 1945. There were practically no promotions awarded to National Guard Bureau civilians, which did not compare favorably with other War Department agencies. This made retaining those few key civilian employees needed in maintaining good relations with the States and working towards planning the post-war reorganization of the National Guard extremely difficult. ==Post-war National Guard Bureau== During the war years, annual leave was restricted for all War Department civilian employees. National Guard Bureau civilian personnel certainly could have been spared, since their workload had been greatly reduced. When the freeze on annual leave was limited in 1945 civilian employees were compelled to use their leave or lose it. At the war's end the National Guard Bureau desperately needed full military and civilian staff, for the task of reorganizing the National Guard in the states. However, the number of personnel was not expanded quickly enough to facilitate such activity. The frantic post-war reorganization of the National Guard was coordinated by an under-staffed Guard Bureau. In addition to the reorganization of the National Guard, the Bureau also had to deal with internal reorganizations. The most important of these was the creation of the Air Force and consequently, the Air National Guard. Under the National Security Act of July 26, 1947, Congress approved the creation of a separate division within the National Guard Bureau for the Air National Guard, thus transferring the functions, powers, and duties from the Department of the Army and the Secretary of the Army to the Department of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Air Force. After World War II the National Guard Bureau and the Army Air Forces jointly prepared a plan for the Air National Guard. Among the foreseeable problems were supplies of aircraft, type and distribution of units, training, recruitment of trained personnel, and strength in relation to the Air Force and Air Force Reserve. In 1946 a plan calling for the creation of 12 wings, 27 groups, and 84 fighter and light bombardment squadrons was authorized and tendered to the States. June 30, 1946 saw the federal recognition of the first post-war Air Guard unit, the 120th Fighter Squadron, based at Buckley Field, Denver, Colorado. Although the projected date of July 1, 1947 for organizing all Air Guard units could not be met due to drastic cuts in federal funding (the Air Guard only received $154 million instead of the requested $536 million during FY 1947‚Äì1949), by May 1949, 514 units had been organized and federally recognized. In 1949 the Army and Air Force Authorization Act (Public Law 604, 81st Congress) formally established a legal existence which provided that the Air Force of the United States shall consist of, among other components, the Air National Guard of the U.S., composed of federally recognized units and personnel of the several States. This Act established an independent relationship for the Air Guard, separate from the Air Force. It ensured that the Air Guard would remain state controlled. To facilitate the dual function of the National Guard Bureau, the Departments of the Army and Air Force, along with the NGB, reorganized the latter agency on October 1, 1948. This reorganization established the NGB as a Bureau of the Department of the Army and an agency of the Department of the Air Force. The reorganization of the NGB included the creation of the Legal Adviser, the Information Office, the Administrative Office, and the Planning Office. It also established the Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) as the head of the two component divisions, the Army Division and the Air Division. It provided for a major general of the appropriate service, commissioned in the National Guard, to be appointed as Chief of each of the respective Divisions. The Army and Air Force Authorization Act also stipulated that the National Guard Bureau would perform similar functions and duties for the Department of the Air Force as it performed for the Department of the Army and would be a formal channel of communication between the Department of the Air Force and the several States on matters pertaining to the ANG. ==Army vs. Air Guard== The Air Guard viewed this mandate as an attempt to restrict Air Guard authority through the Army- dominated NGB. Further, the active Air Force and the Bureau disagreed on the scope and function of each other's duties in relation to the Air National Guard. On the one hand, the Air Force felt that the Bureau should act only as a channel of communications between the Air Force Chief of Staff and the State military authorities. The Guard Bureau, on the other hand, interpreted its mission in broader and more active policymaking terms, rejecting the purely administrative role envisioned by the active Air Force. By late 1949, the stage had been set for an open confrontation. Major General Kenneth F. Cramer, Chief of the National Guard Bureau and an Army Guardsman, relieved the head of the bureau's Air Division, Major General George Finch - without consulting the Department of the Air Force. It is reported that a personality conflict existed between the two intensely ambitious men, but the underlying factor in Finch's dismissal was the rift between the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau concerning the control of the ANG. The Air Force believed that Cramer was not sufficiently informed about the Air National Guard and had no right to be supreme authority regarding policies the Air Force established for its state-controlled reserve component. The situation led to a joint investigation by the inspectors General of the Army and Air Force. Sweeping reforms and changes in the Guard Bureau were recommended by this inquiry team. In separate reports both General Finch and General Cramer were recommended to be relieved from their duties in the NGB. The team also recommended that the Chief, NGB should be directed to comply fully with provisions of any Air Force directive directly relating to staff procedures on matters pertaining to the Air Guard. The Inspectors General advised the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force to appoint a joint board of officers who would recommend changes in the Bureau's organizational structure and internal operating procedures. The Secretaries appointed a board commonly known as the \\"Miltonberger Board,\\" named because it was headed by former Chief of the Bureau Major General Butler Miltonberger. On March 31, 1950, the Miltonberger Board reported its findings and recommendations to the Secretary of the Army. The report argued against the creation of separate National Guard Bureaus for the Army and Air Force as being unnecessary, but the Bureau's structure and operating procedures must conform to the joint operating policies of both services.\\" The Miltonberger Board reported that the organizational structure and operating procedure of the NGB were inconsistent with staff principles. In the spring of 1950, changes were implemented to reform the bureau's organization and operating procedure. In effect, these changes gave more authority to the directors of the Army and Air National Guards, and reduced that of the chief of the bureau itself (especially in relation to the Air Guard ‚Äì although this would be changed when an Air Guardsman became chief of the Bureau). Also, in May 1950, under Special Regulation 10-230-1 the new position of Deputy Chief of the National Guard Bureau was created. The regulation authorized a major general in the Air National Guard for the position of deputy chief. Earl T. Ricks was the first to hold this office. The two men responsible for the great upheaval in the Bureau's structure eventually left. General Cramer was relieved at his own request to assume duties as commander of the 43rd US Infantry Division upon its induction into federal service on September 8, 1950. General Finch was reassigned to the United States Air Force on September 25, 1950. On August 6, 1958, Congress passed a bill for the organization of the Department of Defense. Among this Act's resolutions was an order to make the NGB a Joint Bureau of the Departments of the Army and the Air Force. It stated that the CNGB headed the Joint Bureau and acted as adviser to the Army Chief of Staff and the Air Force Chief of Staff on National Guard matters. This Act was implemented by AR 130-5/AFR 45-2, July 10, 1959. Under these provisions the Army Division was designated \\"Office of the Assistant Chief, NGB, for Army National Guard\\", and the Air Division was designated \\"Office of the Assistant Chief, NGB, for Air National Guard.\\" These offices were designated again in 1970 by a change to AR 130-5/AFR 45-2 which changed the titles of the Assistant Chiefs, NGB, for Army and Air National Guard, to \\"Director, Army National Guard\\" and \\"Director, Air National Guard.\\" These positions remained Major General positions. Additionally, these changes authorized the creation of a Deputy Director for the Army and Air National Guard, each in the grade of Brigadier General. In 1979, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, La Vern E. Weber, received a third star as a result of a concurrent elevation of the CNGB position from major general to lieutenant general. Five other Chiefs have since held this rank and office. In 1988, the position of Vice Chief, NGB was created. John B. Conaway, at that time a major general, was nominated and appointed to fill the position. He had previously served as Director of the Air National Guard since 1981. In February 1990, General Conaway assumed the position of Chief, National Guard Bureau and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In August 1998, Maj Gen Russell C. Davis, became only the third Air National Guardsman to hold this highest position in the National Guard Bureau. ==Modern National Guard== The National Guard Bureau is a channel of communications between the states and the Departments of the Army and the Air Force. For more than 80 years the National Guard Bureau has experienced many changes and important historical events, most notably four wars, the post‚ÄìWorld War II reorganization of the National Guard, and the creation of a separate Air Force. From its small beginnings as an office in the Adjutant General's Office, the National Guard Bureau has grown into a major staff and operating agency in the Department of Defense. Its personnel have substantially increased from one officer and four clerks to a present total of more than 400 officers, enlisted personnel, and civilians. As of 2017, the mission of the National Guard Bureau is to participate with the Army and Air Force staffs in programs pertaining to the National Guard. The NGB is responsible for administering programs for the development and maintenance of Army and Air National Guard units in the 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. There are many programs administered through NGB that serve youth populations, including the Youth Challenge Program, Partners in Education, HUMVEE School Program, YOU CAN School Program, and Guard Fit Challenge. As of December 31, 2011, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ==See also== * National Guard of the United States * Army National Guard of the United States * Air National Guard of the United States ==References== ==External links== * Globalsecurity.Org: History of National Guard * Law.Jrank.org: National Guard - Further Readings * Kentucky ARNG Military History e-Museum Category:National Guard of the United States ","title":"National Guard Bureau"},{"id":"1429368","text":"Devastator may refer to: ==Geography== * Devastator Peak, a volcanic summit near the upper Lillooet River in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada == Vehicles == * TBD Devastator, a World War II-era torpedo bomber * USS Devastator (AM-318), a 1943 mine sweeper of the United States Navy * USS Devastator (MCM-6), a 1988 mine sweeper of the United States Navy * Devastator (truck), a monster truck on the USHRA circuit == Video games == * Devastator (video game), a 1993 video game by Wolf Team * Devastators, a 1988 video game by Konami == Fiction == * Devastator (Transformers), a Transformer \\"combiner\\" that is made up of Constructicons * Devastator, the House Harkonnen forces' heaviest vehicle in the Dune video game Emperor: Battle for Dune * Devastator (comics), a name shared by two Marvel Comics characters * Devos the Devastator, another unrelated Marvel Comics character * Devastator, the Star Destroyer that chases Princess Leia's ship in the opening sequence of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope * World Devastator, a Star Wars planetary weapon that first appeared in Star Wars: Dark Empire * Devastator, a rocket-launching weapon available in Duke Nukem 3D * Devastator, a rocket- launching weapon available in the original Ratchet & Clank * Devastator, a rocket-launching weapon available in Serious Sam 3: BFE * Devastator, a fictional plane in Crimson Skies and Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge * A Space marine Devastator squad in Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game == Other uses == * Jennings / Bear Devastator Crossbow * Devastator (album), 2020 studio album by Phantom Planet ","title":"Devastator"},{"id":"1429382","text":"Lassen Fragment, Front Lassen Fragment, Back The Lassen Fragment, is a parchment page from c. 1275.

A. Shaw; and commissioned 12 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander R. C. Gloss, USNR, in command. == World War II service == Devastator ‚Äì the first ship in the U.S. Navy to bear that name‚Äîwas an auxiliary ship of the United States Navy. She served as an escort vessel during the latter half of the Second World War, and later saw service in the Korean War. Devastator arrived at Pearl Harbor 30 March 1944 as escort for a convoy. The next day she began convoy escort duty in Majuro and Kwajalein, which continued until 30 July. During 3 to 17 August she swept off French Frigate Shoals, and after one voyage to Eniwetok from 4 to 25 September, served at Pearl Harbor on training duty for the remainder of the year. === Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations === Devastator sailed from Pearl Harbor 27 January 1945 as escort for transports bound for the Battle of Iwo Jima. She participated in preinvasion minesweeping for 3 days before the invasion landings of 19 February, then escorted damaged vessels to Saipan, returning to Iwo Jima 1 March to patrol off the island until 7 March. On 19 March 1945 Devastator got underway from Ulithi for preinvasion minesweeping at Okinawa. She patrolled during and after the invasion and in the heavy suicide attacks of 6 April downed a Japanese plane about off her port quarter. On 4 July she cleared Okinawa for minesweeping operations in conjunction with the U.S. 3rd Fleet raids on the Japanese mainland. She sailed from Okinawa 15 July for Seattle, Washington arriving 12 August for overhaul. Devastator remained on the U.S. West Coast for operations except for two extended periods at Pearl Harbor for experiments in hull design development.

DiPrete agreed to this plea bargain only after receiving assurance that pending charges against one of his sons would be dismissed. Those charges against his son were dismissed in their entirety prior to the Governor agreeing to the plea bargain. In addition, his state retirement pension was revoked, despite attempts to have it reinstated.National Briefing  New England: Rhode Island: Court Denies Ex- Governor Pension (New York Times article) DiPrete served eleven months in Adult Correctional Institutions. Subsequently, the State Supreme Court overturned the denial of DiPrete's pension benefits to his wife and remanded the case back to Superior Court for a new hearing. Because of a degenerative neurological disease, Mrs. DiPrete, notified the court through her attorney, she wished to terminate the request, and the new hearing ordered by the Supreme Court did not proceed. ==Personal life== DiPrete was known for his \\"everyman\\" persona, serving supermarket fried chicken to guests in his Winnebago motor home. He parked the motor home outside the Rhode Island State House during a snowstorm in February 1987 so that he would be able to come to work despite heavy snowfall. DiPrete kept an arcade Pac-Man game in his home, which he demonstrated to president George H. W. Bush in 1989. DiPrete and his wife Patricia had seven children; Patricia died in 2011. DiPrete remained in his Cranston home until October 2016, when he moved to an apartment in the Garden City section of that city. ==Electoral history== ==References== * Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Rhode Island Category:Mayors of Cranston, Rhode Island Category:College of the Holy Cross alumni Category:American politicians convicted of bribery Category:Politicians convicted of racketeering Category:Rhode Island Republicans Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:Rhode Island politicians convicted of crimes Category:Rhode Island city council members Category:School board members in Rhode Island ","title":"Edward D.

He never returned to the Philippines and he spent most of his life in the United States. His best-known work today is the semi- autobiographical America Is in the Heart, but he first gained fame for his 1943 essay on The Freedom from Want. ==Early life and immigration== Bulosan was born to Ilocano parents in the Philippines in Binalonan, Pangasinan. There is considerable debate around his actual birth date, as he himself used several dates. 1911 is generally considered to be the most reliable answer, based on his baptismal records, but according to the late Lorenzo Duyanen Sampayan, his childhood playmate and nephew, Carlos was born on November 2, 1913. Most of his youth was spent in the countryside as a farmer. It is during his youth that he and his family were economically impoverished by the rich and political elite, which would become one of the main themes of his writing. His home town is also the starting point of his famous semi-autobiographical novel, America is in the Heart. Following the pattern of many Filipinos during the American colonial period, he left for America on July 22, 1930 at age 17, in the hope of finding salvation from the economic depression of his home. He never again saw his Philippine homeland. Upon arriving in Seattle, he was met with racism and was forced to work low paying jobs. He worked as a farmworker, harvesting grapes and asparagus, while also working other forms of hard labor in the fields of California. He also worked as a dishwasher with his brother Lorenzo in the famous Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. In 1936, Bulosan suffered from tuberculosis and was taken to the Los Angeles County hospital. There, he underwent three operations and stayed two years, mostly in the convalescent ward. During his long stay in the hospital, Bulosan spent his time constantly reading and writing. ==Labor movement work== Bulosan was active in labour movement along the Pacific coast of the United States and edited the 1952 Yearbook for International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 37, a predominantly Filipino American cannery trade union based in Seattle. ==Writing== There is some controversy surrounding the accuracy of events recorded within America Is in the Heart. He is celebrated for giving a post- colonial, Asian immigrant perspective to the labor movement in America and for telling the experience of Filipinos working in the U.S. during the 1930s and '40s. In the 1970s, with a resurgence in Asian/Pacific Islander American activism, his unpublished writings were discovered in a library in the University of Washington leading to posthumous releases of several unfinished works and anthologies of his poetry. His other novels include The Laughter of My Father, which were originally published as short sketches, and the posthumously published The Cry and the Dedication which detailed the Hukbalahap Rebellion in the Philippines. One of his most famous essays, published in March 1943, was chosen by The Saturday Evening Post to accompany its publication of the Norman Rockwell painting Freedom from Want, part of a series based on Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"Four Freedoms\\" speech. Maxim Lieber was his literary agent in 1944. ==Death and legacy== As a labor organizer and socialist writer, he was blacklisted. Denied a means to provide for himself, his later years were of flight and hardship, probably including alcoholism.http://www.campusactivism.org/displayobject.php?giRid=367&gsTable;=resource&giPhid;=533&gsPhile;=bulosan_center_lecture.rtf. He died in Seattle suffering from malnutrition and an advanced stage of bronchopneumonia. He is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle. Upon his death, union leader Chris Mensalvas, wrote the following obituary: \\"Carlos Bulosan, 30 years old (sic), died 11 September1956, Seattle. Birthplace: Philippines, Address: Unknown; Occupation: Writer; Hobby: Famous for his jungle salad served during Foreign-Born Committee dinners. Estate: One typewriter, a twenty-year old suit, unfinished manuscripts, worn out sock; Finances: Zero. Beneficiary: His people.\\" His works did not immediately garner widespread appreciation. For two decades after his death, his work was largely forgotten, until a group of young Asian Americans rediscovered his works and led to the republication of America is in the Heart in 1973. Bulosan's works and legacy is heralded in a permanent exhibition, \\"The Carlos Bulosan Memorial Exhibit,\\" at the Eastern Hotel in Seattle's International District. Its centerpiece mural is titled \\"Secrets of History\\" and was created by Eliseo Art Silva. In 2018, the Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies Initiative was established at the University of California, Davis to carry on his legacy of activism through research and advocacy of the Filipino and Filipino-American community. The initiative backs the creation of a physical Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies to support research, education and advocacy. The center aims to continue Bulosan‚Äôs legacy by uplifting the voices of the most marginalized in the Filipino community in the United States and the diaspora through community-engaged research and broadly disseminating knowledge about Filipinos for the purpose of advancing their rights and welfare. ==Works== *America Is in the Heart *The Laughter of My Father *The Cry and the Dedication *My Father's Tragedy *The Romance of Magno Rubio *If You Want To Know What We Are *My Father goes to Court == References == ==Sources== *\\"Bulosan's Laughter: The Making of Carlos Bulosan\\" *Bulosan Exhibit *Hounded to Death: the FBI File of Filipino Author Carlos Bulosan *Carlos Bulosan Theatre *\\"Filipino American Hip-Hop: Renewing the Spirit of Carlos Bulosan\\" *See 2014 Edition (Univ. of Washington Press) of his \\"America Is In the Heart\\" as its two Introductions,'For Further Reading' and 'Works Cited' are quite extensive. ==Further reading== *Carlos Bulosan Papers, 1914-1976. 4.65 cubic feet, 17 microfilm reels. *Aurelio Bulosan Papers. 1949-1974. .18 cubic feet (1 box).

A popular starting point for the trail is at Princes Bridge near Flinders Street station. The rider can head off in an easterly or westerly direction. If heading off in the westerly, either side of the river can be used, but the south side tends to be more popular. The Capital City Trail uses the same path as the Main Yarra Trail up to Dights Falls, where it continues, using the same path as the Merri Creek Trail, as part of its loop around the city. == Following the path == The trail follows the Yarra River to Yarra Bend Park on the Yarra River Trail and meets Merri Creek at Dights Falls. It follows the Merri Creek Trail up the Merri Creek to Rushall Station, where it follows the former Inner Circle rail reserve and Royal Park. It then meets the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, which continues back to Docklands and Southbank. At its farthest, the trail is 5 kilometres from the centre of Melbourne. === Construction === Recently completed improvements to the trail include a footbridge crossing Manningham Street in Parkville (which removes a flight of stairs and a road crossing), and re-paving of the path and landscaping on the section that passes under the Hurstbridge railway line.

W. Bush and Senator Strom Thurmond Carroll Ashmore Campbell Jr. (July 24, 1940December 7, 2005), was an American Republican Party politician who served as the 112th Governor of South Carolina from 1987 to 1995. Prior to this, he served as a member of the South Carolina Senate representing the 2nd district from 1977 to 1978 and as a congressman representing South Carolina's 4th district from 1979 to 1987. ==Early life== He was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the oldest of six children. His father, Carroll A. Campbell Sr., worked in the textile mills and the furniture business, and later owned a motel in Garden City, South Carolina. Campbell grew up in Greenville and the nearby cities of Liberty and Simpsonville. He attended Greenville Senior High School, dropping out during a period that The Greenville News characterized as an \\"unsettled adolescence amid a disintegrating family\\"; his uncle then enrolled him at the private McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He attended the University of South Carolina at Columbia but withdrew because of financial concerns and later graduated with a Master of Arts degree from American University. While a student at South Carolina, he became a member of the Sigma chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. ==Early political career== In 1970, Campbell took a leading role opposing the racial integration of public schools in Greenville. He spoke to a crowd of thousands in front of Parker High School against integration, and on January 25 he led a motorcade of 800 vehicles to the state capitol to Columbia to protest \\"forced busing\\" of students to integrated schools. Campbell served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1970 to 1974 during the administration of Governor John C. West, who defeated Republican nominee Albert Watson, the choice of U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, in the 1970 South Carolina gubernatorial election. With Lee Atwater as a key political strategist, he made an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 1974 on the ticket headed by Republican James B. Edwards of Charleston. While Edwards was elected, Campbell lost to the Democrat Brantley Harvey; despite the loss Campbell would continue to seek Atwater's counsel throughout his career. From 1976 to 1978, during the Edwards administration, he served in the South Carolina Senate. In between his two stints in the General Assembly, he served as executive assistant to Governor Edwards. In 1978, Campbell won election to the United States House of Representatives from the Greenville- based South Carolina's 4th congressional district; he defeated Max Heller, the Democratic mayor of Greenville and an emigrant from Austria, to fill the seat vacated by the retiring James Mann. Campbell hence became the first Republican to hold the 4th district seat since Reconstruction. Campbell served as state campaign chairman for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980 and 1984, and as southern regional chairman for George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign in 1988. ==Governor of South Carolina (1987‚Äì1995)== left As governor, Campbell coordinated the state's response to Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Campbell was also known for his role in luring BMW to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Greer, South Carolina. In recognition of his role, in 2002 it was announced that BMW had donated $10 million for a facility at the site of Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research. Like nearly all such large donations, it came with naming rights: the company chose to call the new facility the Carroll A. Campbell Jr. Graduate Engineering Center. When Campbell was governor, the state was confronted with two major controversies shaking taxpayers' confidence in the trustworthiness of public officials. Allegations of financial mismanagement at the University of South Carolina led to university president James B. Holderman's resignation. Operation Lost Trust, a federal investigation of bribery and drug use allegations against members of the South Carolina legislature, led to convictions of twenty-seven legislators, lobbyists and others in a vote-buying scandal. During 1993‚Äì1994, Campbell was the chairman of the National Governors Association. Term limits prevented him from seeking a third term in the 1994 election. He left office with an unprecedented job approval rating of 72 percent. ==Subsequent career== From 1995 to 2001, Campbell was a Washington, D.C. lobbyist, serving as president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers. Campbell briefly considered running for U.S. President in 1996, but concluded that the fundraising hurdles were too high. Following his decision not to run for president that year, Campbell was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for Bob Dole but was ultimately passed over in favor of Jack Kemp, the former U.S. Representative from New York's 31st congressional district and later the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the first President Bush. In 1998, Campbell and former South Carolina First Lady Lois Rhame West became the co-chairs of Winthrop University's first capital campaign. Under Campbell and West, the campaign raised more than $30 million. ==Personal life== Campbell during his time in Congress Campbell eloped with Iris Faye Rhodes in 1959. They had two sons, Carroll Campbell III, and Mike Campbell, the former of whom unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for South Carolina's 1st congressional district to succeed Representative Henry Brown; and the latter of whom was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina in 2006. The family owns franchises for Wendy's restaurants in South Carolina. In October 2001, at the age of 61, Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The revelation forced him to abandon plans to run for governor again in 2002. He was admitted to a long-term residential treatment facility for Alzheimer's patients in August 2005. He died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005, at Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia. After lying in state at the State House, he was eulogized at memorial services at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Columbia and at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pawleys Island. He was buried in the church cemetery of All Saints Episcopal Church. Upon Campbell's death, David Wilkins, U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives, described him as \\"the master architect\\" of the South Carolina Republican Party's speedy rise to dominance. ==Election history== 1986 South Carolina Governor * Carroll Campbell (Republican), 51% * Michael R.

West Asians are typically considered to be White. Asian Latin Americans have a centuries-long history in the region, starting with Filipinos in the 16th century. The peak of Asian immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, however. There are currently more than four million Asian Latin Americans, nearly 1% of Latin America's population. Chinese and Japanese are the group's largest ancestries; other major ones include Indians, Koreans and Filipinos. Brazil is home to the largest population of Asian Latin Americans, at some 2.2 million.Japan, Brazil mark a century of settlement, family ties  The Japan Times Online The highest ratio of any country in the region is 5%, in Peru. There has been notable emigration from these communities in recent decades, so that there are now hundreds of thousands of people of Asian Latin American origin in both Japan and the United States. ==History== The first Asian Latin Americans were Filipinos who made their way to Latin America (primarily to Cuba and Mexico and secondarily to Colombia, Panama and Peru) in the 16th century, as sailors, crews, prisoners, slaves, adventurers and soldiers during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. For two and a half centuries (between 1565 and 1815) many Filipinos sailed on the Manila-Acapulco Galleons, assisting in the Spanish Empire's monopoly in trade. Some of these sailors never returned to the Philippines and many of their descendants can be found in small communities around Baja California, Sonora, Mexico City, Peru and others, thus making Filipinos the oldest Asian ethnic group in Latin-America. While South Asians had been present in various forms in Latin America for centuries by the 1800s, it was in this century that the flow into the region spiked dramatically. This rapid influx of hundreds of thousands of mainly male South Asians was due to the need for indentured servants. This is largely tied to the abolition of black slavery in the Caribbean colonies in 1834. Without the promise of free labor, and a hostile working class on their hands, the Dutch colonial authorities had to find a solution ‚Äì cheap Asian labor. Many of these immigrant populations became such fixtures in their adopted countries that they acquired names of their own. For example, the Chinese men who labored in agricultural work became known as \\"coolies\\". While these imported Asian laborers were initially just replacement for agricultural slave labor, they gradually began to enter other sectors as the economy evolved. Before long, they had entered more urban work and the service sector. In certain areas, these populations assimilated into the minority populations, adding yet another definition to go on a casta. In some areas, these new populations caused conflict. In northern Mexico, tensions became inevitable when the United States began to shut off Chinese immigration in the early 1880s. Many who were originally bound for the USA were re-routed to Mexico. The rapid increase in population and rise to middle/upper class standing generated strong resentment among existing residents. These tensions lead to riots. In the state of Sonora, the entire Chinese population was expelled in 1929. Today, the overwhelming majority of Asian Latin Americans are of Chinese, Japanese or Korean descent. Japanese migration mostly came to a halt after World War II (with the exception of Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic), while Korean migration mostly came to an end by the 1980s and Chinese migration remains ongoing in a number of countries. Settlement of war refugees has been extremely minor: a few dozen ex-North Korean soldiers went to Argentina after the Korean War and some Hmong went to French Guiana after the Vietnam War. == Roles in Labor == Asian Latin Americans served various roles during their time as low wage workers in Latin America. In the second half of the nineteenth century, nearly a quarter of a million Chinese migrants in Cuba worked primarily on sugar plantations. The Chinese \\"coolies\\" who migrated to Peru took up work on the Andean Railroad or the Guano Fields. Over time the Chinese progressed to acquiring work in urban centers as tradesmen, restaurateurs, and in the service industry. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, approximately 25,000 Chinese migrants in Mexico found relative success with small businesses, government bureaucracy, and intellectual circles. In the 1830s the British and Dutch colonial governments also imported South Asians to work as indentured servants to places such as Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Cura√ßao, and British Guiana (later renamed Guayana). At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Japanese immigrants reached Brazil and Peru. Much like the Chinese, the Japanese often worked as indentured servants and low wage workers for planters. Japanese work contracts were notably more short term than those of the Chinese and the process was closely monitored by the Japanese government to dissuade abuse and foul play. In both cases, the influx of Asian migrant workers was to fill the void left in the Latin American work forces after the abolition of slavery. Employers of all kinds were desperate for a low cost replacement for their slaves so those who did not participate in any illegal slave operations turned to the Asian migrants. ==Geographic distribution== Four and a half million Latin Americans (almost 1% of the total population of Latin America) are of Asian descent. The number may be millions higher, even more so if all who have partial ancestry are included. For example, Asian Peruvians are estimated at 5% of the population there, but one source places the number of all Peruvians with at least some Chinese ancestry at 5 million, which equates to 20% of the country's total population. Most who are of Japanese descent reside in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, and Paraguay while significant populations of Chinese ancestry are found in Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Panama, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Costa Rica (where they make up about 1% of the total population). Nicaragua is home to 12,000 ethnic Chinese; the majority reside in Managua and on the Caribbean coast. Smaller communities of Chinese, numbering just in the hundreds or thousands, are also found in Ecuador and various other Latin American countries. Most Korean communities are in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Guatemala, Paraguay, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile. There are around 12,918 living in Guatemala. There is also a Hmong community in Argentina. Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela also have Asian Indian communities. Japanese Peruvians have a considerable economic position in Peru.Lama, Abraham. Asian Times. Home is where the heartbreak is. 1999. 6 September 2006.. Many past and present Peruvian Cabinet members are ethnic Asians, but most particularly Japanese Peruvians have made up large portions of Peru's cabinet members and former president Alberto Fujimori is of Japanese ancestry who is currently the only Asian Latin American to have ever served as the head of any Latin American nation (or the second, if taking into account Arthur Chung). Brazil is home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan, numbering about 1.7 million with ancestry alone. Brazil is also home to 10,000 Indians, 5,000 Vietnamese, 4,500 Afghans, 2,900 Indonesians and 1,000 Filipinos. Korean people are the third Largest Group of Asian Latin Americans. this group at Brazil is the largest (specially in Southeast region) with a population of 51,550. The second largest is at Argentina being at the same time the largest at Hispanic America, with a population of 23,603 and with active koreatowns in Buenos Aires. More 10,000 at Guatemala and Mexico, This last with active communities in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Yucatan and Mexico city. More 1,000 at Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Honduras and Peru where with Mario Jung ex-mayor of Chanchamayo city, He is the first Mayor of Peru and Latin America from korean origin. there are small and important communities (lees 1,000 peoples) at Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Panama, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, and Haiti. ==Emigrant communities== ===Canada=== Canada has been a destination for Asian Latin American emigration. The immigrants usually settle in the largest cities, such as Vancouver and Toronto and integrate into the overall Asian Canadian communities. ===Japan=== Japanese Brazilian immigrants to Japan numbered 250,000 in 2004, constituting Japan's second-largest immigrant population. Their experiences bear similarities to those of Japanese Peruvian immigrants, who are often relegated to low income jobs typically occupied by foreigners. ===United States=== Most Asian Latin Americans who have migrated to the United States live in the largest cities, often in Asian American or Hispanic and Latino communities in the Greater Los Angeles area, New York metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, San Francisco Bay area, Greater Houston, the San Diego area, Imperial Valley, California, Dallas-Fort Worth and South Florida (mainly Chinese Cubans). They and their descendants are sometimes known as Asian Hispanics and Asian Latinos. In the 2000 US Census, 119,829 Hispanic or Latino Americans identified as being of Asian race alone. In 2006 the Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimated them at 154,694, while its Population Estimates, which are official, put them at 277,704. Some notable Americans of Asian Hispanic/Latino heritage include Harry Shum Jr., Franklin Chang-Diaz, Carlos Galvan, Kelis, Kirk Acevedo and Chino Moreno. In the United States, there are Facebook groups that are devoted to Asian Hispanics in New York, California and Bay Area. ==Composition== {class=\\", sortable\\" +Asian Latin American population (incomplete data) - efefef;\\" !Country !Chinese !Indian; note all figures in this table given are the sum of those for Non-Resident Indians and for Persons of Indian Origin, which are tabulated separately in the original report !Japanese !Korean !Filipino !Others !References - Argentina 200,000 4,000 65,000 23,063 15,000 2,000 - Bolivia   14,178 654   - Brazil 251,649 9,200 1,705,685 48,281 1,000   - Chile  1,500 4,000 2,700    - Colombia 30,000 5,000 3,000 Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores del Japon 880 17,000 Ìï¥Ïô∏Ïù¥Ï£º ÌÜµÍ≥Ñ - Ïô∏ÍµêÎ∂Ä - Costa Rica 45,000 16 351 434    - Cuba 114,240 200 1200 900    - Dominican Republic 50,000 200 847 675   - Ecuador 95,000 25,000 434 714   - El Salvador 2,140 55 176 151  103 - Guatemala  2,000 288 12,918    - Honduras 123  160 3,800 1,107 - Mexico 70,000 2,258 35,000 11,897 200,000Floro L.

Drawing from his own experiences, Suvorov (writing under a pseudonym) provides insight into the brutality of a military machine in which soldiers are treated with little regard. A veteran of the Soviet army and intelligence, Suvorov had defected to the United Kingdom in 1978. The book includes Suvorov's eyewitness account of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet forces. More generally, he recounts the daily life within the military. He says that middle-ranking officers struggle to impress their superiors. This does not contribute to military effectiveness or discipline, but depends on officers' cunning and deceit. This is the first book that Suvorov published after his defection and it is written in Russian, as are all his works. The book was also translated into English in more than one edition, including paperbacks. It is available for free in an English edition on the Internet Archive. ==Critical reception== The Liberators does not attempt to discuss Soviet doctrine, organization or equipment in any formal way. Suvorov explored those topics in his subsequent book, Inside the Soviet Army(1982), with a much more objective approach. Suvorov provides a personal account for non-specialist readership. United States military reviewers described the book as \\"a bitter, often sarcastic account of anecdotes about life in the Soviet army and events leading up to the 'liberation' of Czechoslovakia. He portrays an army of doubtful readiness and ability.\\" While the reviewers acknowledged that Soviet forces were not in good shape in 1968, they disputed Suvorov's consistent portrayal of them as \\"incapable of effective combat.\\" They said that since that date, the Soviets had corrected some deficiencies in equipment, for instance. They did note reports in the early 1980s of poor discipline and morale among Soviet forces in Afghanistan. The book was translated into English and has been published in more than one hardcover edition; it was also published in paperback. *; Hamish Hamilton, 1981 (English translation). *; W W Norton, 1983 (English translation). *; Berkley, 1998, in English ==References== ==External links== *Viktor Survorov, The Liberators, available in English for free online at the Internet Archive Category:1981 books Category:Political autobiographies Category:Books about Soviet repression Category:Books about Soviet military occupations ","title":"The Liberators (Suvorov book)"},{"id":"1429557","text":"S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek (29 June 1930 ‚Äì 15 August 2013) was a Polish dramatist, writer and cartoonist.

Associated Press. ==Literary career== Daniel Mr√≥z illustration for Mro≈ºek's 1957 book S≈Ço≈Ñ (The Elephant) Mro≈ºek's first play, The Police, was published in 1958. His first full-length play, Tango (1965) written about totalitarianism in the style of Theatre of the Absurd, made him, according to Krystyna DƒÖbrowska, one of the most recognizable Polish contemporary dramatists in the world. It became also Mro≈ºek's most successful play, according to Britannica, produced in many Western countries. In 1975 his second popular play Emigranci (The √âmigr√©s),August Grodzicki, \\"Bardzo polska tragikomedia.\\" ≈ªycie Warszawy nr 5; 7 Jan 1976 a bitter and ironic portrait of two Polish emigrants in Paris, was produced by director Andrzej Wajda at the Teatr Stary in Krak√≥w. S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek literary evening in the Polish Institute, 27 February 2007, Lengyel Int√©zet, Budapest. Mro≈ºek traveled to France, England, Italy, Yugoslavia and other European countries. After the military crackdown of 1981 Mro≈ºek wrote the only play he ever regretted writing, called Alfa, about the imprisoned Solidarity leader Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa who became President of Poland after the collapse of the Soviet empire. See also \\"fa≈Çszywka\\". After the introduction of martial law in Poland, productions of Alfa were banned, along with two of Mro≈ºek's other plays, The Ambassador and Vatzlav. The later play, in Gda≈Ñsk, in the city known as the birth and home to Solidarity (Polish trade union) and its leader Lech Walesa, Theater Wybrzeze courageously premiered \\"Vatzlav\\". These were the times that the country had food shortages, curfews and a police hour. Many actors were interned including actor Jerzy Kiszkis who played the title role of \\"Vatzlav\\". A Gda≈Ñsk born actress, activist and Solidarity Solidarno≈õƒá (Solidarity)supporter Beata Pozniak, was asked to play Justine, a character that symbolized justice. Censorship in theaters were enforced. It was noted that in this 1982 Gda≈Ñsk production, the censor stopped Mrozek's play not allowing many gestures made by actors on stage, including Justine's father wearing a beard, because he reminded her too much of Karl Marx. (Reference: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/world-theatre-day_b_9548710) It was not without reason that Mrozek's plays were often classified as absurd, since the times that everyone lived in were often referred to as absurd. ==List of works== List of plays by Mro≈ºek (below) is based on Ma≈Çgorzata Sugiera's \\"Dramaturgia S≈Çawomira Mro≈ºka\\" (Dramatic works of S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek): *Professor / The professorSource: Jerzy Afanasjew, Sezon kolorowych chmur.

It is located at the intersection of Moreton Terrace and Causeway Road in Causeway Bay. Facing Victoria Harbour, the 12-storey high building occupies a gross area of with a floor area of . The building cost of the Central Library was HK$690 million ($88 million). The Library's collections amount to one fifth of the Hong Kong Public Libraries System; 2.3 million items out of the total 12.1 million items. The library's 11th floor houses the HKPL head office.\\"library_list_eng.pdf.\\" Hong Kong Public Libraries.

The circle represents the sky, the square the land and the triangle the accretion of knowledge. When it was originally proposed, the design was controversial and received critiques from Urban Council members. ==Services== Atrium of the library Opened on 17 May 2001, the Hong Kong Central Library provides a complete variety of library services including: * inclusive reference and information services * self- charging terminals * Bookdrop service (available during library non-opening hours) * information kiosks * Multimedia Information System (MMIS). ===Online Public Access Catalogue=== The Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) enables readers to rummage around the whole Chinese and English collections of the Hong Kong Public Libraries. Over and above a wide assortment of search options, such as author, title, subject, etc. Readers do not have the choice at the start to narrow their search to books only, to audio-visual materials only or to some other categories or materials. From any OPAC terminal, readers will know instantaneously whether the item they need is available on the shelf, on loan or being reserved. If it is on loan, readers will also know the date the item is due for return. In case readers wish to know library related activities that are being held or forthcoming; or wish to check their own borrowing record, like how many books readers have borrowed, which item is overdue, etc., merely follow the menu options and readers will find them all. Readers may also carry out renewal and reservation at any OPAC terminal. ===Multimedia Information System (MMIS)=== Steps leading to the library. Quotations from Chinese classics (as can be seen here), and English proverbs, are carved on them. Multimedia Information System is an example of all- embracing use of information technology and computer application in the Hong Kong Central Library. A three level audio-on-demand (AOD) and video-on-demand (VOD) system has been set up: *1st level: built upon the high quality video- audio servers. Users can access the system in sync. *2nd level: consists of servers and jukeboxes. It is a more economical channel for the public to search for less frequently used audio/video materials. *3rd level: a conventional video/audio distribution network is used. Users can access media of most formats using LD, VCD, DVD, CD player and cassette player. To enable more public to use the first level video and third level audio and video of the AOD/VOD system, about 90 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) terminals are installed in the Hong Kong Central Library. Meanwhile, the public can also use the AOD system by using the over 400 LAN workstations in the Central Library. In addition, the Hong Kong Central Library provides document imaging materials, such as drawings, manuscripts, microfilms, clippings, reports, posters, house programmes, newspapers, photos, maps, pictures, black-and-white document images etc. After clearance of the relevant copyright/licensing terms, the materials are digitised and stored in the multimedia databases for all set access of users. Comparing with the traditional library services, the digital library can provide better services in the way that: *user can search information once there are networked workstations; *multiple users can search for and use the same library materials concurrently; *research and accessing information becomes more effective, efficient and in-depth; *research means are of a greater variety, such as searching by colour format, style and structure, etc. The Multimedia Information Services have already been extended to other public libraries. Depending on user demand, the Hong Kong Central Library may also make more workstations available for use. ===Legal Deposit Library=== Level 5 Reading Area D√©lifrance caf√©. The Hong Kong Central Library is an intelligent building, built on a network flooring system to offer litheness for the supply of power, telecommunication and further alteration and extension. Hong Kong Central Library has been designated as the legal depository library in Hong Kong for nine global organisations: *Asian Development Bank *European Union *International Labour Organization *International Maritime Organization *United Nations *United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization *World Bank *World Trade Organization *World Food Programme Materials published by these organisations will have copies sent to this library. These materials are accessible to the public via a variety of methods. Reading tables are all provided with separate power points and dataline outlets through which library patrons can use their own portable computers to access the library network and the Internet. Readers can also retrieve a wide range of multimedia databases on CD-ROMs and the Internet through the LAN/ATM workstations. ===Discussion Rooms=== Several floors of the Hong Kong Central Library have discussion rooms available for rental at a fixed charge on an hourly basis, and on a 30-minute basis thereafter. ===Caf√©=== The library houses a D√©lifrance caf√© outside the library area on the first floor behind the bookshop. There are both indoor and outdoor seats for it. ==Floor plan== Adult Lending Library Central Reference Library Atrium Glass-walled elevators in the library.

After three cases of jumping to death in the library, tall fences were installed along some railings around the corners on fifth and sixth floors in 2015 to prevent future suicides. Yet there was another suicide in the library in 2016. Now fences have been installed from third to sixth floors. ==Design controversy== The library was designed by government senior architect Ho Chiu-fan. When the design was submitted to the Town Planning Board in 1995, its members were disappointed, especially by its exterior look. After Elaine Chung Lai-kwok became the Director of Urban Services Department in February 1997, she heard strong criticisms against the design from urban councillors and the cultural community, so she asked the Director of Architectural Services Department Pau Shiu-hung for new designs, and Pau invited four prominent Hong Kong private architects to the task. A row broke out in July 1997 when Ronald Leung Ding- bong, chairman of the Provisional Urban Council, openly scolded Chung for acting without his approval. Kam Nai-wai, chairman of the Libraries Select Committee of the Council, also criticised Chung for breaching procedures and opposing the Council's decisions. On 8 August 1997, the Provisional Urban Council decided to vote between the design by Rocco Yim Sen-kee and the original design, which resulted in a tie with 21 votes each, then Leung, the Council's chairman, made the final decision by casting his second vote for the original design, even though Yim's design was praised by architects as much superior to the original. ==Anecdote== There existed some memorial plaques dedicated to famous modern Chinese writers in the library, one of them was for the witty and erudite scholar-novelist Qian Zhongshu (). When the library was first opened, it was found that the second character in Qian's name, zhong (, \\"to favour\\"), was mis-represented as zhong (, \\"clock\\"). The mistake drew some criticism against the new library, which contains the greatest number of reference books among the public libraries in Hong Kong. ==See also== * Hong Kong Public Libraries * List of libraries in Hong Kong ==References== ==External links== *Hong Kong Public Libraries Official website *Hong Kong Central Library Official website Category:2001 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Causeway Bay Category:Deposit libraries Category:Landmarks in Hong Kong Category:Libraries established in 2001 Category:Library buildings completed in 2001 Category:National libraries Category:Postmodern architecture Category:Public libraries in Hong Kong Category:Wan Chai District Category:Libraries in Hong Kong ","title":"Hong Kong Central Library"},{"id":"1429572","text":"Little Wolf/Little Coyote in Fort Laramie, in May 1868. Little Wolf (Cheyenne: √ì'k√¥h√≥m√¥xh√°ahketa, sometimes transcribed Ohcumgache or Ohkomhakit, more correctly translated Little Coyote, 18201904) was a Northern S√≥'taeo'o Chief and Sweet Medicine Chief of the Northern Cheyenne. He was known as a great military tactician and led a dramatic escape from confinement in Oklahoma back to the Northern Cheyenne homeland in 1878, known as the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. ==Overview== Born in present-day Montana, by the mid-1840s, Little Wolf had become a prominent chieftain of the Northern Cheyenne, leading a group of warriors called the \\"Elk Horn Scrapers\\" during the Northern Plains Wars. He fought in Red Cloud's War, the war for the Bozeman Trail, which lasted from 1866 to 1868. As chief, he signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie. He was chosen one of the \\"Old Man\\" chiefs among the Council of Forty-four, a high honor in traditional Cheyenne culture. He was also chosen as Sweet Medicine Chief, bearer of the spiritual incarnation of Sweet Medicine, a primary culture hero and spiritual ancestor of the Cheyenne. Because of this honorary title, he was expected to be above anger, as well as concerned only for his people and not for himself. ==Battles== He was not present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, but played a part before and after the battle. Some scouts from his camp apparently found some food left behind by Custer's attack force, and were observed by U.S. military scouts. This fact was reported to Custer, who incorrectly assumed he had been discovered by the main camp of Sioux and Cheyenne on the Little Bighorn, and urgently pressed on with his attack, trying to prevent the escape of the Indians. After the battle, Little Wolf arrived and was detained and almost killed by the angry Sioux, who suspected he was scouting for the whites. Only his fierce denial of complicity in the attack and the support of his fellow Northern Cheyenne present during the fighting saved him from harm. ==Escape from Fort Robinson== Morning Star (Dull Knife), Chiefs of the Northern Cheyennes Following the defeat of Morning Star (Dull Knife) and Little Wolf by Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie at the Dull Knife Fight in November 1876, Little Wolf and Dull Knife surrendered. They were forced onto a reservation in Oklahoma's Indian Territory. Around 1878, he and Dull Knife led almost 300 Cheyenne from their reservation near Fort Reno, Oklahoma, through Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakota Territory into the Montana Territory, their ancestral home. During the journey, they managed to elude the U.S. cavalry units which were trying to capture them. The two groups split up after reaching Nebraska, and while Dull Knife's party was eventually forced to surrender near Fort Robinson, those in Little Wolf's group made their way to Montana where they were finally allowed to remain.

Little Wolf was intoxicated when he shot and killed him at the trading post of Eugene Lamphere on December 12, 1880. Little Wolf went into voluntary exile as a result of this disgrace. His status as a chief was revoked.Thomas B. Marquis (interpreter), Wooden Leg, Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer, pp. 330-333, University of Nebraska Press, 2003 . In his later years, he lived on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, where he died in 1904. He is interred in the Lame Deer cemetery, alongside the gravesite of Morning Star.

Its plot, loosely based on the crimes of Ed Gein, follows Ezra Cobb, a middle-aged man in a rural Midwestern community who begins a string of serial murders and grave robberies after the death of his mother, a religious fanatic who raised him to be a misogynist. Though based on Gein, the film's title is misleading since Gein never experimented with necrophilia; although a necrophile is also defined as \\"an obsessive fascination with death and corpses.\\" Funded by an American concert promoter on a small budget, the production took place in Oshawa, Ontario in the winter of 1973, with a largely Canadian cast and crew. The film premiered in Los Angeles on March 20, 1974. ==Plot== Middle-aged Ezra Cobb helps operate a farm in the rural Midwest with his elderly mother, Amanda, a religious fanatic who has indoctrinated him since childhood to abhor women. Amanda dies following a protracted illness, and Ezra withdraws. Nearly a year after her death, he experiences auditory hallucinations that compel him to exhume his mother. He arrives at her grave one night and digs up her decomposed body, returning it to his home where he cobbles it together using discarded fish skin and wax. Ezra becomes acquainted with Maureen Selby, an eccentric middle-aged woman and proclaimed psychic. One night during a preemptive sexual encounter, he murders her, an event that sets him off on a chain of serial killings. He first sets his attention on a 34-year-old waitress, Mary Ransum, whom he becomes acquainted with. He slashes her tires one night, leaving her stranded at the restaurant after-hours, and then appears under the guise of offering her a ride. She reluctantly agrees to ride with him to his house, where he says he has spare tires. After waiting in the truck for an extended period of time, Mary goes to look for him. In the house, she finds Ezra in a bedroom surrounded by the corpses of his mother and others, his face obscured with a mask made of human flesh. She attempts to flee, but he incapacitates her. Later, Mary awakens bound in a closet, wearing only undergarments. Ezra escorts her to the dining room, where he seats her at a table surrounded by corpses. He becomes aroused and begins molesting her, during which she convinces him to free her arms. She manages to smash a bottle over his head, but he beats her to death with a human femur bone. A short time later, Ezra visits his friend, Harlon, at his house, and discusses Mary's disappearances. In conversation, Ezra references her \\"being over at his place,\\" a comment Harlon takes in jest. Harlon's teenage son, Brad, arrives with his girlfriend, Sally Mae, who immediately catches Ezra's interest. He later visits her while she works her cashier job at a local store, and shoots her with a rifle; the bullet grazes her head, but does not kill her. Ezra places Sally Mae in the bed of his truck and drives away, but she awakens and escapes on foot, fleeing into the woods. She inadvertently runs over a bear trap earlier set by Harlon and Brad. The trap mangles her foot, and she attempts to hide amidst the underbrush, but Ezra finds her and shoots her to death. Harlon and Brad return to the store and find blood and broken glasses at the cash register, but no sign of Sally Mae; Brad recalls to the sheriff that Ezra was the last person he saw at the store. Ezra brings Sally Mae's corpse to his farm, where he hangs it upside down in the barn and begins skinning the body. Harlon, Brad, and the sheriff arrive and find him in his kitchen, laughing over a bowl of blood. ==Cast== *Roberts Blossom as Ezra Cobb *Cosette Lee as Amanda Cobb *Leslie Carlson as Tom Simms *Robert Warner as Harlon Kootz *Marcia Diamond as Jenny Kootz *Brian Smeagle as Brad Kootz *Arlene Gillen as Miss Johnson *Robert McHeady as Sheriff *Marian Waldman as Maureen Selby *Jack Mather as Drunk *Micki Moore as Mary Ransum *Pat Orr as Sally Mae ==Production== ===Filming=== Principal photography took place over a period of two months between February and March 1973 in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, on a budget of $200,000. Producer Tom Karr, who had been fascinated with Ed Gein for many years, funded the film himself with income he had earned as a concert promoter for Led Zeppelin and Three Dog Night. The Canadian location was chosen to ensure the film achieved a wintry setting. Locations used included an abandoned farmhouse, a local hardware store, and a basement location in the hotel in which the cast and crew were lodging. The majority of interior scenes were shot on sets constructed at a local motion picture studio. The film's art director, Albert Fisher, dressed the sets with stacks of crime serials and pornographic magazines; Fisher garnered inspiration by reading newspaper stories about Ed Gein and his crimes. ==Release== ===Censorship=== In order to achieve an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), several sequences were truncated or excised entirely. Among these included an extended murder sequence involving Mary, as well as a protracted dissection sequence in which Ezra mutilates a corpse. ===Theatrical release=== Deranged had its theatrical premiere in Los Angeles, California on March 20, 1974. ===Home media=== In 2002, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released Deranged as part of its \\"Midnite Movies\\" collection of double feature DVDs. It was released along with the 1980 feature film Motel Hell. A second release of the film was also made available in the United States on DVD from Desert Island Classics on March 5, 2014. In 2007, Germany released a 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition. Where the U.S. DVD received a cut R-rating, the German version is unrated and uncut, with a brain-scooping scene which is cut from the U.S. version, it is also in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, with both an English and German (dubbed) audio track and optional English and German subtitles. Deranged was released on Blu- ray format in the United Kingdom via Arrow Films on August 19, 2013, which contains both a Blu-ray and DVD of the film. The film was released on Blu-ray in the United States on July 7, 2015 by Kino Lorber distribution. ==Critical response== Time Out's review of the film was mostly positive, writing, \\"The more sensationalist aspects of the story are admirably underplayed, and Blossom's nicely gauged performance lends the film surprising conviction.\\" TV Guide awarded the film three out of five stars, praising Blossom's performance and calling it \\"an accurately recounted horror film inspired by the life of crazed Wisconsin farmer Ed Gein, who actually murdered, skinned and preserved body parts of dozens of women in the late 1950s... A sick little film but told with a disturbing sense of humor.\\" Justin Remer from DVD Talk gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"Deranged is a cult classic that deserves a massively larger cult. Its performances are surprisingly vivid and realistic, its script is smart and subtly funny, its gore is stomach-churning, and its suspense scenes are genuinely nerve-jangling.\\" Robert Vaughn from Diabolique Magazine praised the film for its dark sense of humor, creepy moments, and Blossom‚Äôs performance. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus‚Äô World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade B+, calling it \\"scary and convincing\\", and commended the film's makeup effects, and Blossom's performance. Donald Guarisco of AllMovie wrote: \\"Deranged is interesting because it as witty as it is scary. The film suffers from rough edges, the main problems being inconsistent pacing and a stilted framing device involving an investigative reporter, but remains compelling because it adds some perceptive social satire into the mix.\\" ==See also== * List of American films of 1974 * List of rediscovered films ==References* * Category:1970s comedy horror films Category:1974 films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:Canadian comedy horror films Category:Canadian independent films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Cultural depictions of Ed Gein Category:Necrophilia in film Category:English-language films Category:Horror films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Alan Ormsby Category:Films set in the United States Category:Canadian serial killer films Category:American serial killer films Category:1970s rediscovered films Category:1970s serial killer films Category:Canadian films Category:Films shot in Ontario Category:Rediscovered American films Category:Rediscovered Canadian films ","title":"Deranged (1974 film)"},{"id":"1429577","text":"The epithalamus is a (dorsal) posterior segment of the diencephalon. The diencephalon is a part of the forebrain that also contains the thalamus, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The epithalamus includes the habenular nuclei and their interconnecting fibers, the habenular commissure, the stria medullaris and the pineal gland. ==Functions== The function of the epithalamus is to connect the limbic system to other parts of the brain. The epithalamus also serves as a connecting point for the dorsal diencephalic conduction system, which is responsible for carrying information from the limbic forebrain to limbic midbrain structures. Some functions of its components include the secretion of melatonin and secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland (by the pineal gland circadian rhythms), regulation of motor pathways and emotions, and how energy is conserved in the body. A study has shown that the lateral habenula, an epithalamic structure, produces spontaneous theta oscillatory activity that was correlated with theta oscillation in the hippocampus. The same study also found that the increase in theta waves in both lateral habenula and hippocampus was correlated with increased memory performance in rats. This suggests that the lateral habenula has an interaction with the hippocampus that is involved in hippocampus- dependent spatial information processing. ==Components== The epithalamus is a tiny structure that comprises the habenular trigone, the pineal gland, and the habenular commissure. It is wired with the limbic system and basal ganglia. Species that possess a photoreceptive parapineal organ show asymmetry in the epithalamus at the habenula, to the left (dorsal). == Dysfunction == Dysfunction of the epithalamus can be related to mood disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia and sleeping disorders. Low levels of melatonin will typically give rise to mood disorders. Calcification of the epithalamus can be linked to periventricular lesions near the limbic system, and lesions of cortico-subcortical pathways that are involved with schizophrenia. == Sleep disorders == The epithalamus is associated with sleep disorders like insomnia revolving around circadian rhythms of sleep wake cycles. The close connection of the epithalamus with the limbic system regulates the secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland and the regulation of motor pathways and emotions. The secretion of melatonin happens in a cycle. Secretion is high at night or in the absence of light and low during the day. The suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus is responsible for this cycle of secretion from the epithalamus, specifically from the pineal gland. The Circadian timekeeping is driven in cells by the cyclical activity of core clock genes and proteins such as per2/PER2. Gamma-aminobutyric acid and several peptide factors, including cytokines, growth hormone-releasing hormone and prolactin, are related to sleep promotion. ==References== ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20080504165606/ *http://isc.temple.edu/neuroanatomy/lab/atlas/pdhn/ * NIF Search - Epithalamus via the Neuroscience Information Framework ==See also== Category:Limbic system ","title":"Epithalamus"},{"id":"1429582","text":"Giraffes acquired their long necks through heterochrony, extending the development period of the seven neck vertebrae growth in the embryo to add length to the bones, not by adding more bones. In evolutionary developmental biology, heterochrony is any genetically controlled difference in the timing or duration of a developmental process in an organism compared to its ancestors or other organisms. This leads to changes in the size, shape, characteristics and even presence of certain organs and features. It is contrasted with heterotopy, a change in spatial positioning of some process in the embryo, which can also create morphological innovation. Heterochrony can be divided into intraspecific heterochrony, variation within a species, and interspecific heterochrony, phylogenetic variation, i.e. variation of a descendant species with respect to an ancestral species. These changes all affect the start, end, rate or time span of a particular developmental process. The concept of heterochrony was introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875 and given its modern sense by Gavin de Beer in 1930. ==History== Ernst Haeckel supposed that embryonic development recapitulated an animal's phylogeny, and introduced heterochrony as an exception for individual organs. Modern biology agrees instead with Karl Ernst von Baer's view that development itself varies, such as by changing the timing of different processes, to cause a branching phylogeny. The concept of heterochrony was introduced by the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel in 1875, where he used it to define deviations from recapitulation theory, which held that \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\". As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out, Haeckel's term is now used in a sense contrary to his coinage. He assumed that embryonic development (ontogeny) of \\"higher\\" animals recapitulated their ancestral development (phylogeny). This, in his view, necessarily compressed the earlier developmental stages, representing the ancestors, into a shorter time, meaning accelerated development. The ideal for Haeckel would be when the development of every part of an organism was thus accelerated, but he recognised that some organs could develop with displacements in position (heterotopy, another concept he originated) or time (heterochrony), as exceptions to his rule. He thus intended the term to mean a change in the timing of the embryonic development of one organ with respect to the rest of the same animal, whereas it is now used, following the work of the British evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer in 1930, to mean a change with respect to the development of the same organ in the animal's ancestors. In 1928, the English embryologist Walter Garstang showed that tunicate larvae shared structures such as the notochord with adult vertebrates, and suggested that the vertebrates arose by paedomorphosis (neoteny) from such a larva. De Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony, such as in paedomorphosis, the retention of juvenile features in the adult. De Beer argued that this enabled rapid evolutionary change, too brief to be recorded in the fossil record, and in effect explaining why apparent gaps were likely. ==Mechanisms== Diagram of the six types of shift in heterochrony, a change in the timing or rate of any process in embryonic development. Predisplacement, hypermorphosis, and acceleration ; postdisplacement, hypomorphosis, and deceleration all . These may be combined, e.g. to shift some aspect of development earlier. Heterochrony can be divided into intraspecific and interspecific types. Intraspecific heterochrony means changes in the rate or timing of development within a species. For example, some individuals of the salamander species Ambystoma talpoideum delay the metamorphosis of the skull. Reilly et al argue we can define these variant individuals as paedotypic (with truncated development relative to the ancestral condition), peratypic (with extended development relative to the ancestral condition), or isotypic (reaching the same ancestral shape, but via a different mechanism). Interspecific heterochrony means differences in the rate or timing of a descendant species relative to its ancestor. This can result in either paedomophosis (truncating the ancestral ontogeny), peramorphosis (extending past the ancestral ontogeny), or isomorphosis (reaching the same ancestral state via a different mechanism). There are three major mechanisms of heterochrony, each of which can change in either of two directions, giving six types of perturbations, which can be combined in various ways. These ultimately result in extended, shifted, or truncated development of a particular process, such as the action of a single toolkit gene, relative to the ancestral condition or to other conspecifics, depending on whether inter- or intraspecific heterochrony is the focus. Identifying which of the six perturbations is occurring is critical in identifying the actual underlying mechanism driving peramorphosis or paedomorphosis. Despite greatly differing neck lengths, giraffes (right) have no more cervical vertebrae, just 7, than their fellow giraffids, okapi (left). With the number constrained, the development of the vertebrae is extended, allowing them to grow longer. *Onset: A developmental process can either begin earlier, pre-displacement, extending its development, or later, post-displacement, truncating it. *Offset: A process can either end later, hypermorphosis, extending its development, or earlier, hypomorphosis or progenesis, truncating it. *Rate: The rate of a process can accelerate, extending its development, or decelerate (as in neoteny), truncating it. A dramatic illustration of how acceleration can change a body plan is seen in snakes. Where a typical vertebrate like a mouse has only around 60 vertebrae, snakes have between around 150 to 400, giving them extremely long spinal columns and enabling their sinuous locomotion. Snake embryos achieve this by accelerating their system for creating somites (body segments), which relies on an oscillator. The oscillator clock runs some four times faster in snake than in mouse embryos, initially creating very thin somites. These expand to adopt a typical vertebrate shape, elongating the body. Giraffes gain their long necks by a different heterochrony, extending the development of their cervical vertebrae; they retain the usual mammalian number of these vertebrae, seven. This number appears to be constrained by the use of neck somites to form the mammalian diaphragm muscle; the result is that the embryonic neck is divided into three modules, the middle one (C3 to C5) serving the diaphragm. The assumption is that disrupting this would kill the embryo rather than giving it more vertebrae. ==Detection== Heterochrony can be identified by comparing phylogenetically close species, for example a group of different bird species whose legs differ in their average length. These comparisons are complex because there are no universal ontogenetic timemarkers. The method of event pairing attempts to overcome this by comparing the relative timing of two events at a time. This method detects event heterochronies, as opposed to allometric changes. It is cumbersome to use because the number of event pair characters increases with the square of the number of events compared. Event pairing can however be automated, for instance with the PARSIMOV script. A recent method, continuous analysis, rests on a simple standardization of ontogenetic time or sequences, on squared change parsimony and phylogenetic independent contrasts. ==Effects== ===Paedomorphosis=== Axolotls retain gills and fins as adults; these are juvenile features in most amphibians. Paedomorphosis can be the result of neoteny, the retention of juvenile traits into the adult form as a result of retardation of somatic development, or of progenesis, the acceleration of developmental processes such that the juvenile form becomes a sexually mature adult. Neoteny retards the development of the organism into an adult, and has been described as \\"eternal childhood\\". In this form of heterochrony, the developmental stage of childhood is itself extended, and certain developmental processes that normally take place only during childhood (such as accelerated brain growth in humans), is also extended throughout this period. Neoteny has been implicated as a developmental cause for a number of behavior changes, as a result of increased brain plasticity and extended childhood. Progenesis (or paedogenesis) can be observed in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Axolotls reach full sexual maturity while retaining their fins and gills (in other words, still in the juvenile form of their ancestors). They will remain in aquatic environments in this truncated developmental form, rather than moving onto land as other sexually mature salamander species. This is thought to be a form of hypomorphosis (earlier ending of development) that is both hormonally and genetically driven. The entire metamorphosis that would allow the salamander to transition into the adult form is essentially blocked by both of these drivers. Paedomorphosis may play a critical role in avian cranial evolution. The skulls and beaks of living, adult birds retain the anatomy of the juvenile theropod dinosaurs from which they evolved. Extant birds have large eyes and brains relative to the rest of the skull; a condition seen in adult birds that represents (broadly speaking) the juvenile stage of a dinosaur. A juvenile avian ancestor (as typified by Coelophysis ) would have a short face, large eyes, a thin palate, narrow jugal bone, tall and thin postorbitals, restricted adductors, and a short and bulbous braincase. As an organism such as this aged, they would change greatly in their cranial morphology to develop a robust skull with larger, overlapping bones. Birds, however, retain this juvenille morphology Evidence from molecular experiments suggests both fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and members of the WNT signalling pathway have facilitated paedomorphosis in birds. These signalling pathways are known to play roles in facial patterning in other vertebrate species. This retention of the juvenile ancestral state has driven other changes in the anatomy that result in a light, highly kinetic (moveable) skull composed of many small, non-overlapping bones. This is believed to have facilitated the evolution of cranial kinesis in birds which has played a critical role in their ecological success. ===Peramorphosis=== Irish elk skeleton with antlers spanning and a mass of Peramorphosis is delayed maturation with extended periods of growth. An example is the extinct Irish elk. From the fossil record, its antlers spanned up to 12 feet wide, which is about a third larger than the antlers of its close relative the moose. The Irish elk had larger antlers due to extended development during their period of growth. Another example of peramorphosis is seen in insular (island) rodents. Their characteristics include gigantism, wider cheek and teeth, reduced litter size, and longer lifespan. Their relatives that inhabit continental environments are much smaller. Insular rodents have evolved these features to accommodate the abundance of food and resources they have on their islands. These factors are part of a complex phenomenon termed Island syndrome. With less predation and competition for resources, selection favored overdevelopment of these species. Reduced litter sizes enable overdevelopment of their bodies into larger ones. A 1901 comparison of a frog tadpole (a vertebrate) and a tunicate larva; in 1928 Walter Garstang proposed that vertebrates derived from such a larva by neoteny. The mole salamander, a close relative to the axolotl, displays both paedomorphosis and peramorphosis. The larva can develop in either direction. Population density, food, and the amount of water may have an effect on the expression of heterochrony. A study conducted on the mole salamander in 1987 found it evident that a higher percentage of individuals became paedomorphic when there was a low larval population density in a constant water level as opposed to a high larval population density in drying water. This had an implication that led to hypotheses that selective pressures imposed by the environment, such as predation and loss of resources, were instrumental to the cause of these trends. These ideas were reinforced by other studies, such as peramorphosis in the Puerto Rican Tree frog. Another reason could be generation time, or the lifespan of the species in question. When a species has a relatively short lifespan, natural selection favors evolution of paedomorphosis (e.g. Axolotl: 7‚Äì10 years). Conversely, in long lifespans natural selection favors evolution of peramorphosis (e.g. Irish Elk: 20‚Äì22 years). ===Across the animal kingdom=== Heterochrony is responsible for a wide variety of effects such as the lengthening of the fingers by adding extra phalanges in dolphins to form their flippers, sexual dimorphism, the neotenous origin of the vertebrates from a tunicate larva, and the polymorphism seen between insect castes. Neoteny in human development ===In humans=== Several heterochronies have been described in humans, relative to the chimpanzee. In chimpanzee fetuses, brain and head growth starts at about the same developmental stage and grow at a rate similar to that of humans, but growth stops soon after birth, whereas humans continue brain and head growth several years after birth. This particular type of heterochrony, hypermorphosis, involves a delay in the offset of a developmental process, or what is the same, the presence of an early developmental process in later stages of development. Humans have some 30 different neotenies in comparison to the chimpanzee, retaining larger heads, smaller jaws and noses, and shorter limbs, features found in juvenile chimpanzees. ==Related concepts== The term \\"heterokairy\\" was proposed in 2003 by John Spicer and Warren Burggren to distinguish plasticity in timing of the onset of developmental events at the level of an individual or population. ==See also== * Ontogeny and Phylogeny ==References== ==See also== * Developmental biology * Embryogenesis * Evolutionary biology * Phylogeny Category:Developmental biology Category:Evolutionary developmental biology ","title":"Heterochrony"},{"id":"1429584","text":"Roger Montgomery (1925‚Äì2003) was an American architect, and Professor at Washington University in St. Louis and University of California, Berkeley.. ==Early life and education== Roger Montgomery was born in New York City to parents Graham Livingston Montgomery and Anne Cook and lived in Greenwich Village until 1930, when he moved to Port Washington, Long Island. In 1945 he was accepted into the United States Army, where he served in an intelligence unit in occupied Germany as a radio operator. He attended a John Dewey- influenced grade school in Port Washington. In high school he was voted ‚ÄòMost Likely to Succeed‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Great Orator‚Äô. He was excused from military service in 1941 because of a punctured eardrum and subsequently enrolled in Oberlin College, but was dismissed from the college in 1945. Montgomery began his architectural work in 1948 as an apprentice in Springfield, Ohio and was soon successful, in part because of a shortage of architects and large post- war boom in construction. From 1955 to 1956 he attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he received a Masters of Architecture degree under professors Josep Llu√≠s Sert and Sigfried Giedion, while studying with classmates Fumihiko Maki and Ben Weese. ==Career== *1957: Began position as professor of architecture at Washington University in St. Louis.

By age 23 he held 53 French patents. He emigrated to the United States in 1886 where he worked as an assistant to French-born William Kennedy Laurie Dickson at the Edison Laboratories. Lauste contributed to the development of the leading predecessor to the motion picture projector, the Kinetoscope, an invention for which Edison would claim credit. Lauste left Edison in 1892. Lauste also worked on an idea for a combustible gasoline engine; he did develop a working model in the 1890s but gave up when told that such a noisy device would never be widely used. He then worked with Major Woodville Latham, for whom he engineered the Eidoloscope and assisted with the design of the Latham loop. (Later, Dickson would credit Lauste with the loop's invention.) The Eidoloscope was demonstrated for members of the press on 21 April 1895 and opened to the paying public on 20 May, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo- Barnett prize fight, taken from Madison Square Garden's roof on 4 May. Thanks to the Latham loop inside the camera, the entire fight could be continuously shot on a single reel of film. He held regular displays of the pictures that summer in a Coney Island tent. He joined the American Biograph Company in 1896 and remained there for four years before moving to Brixton, England. In 1904 he prepared his first sound-on-film model. On 11 August 1906 he (along with Australian Robert R. Haines and Briton John S. Pletts) applied for a British patent; their application was granted patent No. 18057 in 1907 for \\"a process for recording and reproducing simultaneously the movements or motions of persons or objects and the sounds produced by them,\\" i.e., a strip of 35 mm celluloid film containing both image frames and a sound strip. In 1911 he exhibited a sound film in the United States, possibly the first-ever American showing of a movie using sound-on-film technology. Before he could market his system more widely, though, World War I intervened. From 1928 until his death, Lauste was a consultant for Bell Telephone Laboratories. With his wife, Melanie, he had a son, Emile, and two stepsons, Clement and Harry E. LeRoy. ==See also== * Ernst Ruhmer * Photographophone ==References== ==Sources== *Eyman, Scott (1997).

Its solubility is 0.77 grams per liter (g/l) in water and 2.9 g/l in ethanol.Merck Index, 11th ed., 7213 Phenolsulfonphtalein It is a weak acid with pKa = 8.00 at . A solution of phenol red is used as a pH indicator, often in cell culture. Its color exhibits a gradual transition from yellow (Œªmax = 443 nm) to red (Œªmax = 570 nm) over the pH range 6.8 to 8.2. Above pH 8.2, phenol red turns a bright pink (fuchsia) color.Merck Index, 13th ed., 7329 PhenolsulfonphthaleinBeilstein 5-19-03-00457 In crystalline form, and in solution under very acidic conditions (low pH), the compound exists as a zwitterion as in the structure shown above, with the sulfate group negatively charged, and the ketone group carrying an additional proton. This form is sometimes symbolically written as and is orange-red. If the pH is increased (pKa = 1.2), the proton from the ketone group is lost, resulting in the yellow, negatively charged ion denoted as HPS‚àí. At still higher pH (pKa = 7.7), the phenol's hydroxy group loses its proton, resulting in the red ion denoted as PS2‚àí. In several sources, the structure of phenol red is shown with the sulfur atom being part of a cyclic group, similar to the structure of phenolphthalein. However, this cyclic structure could not be confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Several indicators share a similar structure to phenol red, including bromothymol blue, thymol blue, bromocresol purple, thymolphthalein, and phenolphthalein. (A table of other common chemical indicators is available in the article on pH indicators.) ==Phenolsulfonphthalein test== Phenol red was used by Leonard Rowntree and John Geraghty in the phenolsulfonphthalein test to estimate the overall blood flow through the kidney in 1911. It was the first test of kidney function and was used for almost a century but is now obsolete. The test is based on the fact that phenol red is excreted almost entirely in the urine. Phenol red solution is administered intravenously, the urine produced is collected. By measuring the amount of phenol red excreted colorimetrically, kidney function can be determined. ==Indicator for cell cultures== Phenol red, 40 ŒºM: colors in cell culture medium at a pH range from 6.0 to 8.0. Most living tissues prosper at a near-neutral pH; that is, a pH close to 7. The pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, for instance. When cells are grown in tissue culture, the medium in which they grow is held close to this physiological pH. A small amount of phenol red added to this growth medium will have a pink-red color under normal conditions. Typically, 15 mg/l are used for cell culture. In the event of problems, waste products produced by dying cells or overgrowth of contaminants will cause a change in pH, leading to a change in indicator color. For example, a culture of relatively slowly dividing mammalian cells can be quickly overgrown by bacterial contamination. This usually results in an acidification of the medium, turning it yellow. Many biologists find this a convenient way to rapidly check on the health of tissue cultures. In addition, the waste products produced by the mammalian cells themselves will slowly decrease the pH, gradually turning the solution orange and then yellow. This color change is an indication that even in the absence of contamination, the medium needs to be replaced (generally, this should be done before the medium has turned completely orange). Since the color of phenol red can interfere with some spectrophotometric and fluorescent assays, many types of tissue culture media are also available without phenol red. ==Estrogen mimic== orthotolidine indicator solution Phenol red is a weak estrogen mimic, and in cell cultures can enhance the growth of cells that express the estrogen receptor. It has been used to induce ovarian epithelial cells from post- menopausal women to differentiate into cells with properties of oocytes (eggs), with potential implications for both fertility treatment and stem cell research. ==Use in swimming pool test kits== Phenol red, sometimes labelled with a different name, such as \\"Guardex Solution #2\\", is used as a pH indicator in home swimming pool test kits.Guardex Solution 2 - Phenol Red Material Safety Data Sheet Chlorine can result in the bleaching of the dye in the absence of thiosulfate to inhibit the oxidizing chlorine. High levels of bromine can convert phenol red to bromophenol red (dibromophenolsulfonephthalein, whose lowered pKa results in an indicator with a range shifted in the acidic direction ‚Äì water at pH 6.8 will appear to test at 7.5). Even higher levels of bromine (>20 ppm) can result in the secondary conversion of bromophenol red to bromophenol blue with an even lower pKa, erroneously giving the impression that the water has an extremely high pH despite being dangerously low.Effect of Bromine on Phenol Red in pH Tests ==References== ==External links== *Video of phenol red activity demonstration and medium preparation Category:PH indicators Category:Triarylmethane dyes Category:Phenols Category:Benzenesulfonates ","title":"Phenol red"},{"id":"1429599","text":"Deathspell Omega is a French black metal band formed in 1998 in Poitiers. Their lyrical content deals primarily with Satanism on a metaphysical level ‚Äì as the band has stated that \\"all other interpretations of Satan are intellectually invalid\\" ‚Äì and other various theological topics. They have also released a trilogy of concept albums which focus on the theological aspects of God, Satan and man's relationship with the two. They released their sixth album The Synarchy of Molten Bones on 8 November 2016. and their seventh, The Furnaces of Palingenesia, on 24 May 2019; the last of these reflects a shift in lyrical focus to anti-authoritarian political themes. Some of their lyrical inspiration has also revolved around existentialist themes coming from the French surrealist Georges Bataille, whom the band has cited several times as their largest literary influence, as well as the German idealist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. == Biography == Initially, Deathspell Omega produced raw, traditional black metal akin to Darkthrone's Transilvanian Hunger. However, their 2004 release, Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice, marked a change to a vastly more technical, experimental, and well-recorded sound featuring such musical influences as Russian Orthodox chanting and choral music. The band's work after Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice has been even more experimental and technical, with their output in 2005‚ÄîK√©n√¥se, \\"Mass Grave Aesthetics\\" and \\"Diabolus absconditus\\"‚Äîtotaling nearly eighty minutes in length, longer than Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice. The second volume of the band's trilogy, Fas ‚Äì Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum, was released on 16 July 2007, outside the United States, and the following day within the United States, to considerable acclaim. The band released another EP in January 2009, entitled Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon. The final album in the trilogy, Paracletus, was released by Norma Evangelium Diaboli and Season of Mist on 9 November 2010. The band's final work related to the trilogy, titled Drought, was released on 22 June 2012. Deathspell Omega's full-length album, The Synarchy of Molten Bones, was made available early to download and stream on 31 October 2016 with a full physical release on 8 November. There is little to no concrete information about Deathspell Omega's lineup‚Äîthey do not have any official website, social media platform or promotional photos, have never performed live and do not list credits in their releases. Finnish musician Mikko Aspa is most commonly cited as the vocalist. It is known that Hirilorn vocalist Shaxul was Deathspell Omega's vocalist until 2002, and has gone on record as leaving due to displeasure with the band's shift in themes. Early interviews were deeply critical of the black metal scene, and the last interview they agreed to until 2019 was conducted by their North American label The Ajna Offensive, with questions and answers sent through the band's exclusive label, Norma Evangelium Diaboli, to preserve their identity. In a 2018 interview with Loudwire, Tobias Forge, lead singer of the band Ghost, stated that the French synthwave artist Carpenter Brut (Franck Hueso) was Deathspell Omega's producer. The band's seventh full-length album, The Furnaces of Palingenesia, was released on May 24, 2019, and reflects a shift in lyrical focus for the band. The album is presented as a manifesto from an authoritarian dictator speaking for a political faction referred to as \\"the Order\\"; it is explicitly intended to deconstruct authoritarian regimes of both the left and the right. The band recorded the album live in a studio using analogue gear, and it was mastered more quietly than most of the band's preceding material, also reflecting a shift in production approach. A month later, the band conducted its first interview in fifteen years with Niklas G√∂ransson of the website Bardo Methodology, during which they discussed the album's themes in detail. The band discussed a major impetus for the interview and the album being the Doomsday Clock being at two minutes to midnight, citing concerns over the degradation of the natural environment and the growing presence of authoritarian politics. They referenced Maximillien Aue, the villainous narrator of Jonathan Littell's novel The Kindly Ones, in discussing the narration style of the album, contrasting his perspective with Winston Smith's from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. They compared their politics to those of their largest literary inspiration, Georges Bataille, noting that Bataille opposed both the authoritarianism of the left from the Soviet Union and the authoritarianism of the right from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The band noted that a major purpose of The Furnaces of Palingenesia was to \\"shatter a myth that‚Äôs so central to stability both on an individual and civilisational level: the impervious necessity to believe that what we do is just, that we are just, that good and evil in intent and deed are as distinct as night and day.\\" They also argued: :: Twice, man committed the highest of crimes: by waging an absolutist war against nature and, therefore, against life itself. And, secondly, by severing the bond to nature and forging an anthropocentric worldview that places man above everything else and, therefore, can be used to justify just about anything ‚Äì no matter how short- sighted or ill-advised ‚Äì so long as it appears to serve mankind‚Äôs interests. Extracting man from the natural order, by intent if not in effect, was a sign of hubris which remains literally without equivalent and whose resulting devastations will know no equivalent either. Listen carefully enough and you‚Äôll hear demonic snigger. Without naming any of their members directly, the band also confirmed suspicions of an ideological rift within the band, noting, \\"A minority of the collective‚Äôs contributors ‚Äì shall we say, parts of the second circle ‚Äì who‚Äôve been invited to partake because of their incredible talents as musicians are involved with earthly politics, but stand on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum and are therefore irreconcilable political foes.\\" However, they noted that the music and lyrics were authored by the \\"French core of the collective\\". This clarification was done in the wake of backlash against Deathspell Omega due to their long time collaboration with Mikko Aspa who has long been accused of having connections and links with various NSBM acts from a myriad of European metal scenes. ==Line-up== Current members *Hasjarl - guitar (1998-) *Khaos - bass (1999-) *Mikko Aspa - vocals (2003-) Past members *Yohann Pasquier - drums (1998-1999) *Shaxul - vocals (1998-2002) ==Discography== * Infernal Battles (2000) * Inquisitors of Satan (2002) * Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice (2004) * Fas ‚Äì Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum (2007) * Paracletus (2010) * The Synarchy of Molten Bones (2016) * The Furnaces of Palingenesia (2019) === Compilation albums === * Manifestations 2000‚Äì2001 (2008, collection of material originally released on LP on the splits with Moonblood and M√ºtiilation and the Black Metal Blitzkrieg compilation) * Manifestations 2002 (2008, eight previously unreleased tracks, initially written for the Crushing the Holy Trinity compilation and a planned split with Cantus Bestiae) === EPs === * K√©n√¥se (2005) * Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon (2008), standalone release of the band's contribution to the split album with S.V.E.S.T. * Mass Grave Aesthetics (2008), originally released in 2005 on the 'From the Entrails to the Dirt' split. * Diabolus Absconditus (2011), originally released in 2005 on the 'Crushing the Holy Trinity' split. * Drought (2012) === Split releases === * Clandestine Blaze / Deathspell Omega ‚Äì Split (2001) * Sob A Lua Do Bode / Demoniac Vengeance (2001, split LP with Moonblood) * Split with M√ºtiilation (2002) * From the Entrails to the Dirt (Part III) (2005, split LP with Malicious Secrets) * Crushing the Holy Trinity (Part I: Father) (2005, V/A LP with Stabat Mater, Clandestine Blaze, Musta Surma, Mg≈Ça, and Exordium) * Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum (2008, split EP with S.V.E.S.T.) === Demos === * Disciples of the Ultimate Void (1999, entire release is included as the final four tracks of the band's first album, Infernal Battles) === Compilation appearances === * \\"Black Crushing Sorcery\\" on Black Metal Blitzkrieg (2001, End All Life Productions) === Box sets === * Untitled 5LP vinyl box (2009): includes Infernal Battles, Inquisitors of Satan, Manifestations 2000‚Äì2001, Manifestations 2002, and the band's side of the split with Clandestine Blaze. * Untitled 7LP vinyl box (2012): includes Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice, K√©n√¥se, Diabolus Absconditus, Mass Grave Aesthetics, Fas ‚Äì Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum, Chaining the Katechon, Paracletus, and Drought == References == == External links == * [ Allmusic biography] * MusicMight biography Category:French black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Season of Mist artists Category:French musical groups from Nouvelle-Aquitaine ","title":"Deathspell Omega"},{"id":"1429601","text":"Northern Manitoba is the most northerly region of the Canadian province of Manitoba, added to the province during the last major expansion of its boundaries in 1912.

Its total population at the 2011 census was 88,146, which was only 7.3% of Manitoba's total population in the 2011 census. The largest municipality is the city of Thompson. Other major population centers include the city of Flin Flon and the town of The Pas. Indian reserves comprise more than 49% of the region's population. There are 54 reserves with a total population of 40,572. The largest of these are Norway House 17 and Peguis 1B. ===Major communities=== The following communities are within the Northern Region of Manitoba:Manitoba. 2009 *Churchill *Flin Flon *Gillam *Gods River *Grand Rapids *Granville Lake *Ilford *Leaf Rapids *Lynn Lake *Mystery Lake *Snow Lake *South Indian Lake *The Pas *Thompson ==Infrastructure== Northern Manitoba is accessed by two Provincial Trunk Highways: PTH 10 to Flin Flon and PTH 6 to Thompson, as well as a network of smaller roads. These are extended in the winter by an additional network of winter roads. Northern Manitoba is served by a single rail line running north from Winnipeg, via eastern Saskatchewan. The Canadian National Railway operates the line as far as The Pas. At The Pas, the line splits into branches. The Keewatin Railway Company owns the branch connecting The Pas to Pukatawagan, while the Hudson Bay Railway operates a cargo-only branch to Flin Flon and a mixed-use branch connecting to Churchill. All rail service between The Pas and Churchill was suspended from 2017 to 2018 due to a washout of tracks north of Amery. Via Rail passenger service operates on these lines as part of its Winnipeg‚ÄìChurchill service. Air transport provides access to many northern communities with 58 airfields in the region. Calm Air and Perimeter Aviation provide scheduled passenger service into larger northern communities. Chartered bush planes land on lakes when airfields are not available. ==See also== * First Nations in the Northern Region of Manitoba * Nelson River Hydroelectric Project * Southern Manitoba ==References== *C.

From 1977 to 1981, he was the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. ==Background== West was born in Camden, South Carolina. He was reared in the Kershaw County farming community of Charlotte Thompson. In May 1923, his father, along with 76 other people, was killed in a fire at the nearby Cleveland School. His mother and maternal grandmother escaped unharmed from the fire. West was thereafter reared by his determined single mother. In 1942, he married his childhood sweetheart, Lois Rhame. The couple had a daughter and two sons.Former SC first lady remembered for championing causes That same year, he graduated from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, and enlisted in the United States Army as a major, an intelligence officer, during World War II, assigned to stateside service.Billy Hathorn, Review of Philip G. Grose, Looking for Utopia: The Life and Times of John C. West (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 2011), pp. 257-258 ==Political career== Following the war, West earned a law degree in 1948 from the University of South Carolina in the capital city of Columbia. From 1948 to 1952, he served on the South Carolina Highway Commission. In 1954, he coordinated the unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidacy of Edgar A. Brown, who lost in a write-in campaign waged by former Governor Strom Thurmond, then a Democrat but in 1964 a defector to the Republican Party. John C. West, circa 1970s From 1955 to 1967, West served in the state senate from Kershaw County. At the time he was a segregationist but felt uncomfortable denying basic rights to African Americans and by the time he was lieutenant governor was a \\"southern moderate\\" on racial issues. He was assigned to several committees which studied public school curriculum, investigated the activities of the Communist Party of the United States of America, monitored the state Development Board, examined state support for the nursing profession and junior colleges, and recommended revisions to the state constitution. West was the 80th Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina, having served from 1967 to 1971. Elected lieutenant governor in November 1966, he and Robert Evander McNair, the governor, and Ernest Hollings, a former governor elected to a long-term stint in the U.S. Senate, succeeded in thwarting Strom Thurmond's daring attempt to stampede the white electorate of their native state from a century of Democratic hegemony into the Republican Party, which had prevailed in South Carolina in 1964 at the presidential level for the first time since the disputed election of 1876. Thurmond nevertheless won his first term as a Republican in that same general election. The GOP had also made a strong presidential bid in the state in 1960, but John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon for the state's electoral votes that year. In the 1970 gubernatorial election, in which McNair was constitutionally barred from seeking a second full term, West with 53.2 percent of the vote defeated U.S. Representative Albert W. Watson, a Democrat-turned-Republican who carried Thurmond's backing. Watson finished with 45.9 percent of the ballots cast. A former state legislator, Alfred W. Bethea of Dillon, polled 2 percent of the vote as the nominee of George Wallace's former American Independent Party. West's running- mate for lieutenant governor, Earle Morris Jr., of Pickens defeated Watson's running mate, advertising executive James M. Henderson of Greenville, by about the same percent of the vote as West had prevailed over Watson.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965-1970\\", South Carolina Historical Magazine Vol. 89 (October 1988), pp. 237-238 As governor, West was known for his accessibility with the media and his openness with legislators. In carrying out his duties, he kept a recurring eye on history and left much archival material for future researchers. He worked to increase employment opportunities in the state. The Orangeburg Times and Democrat wrote that West's \\"greatest single success was in the field of economic growth. ... With the state's growing income and new jobs, the historic trend of out-migration ... was halted. Under West, South Carolina in October 1971 held its first ever integrated state fair in Columbia. On March 28, 1973, the South Carolina Legislature ratified an amendment to the state constitution that allowed restaurants to serve mixed drinks. Ambassador West meeting with President Carter After his tenure as governor, West returned for two years to private law practice until he was appointed the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a position that he held during the Jimmy Carter administration. Newly appointed as ambassador to Saudi Arabia, West outlined his plan to Dee Workman, a high- ranking Mobil Oil executive, who reported directly to William Tavoulareas, to encourage communication between the public and private sectors of both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. He began by setting up visits by members of Congress, including Senator Jacob Javits, to allow them to see firsthand the \\"problems and opportunities\\" of the Saudi economy. In his 1997 oral history, West commented on his strategy of helping the Saudis with their image: \\"It didn't take a rocket scientist or a smart fellow to realize the public relations of the Arab world was just nonexistent.\\" In a five-point formula for potential peace in the region, Carter endorsed the creation of a Palestinian state, an issue still opposed by conservatives. A leading Jewish Democratic Party contributor said that West was more \\"the Saudis' ambassador to the United States\\", rather than the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as he had been appointed. ==Death and legacy== After returning to the United States, he became a Professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of South Carolina. He endowed a professorship at The Citadel, which currently resides in The Citadel School of Humanities and Social Sciences. From 1993 until his death from cancer in 2004 at Hilton Head Island, he had been a partner in the law firm of Bethea, Jordan, and Griffin. He was Presbyterian. Philip G. Grose, a former staff member for both Governors McNair and West and later a research associate at the University of South Carolina's Institute for Southern Studies, wrote a 2011 biography of West entitled Looking for Utopia: The Life and Times of John C. West. Grose took the \\"looking for Utopia\\" line from McNair, who once described his friend and colleague West as \\"an idealist ... always looking for Utopia\\". Grose depicts West as a determined statesman who shaped his career by championing causes of the underprivileged in a state with more than its share of poverty and denied opportunities to many of its citizens. Grose concludes that West \\"was right about a lot of things, as it turned out, and his Utopian quest left a permanent, undeniable, and irreversible impact on a state whose residents ordinarily did not like the idea of change.\\" John \\"Jack\\" West, III called his father \\"a combination of John C. Calhoun and Atticus Finch.\\"Philip G. Grose, Looking for Utopia: The Life and Times of John C.

It was Jon Pertwee's last serial as the Third Doctor, and marks the first, uncredited appearance of Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. It marks the last regular appearance of Mike Yates. This serial introduces the term \\"regeneration\\". The serial is set in England and on the planet Metebelis Three. In the serial, the fired salesman Lupton (John Dearth) allies with a race of psychic spiders called the Eight-Legs to gain power. ==Plot== Following the events of Invasion of the Dinosaurs, Mike Yates was discharged from UNIT and is now attending a Tibetan meditation centre in rural England. Sarah Jane Smith visits him and they witness some curious events, seemingly organised by a resident called Lupton, and his cronies. Mike and Sarah stumble across Lupton performing an incantation, which conjures up a giant spider. It jumps on Lupton‚Äôs back and then disappears. The spider manifests itself in Lupton‚Äôs head, telling him to seek out and locate a certain blue crystal. The Third Doctor has developed an interest in psychic ability, but his testing of a clairvoyant called Professor Clegg backfires when his subject has a heart attack. It is triggered when Clegg comes into contact with a blue crystal from Metebelis Three (sent back from the Amazon by Jo Grant), which caused him to see the image of deadly spiders. Sarah returns from the retreat and she and the Doctor swap spider tales. Meanwhile, Lupton has also arrived at UNIT HQ and steals the crystal from the Doctor‚Äôs laboratory. A multi-vehicle chase ensues which Lupton escapes by teleporting himself back to the monastery. Once there, the spider reveals that it is plotting against some of its sisters back on Metebelis Three. The spiders and the crystal originate from the same blue planet in the Acteon Galaxy the Doctor the last visited (during The Green Death). The Doctor and Sarah now make for the monastery and tell the deputy abbot, Cho-Je, that something is very amiss. The crystal is taken by Tommy, a handyman with learning difficulties, whose mind is opened and by the power of the crystal. Lupton is teleported to Metebelis Three, unwittingly allowing Sarah to follow him. She soon meets the human slave inhabitants of the planet, a generally dispirited bunch, other than the rebellious Arak, who is in hiding. The planet is ruled by the Eight-Legs or giant spiders, and their Queen is the supreme ruler. They govern using guards chosen from among the planet's Two-Leg (human) population and their own phenomenal mental powers, amplified by the blue stones of the planet. The Doctor arrives and makes contact with Arak, who explains that the Metebelians are the descendants of the crew of an Earth space ship, which crashed hundreds of years before. A spider on board found its way to the Blue Mountains where, through the effect of the crystals, its progeny grew larger and cleverer. The Doctor works out that a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù stone can absorb and reject the power of the blue crystals. He starts a revolt among the humans, now protected by these stones, but this is not effective. Far into the Blue Mountains the Doctor explores there and encounters the Great One, an enormous spider which controls the world of Metebelis and desires power over other domains too. She craves the crystal as it will complete a lattice of hundreds of similar crystals on her web and magnify her mental powers immensely. She knows the crystal is still on Earth and sends the Doctor there to get it for her. He flees back to Earth with Sarah, not knowing the Queen spider has now implanted itself in his companion's mind. Tommy has given the crystal to the abbot, K‚Äôanpo Rimpoche, who is an elderly Time Lord and the one-time hermit mentor of the Doctor. He now lives in peaceful exile on Earth. He tells the Doctor of Sarah's control and they work together to expel the Queen Spider. A fight breaks out in the monastery between Lupton‚Äôs cronies and the Abbot‚Äôs men. The Abbot advises the Doctor to take the crystal to the Great One. He suggests that, as the Doctor started this chain of events by removing the crystal in the first place, it is up to him to put it back. He departs in the TARDIS with the crystal. On Metebelis Three, Lupton has been killed by the spiders after falling out with the Spider Queen. When the TARDIS lands, the Doctor heads to the cave of the Great One with the crystal. He warns her of the danger of completing the lattice but she does so anyway. However, the forces unleashed are too strong for the Great One and the positive feedback kills her and the other spiders. A vast wave of deadly radiation floods the cave. The Doctor, now very weak, staggers back to the TARDIS and away. Weeks later, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sarah are in the Doctor's laboratory when the TARDIS materialises and on exiting it the Doctor collapses on the floor. The abbot K‚Äôanpo arrives in his new body, having regenerated into the form of Cho-Je, who was a sort of forward projection of his soul. He tells them that the Doctor will change too and before their eyes the Doctor regenerates into his fourth incarnation. ==Production== The final story of Season 11 (to have been titled The Final Game) was originally intended to write out the character of the Master (played by the recently deceased Roger Delgado), with the villainous Time Lord sacrificing his life to save the Doctor. The railway station at which Sarah Jane arrives in Part One is Mortimer, near Reading. Producer and director Barry Letts later said in an interview in 2004 that he was unhappy with the scenes on Metebelis, which \\"never looked right\\". ===Cast notes=== Ysanne Churchman had provided the voice of Alpha Centauri in both The Curse of Peladon (1972) and its sequel The Monster of Peladon (the serial immediately preceding Planet of the Spiders), she would briefly reprise the role in \\"Empress of Mars\\" (2017). Kismet Delgado, the widow of Roger Delgado, was one of the voices for the Spiders. Carl Forgione would later play Nimrod in Ghost Light (1989). Christopher Burgess had previously played Swann in The Enemy of the World (1968). ==Broadcast and reception== The story was edited and condensed into a single omnibus episode broadcast on BBC1 at 2:45 pm on 27 December 1974, reaching 8.6 million viewers. The compilation was included on the DVD release of the complete story.http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/ Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \\"Grotesquely over padded and stuck with bad CSO, Planet of the Spiders is not the celebration of an era that it should have been.\\" However, they felt that the regeneration scene \\"almost atones for this\\". In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five. He praised the regeneration and wrote that the story was \\"fun\\". He noted that some of the cliffhangers were \\"unusually feeble\\", but the first was one of the best. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the story three out of five stars, writing that it was \\"enjoyable\\" despite \\"not the great sendoff that Pertwee should have received\\" with padding and weak special effects. Reviewing the serial for SFX, Ian Berriman rated the serial three and a half out of five stars and described it as \\"a mix of the fresh and the hokey\\". While he noted that some of plot was repetitive and traditional, he praised the inclusion of Buddhism. In 2010, Alasdair Wilkins of io9 called the story a \\"mash-up of a bunch of different types of Third Doctor stories\\", but the plot was not enough to stretch out over six episodes and so a lot of unnecessary elements were added. However, Wilkins felt that it was a good thematic end for the Third Doctor, and named it the third best regeneration but the third worst regeneration story. In 2009, SFX listed Sarah Jane with the spider on her back as the tenth scariest Doctor Who moment. ==Commercial releases== ===In print=== A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in October 1975 as Doctor Who and the Planet of the Spiders. The novel's prologue shows Jo Grant and her husband Professor Jones in the Amazon jungle following the events of The Green Death. Harry Sullivan is referred to as Doctor Sweetman. ===Home media=== The serial was released on VHS in April 1991 as a double pack. It was released on DVD in the UK on 18 April 2011, and in the USA and Canada on 10 May 2011. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 110 on 20 March 2013. ==References== ==External links== * *That Doctor Who Episode with the Hovercraft Chase: A Retrospective ‚Äî A tongue-in-cheek analysis of Planet of the Spiders Part Two. *Planet of the Spiders on BBCWorldwideTV YouTube channel ===Target novelisation=== * Category:Third Doctor serials Category:Doctor Who serials novelised by Terrance Dicks Category:1974 British television episodes Category:Fourth Doctor serials Category:Spiders in popular culture ","title":"Planet of the Spiders"},{"id":"1429630","text":"upright=1.4 Vitascope was an early film projector first demonstrated in 1895 by Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. They had made modifications to Jenkins patented Phantoscope, which cast images via film and electric light onto a wall or screen. The Vitascope is a large electrically-powered projector that uses light to cast images. The images being cast are originally taken by a kinetoscope mechanism onto gelatin film. Using an intermittent mechanism, the film negatives produced up to fifty frames per second. The shutter opens and closes to reveal new images. This device can produce up to 3,000 negatives per minute.Lathrop, George P. ‚ÄúStage Scenery and the Vitascope.‚Äù The North American Review 163.478 (1896): 377-381. JSTOR. Web. 18 Oct. 2014. With the original Phantoscope and before he partnered with Armat, Jenkins displayed the earliest documented projection of a filmed motion picture in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana. Armat independently sold the Phantoscope to The Kinetoscope Company. The company realized that their Kinetoscope would soon be a thing of the past with the rapidly advancing proliferation of early cinematic engineering. By 1897, just two years after the Vitascope was first demonstrated, the technology was being nationally adopted. Hawaii and Texas were among the first to incorporate the Vitascope into their picture shows. Vitascope was also used briefly as a trademark by Warner Brothers in 1930 for a widescreen process used for films such as Song of the Flame. Warner was trying to compete with other widescreen processes such as Magnascope, Widevision, Natural Vision (no relation to the later 3-D film process), and Fox Grandeur.David Coles, \\"Magnified Grandeur, Widescreen 1926-1931\\" ==History== Thomas Edison was slow to develop a projection system at this time, since his company's single-user Kinetoscopes were very profitable. However, films projected for large audiences could generate more profits since fewer machines were needed in proportion to the number of viewers. Thus, others sought to develop their own projection systems. One inventor who led the way was Charles Francis Jenkins who created the Phantoscope. Jenkins was behind the earliest documented projection of a motion picture before an audience. Using film and electric light, the film of a vaudeville dancer was projected in Richmond, Indiana on June 6, 1894. Woodville Latham, with his sons, created the Eidoloscope projector which was presented publicly in April 1895. William Kennedy Dickson apparently advised the Lathams on their machine, offering technical knowledge, a situation which led to Dickson leaving Edison's employment on April 2, 1895. Dickson formed the American Mutoscope Company in December 1895 with partners Herman Casler, Henry Norton Marvin and Elias Koopman. The company, which eventually became the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, soon became a major competitor to the Edison Company. During the same period, C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat modified Jenkins' patented Phantoscope. It was publicly demonstrated in Atlanta in the Autumn of 1895 at the Cotton States Exposition. The two soon parted ways, each claiming credit for the invention. Armat showed the Phantoscope to Raff & Gammon, owners of the Kinetoscope Company, who recognized its profit potential in the face of declining kinetoscope business. They negotiated with Armat to purchase rights to the Phantoscope and approached Edison for his approval. The Edison Manufacturing Company agreed to manufacture the machine and to produce films for it, but on the condition it be advertised as a new Edison invention named the Vitascope. Edison skeptics argue that the Vitascope has a jaded past. In addition, critics claim the Vitascope was nothing more than a repackaging of the phantoscope with slight modifications. The Vitascope's first theatrical exhibition was on April 23, 1896, at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City. Other competitors soon displayed their own projection systems in American theaters, including the re-engineered Eidoloscope, which copied Vitascope innovations; the Lumi√®re Cin√©matographe, which had already debuted in Europe in 1895; Birt Acres' Kineopticon; and the Biograph, which was marketed by the American Mutoscope Company. The premiere of the Vitascope was a quick response to threat of losing a very large amount of money to the Lumiere Cinematographe, which vaudeville managers were about to invest in. Even though the Lumiere Cinematographe existed since 1895, it had not gained popularity in the US yet, as it had already in the UK. People were going crazy for the Lumiere Cinematographe especially in London. Raff and Gammon recognized that they would get more money and positive exposure by releasing their technology ahead of the Lumiere Cinematographe in the United States. After the Vitascope made its infamous debut in Manhattan, the device was distributed across the nation including exhibitions in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Portland, Scranton, New Haven, New Orleans, New London, Cleveland, Buffalo, San Francisco, Asbury Park, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles and more. The Vitascope‚Äôs exhibition made its way across 25 cities in one summer. The Vitascope, along with many of the competing projectors, became a popular attraction in variety and vaudeville theaters in cities across the US. Motion pictures soon became starring attractions on the vaudeville bill. Exhibitors could exhibit films from the Edison inventory. The Edison Company developed its own projector known as the Projectoscope or Projecting Kinetoscope in November 1896, and abandoned marketing the Vitascope. == Marketing == Thomas Edison and Thomas Armat profited greatly while many investors defaulted, even ending up in the red in some cases. Investors lost money on the Vitascope due to how it was marketed for audiences.Musser, Charles. ‚ÄúThe Vitascope.‚Äù The Emergence of Cinema: The American Cinema to 1907 1.1 (1990): 109-132. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 18 Oct. 2014. Raff and Gammon were in charge of franchising in the US and Canada. They would offer investors the opportunity to buy out the rights to use the Vitascope exclusively in their state. This created somewhat of a monopoly effect for a short-time and essentially forced audiences to take whatever the exhibitor was giving them. Raff & Gammon put the cart before the horse when they began their marketing campaign. At the time they only had approximately 20 films for Vaudeville managers to use. They did not have the resources to continually realize that update the audience‚Äôs cinematic experience with new films.Allen, Robert C. ‚ÄúVitascope/Cin√©matographe: Initial Patterns of American Film Industrial Practice.‚Äù Journal of the University Film Association 31.2 (1979): 13-18.

The state's intent was not only to honor such large families but also to increase financial assistance for pregnant women, mothers of large families, and single mothers, and to promote an increased level of health in mother and child. The award was established in 1944 and continued to exist until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. ==Award history== USSR 1945 stamp The honorary title \\"Mother Heroine\\" was established on July 8, 1944 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Its statute, including multiple increases in available state pensions for these families or single mothers, was amended 15 times from its original establishment until the last amendment contained in Decree number 20 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of May 7, 1986. ==Award statute== The honorary title \\"Mother Heroine\\" was awarded to mothers bearing and raising 10 or more children. The title was accompanied by the bestowal of the Order \\"Mother Heroine\\" and a certificate conferred by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. It was awarded upon the first birthday of the last child, provided that nine other children (natural or adopted) remained alive. Children who had perished under heroic, military or other respectable circumstances, including occupational diseases, were also counted. The award was created simultaneously with the Order of Maternal Glory (Russian: –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω \\"–ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–ª–∞–≤–∞\\") and the Maternity Medal (Russian: –ú–µ–¥–∞–ª—å –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞), intended for women with five to nine children. They were also entitled to a number of privileges in terms of retirement pension, the payment of public utility charges, and the supply of food and other goods. Approximately 430,000 women were awarded this title during its existence. If worn with honorary titles of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence. ==Award description== The honorary title \\"Mother Heroine\\" entitled the recipient to wear the Order \\"Mother Heroine\\", which was a gold star with silver straight rays between the arms forming an inverted pentagon; it was suspended by a silver-plated ring through the suspension loop to a metallic, red-enameled scroll-shaped mount bearing the gilt relief inscription, \\"MOTHER HEROINE\\" (). ==Post-Soviet awards== Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the award was abolished in most post-Soviet republics. * In the Russian Federation it was abolished in 1991 but replaced in 2008 with the Order of Parental Glory. * In Tajikistan it was withdrawn in 1996 to discourage large families. * In Ukraine it was canceled upon independence but restored in 2001.Gender, Politics and Society in Ukraine, University of Toronto Press, 2012, * In Kazakhstan, mothers of 10 or more children have since 1995 been awarded the Altyn Alka (–ê–ª—Ç—ã–Ω –∞–ª–∫–∞, \\"Golden pendant\\") and mothers of eight or nine children have received the Kumis Alka (–ö—É–ºi—Å –∞–ª–∫–∞, \\"Silver pendant\\"). ==See also== * List of awards honoring women * Orders, decorations, and medals of the Soviet Union * Order of Maternal Glory * Order of Parental Glory Russian Federation * Order of Mother, Belarus * Cross of Honour of the German Mother * M√©daille de la Famille fran√ßaise * Family in the Soviet Union * Natalism ==References== *–û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω \\"–ú–∞—Ç—å-–≥–µ—Ä–æ–∏–Ω—è\\" at Ordena i Medali SSSR ==External links== * Legal Library of the USSR Category:Natalism Category:Soviet honorary titles Category:Civil awards and decorations of the Soviet Union Category:Orders, decorations, and medals for women Category:Awards established in 1944 Category:Awards disestablished in 1991 Category:1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union Category:Demographics of the Soviet Union ","title":"Mother Heroine"},{"id":"1429643","text":"Josef Rumler (20 July 1922 in Chlumec nad Cidlinou ‚Äì 1 November 1999 in Prague) was a Czech poet, literary critic, historian, editor and translator from Polish language and to Esperanto. == Garners == * Vyn√°≈°en√≠ housl√≠ (1970) * Hrnek rann√≠ho ml√©ka (1973) * V√Ωstup na horu ≈ò√≠p (1978) Category:Czech poets Category:Male poets Category:Czech male writers Category:1922 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Czech Esperantists Category:20th-century poets Category:20th-century male writers Category:Czech translators Category:People from Chlumec nad Cidlinou Category:20th-century translators ","title":"Josef Rumler"},{"id":"1429649","text":"Jean Lur√ßat Art auction in Amsterdam 1958, including a painting by Jean Lur√ßat Jean Lur√ßat (; 1 July 1892 ‚Äì 6 January 1966) was a French artist noted for his role in the revival of contemporary tapestry. ==Biography== He was born in Bruy√®res, Vosges, the son of Lucien Jean Baptiste Lur√ßat and Marie Emilie Marguerite L'Hote. He was the brother of Andr√© Lur√ßat, who became an architect. After his secondary education at √âpinal, he enrolled at La Facult√© des sciences de Nancy and studied medicine. He went to Switzerland and Germany (Munich) and in leaving his educational path, he went to the workshop of Victor Prouv√©, the head of the √âcole de Nancy. ==Painting and the War== In 1912, Jean Lur√ßat took residence in Paris with his brother Andr√©. He enrolled at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, then at the workshop of the engraver, Bernard Naudin. He met painters such as Matisse, C√©zanne, Renoir; his friends included Rainer Maria Rilke, Antoine Bourdelle, and Elie Faure. Lur√ßat and three associates founded the Feuilles de Mai (The leaves of May), a journal of art in which these celebrities participated. He then became an apprentice of the painter Jean-Paul Lafitte with whom he had an exhibition at La facult√© des sciences de Marseille. His first journey to Italy was interrupted in August by the declaration of war. Back in France, Lur√ßat joined the infantry, but was evacuated on 15 November after falling ill. During his recovery to health, in 1915, he practised painting and lithography. In July 1916, he returned to the front, but was evacuated once again due to injury. He never returned to the front. In September, his art was put on exhibition in Z√ºrich. ==Discovery of tapestry== In 1917, Jean Lur√ßat made his first tapestries: Filles Vertes (Green Girls) and Soir√©e dans Grenade (Evening in Grenada). At the end of the war in 1918, he returned to Switzerland where he had a holiday in Ticino (Swiss Italy), with Rilke, Busoni, Hermann Hesse and Jeanne Bucher. His second exhibition took place in Z√ºrich in the same year. In 1920, he travelled extensively: Berlin, Munich, Rome, Naples. Then he took up residence in Paris with Marthe Hennebert. It was she who wove two tapestries: P√™cheur (Fisherman) and Piscine (Swimming pool). He unveiled in the same year, at Le Salon des Ind√©pendants, two tapestries and four paintings. He met the art merchant √âtienne Bignou. In 1921, Jean Lur√ßat met Louis Marcoussis, he discovered Picasso and Max Jacob, and created decoration and costumes for Le spectacle de la Compagnie Pitoeff: \\"He who receives slaps\\", and then spent the autumn near the Baltic sea. The following year, he created his fifth tapestry, Le Cirque (the circus), for Mme. Cuttoli. His first personal exhibition took place in Paris in April and September. He made a large decoration on a wall (no longer visible today) at the Castle of Villeflix. Then he went to Berlin, where he met Ferruccio Busoni. During the next two years Lur√ßat resumed travelling. In 1923 he went to Spain; in 1924 he went to North Africa, the Sahara, Greece and Asia Minor. Upon his return, he signed a contract without exclusivity with his friend, √âtienne Bignou. His brother Andr√© built his new house, Villa Seurat, in Paris. He devoted a portion of the year 1924 to the making of his sixth tapestry, Les arbres (The trees). On 15 December, Lur√ßat married Marthe Hennebert and traveled in 1925 to Scotland, then Spain and northern Africa. Upon his return, he took up residence at La Villa Seurat. He participated in several expositions with Raoul Dufy, Marcoussis, Laglenne and others. He revealed, at the home of Jeanne Bucher, elements of decoration (carpets and paintings) of Le Vertige, a film by Marcel l'Herbier. In 1926, he exhibited in Paris and Brussels, and participated in collective exhibitions in Vienna, Paris, and Anvers. His fame began due to several articles devoted to him. ==Years of glory== With the company of Marthe, he departed in 1927 for the Orient and spent the summer in Greece and Turkey. He decorated the lounge of the family of David David-Weill. There are four tapestries in developing and implementing L'Orage (The storm), for George Salles (Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, National Museum of Modern Art). He returned to Greece and Italy (Rome) in 1928 before embarking in October for the United States of America, for his first exhibition in New York. He spent 1929 in Marco. In 1930 he had exhibitions in Paris, London, New York, and Chicago; he created nine drypoint illustrations for Les Limbes (The limbo) by Charles-Albert Cingria; and he made another visit to America. In that same year he divorced Marthe Hennebert. In 1931 he married Rosane Timotheef and they took up residence in Vevey (Switzerland). He wrote several articles about painting, and reduced his production of pictures. In December, 1932, Lur√ßat participated in the exhibition S√©lections with Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Derain and Raoul Dufy; the event was organised in New York by the Valentine Gallery. Being aligned with the far left, from then on he often mixed his political opinions with his art. In 1933, he was living in New York. He created the decoration and the costumes for the Jardin Public (Public Garden), a ballet by George Balanchine. 1933 also saw his first tapestry sewn at Aubusson, following the new and revolutionary technique that he developed. == Lur√ßat and the revival of French tapestry == In order to fully appreciate and understand the works of Jean Lur√ßat, one must view them in the context of the history of tapestry, in particular, the downfall of its existence during the rise of the Renaissance. It was during this time that tapestry was somewhat re-invented, where by traditional techniques were misplaced in the likening of tapestry to paintings by artists of the likes of Raphael. Jean Lur√ßat is largely responsible for its revival in the 20th century when he redefined the importance of designing tapestry in a way that embraced the integrity of authentic tapestry from the middle ages, inspiring artists like Picasso to acquire the skills to design for tapestry. It was in the 15th century that tapestry, in its authentic form, was first recorded as being practiced. By this time the technique had been mastered which gives us no reference as to when it was first put into practice. What we do know is that during the rise of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century, the art of tapestry was alienated by a demand for tapestry to imitate painting as closely as possible. This allowed for traditional techniques, like hachure and hatching, to fall by the wayside allowing the art of tapestry to experience a kind of identity crisis. Techniques like shape-building dominated this new presence, creating an aesthetic dissimilar to that of traditional tapestry in that it achieved shading and implied dimension by building shapes as opposed to blending shapes and colour with the above mentioned techniques. This, in essence, created a new art form; a derivative of tapestry, effectively superseding it. Western European tapestry history spans the foundation of the Gobelins manufactory 1662 to the beginning of the third republic of France in 1871. It is in this time period where the subservience to painting is observed as being the dominant characteristic of tapestry. The commission by Pope Leo X in the early sixteenth century of The Acts of the Apostles by Raphael, to be woven in the Brussels workshops is thought be the turning point whereby tapestry was to, from that point on, be fashioned after designs supplied by painters. The relationship of painting to tapestry in fact began in 1476 where the first counts of tapestry weaving were in Belgium, and painters had ostracized weavers for creating their own cartoons. Thus indicating that tapestries were originally made in the likeness of paintings, and is where traditional techniques were formed. Furthermore, in the 1500s, painters (with paint) and later designated specialized glazers (with only ink, wild-grain colour or chalk) were commissioned to touch up and create defined lines around the shapes on the surface of woven tapestry. The need for this integration of painting on tapestry has been observed as being the result of poor tapestry cartoons. Jean Lur√ßat himself began as a painter and tapestry weaver in 1915. He became intrigued by tapestry weaving when he was learned of its history. Lur√ßat was especially influenced by Apocalypse of Angiers (14C) which he viewed in 1937. He came away from this experience more sure that emotional content and reduction of means, or \\"scale of pre-arranged colour\\" were of ultimate importance to tapestry design. Lur√ßat was already practicing these values and was pleased to see them validated by such an illustrious and historically powerful piece. Consequently, his convictions about how tapestry should be designed, regarded and used became stronger. The opening statement of Lurcat's Designing Tapestry, distinguishes tapestry and easel paintings by their location: tapestries custom made for a specific, large wall. Lur√ßat later refers to tapestry as a medium whose most authentic form is: 1) embedded with content; 2) is invariably large scale (15 meters X 15 meters), and; 3) is designed and thought of as being forever connected to architecture. The artist asserts: \\"I want to remind you that Tapestry knew its proudest moments in a time when a style of extremely grandiose architecture reigned supreme\\". There are many things about tapestry that Lur√ßat is sure of, e.g. the emphasis of content in relation to economy; the importance for tapestry to continue to thrive as a partner to architecture. The most recurring theme in his book, Designing Tapestry, is that of the strict design guidelines of which should be followed in order for the weaver, who is presumably not the designer, to have no artistic freedom so as for the designer to be able to design a tapestry cartoon and achieve exactly what they had envisioned as a result. In essence, Lur√ßat recommends a non-interpretive code in which the weaver would have no question as to what the designer requires of them. Additionally, Lur√ßat makes it very clear that the idea of fashioning a tapestry after a painting, especially one that had originally been painted with no intention of becoming a tapestry, was to Lur√ßat misrepresentative and disrespectful to the art form. ==Expositions in the USSR== In 1934, Lur√ßat returned to New York where he participated in the creation of new decoration and costumes for a choreography of Balanchine; which he unveiled in Chicago and Philadelphia. Then he returned to Paris and Vevey for the summer. At summer's end, he departed for Moscow, where he had an exhibition at the Mus√©e Occidental (Western Museum), then at the museum of Kiev. In 1935, he painted the Dynamiteros in Spain; with inspiration from the revolution and the War of Spain. In Paris, he participated in the activities of the Association of the revolutionary authors and artists. Then, he followed, with Malraux and Aragon, the Journ√©es d'Amit√© pour l'Union Sovi√©tique (The Journeys of Friendship for the Soviet Union). In 1936, he exhibited in London and released his first tapestry, made at La Manufacture des Gobelins (The Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory, Paris), Les Illusions d'Icare (The Illusions of Icare). In 1937, he met Fran√ßois Tabard. ==Vision of the apocalypse== In 1936, Jean Lur√ßat was inspired when he saw the tapestry L'Apocalypse (The Apocalypse), which was woven in the 14th century. In 1938, Moisson was sewn. In 1939, he exhibited in New York and in Paris. In September, he took up residence in Aubusson with Gromaire and Dubreuil in order to renovate the art of tapestry, which at the time had fallen to a low point. His innovative technique used a simplified palette and robust weaving at broad point. During this period he abandoned oil painting in favour of poster paints. The Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne (National Museum of Modern Art) acquired Jardin des Coqs (Garden of Roosters) and L'Homme aux Coqs (The Man of the Roosters), of which the cardboard would be destroyed by the SS in 1944 in Lanzac. In 1940, he collaborated with Andr√© Derain and Raoul Dufy. ==Resistance== In June 1944, he associated himself with the fighters of the communist resistance, namely, Tristan Tzara, Andr√© Chamson, Ren√© Huyghe, Jean Cassou, and Jean Agamemnon. He was put on the Comit√© de Lib√©ration (Comity of Liberation). He also met Simone Selves, who would later become his wife. His adoptive son, Victor was captured while on an intelligence mission in France and was put to death. Lur√ßat would not learn of his disappearance until the following year. ==Legacy== Lur√ßat died on 6 January 1966 in Saint-Paul de Vence. During the 1980s, his widow Simone established the Mus√©e Jean Lur√ßat de Saint-Laurent les Tours and the Mus√©e Jean Lur√ßat et de la Tapisserie contemporaine, and bequeathed many of his works to posterity. ==References== ==External links== * Vid√©o: Jean Lur√ßat (FR) * Vid√©o: Jean Lur√ßat(FR) * The UNESCO Works of Art collection * Mobilier national : Jean Lur√ßat Category:1892 births Category:1966 deaths Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters Category:Modern painters Category:Landscape artists Category:Members of the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts Category:Acad√©mie Colarossi alumni Category:Articles containing video clips Category:People from Vosges (department) Category:Artists from Paris Category:French tapestry artists Category:French Resistance members ","title":"Jean Lur√ßat"},{"id":"1429656","text":"Newman, originally named Mount Newman until 1981, is a town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is located about north of Perth, and north of the Tropic of Capricorn. It can be reached by the Great Northern Highway. Newman is a modern mining town, with homes contrasting with the surrounding reddish desert. The Hickman Crater is north of Newman. ==History== Mount Newman Newman was established as Mount Newman by Mt. Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of BHP) in 1966 as a company town to support the development of iron ore deposits at nearby Mount Whaleback. The town takes its name from nearby Mount Newman, named in honour of government surveyor Aubrey Woodward Newman (son of Edward Newman who also died young) who died of typhoid aged 28 at Cue on 24 May 1896, while on an expedition from Nannine to the Ophthalmia Range. William Frederick Rudall then took charge of the expedition and named Mount Newman to honour his deceased leader. Aboriginal occupation of the area extends to around 26,000 years. The Martu people comprise about a dozen language groups that extend across the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts. The Martu progressively lost their land and nomadic lifestyle as European expansion crept inland from the late 19th Century. Western exploration, the establishment of Christian missions, and gold discoveries at Marble Bar and Wiluna led to Indigenous people moving from their traditional lands. ==Commercial area and amenities== Dome Cafe seen at the front of Parnawarri Typical of company towns, Newman is laid out with a core, where shopping and hotels are located, surrounded by residential areas, with more industrial activities on the outskirts. There are two supermarkets in town (one Woolworths and an IGA), two shopping plazas, three hotels, and three bars/restaurants outside of those contained in the hotels. One public outdoor pool serves the town's population. In late 2017, Parnawarri Retail centre (Parnawarri meaning \\"united\\" or \\"all together\\" in Nyiyaparli) was opened and housed the towns second supermarket (IGA) as well as a Dome coffeehouse, SportsPower and a Chicken Treat. BHP invested $30 million to build the retail centre. The town contains Newman Primary School, South Newman Primary School, Newman Senior High School, and Rawa Community School. ==Transport== Iron deposits A privately owned railway, the Mount Newman railway, was constructed linking it to Port Hedland which itself was upgraded to handle shipment of the ore to the world market. On 21 June 2001 a train long, comprising 682 ore cars and eight locomotives made the Newman‚ÄîPort Hedland trip and is listed as the world's longest ever train.Hamersley Freight Line, Australia railway- technology.com, accessed: 4 November 2010BHP breaks its own heaviest train record Railway Gazette International, published: 1 August 2001, accessed: 5 November 2010 The ore trains are typically over 2 km long. Newman is also a service town to the nearby mining settlements like Tom Price and Paraburdoo. The town is served by Newman Airport. ==Architecture== Being founded in the 1960s, Newman's architecture reflects the modernist styles of that decade and the next, being predominantly functional and devoid of detail or embellishment. As the town was founded and built by a steel company, the majority of buildings use a steel frame construction. This applies to the homes themselves, most of them being two prefabricated halves inserted together into a steel I-section frame, the columns of which are left exposed on the exterior of the home. This construction method serves not only to showcase the company's product, but also gives strong resistance to cyclone winds which can affect the region from time to time. For this same reason most houses are elevated from the ground by a few steps. Many houses also have large air-conditioning units situated next to them to provide adequate cooling against the very hot summer temperatures. ==Climate== Newman has a semi-arid climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. The temperature reaches or exceeds for many days in the summer. On 15 January 1998, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of . Precipitation is sparse, but the influx of monsoonal moisture in the summer, which generally begins in December and lasts until April, raises humidity levels and can cause occasional heavy storms. Winter months are mild to warm, with daily high temperatures ranging from the to , and low (nighttime) temperatures rarely dipping below . ==See also== * Pilbara historical timeline * Pilbara newspapers * Red Dog Story ==References== ==Further reading== * Austin, Noel (1999) The Newman story, 1967-1969.

The broad, low dominantly andesitic stratovolcano rises above the northern end of the Kanto Plain. It contains an elliptical, 3 x 4 km summit caldera with post- caldera lava domes arranged along a NW-SE line. Lake Ono is located at the NE end of the caldera. An older stratovolcano was partially destroyed by edifice collapse, producing a debris-avalanche deposit along the south flank. A series of large plinian eruptions accompanied growth of a second stratovolcano during the Pleistocene. Construction of the central cone in the late-Pleistocene summit caldera began following the last of the plinian eruptions about 31,000 years ago.

It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest. The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. PƒÅ·πáini defines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means \\"the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son.\\" When a person says \\"I am Vipparla-gotra\\", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent. According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.2.4 Kashyapa, Atri, Vasistha, Vishvamitra, Gautama Maharishi, Jamadagni and Bharadvaja are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to PƒÅ·πáini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotr√¢vayava. One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye. There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras. ==Origins== As a Rigvedic terms, gotra simply means \\"cow pen\\" or \\"herd of cows\\". The specific meaning \\"family, lineage kin\\" (as it were \\"herd within an enclosure\\") is relatively more recent, first recorded around the mid-1st millennium BCE (e.g., Chandogya Upanishad). These \\"lineages\\" as they developed among the Brahmins of that time meant patrilineal descent. The Brahmanic system was later adopted by other communities, such as the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas All members of a particular gotra are believed to possess certain common characteristics by way of nature or profession. Many theories have been propounded to explain this system. According to the vedic theories, the Brahmins are direct descendants of seven sages who are believed to be the sons of Brahma, borne out of his mind through yogic prowess. They are (1) Shandilya, (2) Gautama Maharishi, (3) Bharadwaja, (4) Vishvamitra, (5) Jamadagni, (6) Vashista, (7) Kashyapa and (8) Atri . To this list, Agastya is also sometimes added. These eight sages are called gotrakarins, from whom all 49 gotras (especially of the Brahmins) have evolved. For instance, from Atri sprang the Atreya and Gavisthiras gotras. According to Robert Vane Russell, many gotra of hindu caste are of totemic origin which are named after plants, animals and natural objects. These are universal among non-aryan or primitive tribes, but occurs also in Hindu castes. The commonest totem names are those of animals, including several which are held sacred by Hindus, as bagh or nahar, the tiger; bachas, the calf; murkuria, the peacock; kachhua or limun, the tortoise; nagas, the cobra; hasti, the elephant; bhainsa, the buffalo; richaria, the bear; Kuliha, the Jackal, kurura, the dog; karsayal, the deer; hiran, the black-buck and so on. The utmost variety of names is found, and numerous trees, as well as rice and other crops, salt, sandalwood, cucumber, pepper, and some household implements such as pestle, rolling slab, serves as name of clans. Thus name of the rishis or saints, Bharadwaj means a lark, Kaushik means descended from Kusha, Agastya from agasti flower, Kashyapa from kachhap a tortoise, Taittiri from titar a partridge. Similarly the origin of other rishis is attributed to animals, Rishyasringa to an antilope, Mandavya to a frog, Kanada to an owl. The usual characteristic of totemism is that the member of clan regard themselves as related to or desendend from, the animals or trees which the clan takes its name, and abstain from killing or eating it. A gotra must be distinguished from a kula. A kula is equal to a particular family , or equal to modern day \\"clans\\", Kula does relate to lineage or caste. ==Marriages and gotras== Marriages within the gotra ('sagotra' marriages) are not permitted under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system. The compound word 'sagotra' is a union of the words 'sa' and 'gotra', where 'sa' means same or similar. It is common practice in preparation for Hindu marriage to inquire about the kula-gotra (meaning clan lineage) of the bride and groom before approving the marriage. People within the gotra are regarded as siblings and marrying such a person would be thought of as taboo. In almost all Hindu families, marriage within the same gotra is not encouraged or practised since they are believed to be descended from the same family. Marriages between different gotras are therefore encouraged. But marriage within the jaati is allowed and even preferred. For example, Jats and Rajputs have 3000 Gotras and Mudirajas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have 2600 Gotras. Gotra is always passed on from father to children among most Hindus. However, among the Malayali and Tulu people it is passed on from mother to child. The tatsama words 'sahodara' (brother) and 'sahodari' (sister) derive their roots from the Sanskrit word 'saha udara' (‡§∏‡§π‡•ã‡§¶‡§∞) meaning co-uterine or born of the same womb. In communities where gotra membership passed from father to children, marriages were allowed between a woman and her maternal uncle, while such marriages were forbidden in matrilineal communities, like Thiyyars and Tuluvas, where gotra membership was passed down from the mother. A much more common characteristic of South Indian Hindu society is permission for marriage between cross-cousins (children of brother and sister) as they are of different gotras. Thus, a man is allowed to marry his maternal uncle's daughter or his paternal aunt's daughter, but is not allowed to marry his paternal uncle's daughter. She would be considered a parallel cousin, of the same gotra, and therefore to be treated as a sister. North Indian Hindu society not only follows the rules of gotra for marriages, but also has many regulations which go beyond the basic definition of gotra and has a broader definition of incest.Sex and Marriage: Marriage Rules (Part 1). palomar.edu. Some communities in North India do not allow marriage with certain other clans, based on the belief that both clans are of the same patrilineal descent. In other communities, marriage within the gotra of the mother's father, and possibly some others, is prohibited. A possible workaround for sagotra marriages is to perform a 'Dathu' (adoption) of the bride to a family of different gotra (usually dathu is given to the bride's maternal uncle who belongs to different gotra by the same rule) and let them perform the 'Kanyadanam' ('kanya' (girl) + 'danam' (to give)). Such workarounds are used in rare cases, and the acceptability is questionable. Vedic Hinduism recognises eight types of marriages, thus predominantly follows the principles as stated in the Manu Smriti, referring to 8 types of marriages, the roles and responsibilities of husband and wife and the purpose of marriage. Eight types of marriages are, (1) Brahma Vivaha, (2) Arsa Vivaha, (3) Daiva Vivaha, (4) Prajapatya Vivaha, (5) Gandharva Vivaha, (6) Asura Vivaha, (7) Rakshasa Vivaha, and (8) Paishacha Vivaha. The first four types of marriages reflect the paradigm behind arranged marriages. The last three are prohibited as per Manu Smriti, out of which the last two are condemned. The Gandharva marriage is an analogy to the modern-day love marriages, where the individuals have the liberty to choose their partners. Though Gandharva marriage had its due prominence in our Shahstras, but with advancement of time, Vedic Hinduism giving way to classic Hinduism, the concept of arranged marriage rose to prominence, which till today is predominant ritual for a marriage between two individuals. However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, ‡§∏‡§™‡§ø‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§§‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡•á ‡§∏‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•á ‡•§ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ã‡§¶‡§ï‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§®‡•ã‡§∞‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§®‡•á, which means that sapinda ends after seventh generations.Manu Smriti Section 5(v) of Hindu Marriage Act 1955 also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 With nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra. Even if it is known, there is hardly any way to prove its authenticity. advaita- vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-June/027680 ===Legal situation=== While the gotras are almost universally used for determining excluding marriages that would be traditionally incestuous, they are not legally recognized as such, although those within \\"degrees of prohibited relationship\\" or are \\"sapinda\\" are not permitted to marry.THE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955. Khap panchayats in Haryana have campaigned to legally ban marriages within the same gotra. A convener of the Kadyan Khap, Naresh Kadyan, petitioned the courts to seek amendment to the Hindu Marriage Act to legally prohibit such marriages. However, the petition was dismissed as withdrawn after being vacated, with the Delhi High Court warning that the Khap would face heavy penalty costs for wasting the time of the court.HC throws out plea to forbid same gotra marriages, The Hindu, June 2010. In the 1945 court case of Madhavrao vs Raghavendrarao, which involved a Deshastha Brahmin couple, the definition of gotra as descending from eight sages and then branching out to several families was thrown out by the Bombay High Court. The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \\"impossible to accept.\\" The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times, emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of the Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is a near-impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence. ==See also== * Aliyasantana * Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar * Pravaras ==References== ==Further reading== * Ruegg, D.

There are many hiking courses, and when the foliage changes color there are splendid views to be seen. The highest point is the peak of the Mt. S≈çmadake (Áõ∏È¶¨Â≤≥) reaching .It is also a National Place of Scenic Beauty as determined by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan in 1923. Mount My≈çgi, along with Mount Akagi and Mount Haruna, is one of the \\"Three Mountains of J≈çm≈ç\\". (J≈çm≈ç is an old name for Gunma.) == Overview == Mount My≈çgi is composed of many different peaks: Hakuun-zan (ÁôΩÈõ≤Â±±), Kond≈ç-san (ÈáëÊ¥ûÂ±±), Kinkei-san (ÈáëÈ∂èÂ±±), S≈çma-dake (Áõ∏È¶¨Â≤≥), Mitake- san (Âæ°Â≤≥Â±±), Ch≈çsunokashira (‰∏ÅÈ†à„ÉéÈ†≠), Yakyu-san (Ë∞∑ÊÄ•Â±±) and others. Mount My≈çgi is generally separated in its south side (known as the front side) and its north side (known as the back side). For instance, when looking at Kinkei-san from Shimonita, the mount is referred to as Nakano-take (‰∏≠‰πãÂ∂Ω). Among the many peaks of Mount My≈çgi, which is already considered having a picturesque form, the landscape of Nakano-take is very particular. Along the slope of the mountain, there is a group of rocks with unique names („É≠„Ç¶„ÇΩ„ÇØÂ≤© \\"candle rock\\" , Â§ßÁ†≤Â≤© \\"cannon rock\\", Á≠ÜÈ†≠Â≤© \\"head of the family rock\\", „É¶„É´„ÇÆÂ≤© \\"shaky rock\\", ËôöÁÑ°ÂÉßÂ≤© \\"nihilist monk rock\\") that make it praised as one of the most beautiful mountains over Japan. The starting point of the hiking course going through those rocks is Nakano- dake shrine (‰∏≠‰πãÂ∂ΩÁ•ûÁ§æ). The most famous temple of the divine mountain, My≈çgi Shrine (Â¶ôÁæ©Á•ûÁ§æ), is located on Hakuun-zan, on the east slope of Mount My≈çgi. During Edo period, people thought that the god of the mountain protected the population from fire and lightnings. Mount Fuji is located south of Mount My≈çgi. Mount My≈çgi is made out of volcanic rocks (dacite, tuff) and conglomerates. It was formed 3 million years ago, at the same time as Mount Arafune located south-west, after a volcanic caldera. Later, the soft sedimentary layer is thought to have been eroded which gave the mountain its current rugged appearance. Mount My≈çgi is designated as one of Japan's Three Great Rare Scenic Beauties and was selected as one of the 100 Landscapes of Japan. == Hiking == The landscape being very rugged, many severe accidents and deaths have been reported. As a consequence, Tomioka city introduced courses for beginners, intermediates and experienced hikers. In January 2010, Gunma prefecture officials, local authorities, the police, firemen and the hiking club discussed the issue during the \\"Meeting for the establishment of preventive measures to avoid accidents in Mount Myogi and surrounding mountains\\". The proposition of the officials to forbid hiking was rejected by the locals who wished to continue hiking. Finally, all participants agreed to increase the number of chains and to improve the quality of the routes. == Use of the name \\"My≈çgi\\" in the prefecture == * During sport festivals, many primary schools of the prefecture name their teams \\"Team Myogi\\", \\"Team Haruna\\" or \\"Team Asama\\" * The three dormitories of Tomioka Silk Mill, registered as a UNESCO World Heritage since 2014, are also named \\"Myogi Dormitory\\", \\"Haruna Dormitory\\" and \\"Asama Dormitory\\" == In popular culture == Mount My≈çgi is mentioned in the street racing manga, video game, and anime series Initial D.

This hall of fame commemorates the greatest Australian cricketers of all time, as the \\"selection philosophy for the hall of fame focuses on the players' status as sporting legends in addition to their outstanding statistical records.\\" Inductees must be retired from international cricket for at least five years. The Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was an idea conceived by the Melbourne Cricket Club to honour Australia's legendary cricketers. It was opened on 6 December 1996 by the then Prime Minister, John Howard. The hall of fame opened with ten inaugural members, ranging from Fred Spofforth, a pace bowler who retired from Test cricket in 1887, to Dennis Lillee who played his last Test match in 1984. , the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame comprises 49 members. All twelve members of the Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century are included, six of them amongst the inaugural members. The vast majority are men; Belinda Clark was the first woman admitted to the hall when she was inducted in 2014 (three years after she was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame). Clarke and Karen Rolton are the only two female Test captains to have been admitted, along with twenty-one of her male counterparts. Betty Wilson and Rolton became the second and third woman to enter the hall of fame when they were inducted in 2017 and 2018 respectively. , the selection committee comprises the Melbourne Cricket Club chairman, Peter King, former Australian Test captains, Bill Lawry and Mark Taylor, former Test batsman Paul Sheahan, the Chief Executive of Cricket Australia, James Sutherland, the Chief Executive of the Australian Cricketers' Association, Alistair Nicholson, and media representatives Gideon Haigh (writer for The Australian) and Ben Horne (writer for The Daily Telegraph).

Hathaway, or \\"Stan\\" as he was known to most of his friends and associates, was born on July 19, 1924, in Osceola, Nebraska, the fifth of six children born to Lily (Koehler) and Robert C. Knapp. Following his mother's death when he was two years old, he was adopted by a cousin, Velma, and her husband Franklin Earl Hathaway. The couple homesteaded and farmed near Huntley, Wyoming. Young Hathaway received his early education near there in one-room country schools at Table Mountain and at New Fairview, and then attended Huntley High School, where he graduated as class valedictorian in 1941.Sally Vanderpoel, \\"Stan Hathaway: A Biography\\", , Jan. 2003. After enrolling briefly at the University of Wyoming, Hathaway left school in early 1942 to enlist in the Army Air Corps following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941, and was trained as a radio operator and gunner. He was assigned to the Eighth Air Force's 401st Bomb Group, flying B-17 Bombers from England, and took part in 35 combat missions over France and Germany, with his unit often suffering heavy casualties.\\"Stanley K. Hathaway - Wyoming's Leader, Lawyer and Friend\\", Wyoming State Bar, Journal, October 2005 Issue. Wyoming State Bar On one mission under General Jimmy Doolittle over Leipzig, Germany, Hathaway's plane and crew took heavy enemy fire while making a series of three runs at their target, an oil refinery. After managing to return to base, the crew counted 115 holes in their B-17 from Nazi fighter-plane rounds and anti-aircraft flak. During their entire Leipzig mission under General Doolittle, a total of 56 American planes and more than 500 American troops were lost, and, overall, Hathaway's unit suffered a 50% casualty rate during World War II. In the fall of 1944, his crew was on a mission to Frankfurt, Germany, when their plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. They lost three engines before crash-landing in a field in France, where they were eventually rescued by the French Resistance. For his service during the War, Hathaway was the recipient of the French Croix de Guerre, U.S. Presidential Unit Citations, and five Air Medals. After his discharge from the Air Corps, Hathaway enrolled at the University of Nebraska, where he earned a bachelor's degree. He graduated from the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln College of Law in 1950. While there, he met Roberta \\"Bobby\\" Harley, and they were married on November 25, 1948. Following his graduation from law school, the Hathaways moved to Torrington, Wyoming, where Mrs. Hathaway taught mainly English at Torrington Junior High School while Hathaway established a law practice. They had two daughters, Susan and Sandra. == Political career == From 1954 until 1962, he served in Torrington as prosecuting attorney for Goshen County in southeastern Wyoming. In 1962, he was elected Chairman of the Goshen County Republican Party and Secretary of the Republican State Central Committee. In 1963, he was elected Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee and served for two years on the Republican National Committee. In 1966, Hathaway was elected governor of Wyoming, and was re-elected to a second term by a large margin in 1970. He declined to run for a third term. His tenure as governor was marked by significant reorganization of State government and the passage of new environmental laws: the enactment of air and water quality standards, surface mining regulations, and the creation of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. Other new departments created during the Hathaway administration included a Department of Recreation to oversee and improve care of state parks and to provide support for Wyoming's tourism industry, and a Department of Economic Planning and Development to promote economic growth in the state.Sally Vanderpoel, \\"Stan Hathaway: A Biography\\", , Jan. 2003 -- pp. 159-160. Wyoming's economy had been in the doldrums when Hathaway was elected governor, but he set in motion a number of initiatives which turned the economy around and saw it booming by the time he left office. Another major accomplishment during his administration was the enactment of Wyoming's first mineral severance tax in 1969, and of an amendment to the Wyoming State Constitution in 1974 creating a Permanent Mineral Trust Fund, that imposes a 1¬Ω% tax on the extraction of minerals in the State, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Trust Fund. The principal of the Trust Fund (more than $2.25 billion by 2005) can never be spent, but the income from it goes into the State's general fund. Mrs. Hathaway was also very active during her tenure as Wyoming's First Lady in the promotion of many new initiatives. These included the creation of an Arts Council supported entirely by donated funds to promote arts in the state; the establishment of an Indian Council to improve the welfare of Native Americans living on reservations in the State and to build markets for Native American crafts and other products, such as woven rugs and jewelry; and the extensive updating and expansion of government mental health programs and facilities statewide.Sally Vanderpoel, \\"Stan Hathaway: A Biography\\", , Jan. 2003 - pp. 172-174. During his tenure as governor, Hathaway also served as Chairman of the Western Governor's Conference (whose membership at the time included California Governor and future President Ronald Reagan) and as Chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, the National Governor's Conference Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Management, and the Federation of Rocky Mountain States. Among his last appointments in office was that of Richard V. Thomas to the Wyoming Supreme Court, a position that Thomas held from December 1974 until February 2001. After retiring from the governor's office in 1975, Hathaway was nominated for Secretary of the Interior by President Gerald Ford, taking office following lengthy and at times contentious confirmation hearings,Jessie Stearns, Star- Tribune Capital Bureau, \\"Defending Stan\\", The Casper Star-Tribune, Casper, Wyoming, June 3, 1975. During his brief tenure at the Department of the Interior, he was responsible for moving the federal coal leasing program forward. Health issues, however, resulted in his resignation as the Interior Secretary later that year, after which the Hathaways returned to Wyoming. == Later years and death == After returning to Wyoming in October 1975, Hathaway co-founded the law firm of Hathaway, Speight and Kunz in Cheyenne, and returned to the practice of law. He also served on the Boards of Directors of the PacifiCorp, of the Nerco, Inc., of the First Wyoming Bank, and of the Apache Corporation, and was named an Emeritus Member of the University of Wyoming's Ruckelshaus Institute for Environment and Natural Resources. In 2003, Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal awarded the \\"Governor's Art Award for Excellence in the Arts\\" to Stan and Bobby Hathaway.Robin Beaver, \\"Stan Hathaway - Wyoming's Favorite Son\\", Made in Wyoming Profiles, 2010. The Wyoming Legislature in 2005 authorized $400 million for a \\"Hathaway Student Scholarship Endowment Account\\". Under this program, Wyoming high school graduates who qualify can receive a Hathaway scholarship for the full cost of tuition and fees at the University of Wyoming, or for attendance at any community college in Wyoming. Hathaway died in Cheyenne, Wyoming, following a lengthy illness, on October 4, 2005, having been preceded in death by his wife Bobby in 2004. The Hathaways are interred in Valley View Cemetery in Torrington, Wyoming. Following his death, both houses the Wyoming State Legislature in 2006 unanimously passed a Joint Resolution memorializing Governor Hathaway as \\"one of Wyoming's greatest natural resources\\".58th Legislature, State of Wyoming, March 6, 2006 ==References== - - Category:1924 births Category:2005 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American Episcopalians Category:American prosecutors Category:Burials in Wyoming Category:Ford administration cabinet members Category:Governors of Wyoming Category:People from Osceola, Nebraska Category:People from Torrington, Wyoming Category:Politicians from Cheyenne, Wyoming Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:State political party chairs of Wyoming Category:United States Secretaries of the Interior Category:University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln alumni Category:Wyoming lawyers Category:Wyoming Republicans Category:American adoptees Category:Nebraska politicians Category:United States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II ","title":"Stanley K.

Her stage name, Bronhill, which she used from 1952, was an abbreviation of Broken Hill, which was her way of thanking her home town for its support in raising money to send her overseas for professional training as a singer.Biographies ‚Äî Australian National UniversitySimilarly, Helen Porter Mitchell chose the stage name of Nellie Melba (after Melbourne); Florence Mary Wilson chose the stage name of Florence Austral; and Elsie Mary Fischer chose the stage name Elsa Stralia (after Australia). Her European vocal teacher misheard \\"Broken Hill\\" as \\"Bro- n-hill\\". She won third prize in the Sun Aria, now known as the Sydney Eisteddfod McDonald's Operatic Aria, in 1949 and first prize in 1950. She used her prize money to fund a trip to London to further her studies. Bronhill trained in London and gained early exposure with the English National Opera (Sadler's Wells Opera) company in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. She also sang leading roles in Die Fledermaus, The Gypsy Baron, Menotti's The Telephone, Flotow's Martha and Hansel and Gretel. Her roles in Offenbach's operas, with the Sadler's Wells company, included Eurydice in Orpheus in the Underworld and Gabrielle in La Vie parisienne. In 1961 and 1962, she appeared as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music on the Australian stage. In 1964 she appeared as Elizabeth in the musical Robert and Elizabeth at the Lyric Theatre, London alongside Keith Michell as Robert Browning, a show she took to Australia in 1966. She also appeared in England in tours of two Ivor Novello musicals, Glamorous Night and The Dancing Years, the latter playing a season at the Saville Theatre in London. She also appeared as the Mother Abbess in the 1981 London revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. Bronhill was perhaps best known for the title role of Hanna Glawari in Franz Leh√°r's The Merry Widow, with the Sadler's Wells Opera (now known as English National Opera), with Thomas Round as Danilo in 1958 and revised in 1960. She sang the role more than 200 times, capturing a faithful following. Bronhill made frequent visits back to her homeland, singing in operas such as The Merry Widow, Orpheus in the Underworld, Die Fledermaus and Rigoletto at the Sydney Opera House in 1975. In 1976, she decided to move back to Australia permanently. In Australia she appeared in operas such as Il Seraglio (Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail) and a Victoria State Opera production of Donnizetti's Maria Stuarda in July 1976, directed by Robin Lovejoy with a cast including Nance Grant conducted by Richard Divall. She played operetta roles such as Josephine (H.M.S. Pinafore), Phyllis (Iolanthe) and Ruth (The Pirates of Penzance). She also had roles in The Maid of the Mountains, Call Me Madam, A Little Night Music, Nunsense, My Fair Lady and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying as well as appearing in the non-musical plays Arsenic and Old Lace and Straight and Narrow. Bronhill also appeared in the role of Mrs Crawford in the television comedy series Are You Being Served?, the Australian version of the British comedy series, as well as in Lipton Tea television advertisements singing an adaption of Fugue for Tinhorns. Bronhill was a patron of the Australian Girls Choir from the choir's beginning. There is a scholarship in her name, the June Bronhill Encouragement Scholarship, awarded each year to the chorister with the most choral prowess. A portrait of Bronhill, painted by Andrew Sibley, was entered into the 1966 Archibald Prize. In 1976 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to the music industry. In Broken Hill a street and an auditorium are named after her. Her voice was characterised as a \\"very crystal clear, diamond bright coloratura soprano\\" with \\"absolutely impeccable diction\\". Opera News noted that \\"Bronhill's crisp, bright prettiness and crystalline diction made her an ideal exponent of operetta heroines.\\" ==Personal life== Bronhill married twice, first to Brian Martin in 1951 in Sydney and second to Richard Milburn Champion de Crepigny Finny, in January 1953. Both marriages ended in divorce. She had a daughter, Carolyn Jane Finny, in May 1963 by her second marriage. ==Death== Bronhill died on 24 January 2005, aged 75, in her sleep at a Sydney nursing home. Although she had beaten breast cancer in the 1980s, her later years were marred by deafness and social isolation, and she retired in 1993. Her home town, Broken Hill, honoured her by declaring a minute's silence during the 2005 Australia Day celebrations two days after her death. Mayor Ron Page noted, \\"She is very special to us; if you ask every householder in Broken Hill, they'll be able to say, yes, they are proud of June Bronhill.\\" Then acting prime Minister, John Anderson noted, \\"The world is mourning the loss of someone who entertained millions, but it's good to see the local community here recognise one of their own in ... a very proud community celebrating the life of one of their daughters.\\" ==Autobiography== Bronhill's \\"frank and funny\\" autobiography, The Merry Bronhill, was published in 1987. EMI Australia produced a compilation album with the same title to publicise the book. ==Honours== Bronhill was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the New Year's Honours of 1976,It's an Honour and was later given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Australian Variety Club. ==References== ==Sources== *O'Connor, Patrick (1992), 'Bronhill, June' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed.

On Commercial Street in the East End and in today's Central London it is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, on its western border facing the City of London, it was one of the first (and arguably one of the finest) of the so-called \\"Commissioners' Churches\\" built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, which had been established by an Act of Parliament in 1711. The purpose of the Commission was to acquire sites and build fifty new churches to serve London's new settlements. This parish was carved out of the circa medieval Stepney parish for an area then dominated by Huguenots (French Protestants and other 'dissenters' who owed no allegiance to the Church of England and thus to the King) as a show of Anglican authority. Some Huguenots used it for baptisms, marriages and burials but not for everyday worship, preferring their own chapels (their chapels were severely plain compared with the bombastic English Baroque style of Christ Church) though increasingly they assimilated into English life and Anglican worship ‚Äì which was in the eighteenth century relatively plain. The Commissioners for the new churches including Christopher Wren, Thomas Archer and John Vanbrugh appointed two surveyors, one of whom was Nicholas Hawksmoor. Only twelve of the planned fifty churches were built, of which six were designed by Hawksmoor. ==Architecture== The interior The architectural composition of Christ Church demonstrates Hawksmoor's usual abruptness: the very plain rectangular box of the nave is surmounted at its western end by a broad tower of three stages topped by a steeple more Gothic than classical. The magnificent porch with its semi-circular pediment and Tuscan columns is attached bluntly to the western end: it may indeed be a late addition to the design intended to add further support to the tower. Like those of Hawksmoor's other London churches and many of Wren's, the central space of the nave is organised around two axes, the shorter originally emphasised by two entrances of which only that to the south remains. It has a richly decorated flat ceiling and is lit by a clerestory. The aisles are roofed with elliptical barrel-vaults carried on raised Composite order columns (cf. Wren's St James's, Piccadilly), and the same order is used for the screens across the eastern and western ends. The Venetian window at the east may show the growing influence of the revival of Palladian architecture, or it may be a rhyme with the arched pediment of the entrance portico, repeated in the wide main stage of the tower. The east window is a double window, one inside, one outside, the effect now obscured by the Victorian stained glass window between the two. ===Alterations=== In 1836, Wallen Son and Beatson, local architects and surveyors, provided a substantial estimate for repairs to the church following a fire.Webster C 2010, ‚ÄòAn alternative to Ecclesiology: William Wallen (1807-53)‚Äô in Brandwood G. 2010, ed., Seven Church Architects 1830-1930, Ecclesiology To-day, London: Ecclesiological Society,12 The church was severely altered in 1850 by Ewan Christian (better known as architect of London's National Portrait Gallery), who removed the side galleries, blocked in the windows at the corners of the central space, and combined upper and lower aisle windows to make tall, thin windows. ==Organ== The restored organ The organ in the church was inaugurated in 1735, the work of Richard Bridge, a most celebrated builder of the time. With over two thousand pipes it was, when built, the largest organ in England, a record it held for over a hundred years. In the nineteenth century work was done at various times and further changes were made in the 1920s; remarkably, much of the original Richard Bridge organ survives. The organ became derelict and was not heard in public from about 1960 onwards. The magnificent organ case, largely of walnut, and the completeness of the Georgian survivals, make this a historic instrument of national importance. The involvement of local expert Michael Gillingham was very largely responsible for the decision to have it restored to working condition. The organ parts were dismantled and removed for safe keeping and to protect them from damage during the restoration of the building. A scheme of conservative restoration was prepared by organ builder William Drake and the restored organ was installed in 2014. ==Restoration== By 1960 Christ Church was nearly derelict and services were held in the Church Hall (an ex Huguenot Chapel in Hanbury Street) as the roof of Christ Church itself was declared unsafe. The Hawksmoor Committee staved off the threat of wholesale demolition of the empty building‚Äîproposed by the then Bishop of Stepney, Trevor Huddleston‚Äîand ensured that the roof was rebuilt with funds from the sale of the bombed out shell of St John's, Smith Square, now a concert hall. A rehabilitation centre for homeless alcoholic men was housed in part of the crypt from the 1960s until 2000 when it relocated to purpose built accommodation above ground. In 1976 the Friends of Christ Church Spitalfields, an independent charity, was formed to raise money and project manage the restoration of this Grade I listed building so it could be brought back into use. Church services returned to the partially restored building in 1987 and the restoration of the building was finally complete in 2004, enabling a wide range of uses to run alongside its primary function as a place of worship. As part of the restoration process, the burial vaults beneath the church had to be cleared. Instead of hiring a commercial undertaker for this job, the Friends of Christ Church raised funds for the employment of an archaeological team, who excavated nearly 1,000 interments between 1984 and 1986. Of these, about 390 were identifiable from coffin name plates. Archaeologists and physical anthropologists took this opportunity to study Victorian mortuary practices and anthropology, including health and causes of death of the local population. The project was written up as a two-volume landmark study.Reeve, Jez; Adams, Max, The Spitalfields project.

View of Christ Church and the fruit and wool exchange in September 2013 The portico at the west end was repaired and cleaned in 1986, when Ewan Christian's re-arrangement of the aisle windows was also replaced by a recreation of the originals, scrupulously researched. The 202 ft tower and spire were consolidated and cleaned in 1997. The south fa√ßade was cleaned and repaired in 1999 revealing the striking whiteness and beauty of the Portland stone and the delicate detailing, both so quickly obscured by weather and city pollution. At the same time Hawksmoor's magnificent double flight of steps on the south side, which was removed in the nineteenth century, was rebuilt. In addition, the gate piers of the Rectory yard were repaired and the large iron gates restored. Regency style railings to the churchyard, removed in World War II, were replaced. The north and east fa√ßades were repaired and cleaned in 1999‚Äì2000. The restoration of the interior, begun in 2000 and completed in 2004, restored the fabric of the church; removed the nineteenth- and twentieth-century alterations; reinstated the original arrangement of galleries following archaeology to establish their original pattern; and has recaptured the proportions, light and clarity of Hawksmoor's original design. In 2015 the Crypt was also restored, restoring much of Hawksmoor's original walls as well as providing a caf√© area. This is accessible via a ramp to make disabled access possible and encourage use by the local community. In February 2016 the restoration of the Crypt was shortlisted in the RICS Awards 2016, London in the 'Building conservation' category. Thus, after years of neglect, the church was restored to its pre-1850 condition, working from the original building documents where possible, a process that stretched over more than 25 years. The restoration revealed the most complex and sumptuous of Hawksmoor's interiors in London. Key players in the restoration were Andrew D \\"Red\\" Mason (Project Architect and building historian from 1976 to 2004), Revd. Eddy Stride (Rector), Eric Elstob (Chair of The Friends of Christ Church and benefactor), Howard Kenward, Derek Stride and Hosten Garroway (Wardens), The Hon Simon Sainsbury (benefactor), English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. \\"Red\\" Mason worked from 1972 to 2000 with the architects Whitfield Partners, and from 2000 with Purcell Miller Tritton. ==See also== * List of churches and cathedrals of London ==References== ==External links== *Christ Church at the Survey of London **Historical account **Architectural description *Christ Church Spitalfields homepage *Great Buildings ‚Äì Christ Church *Christ Church Spitalfields building information & photos * Category:Churches completed in 1729 Category:18th-century Church of England church buildings Spitalfields Category:Nicholas Hawksmoor buildings Category:Grade I listed churches in London Category:Grade I listed buildings in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:English Baroque architecture Category:Diocese of London Category:Spitalfields Category:1729 establishments in England Category:Ewan Christian buildings Category:Commercial Street, London ","title":"Christ Church, Spitalfields"},{"id":"1429826","text":"St George's, Bloomsbury, is a parish church in Bloomsbury, London Borough of Camden, United Kingdom. It was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and consecrated in 1730. The church crypt houses the Museum of Comedy. ==History== William Hogarth, Gin Lane, with the church tower (centre) The Commissioners for the Fifty New Churches Act of 1711 realised that, due to rapid development in the Bloomsbury area during the latter part of the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries, the area (then part of the parish of St Giles in the Fields) needed to be split off and given a parish church of its own. They appointed Nicholas Hawksmoor, a pupil and former assistant of Sir Christopher Wren, to design and build this church, which he then did between 1716 and 1731. This was the sixth and last, of his London churches. St George's was consecrated on 28 January 1730 by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London. The Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope was baptised here in 1824. The wedding of F. B. Chatterton, manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane took place here in 1853. Richard Meux Benson, founder of the first Anglican religious order for men, Society of St John the Evangelist, the \\"Cowley Fathers\\", was also baptised in the church. A funeral service for Emily Davison, the suffragette who died when she was hit by the King's horse during the 1913 Derby, took place here that same year. It was conducted by Claude Hinscliff and C. Baumgarten, both part of the Church League for Women's Suffrage. Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia attended a controversial requiem for the dead of the Abyssinian War in 1937. It was until 2006 the subject of major conservation work led by the World Monuments Fund and closed to visitors, with the congregation continuing as normal in its parish life, holding services in a nearby chapel. The building reopened fully from October 2006, including a new exhibition on the church, Hawksmoor and Bloomsbury housed in its undercroft. ==Architecture== The interior The land on which the church is built (‚ÄòPloughyard‚Äô) was bought for ¬£1,000 from Lady Russell, widow of the Whig rebel Lord John Russell who had been executed in 1683. This was a substantial sum, and its expenditure on a narrow, rectangular plot of land on a North‚ÄìSouth axis, hemmed in by buildings on all sides, seemed to fly in the face of the Commissioners‚Äô 1711 stipulation that \\"no site ought to be pitched upon for the erecting [of] a new church where the same will not admit the church to be placed East and West.\\" Perhaps the orientation of the site was deemed a surmountable obstacle, especially since the site met the needs of the Commissioners in that it was situated \\"amongst the‚Ä¶ better sort‚Ä¶ [and on] the larger and more open streets, not in obscure lanes, nor where coaches will be much obstructed in the passage.\\" The land purchase was the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor, one of the two surveyors appointed by the Commissioners of the 1711 Act. Unlike others appointed by the Commissioners, Hawksmoor continued to work as a surveyor of the 1711 Act churches until his death in 1736. Of the twelve churches completed, he was responsible for designing six, of which St George's Bloomsbury was the last. His final designs for St George's, however, were only commissioned and then adopted after earlier designs by James Gibbs and Sir John Vanbrugh (who proposed building a church with the altar in the north) were rejected by the Commissioners. The stepped tower is influenced by Pliny the Elder's description of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and topped with a statue of King George I in Roman dress. Its statues of fighting lions and unicorns symbolise the recent end of the First Jacobite Rising. The portico is based on that of the Temple of Bacchus in Baalbek, Lebanon. The tower is depicted in William Hogarth's well-known engraving \\"Gin Lane\\" (1751). Charles Dickens used St George's as the setting for \\"The Bloomsbury Christening\\" in Sketches by Boz. Detail of the tower of St George's Church The statue of George I was humorously described by Horace Walpole in a rhyme: The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 24 October 1951. ==Opening times and services== Services are held on Monday & Wednesday at 1:10pm and Sunday mornings at 10:30 am. The church is usually open to visitors from 1:00pm ‚Äì 4:00pm every day of the week. (If it is not open, please visit the church office at the back of the site (entrance via Little Russell Street gate): a staff member can open it for you). St. George's runs educational workshops and lectures for schools, families and adults. It also hosts events and classes for the local community events (flower festivals, dance, choir classes). ;Location St George's Bloomsbury is located on Bloomsbury Way next door to the Bloomsbury Thistle Hotel.

The museum focuses on the history of British comedy and includes photos, posters, props, clothing and costumes, scripts, films and videos of British comedic performers and shows.

In 2011 the factory ceased production of whole cars as a result of the global crisis and the entry into force of the Free Trade Treaty, as a result of which cars imported from South Korea into the EU are exempt from 1% duty; since then, FSO has been producing of automotive sub-assemblies.Bankier.pl: lat od wyprodukowania ostatniego samochodu w FSO == Early history == FSO Warszawa M20-57 Warszawas assembled at FSO in the early 1950s FSO Syrena 104 Polski Fiat 125p sedans assembled at FSO around 1974 FSO 125p FSO Polonez (first generation of Polonez) Daewoo-FSO Polonez Atu Plus (third generation) FSO Lanos FSO Matiz Chevrolet Aveo from FSO The FSO plant was established in 1948 by the Communist Polish government in ≈ªera≈Ñ on Warsaw's eastern bank of the river Vistula, to produce automobiles for post World War II Poland. The first FSO car was the Warszawa which was essentially a Polish manufactured re-badge of the GAZ-M20 Pobeda, built under license from the Soviets. In 1953, an in-house team started development of a smaller and cheaper to manufacture car resulting in FSO's second model, the two-stroke Syrena. The Syrena, introduced in 1957, was a proprietary design of FSO; and its production was moved to the FSM car factory (Fabryka Samochod√≥w Ma≈Çolitra≈ºowych). === 125p and Polonez era === In 1965, the Polish government signed licensing agreements with the Italian auto manufacturer Fiat to manufacture select Fiat models in Poland, under the brand of Polski Fiat. In particular, the Fiat 125 was to be manufactured at FSO to replace the outdated Warszawa. The resulting model, called Polski Fiat 125p, was in fact a simplified version of the Italian 125 with Fiat 1300/1500 mechanicals, and was exported for some time as the Fiat 125p. After the licensing agreement had ended, it was rebranded as the FSO 1300/1500. It was also produced in estate (station wagon) and pick-up variants. Meanwhile, the Warszawa was manufactured concurrently until 1973. In 1978, FSO introduced a new model called the Polonez, a 5-door compact car based on the updated FSO 1500 design. The Polonez was also exported to many markets under the FSO brand. This model was to initially substitute all variants of the original 1500, but in actuality the production of the latter continued all the way until 1991. Both models were updated and revised multiple times during their production period. The Polski Fiat 125p production ended on the 26th of June, 1991. In total, 1,445,689 were manufactured. By that time, the design was 24 years old and used mechanicals which were essentially 30 years old, with only minor improvements. === Daewoo era === After the end of the Cold War, the Iron Curtain, the Fall of Communism in Poland, and with the Warsaw Pact Eastern Europe in 1989, the Polish government sought to privatize FSO by establishing a partnership with an international automaker to secure its future. Despite many attempts and negotiations, this was not the case for many years. The first full-fledged venture started in 1994, when an agreement with General Motors was signed to assemble Opel Astra in ≈ªera≈Ñ. Nevertheless, the following year FSO was sold to the Korean Daewoo Motors, which was a competitor to GM at that time. The company was then renamed Daewoo-FSO. At first, Daewoo used FSO to assemble models such as Daewoo Tico, Daewoo Nexia and Daewoo Espero. In 1997, the assembly and then full-fledged production of the Daewoo Lanos commenced, followed in 1999 by the Daewoo Matiz. Other contemporary Daewoo models like the Nubira, the Leganza, the Korando, the Musso and the Chairman were also assembled. The production of the Polonez was continued, the model was modernized, and new body styles were added. Shrinking market demand led FSO to cease Polonez production in 2002. Meanwhile, in 1998, General Motors decided to build their own factory in Gliwice, and relocated the production of the Opel Astra to this facility. GM's assembly line at FSO was used for a short period to assemble the Opel Vectra for the Polish market and then shut down completely, ending the relationship with General Motors. === Post-Daewoo FSO === Daewoo went bankrupt in 2000 leading to an acute deterioration of FSO's position in the industry. Daewoo Motors was bought out by General Motors (and its Asian partners), but overseas manufacturing subsidiaries such as Daewoo-FSO were not part of the deal. Therefore, FSO became de facto independent again. Through lengthy negotiations, the Polish government secured FSO the rights to manufacture and sell the Lanos and the Matiz until 2007. Nevertheless, FSO did not have the means to update the models, so they quickly became less and less attractive. Additionally, Daewoo's collapse caused buyers to become wary of Daewoo cars. FSO found salvation in the Ukrainian market, where Matiz and Lanos, assembled by the local partner AvtoZAZ, became very popular. In 2004, Daewoo-FSO was renamed FSO again. During this period, the Polish government was actively seeking a new strategic partner for FSO, but no major automaker expressed interest. Finally, FSO entered talks with the British MG Rover, but as talks progressed it became apparent that the British company did not have the means to complete the deal despite suggestions of the involvement of an (alternating) Chinese partner. MG Rover went into administration in 2005, putting an end to any hopes connected with it. Consequently, the UkrAVTO, the owner of ZAZ, became the only possible partner for FSO. The Ukrainian company gradually became a majority shareholder of FSO (84.31% of shares), while at the same time strengthening the cooperation between FSO and ZAZ. UkrAVTO suggested it would provide a new model for FSO to manufacture after the Matiz and Lanos licenses had expired. In mid-2006, the parent company of FSO, UkrAVTO, signed a license agreement with General Motors to produce the Chevrolet Aveo (T250) saloon, and since July 2008, the 3 and 5-door hatchback. For the production of the Aveo a new company was formed, whose shareholders were FSO (60%) and GM (40%); FSO provided the plant, while GM provided the finances. The first Aveo rolled off the FSO plant on 11 July 2007. The 100,000th Aveo rolled off the assembly lines on February 1, 2011. The license for the production of Aveo expired in February 2011 and it was not resumed for the next generation model. By March 2011 more than 1,800 employees were made redundant and the land on which the factory was built was offered for sale. Despite the sale of some of the assets, the company's authorities declared their willingness to start production within a few months of signing the contract with a potential investor, announcing the possibility of achieving the plant's performance of 250,000. cars a year. In August 2014, the president of FSO in an interview assured that despite the lack of production, the company's condition was good and it did not have debt, and even made a profit. The FSO capital group diversified its activities by producing exhaust systems, McPherson columns, fuel tanks, car electrical beams, fences, lamps, Lego blocks, subassemblies for household appliances, the group also sold and serviced cars and rented production halls and office spaces. In 2017, the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Poland, acting on behalf of the Treasury, filed a complaint with AvtoZAZ for failure to fulfill its obligations under the share purchase agreement. The State Treasury is seeking compensation from the Ukrainian company in the amount of PLN 250 million. AvtoZAZ considered the accusations made against them unfounded.Koniec fabryki na ≈ªeraniu?Drugie ≈ºycie \\"na zak≈Çadzie\\".

Friedell has been described as a polymath. Before 1916, he was also known by his pen name Egon Friedl√§nder. == Early life == Friedell's parents had immigrated to Vienna from the eastern parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Bernhard Viel (2013), \\"Egon Friedell: Der geniale Dilettant\\". Friedell was the second child of Jewish parents, Moriz Friedmann and Karoline (n√©e Eisenberger), who were running a silk manufactory in Mariahilf. His older brother, , also later became a writer and journalist. His mother left the family for another man when he was one year old, from then on he lived with his father. The divorce was made in 1887. After his father's death in 1889, Friedell lived with his aunt in Frankfurt am Main, where he would attend school, until he was expelled for unruly behaviour three years later. Even at this young age, Friedell was considered a trouble maker and free thinker. In 1897, he renounced Judaism and converted to the Lutheran faith. He attended several schools in Austria and Germany. Whilst attending school in Heidelberg in 1897, he already attended lectures on history of philosophy by Kuno Fischer.Elisabeth Flucher (2015), Traces of Immanuel Kant in Friedell‚Äôs Work. In: Violetta Waibel, Detours: Approaches to Immanuel Kant in Vienna, in Austria, and in Eastern Europe. . page 365 In 1899, he finally passed his Abitur (exit examination) after four attempts, in Bad Hersfeld. After graduation, he enrolled in Heidelberg University to study under the historian of philosophy and follower of Hegel, Kuno Fischer. Also in 1899, he had come of age and accepted his part of his father's inheritance. This enabled him to buy a tenement in Vienna at Gentzgasse 7, where he lived from then on. This is also where he tragically died. Neither of the brothers wanted to continue running the father's factory. From 1900 to 1904, Egon Friedell studied philosophy and German literature in Vienna. During that time he meet Peter Altenberg and began writing articles for M√§rz and Die Schaub√ºhne. In 1904, he received his PhD for the dissertation on Novalis als Philosoph, which he wrote under the guidance of . His dissertation was published soon after at in Munich.Elisabeth Flucher (2015), Traces of Immanuel Kant in Friedell‚Äôs Work. In: Violetta Waibel, Detours: Approaches to Immanuel Kant in Vienna, in Austria, and in Eastern Europe. . page 365 == Actor, theatre critic, essayist, translator and biographer == In 1905, he started publishing texts in Karl Kraus's journal Die Fackel. The first was Vorurteile (issue no. 190), which included the following statement: \\"The worst prejudice we acquire during our youth is the idea that life is serious. Children have the right instincts: they know that life is not serious, and treat it is a game...\\" In the following issue he published Die Lehrmittel and Das schwarze Buch, which was co-authored with Peter Altenberg. Then followed by Zwei Skizzen: Der Panamahut & Die Bolette (issue 193), Pilatus (issue 201) and Ein Schmerzensschrei (issue 202).https://fackel.oeaw.ac.at/ After these texts were published, he and Kraus fell out with each other. In 1906, Friedell began kabarett performances at venues called Cabaret Nachtlicht and '. In 1907 he directed at Intimes Theater in Vienna, which was run by his brother, Oskar Friedmann.Bernhard Viel (2013), \\"Egon Friedell: Der geniale Dilettant\\". There, he staged plays by August Strindberg, Frank Wedekind and Maurice Maeterlinck and brought them to the audience in Vienna for the first time. Friedell was doing lighting, acting and directing. Between 1908 to 1910 Friedell worked as the artistic director of the ', named after the Johann Strauss operetta. Most pieces were written either by Peter Altenberg or jointly by Friedell and Alfred Polgar, who were nicknamed the \\"Polfried AG\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131848/http://deutsch.pi- noe.ac.at/inetsem/kabar_g.htm#Fledermaus He also was acting there.https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Egon_Friedell Other people involved were Oscar Straus, Hermann Bahr, Franz Blei, Erich M√ºhsam, Hanns Heinz Ewers, Alexander Roda Roda and Frank Wedekind.Karin Ploog (2015): ...Als die Noten laufen lernten...Band 2: Kabarett-Operette-Revue-Film-Exil ... , page 38 Fritz Lang described his impressions of the Fledermaus: \\"There, amid Jugendstil decor, Kokoschka mounted his Indian fairy tale \\"Des getupfte Ei\\" [\\"The Dotted Egg\\"] on slides, writer Alfred Polgar [...] read his short prose and caustic commentary, and Friedell and other authors of rising repute presented their sketches and short plays.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/fritzlang.htm During this time, Friedell continued to publish essays and one-act plays. His first literary effort was Der Petroleumk√∂nig (Petrol king) in 1908. The parody Goethe im Examen, written jointly Alfred Polgar, in which he also played the leading role, made him famous in German speaking countries and got mentioned in the Sunday Times. He played this role repeatedly until 1938. Also in that time he wrote Soldatenleben im Frieden. In 1910, Friedell was commissioned by publisher Samuel Fischer to write a biography of the poet Peter Altenberg. Fischer, who had expected something light, was unsatisfied with Friedell's analysis and critique of culture titled Ecce poeta, and the book was not promoted in any way. Hence, the book was a commercial failure, but served to mark the beginning of Friedell's interest in cultural history.https://austria- forum.org/af/Biographien/Friedell%2C_Egon He frequented the so called \\"literary caf√©s\\" among the Viennese coffee houses, notably the Caf√© Central, where many notable people were patrons and where he got acquainted and befriended with many of them.Shachar M. Pinsker (2018), A Rich Brew: How Caf√©s Created Modern Jewish Culture In 1912, Friedell went to Berlin, wrote and performed in cabarets. In 1913, he temporarily worked as an actor for director Max Reinhardt. In 1914, suffering from alcoholism and obesity, Friedell was forced to undergo treatment at a sanatorium near Munich. Friedell was enthusiastic about the beginning of World War I, as were many of his contemporaries, and volunteered for military service but was rejected for physical reasons. In 1916, he officially changed his name to Friedell. Friedell published the Judas Tragedy in 1920 and it was staged at the Burgtheater in 1923.https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/reflexionen/vermessungen/531620-Dichter- und-Dilettant.html In 1922 published Quarry -- Miscellaneous Opinions and Quotations. In 1924, while working as a critic for the journal Stunde, Friedell was fired as a \\"traitor\\", for making satirical remarks. Between 1919 and 1924, Friedell worked as a journalist and theatre critic for various publishers including Die Schaub√ºhne, Der Merker and Neues Wiener Journal. Between 1924 and 1927 he was ensemble cast at the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, which was directed by Max Reinhardt. There he played, amongst others, roles in The Servant of Two Masters, Fanny's First Play, Intrigue and Love, The Merchant of Venice. He played with famous actors such as Hans Moser and Heinz R√ºhmann.Bernhard Viel (2013), \\"Egon Friedell: Der geniale Dilettant\\". After 1927, health problems prevented any permanent commissions, and he worked as an independent essayist, editor and translator in Vienna. Among the authors Friedell translated were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Christian Friedrich Hebbel in 1909, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, Thomas Carlyle and Hans Christian Andersen in 1914, Johann Nestroy, and Thomas Babington Macaulay in 1924. During his life he published 22 works with 15 different publishers. Additionally, he wrote for 17 different journals and newspapers. Since 1937, he worked on two unfinished books, which only were left as sketches: History of Philosophy and Novel on Alexander the Great.Elisabeth Flucher (2015), Traces of Immanuel Kant in Friedell‚Äôs Work. In: Violetta Waibel, Detours: Approaches to Immanuel Kant in Vienna, in Austria, and in Eastern Europe. . page 367 == Cultural history == === Cultural History of the Modern Age === During the early 1920s, Friedell wrote the three volumes of his Cultural History of the Modern Age, which describes events from the Black Death to World War I in an anecdotal format. In 1925, publisher Hermann Ullstein received the first volume, but was suspicious of the historiography of an actor. Five other publishers subsequently rejected the book. The first volume was finally published by Heinrich Beck in Munich in 1927 and the following two volumes in 1928 and 1931. The book proved very successful and allowed Friedell to continue his work as an author and has been translated into seven languages. His approach to history was influenced by Oswald Spengler and Jacob Burckhardt.https://austria-forum.org/af/Biographien/Friedell%2C_Egon For instance, Friedell writes; \\"All the classifications man has ever devised are arbitrary, artificial, and false, but simple reflection also shows that such classifications are useful, indispensable, and above all unavoidable since they accord with an innate aspect of our thinking.\\" Friedell summed up the Congress of Vienna as: \\"the Tsar of Russia falls in love for everyone; the King of Prussia thinks for everyone, the King of Denmark speaks for everyone; the King of Bavaria drinks for everyone; the King of W√ºrttemberg eats for everyone ‚Ä¶ and the Emperor of Austria pays for everyone.\\"British Government. Foreign & Commonwealth Office, 18 December 2012. Speech - The Foreign Office, one of the great offices of state. by William Hague, Foreign Secretary === Cultural History of Antiquity === Friedell's A Cultural History of Antiquity was planned in three volumes. Because his publisher in Germany Heinrich Beck was, since 1935, not allowed to publish any of his works, the first volume on Cultural History of Egypt's Land and of the Ancient Orient was published in 1936 by the Helikon-Verlag in Zurich. The second volume Cultural History of Ancient Greece was unfinished and published in Munich in 1950. Due to his death, he couldn't write the third volume on Cultural History of the Romans. == Censorship and suicide == In 1933, when the Nazis came to power in Germany, Friedell described the regime as: \\"the realm of the Antichrist. Every trace of nobility, piety, education, reason is persecuted in the most hateful and base manner by a bunch of debased menials\\". In 1937, Friedell's works were banned by the National Socialist regime as they did not conform to the theory of history promoted by the NSDAP, and all German and Austrian publishers refused to publish his works. On the occasion of the Anschluss of Austria, anti- semitism was rampant: Jewish men and women were being beaten in the streets and their businesses and synagogues ransacked or destroyed. Friedell, knowing that he could be arrested by the Gestapo, began to contemplate ending his own life. Friedell told his close friend, √ñd√∂n von Horv√°th, in a letter written on 11 March: \\"I am always ready to leave, in every sense.\\" On 16 March 1938, at about 22:00, two SA men arrived at Friedell's house to arrest him. While they were still arguing with his housekeeper, Friedell, aged 60, committed suicide by jumping out of the window. Before leaping, he warned pedestrians walking on the sideway where he hit by shouting \\"Watch out! Get out of the way!\\" Friedell, of whom Hilde Spiel said \\"in him, the exhilarating fiction of the homo universalis rose once again\\", was interred in the Zentralfriedhof cemetery in Vienna. In 1954, a street in Vienna was named after him.https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Egon-Friedell-Gasse In 1978, the Austrian postal service issued a stamp with his portrait in celebration of his 100th birthday.https://austria- forum.org/af/Wissenssammlungen/Briefmarken/1978/Egon_Friedell In 2005, his grave was given the honor of becoming an Ehrengrab.https://www.wien.gv.at/presse/2005/03/16/ehrengrab-widmung-fuer- schriftsteller-egon-friedell == Works == * Absinth \\"Sch√∂nheit\\" (Peter Altenberg & Egon Friedell) - eLibrary Austria Project (elib austria text in German) * Das schwarze Buch (Peter Altenberg & Egon Friedell) - eLibrary Austria Project (elib austria text in German) * Der Petroleumk√∂nig, 1908 * Der Nutzwert des Dichters - eLibrary Austria Project (elib austria text in German) * Goethe, 1908 - eLibrary Austria Project (elib austria text in German) * Ecce poeta, 1912 * Von Dante zu d'Annunzio, 1915 * Die Judastrag√∂die, 1920 * Steinbruch, 1922 * Ist die Erde bewohnt?, 1931 - eLibrary Austria Project (elib austria text in German) * Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit, 1927‚Äì31 (Engl. transl) * Kulturgeschichte √Ñgyptens und des alten Orients, 1936 * Kulturgeschichte Griechenlands, 1940 * Die Reise mit der Zeitmaschine, 1946 - translated by Eddy C Bertin into English and republished as The Return of the Time Machine * Kulturgeschichte des Altertums, 1949 * Das Altertum war nicht antik, 1950 * Kleine Portr√§tgalerie, 1953 * Abschaffung des Genies.

It is one of the largest television channels in that country. Color Visi√≥n is channel 9 in the Dominican Republic's television dial. ==History== Color Visi√≥n began regularly scheduled programming on November 30, 1969, in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros. The first transmissions were from the Matum hotel, in Santiago., In 1970, Color Visi√≥n moved its daily transmissions to Santo Domingo. There, Color Visi√≥n used the famous Hotel Jaragua's areas as television sets. One of the first show hosts was Manolo Quiroz. Later on, Dominican businessman Poppy Bermudez put a large amount of money into helping Color Visi√≥n open its own studio. The 1970s were times of growth for the company, as many locally produced programs were shown, and people such as Jack Veneno found work at the station, and a niche among Dominican television viewers.

The area got its name because it was once used for Thomas Starr King rallies and support for the Union Army during the American Civil War, earning its designation as a California Historical Landmark. Today, this one-block plaza and surrounding area is one of the largest collections of department stores, upscale boutiques, gift shops, art galleries, and beauty salons in the United States, making Union Square a major tourist destination and a vital, cosmopolitan gathering place in downtown San Francisco. Grand hotels and small inns, as well as repertory, off-Broadway, and single-act theaters also contribute to the area's dynamic, 24-hour character. The Dewey Monument is located at the center of Union Square. It is a statue of Nike, the ancient Greek Goddess of Victory. ==History== Union Square in 1905 The Square in 1968, as seen from the St. Francis Hotel Union Square was originally a tall sand dune, and the square was later set aside to be made into a public park in 1850. Union Square got its name from the pro-Union rallies held there on the eve of the Civil War. The monument itself is also a tribute to the sailors of the United States Navy. Union Square was built and dedicated by San Francisco's first American mayor John Geary in 1850 and is so named for the pro-Union rallies by Thomas Starr King that happened there before and during the United States Civil War. Since then the plaza has undergone many notable changes, one of the most significant happening in 1903 with the dedication of a tall monument to Admiral George Dewey's victory at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It also commemorates U.S. President William McKinley, who had been recently assassinated. Executed by Robert Aitken, the statue at the top of the monument, \\"Victory,\\" was modeled after a voluptuous Danish-American stenographer and artist's model, Alma de Bretteville, who eventually married one of San Francisco's richest citizens.Peter Booth Wiley, National Trust Guide‚ÄîSan Francisco: America's Guide for Architecture and History Travelers (John Wiley, 2000), pp. 377‚Äì379) Another significant change happened between 1939 and 1941 when a large underground parking garage was built under the square; this meant the plaza's lawns, shrubs and the Dewey monument were now on the garage \\"roof.\\" Designed by Timothy Pflueger, it was the world's first underground parking garage. During the late 1970s, and through the 1980s and 1990s, the area became somewhat derelict as the homeless began to camp in the space. San Francisco's rowdy New Year's parties used to happen yearly at the plaza with some sort of civil disruption and rioting happening afterward. In early 1998 city planners began plans to renovate the plaza to create more paved surfaces for easier maintenance, with outdoor cafes, and more levels to the underground garage. Finally in late 2000, the park was partially closed down to renovate the park and the parking garage. On July 25, 2002, the park reopened and a ceremony was held with then Mayor Willie Brown. In 2004 Unwire Now, a company founded by entrepreneur Jaz Banga, launched a free Wi-Fi network in Union Square which was championed by Mayor Gavin Newsom. Union Square hosts many public concerts and events. Public views of the square can be seen from surrounding high places such as the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, Macy's top floor, and the Grand Hyatt hotel. The Union Square Business Improvement District was founded in 1999 and focused primarily on cleaning and safety issues. The BID also deals with marketing, advocacy, streetscapes and capital improvement programs. The Union Square BID has been criticized by some as acting in a harassing manner toward homeless people at times, to deter them from being there. ==Public art== Dewey Monument in 2017 At the center of Union Square stands the Dewey Monument, an column on which stand a statue of Nike, the ancient Greek Goddess of Victory. The monument is dedicated to Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War for his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898. The monument was dedicated in 1903. Beginning in 2009, painted heart sculptures from the Hearts in San Francisco public art installation have been installed in each of the four corners of the square. ==Economy== The Tiffany Building is an 11-story, building at Union Square.; the bottom two floors contain a Tiffany & Co. store, while the upper floors contain offices.. Cathay Pacific maintains its North America regional headquarters on the third floor of the Tiffany Building, The Cathay Pacific North America headquarters moved from Greater Los Angeles and opened in the Tiffany Building in 2005. The only hotel actually located on Union Square is the Westin St. Francis hotel which is celebrated for its historic Magneta Grandfather Clock. It is believed to be the only hotel in the world that offers its guests, as a courtesy, a coin washing service. The process originated in 1938 at a time when high-society ladies wore white gloves that were easily tarnished during the exchange of money. It uses borax soap in an antiquated, manually-operated burnisher. ==Nearby attractions== Union Square has also come to describe not just the plaza itself, but the general shopping, dining, and theater districts within the surrounding blocks. The Geary and Curran theaters one block west on Geary anchor the \\"theater district\\" and border the Tenderloin. Union Square is also home to San Francisco's TIX Bay Area, a half-priced ticket booth and Ticketmaster outlet. Run by Theatre Bay Area, tickets for most of San Francisco's performing arts can be purchased the day of the performance at a discounted rate. At the end of Powell Street two blocks south, where the cable cars turn around beside Hallidie Plaza at Market Street, is a growing retail corridor that is connected to the SOMA district. Nob Hill, with its grand mansions, apartment buildings and hotels, stands to the northwest of Union Square. Directly northeast is Chinatown, with its famous dragon gate at Grant Avenue and Bush Street. The city's historic French Quarter northeast of Union Square and centers on the Belden Place alleyway, between Bush and Pine Streets, and Claude Lane off Bush Street. This area has many open-air French Restaurants and Cafes. Every year the area is the site of the boisterous Bastille Day celebration, the nation's largest, and Bush Street is temporarily renamed \\"Buisson.\\" Directly east of the Square off of Stockton Street is Maiden Lane, a short and narrow alley of exclusive boutiques and cafes that leads to the Financial District and boasts the Xanadu Gallery, San Francisco's only building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äîwith its interior most notable for being the predecessor for New York City's Guggenheim Museum. The square is part of the Barbary Coast Trail, linking many San Francisco landmarks. ==Shopping== Some of the department stores along the square, 2011 Over the years, Union Square became a popular shopping destination. Several department stores sit within the three-block radius of Union Square, including Neiman Marcus, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Barneys New York. Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom anchor the nearby Westfield San Francisco Centre, a shopping mall built in 1988 on nearby Market Street. A mix of upscale boutiques and popular retailers occupy many of the buildings surrounding Union Square. Among the luxury retailers that front Union Square are Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Bulgari, Loro Piana, Moncler, and jeweler Tiffany & Co.; while flagship Victoria's Secret, Williams Sonoma, Nike, and Apple stores also occupy buildings surrounding Union Square. Other notable brands in the surrounding area include Chanel, Prada, Burberry, Salvatore Ferragamo, Shapur Mozaffarian, Goyard, Dior and Cartier. Gap Inc., which is headquartered less than a mile away on the Embarcadero, operates multiple flagship and full-line stores for The Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy in and around Union Square. ==Transportation== Cable car along the square, 2015 Two cable car lines (Powell-Hyde and Powell- Mason) serve Union Square on Powell Street. In addition, Union Square is served by many trolleybus and bus lines and the F Market heritage streetcar. The Muni Metro and BART subway systems both serve the area at nearby Powell Street Station on Market Street. In 2012, Muni began building an extension of its Muni Metro system to connect Union Square and Chinatown with Caltrain and other neighborhoods in San Francisco. After several delays, the extension, known as the Central Subway, is scheduled for completion by 2020, and the new Union Square station will be called Union Square/Market Street. ==In popular culture== * Scenes of the square and the surrounding neighborhood were featured in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Vertigo (1958) and the opening scene of his The Birds was filmed at the edge of the square‚Äîthe character Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) looks up and sees hundreds of birds flying in a circular pattern around the column at the center of the square. * Francis Ford Coppola shot numerous scenes of The Conversation (1974) in Union Square, where the bugged conversation which forms the foundation of the movie takes place. * Philip Kaufman's 1978 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers also features scenes of the square. *In Blake Edwards' 1962 film Days of Wine and Roses, Jack Lemmon (as Joe Clay) looks at his reflection in the window of the Union Square Lounge on Maiden Lane and realizes he is an alcoholic \\"bum.\\" ==See also== * 49-Mile Scenic Drive * List of upscale shopping districts * Theatre District, San Francisco ==References== ==External links== * Union Square's official website * 360 degree panoramic photographs of San Francisco's Union Square, from Don Bain's 360¬∞ Panoramas Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Economy of San Francisco Category:Entertainment districts in California Category:Neighborhoods in San Francisco Category:Shopping districts and streets in the United States Category:Shopping malls established in 1988 Category:Shopping malls in San Francisco Category:Squares in San Francisco Category:Tourist attractions in San Francisco ","title":"Union Square, San Francisco"},{"id":"1429860","text":"Skrill (formerly Moneybookers) is an e-commerce business that allows payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet, with a focus on low-cost international money transfers.

The name meaning chosen by God was given by directors of a mission station in 1829 which the town formed around. The mission building is the oldest settler built building still standing in the Free State. The town was also home to one of the largest concentration camps run by the British during the Boer War. ==History== Evidence of life was found to be dated to 250 million years ago in the form of fossils. The first land dwellers to be active in the Bethulie region were the Bushmen, whose various drawings are still in existence in the area. In 1828 a mission station was established by the London Missionary Society for the local people, the San Bushman. It was originally known as Groot Moordenaarspoort (Murderer's Pass) after a vicious clash between the Sotho and Griqua tribes. In 1832 the missionary Jean Pierre Pellissier, whose home is one of the oldest pioneer buildings north of the Orange River, replaced the London missionaries. It now houses a historical museum displaying items of the past and information on the life and trial of Jean Pellissier and Chief Lephoi and his people. Until 1833 Bethulie was known as Caledon (after the nearby Caledon River). This name was in conflict with a Western Cape town bearing the same name. Then in 1833 a French Missionary Society, the \\"Paris Evangelical Missionary Society\\" took over control of the area and renamed the mission station Bethulua, meaning \\"Place of Worship\\". In 1835 it was renamed Verheullpolis and in 1863 the town was established and renamed Heidelberg. In 1872 the town was again renamed to Bethulie. During the Anglo-Boer War (1899 to 1902) the third largest concentration camp erected by the British was also situated in Bethulie. ===Timeline=== * 1777: R.J. Gordon reached the Groot river approximately 10 kilometers from the current Bethulie; he named the river the Oranje river. Mr. Gordon also noted in his drawings of the veldt and his surroundings that he noticed 6 Bushmen. * 1803: Governor J.W. Janssens traveled to the current location of Bethulie. * 1809: Colonel R. Collins reached the convergence of both the Caledon and Oranje rivers, he is also credited for the Caledon River's name. * 1823: G.P.N. Coetsee noted that during his travels in the area he only noticed Bushmen and no other settlements nor indigenous people. * 1828-1833: Missionary work within the Bushman community was undertaken by J. Clark and G.A. Kolbe. * 1833-1867: Missionary work within the Tihaping community was undertaken by J.P. Pellissier. * 1860-1863: During 1860 farmers bought 6,000 morgen (A morgen was a unit of measurement of land in Germany, the Netherlands and the Dutch colonies, including South Africa) from the Tihaping to be officially proclaimed a town with the name of Heidelberg. D.H. Steyn Bridge near Bethulie The D.H. Steyn Bridge or Hennie Steyn Bridge is an arched bridge near the town of Bethulie, it is a combined road and rail bridge which spans the Orange River just outside Bethulie. It is 1,152 m (1,260 yds) long, and 51.5m high and thereby the longest bridge in South Africa. It is also claimed to be the longest in the southern hemisphere. Work started 1899 and completed 1901. ==Notable people== Bethulie's most famous son was Patrick Mynhardt, whose one- man shows featuring Herman Charles Bosman's character Oom Schalk Lourens were popular in South Africa. His autobiographical show Boy from Bethulie formed the basis for a book of the same name. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Kopanong Local Municipality Category:Second Boer War concentration camps Category:Populated places established in 1863 Category:1863 establishments in the Orange Free State ","title":"Bethulie"},{"id":"1429873","text":"The north side of Bedford Square, viewed from near the north-east corner Bedford Square is a garden square in the Bloomsbury district of the Borough of Camden in London, England. ==History== Bedford Square from the BT Tower in 1966 Bedford Square (2005) Panorama of Bedford Square Built between 1775 and 1783 as an upper middle class residential area, the square has had many distinguished residents, including Lord Eldon, one of Britain's longest serving and most celebrated Lord Chancellors, who lived in the largest house in the square for many years.

It is located 45 km east of Bloemfontein in the present-day Free State province of South Africa. Botshabelo is now the largest township in free state, and the second largest township in South Africa after Soweto. ==History== As many people moved away from the farms in the Free State, they looked for places to stay in the region of Thaba Nchu, another homeland under the old Bophutatswana government. The policy governing Bophutatswana at the time clearly stated that Bophutatswana belongs to those who are of Tswana tribe. As a result, all other tribes, mainly Sotho and Xhosa, were housed at a squatter camp named ‚ÄúKromdraai‚Äù. Kromdraai was initiated by a man who was only referred to as \\"Khoza\\". He was selling a stand for only 50 cents around the year of 1976. Later on the government of Bophutatswana started to strongly condemn the development of that area and worked hard through their police force during the day and night, striving to dispatch everybody living in the region and who is not a Tswana. As the pressure mounted for the people of Kromdraai, Khoza fled and he was no longer to be seen. In 1979, the then Prime Minister of QwaQwa, Kenneth Mopeli together with the apartheid government found a place for all the people of Kromdraai at a farm called Onverwacht. All the people who were not Tswana started to move to Onverwacht for free, and later on when they started to settle in the area paid ZAR80 for a stand. Late in 1980 to early 1981 the name Onverwacht started to disappear and people started to call their place by the name of Botshabelo, this name given by Julius Nkoko. ==Economy== Botshabelo has a large industrial park with large companies located there. The economy of this township is based on production of food, clothing and other goods. The poultry producing company [Supreme poultry Pty (Ltd)] is located here. Capitec Bank and Shoprite has three branches and supermarkets in this township respectively. ==Transport== Botshabelo is served by 'Interstate Bus Lines' commuter buses and 'Big Sky Coaches', both traveling local and long distances on a daily basis. The township is located on the main railway line between Bloemfontein and Maseru, as well as on the main road between the two towns. The township still has unnamed streets, but the development of upgrading and naming of streets and roads are underway. There is also a new taxi rank at the newly built Botshabelo Mall. ==Shopping== Botshabelo has a new regional shopping mall near the industrial park. The mall is anchored by Shoprite, Woolworths, Pick n Pay, Cashbuild, Truworths and Foschini Group stores. This new shopping destination has over 80 stores including banks and restaurants like KFC and Hungry Lion. The mall is owned by the Liberty Property Group and Khora investments. It is located at Cnr N8 road & Jazzman Mokhothu highway. Other shopping centres are: Northern centre, Shoprite centre, Addy's Plaza, and Rea-hola shopping centre also known as Fairways. ==Education== Botshabelo has over 65 primary and secondary schools. Motheo FET College has a satellite campus in this township. ==Sports== Botshabelo is one of the towns that have produced soccer players for the Premier Soccer League (PSL), especially for Bloemfontein Celtics, players such as James Madidilane, Ditheko Mototo, the late Abram Raselemane, Ntho Moshe, Motseothata November, Ace Gulwa, Lefu Nyapuli, Moeketsi Sekola, Teboho Salemane and others.

The church council later bought Sannahspoort for 14 000 rixdollars (¬£1050). Immediately stands were sold to get the funds necessary to build a permanent church. An interesting condition of sale was that no spirits or other strong liquor may have been sold on any of the plots. The selling of plots was the biggest income of the church at the time. The current congregations of the surrounding towns of Philippolis, Trompsburg, Edenburg, Petrusburg, Koffiefontein, Luckhoff and a great deal of Jacobsdal were part of the congregation. Two years before the founding of the town, the intervention of the British government in the affairs of the Free State led to the military clash between Boer and Briton at the Battle of Boomplaats, about 30 km from the current Fauresmith. On August 30, 1851, a meeting was held at Sannahspoort. The heading of the minutes, states \\"Fauresmith.\\" After Bloemfontein, Fauresmith was the most important town in the Free State. The first House of Assembly had to choose between the two to determine which would be the capital of the Free State. The vote went to Bloemfontein with a two-vote majority. ==Archaeology== Fauresmith is the name site for a stone tool industry that is often defined as a transitional industry between the Acheulian and the Middle Stone Age or as the end of the Acheulian or beginning of the MSA.Herries 2011 The Fauresmith is found at a number of other archaeological sites such as Wonderwerk Cave and Kathu Pan where it is potentially dated to at least 420,000 years ago. The Fauresmith consists of MSA technology such as blades, points and prepared core technology as well as retaining handaxes from the Acheulian. The type sites are Brakfontien 321 and Riverview Estates Site VI.Van Riet Lowe 1937 ==References== *Herries, A.I.R. 2011.

The town was layout in 1859 by Christoffel Jacobs on his farm Kalkfontein, and today houses 6,500 inhabitants. ==Early history== It is a small attractive town on the Riet River, and in the 19th century it was near the boundary between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony. Its district boundaries date back to 1834 when the Cape Colony negotiated with the Griqua Captain, Andries Waterboer. The town was established in 1859 on the farm Kalkfontein, 'lime spring'. The town was named after the farm's owner, Christoffel Johannes Jacobs. It obtained municipal status in 1860. At that time, the Jacobsdal district was one of the largest districts in the Orange Free State republic.Raper, P. Place Names of South Africa; www.letsemengmunicipality.co.za ==Diamonds== In 1867 when diamonds were discovered in South Africa, the most important alluvial diamond diggings were in the Jacobsdal district. After the discovery, the Cape Colony claimed the largest part of the Jacobsdal district. However, in 1871 the Orange Free State republic's government received ¬£90 000 from the British Crown in compensation for the land taken. ==Military action== Jacobsdal saw plenty of military action during the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902 because it was close to the two strategic towns of Kimberley and Mafeking. The wounded from the battles of Belmont/Graspan, Modder River, Magersfontein and Paardeberg were nursed in the town. The local hotel, known as the Garfield Hotel then, and owned by Mrs. Sarah Ann STREAK, born BROOKS, provided board and lodging to the Transvaal and Free State Ambulance, as well as Despatch riders.TAB/CJC/LEER/179/01/CJC752/1 CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION BRITISH SUBJECTS ORANGE FREE STATE. JACOBSDAL. WILLIAM BROOKEN STREAK. 1904-1904. The hotel was run by her son William Brooks STREAK. In November 1899 Boers from Jacobsdal erected a cairn of a heap of stones (klipstapel), each burgher scratching his name on a stone, before departing for the battle of Roodelaagte. 20 km north west of Jacobsdal lies the Magersfontein battlefield where in December 1899 General Piet Cronj√© blocked Lord Methuen's advance on Kimberley.Free State Department of Tourism, 'Free State' (pdf), undated 200-?; Barker, A Concise Dictionary of the Boer War However, two months later, General Cronje was outflanked by his enemy General French's dash to relieve the siege of Kimberley, and retreated to Jacobsdal from Kimberley. On 15 February 1900 as the British approached the town he departed from Jacobsdal with 5000 men, women and children. Later that day the British captured the town, making Jacobsdal the first Orange Free State town to be occupied. Major General WAVELL and his British Troops occupied the Garfield Hotel in the town in February and March 1900 causing damage to the roof due to its use for Heliographing and flagsignalling between 16 February and 5 March 1900. Two days Cronje's men came under fire at Paardeberg Drift from French who was in pursuit of him and the battle of Paardeberg commenced. Cronje surrendered on 27 February after enduring 9 days of shelling by 40,000 British troops. 4,000 Boers surrendered and were taken off into exile at British prisoner-of-war camps around the world.[Barker, A Concise Dictionary of the Boer War] During the British occupation, the occupiers were surprised by an attack by the Boers that resulted in the death of 23 British soldiers. The British retaliated by burning down twenty houses and interning all the town's women and children in a concentration camp in Kimberley. The men were sent to POW camps inside and outside South Africa. Later in 1900 the British erected a blockhouse near the town on the road to Paardeberg. Its rectangular shape is one of only 12 blockhouses with that shape in South Africa. Besides the cairn, there are other memorials to the war in Jacobsdal. A memorial to the dead from the Battle of Roodelaagte stands in front of the NG church. In 1968 a memorial was erected in the Jacobsdal cemetery which commemorates British and colonial men who were buried in the cemetery. The town has long had a well known Landbouskool, one of only three agricultural high schools in the province. During the Second World War, Italian prisoners of war were held near Jacobsdal and Koffiefontein. Their labour was used to construct the Riet River Irrigation Scheme which extended the existing water scheme. After the war, white war veterans were rewarded with the receipt of an irrigation plot of 24 morgen each. ==Agriculture== The irrigation scheme is an extensive river irrigation settlement using water canals and the main crops are lucerne, potatoes, wheat, cotton, groundnuts, olives, maize and, since 1972, both table and wine grapes. The town claims to have the first wine cellar ever built outside the Cape Province. Wines of a good quality are produced by two wine cellars, Landzicht and Wilreza. In terms of livestock the focus is on sheep but there are also recently established large dairy establishments. ==Notable people== * Eric Louw - South African diplomat and politician ==References== ==External links== * Letsemeng Local Municipality Category:Populated places in the Letsemeng Local Municipality Category:Karoo Category:Populated places established in 1859 Category:1859 establishments in the Orange Free State ","title":"Jacobsdal"},{"id":"1429889","text":"Jagersfontein is a small town in the Free State province of South Africa. The original farm on which the town stands was once the property of a Griqua Jacobus Jagers, hence the name Jagersfontein. He sold the farm to C.F. Visser in 1854. A diamond rush started in 1870 after farmer J.J. de Klerk found a 50 carat (10 g) diamond. This was about three years before diamonds were discovered 130 km away at Kimberley. Mines were no longer operational in Jagersfontein until 2010, but there were many great finds, such as the 972 carat (194.4 g) Excelsior Diamond of 1893 and the 637 carat (127.4 g) Reitz Diamond of 1895. The Jagersfontein Mine is the deepest hand-excavated hole in the world. The Mine was reopened in September 2010 by a company named Son Op before it changed to Jagersfontein Development. Hiring on 40% of Jagersfontein residents, Johan Pretorius is the Mine manager and the owners are Chris Potgieter and Johan Rupert. Jagersfontein was one of the more famous diamond mines and together with the Koffiefontein mine produced one of the clearest diamonds of all mines in the early 1900s, despite being overshadowed by the mines at Kimberley. Streeter called Jagersfontein's diamonds of the \\"first water\\". The Reitz diamond was first named after Francis William Reitz, then state president of the Orange Free State in which Jagersfontein was located.

The series, which has been running since 1938, shares many characteristics with other European humorous adventure comics like The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix. It has been written and drawn by a succession of artists. Spirou and Fantasio are the series' main characters, two adventurous journalists who run into fantastic adventures, aided by Spirou's pet squirrel Spip and their inventor friend the Count of Champignac. ==History== ===Origins of Spirou=== Rob-Vel's Spirou The comic strip was originally created by Rob-Vel for the launch of ' (Spirou magazine) on April 21, 1938, published by √âditions Dupuis. The main character was originally an elevator (lift) operator (in French: un groom) for the Moustique Hotel (in reference to the publisher's chief magazine, Le Moustique), and remained dressed in his red bellhop uniform for a long time after the occupation was dropped. Spirou (the name means \\"squirrel\\" (lit.) and \\"mischievous\\" (fig.) in Walloon) has a pet squirrel called Spip, the series' first supporting character, who was introduced on June 8, 1939 in the story arc titled L'H√©ritage de Bill Money and liberated in the following week's issue, remaining a presence in all Spirou stories since. Spip's liberation, June 15, 1939 Adding to the difficulties of magazine publication that came with the outbreak of World War II, Velter joined the army effort, and his wife Blanche Dumoulin, using the pen name Davine, continued the work on the Spirou strip, with the aid of the young Belgian artist Luc Lafnet. Spirou became the property of the publisher Dupuis (atypical in France and Belgium where most comics characters are owned by their creator(s)), who bought the character from Rob-Vel in 1943, and since then the series has belonged to no specific author. The title has therefore subsequently been passed on to several different artists and writers. The first succession came in 1943 when Joseph Gillain, known by the pen name Jij√©, was given charge of the character. In 1944 Jij√© introduced a new character, Fantasio, who would become Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer. Holding many artistic commitments at Spirou magazine, Jij√© sought to delegate much of his work, and in 1946 he handed the series to his understudy, the young Andr√© Franquin, in the middle of the production of the story Spirou et la maison pr√©fabriqu√©e. ===Franquin's Spirou=== Franquin developed the strip from single gags and short serials into long adventures with complex plots, and is usually considered as the definitive author of the strip. He introduced a large gallery of recurring characters, notably the Count de Champignac, elderly scientist and inventor; the buffoonish mad scientist Zorglub; Fantasio's cousin and aspiring dictator Zantafio; and the journalist Seccotine, a rare instance of a major female character in Franco-Belgian comics of this period. Spirou et les h√©ritiers, 1952, by Franquin One Franquin creation that went on to develop a life of its own was the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail. The Marsupilami appears in the majority of the Franquin stories, starting in 1952 with Spirou et les h√©ritiers. In the series, it is adopted by the duo and follows them everywhere they go. Marsupilamis in the wild take centre stage briefly in Le nid des Marsupilamis (1957) which presents Seccotine's documentary featuring a family in their natural habitat, the jungles of the fictitious South American state Palombia. Starting with Le prisonnier du Bouddha (1959), Franquin began to work with Greg (writing) and Jid√©hem (backgrounds). As in some of his later series (Bruno Brazil, Bernard Prince), Greg staged his stories in a realistic geopolitical context. Le prisonnier du Bouddha is set in mainland China, with veiled references made to the Cold War. As for QRN sur Bretzelburg, it takes place in two imaginary European countries which bring to mind pre- reunification Germany. Lastly, it is with Greg that Franquin created famed villain Zorglub in the diptych of Z comme Zorglub and L'ombre du Z. However, as Franquin grew tired of Spirou, his other major character Gaston began to take precedence in his work, and following the controversial Panade √† Champignac, the series passed on to a then unknown young cartoonist, Jean- Claude Fournier, in 1969. One side effect of this is that the Marsupilami would only appear in one last story, Le faiseur d'or. This is because Franquin decided to retain the rights to that character; all the other characters remained the property of the publisher. Starting with Du glucose pour No√©mie, there would be no more appearances of the Marsupilami in Spirou et Fantasio, with the exception of a few discreet references. Only in the 1980s did the Marsupilami reappear in its own series, and later television cartoon and videogame. ===A long transition=== Fournier authored nine books in the series, which saw Spirou evolve into a more modern character. Where Franquin's stories tended to be politically neutral (in his later works, notably Id√©es noires, he would champion pacifist and environmental views), Fournier's stint on Spirou addressed such hot topics (for the 1970s) as nuclear energy (L'Ankou), drug- funded dictatorships (Kodo le tyran) and Duvalier-style repression (Tora Torapa). Fournier introduced some new characters such as Oror√©a, a beautiful girl reporter with whom Fantasio was madly in love (in contrast with his dislike of Seccotine); Itoh Kata, a Japanese magician; and an occult SPECTRE- like criminal organisation known as The Triangle. None of these were reused by later artists until some thirty years later when Itoh Kata appeared in Morvan and Munuera's Spirou et Fantasio √† Tokyo. However, at the end of the 1970s Fournier's pace began to slow down and the publisher, Dupuis, sought new authors to replace him. For a time, three separate teams worked on concurrent stories. Nic Broca (art) and Raoul Cauvin (writing) took on Fournier's lead without adding much to the characters. Their primary addition to the Spirou universe, namely the \\"Black box\\", a device which annihilates sound, is in fact an acknowledged rehash from an early Sophie story by Jid√©hem (La bulle du silence). Strangely, the authors were not allowed by the publisher to use any of the side characters and because of this, the duo's three stories read somewhat like a parenthesis in the series. ===Yves Chaland's case=== Yves Chaland proposed a far more radical make-over. His (very short) stint on Spirou is an ironic re-staging of the strip as it was in the 40s. This homage to Jij√© and early Franquin was seen at the time as too sophisticated for the mainstream readership. It was prepublished in 1982 in Spirou magazine, n¬∞2297 to n¬∞2318, printed in two-colour, but was interrupted before it was completed. This unfinished story was first collected in an unofficial album in 1984, √Ä la recherche de Bocongo, and then, legally, under the name of C≈ìurs d'acier (Champaka editor, 1990). This last edition includes the original strips, and a text by Yann Le Pennetier, illustrated by Chaland, that finishes the interrupted story.Included in L'int√©grale Chaland (Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1997. ), and Special Edition n¬∞4 (Dupuis ed.) ===Tome & Janry - The Dynamic Duo=== Vito la D√©veine, 1991, by Tome & Janry It was the team of Tome (writing) and Janry (art) which was to find lasting success with Spirou, both in terms of sales and critical appeal. Graphically, the authors' work was seen as a modern homage to Franquin's classic work, while their plots involved such modern topics as biotech (Virus), robotics (Qui arr√™tera Cyanure?) and even time travel (the diptych of L'horloger de la com√®te and Le r√©veil du Z, featuring future descendants of the Count and Zorglub). Their position as the official Spirou authors made them the flagship team to a whole new school of young, likeminded artists, such as Didier Conrad, Bernard Hislaire or Frank Le Gall, who had illustrious careers of their own. For a time, Spirou also acted as a side character in Frank P√©'s short-lived absurd humor strip L'√âlan (originally published in the weekly Spirou magazine). With La jeunesse de Spirou (1987), Tome and Janry set out to imagine Spirou's youth. This idea was later developed into a spin-off series, Le Petit Spirou (\\"Young Spirou\\"), which details the antics of the character as an elementary school boy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the Petit Spirou doesn't have very much in common, psychologically speaking, with the adult character. A new villain, the unlucky Mafia boss Vito \\"Lucky\\" Cortizone, based on the character Vito Corleone from The Godfather movies, was introduced in Spirou √† New-York, while Spirou √† Moscou (1990) sees Spirou and Fantasio pay their first visit to the USSR, just as it was about to collapse (the country was dissolved in 1991). In Machine qui r√™ve (1998), Tome and Janry tried to once again renew the series with a more mature storyline (wounded hero, love relationships, etc.), coupled with a more realistic graphic style. This sudden shift into a darker tone shocked many readers, although its seeds were apparent in previous Spirou albums and in other series by the same authors (Soda, Berceuse assassine). While many considered the change in tone to be courageous and laudable, there was some concern that Spirou lost much of its point when presented as a \\"realistic\\" character. At any rate, the controversy caused Tome & Janry to concentrate on Le Petit Spirou, and stop making albums in the main series. ===Spirou in the 21st century=== Spirou mural in Brussels. ====Morvan & Munuera==== Then, after a 6 years break, which only saw the publication of L'acc√©l√©rateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim not included in the official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and Jos√©-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and not just from Franquin's period. The duo's third album, Spirou et Fantasio √† Tokyo was released 20 September 2006. Spirou and Fantasio uncover the story of two children with telekinetic powers (similarly to the manga Akira) that are forced to construct an edo and meiji period theme park. Dupuis has also released as Spirou et Fantasio 49Z a manga story by Hiroyuki Oshima after an idea by Morvan. This story tells Spirou's adolescence as a groom in a 5 star Tokyo hotel. Due to a significant decline in sales, Dupuis decided to cease Morvan and Munuera work in Spirou in January 2007.InediSpirou - Morvan & Munuera arr√™tent Spirou However, they were allowed to complete one last album, Aux sources du Z, which was released 5 November 2008, with the help of scenarist Yann. ====Yoann & Vehlmann==== In January 2009, it was announced in Spirou magazine #3694 that Morvan and Munuera would be succeeded by Fabien Vehlmann and Yoann, who had together created the first volume of Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par.... Their first album in the regular series was announced for October 2009,ToutenBD reports the new authors for Spirou (24 January 2009) but was later pushed back to September 3, 2010 and is named Alerte aux zorkons. ====Le Spirou de...==== In 2006, Dupuis launched a second series of one-off volumes by various authors, under the name Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par... (\\"A Spirou and Fantasio adventure by...\\"). It has subsequently been renamed \\"Le Spirou de...\\" (\\"The Spirou story by...\\") The first volume, Les g√©ants p√©trifi√©s by Fabien Vehlmann and Yoann, had a modern storyline and art, not dissimilar in spirit to Morvan and Munuera's work. The second volume, Les marais du temps, by Frank Le Gall, is drawn in a more classic style not dissimilar to The Adventures of Tintin and Th√©odore Poussin, Le Gall's own comic series. The third, Le tombeau des Champignac, by Yann and Fabrice Tarrin, is a slightly modernized homage to Franquin's classic period. The fourth, Journal d'un ing√©nu, by Emile Bravo, is a novelistic homage to the original Rob-Vel and Jij√©'s universes and stories, and was released to critical acclaim, being awarded at the Angoul√™me festival. The fifth, Le groom vert-de-gris by Yann and Olivier Schwartz, is based on one of Yann's old scripts from the 80's originally intended to have been drawn by Chaland, while the editor rejected it. Yann picked up the artist Schwartz, working in a similar style, to complete the story. The story takes place among the resistance movement in the Nazi-occupied Belgium. Unlike traditional Spirou stories, but similar to other works by Yann, the story features rather much dark humour and political satire. It was released once again to some acclaim but also attracted controversy for its cavalier approach to sensitive issues. The sixth album, Panique en Atlantique, authored by Lewis Trondheim and Fabrice Parme, was released on April 16, 2010. ==Characters== Main and recurring Spirou et Fantasio characters: * Spirou - The main character. An investigative reporter with a strong sense of justice. * Fantasio - Spirou‚Äôs best friend and co-adventurer, a reporter with a hot temper. * Spip - Spirou's grouchy pet squirrel. * The Marsupilami - A very unusual creature captured in a South-American jungle by Spirou and Fantasio. Marsupilami is the name of the species, and the creature never acquired an individual name. Often referred to as \\"the little animal\\" even though it can terrorise anything and anyone. * Count of Champignac - Spirou and Fantasio's eccentric scientist friend. * The Mayor of Champignac. Petty, pompous, ineffectual and two-faced, he is mostly memorable for his trademark speeches in which he piles up mixed metaphors sky- high. * Seccotine - Their fellow reporter, a friend and rival at the same time. Gets on Fantasio's nerves, but a priceless ally. * Gaston Lagaffe - The main source of disaster and gags at the Spirou magazine offices. While he is the hero of his own series, he makes a few guest appearances in Spirou stories. * Oror√©a - Another brave female reporter, of Polynesian descent. * Itoh Kata - A Japanese scientist and magician. * Zorglub - A mad scientist as well as a former colleague of the Count of Champignac from university. Originally a foe upon his first appearance, he boasts that he could take over the world, but really wants to be recognised as the greatest scientist of all time. He later rehabilitates and becomes a friend of the protagonists. However, his ego is never shot down as more recent albums show. ===Enemies=== * Zantafio - Fantasio's evil cousin. * John Helena \\"la Mur√®ne\\" (the moray) - A brutal maritime criminal. * Don Vito \\"Lucky\\" Cortizone - New York mafia boss, father of a dangerous woman called Luna. * Cyanure, a gynoid. ==Albums== This list includes French titles, their English translation, and the first year of publication ===Jij√©=== * Spirou et l'aventure, 1948, featuring: **Le meeting a√©rien (The Aerial Meeting), 1943 **Autour du monde avec le pilote rouge (Around the World with the Red Pilot), 1944 **Le voyage dans le temps (The Voyage in Time), 1944‚Äì45 **L'enl√®vement de Spip (The Abduction of Spip), 1945 **La jeep de Fantasio (Fantasio's Jeep), 1945-46.

In some interviews the band stated that Visconti's 1969 film The Damned, a depiction of the fictitious German industrial dynasty of the Essenbecks, was the main inspiration. Critics worldwide hail them alongside Kraftwerk and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten as pioneers of Electronic and Industrial music, bands like Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb called them their inspiration, and their musical ideas found their way into the sound of a wide spectrum of music, from Depeche Mode to the innovative pioneers of Detroit techno. Also seen as one of the pioneers of fusing metal music and electronic music. Ralf D√∂rper who was part of the initial line-up which created the highly acclaimed early recordings Stahlwerksynfonie and Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn in 1981, left the band in 1982 to found the band Propaganda. Propaganda became one of the few German bands which were internationally successful in the 1980s. In the mid 1980s, Jurgen Engler went to work on his record label Atom-H, signing bands who played mainly thrash metal and hardcore punk. This influence would play a key part in the musical change in the 1990s. In 1989, Ralf D√∂rper initiated a collaboration with Nitzer Ebb on an old Die Krupps track (i.e. \\"Machineries of Joy\\", a newer version of their early 1980s track \\"Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn\\") which he produced together with J√ºrgen Engler. The chart success of the record (Billboard charts) led to the reactivation of Die Krupps fronted by Engler and D√∂rper. The initial sound on the band's first album Stahlwerksynfonie, showed a mix of industry factory noises with metallic percussion and real instruments. Later on the Wahre Arbeit, Wahrer Lohn EP and the Volle Kraft voraus! album in 1982 the band's sound moved toward a less experimental sound but rather a more synthesizer based sound while still keeping the metallic percussion. With the release of Entering the Arena the band almost completely abandoned the metallic percussion and went for a more 1980s new wave sound. Die Krupps were key in the Europe wide progression of electronic body music, culminating with the collaboration in 1989 with British band Nitzer Ebb. In 1992, they began to utilize guitars and more sounds derived from heavy metal music, with the release of their album I and the EP Tribute to Metallica, which consisted of covers of Metallica songs. Combining electronic and metal elements was a pioneering move which led to a number of other bands using the electronic/metal combo as a template in keeping with a deeper industrial sound. The band continued in this vein through the 1990s, releasing II - The Final Option (with an album cover influenced by Deep Purple's Machine Head) in 1993. A more experimental and pensive III - Odyssey of the Mind followed in 1995. After the release of the thrash metal influenced album Paradise Now in 1997 (unofficially known as IV), the band disbanded. J√ºrgen Engler founded the project DKay.com in 1997, and released two albums in 2000 and 2002, Decaydenz and Deeper into the Heart of Dysfunction. The band in 2006 Die Krupps celebrated their 25th anniversary with appearances in some major European festivals as well as solo appearances in 2005 and 2006. In fall 2007, two greatest-hits albums were released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Die Krupps: Too Much History - The Electro Years Vol. 1 and Too Much History - The Metal Years Vol. 2, both in digipak format. Both albums were combined as the 2-disc Too Much History. A collection of completely recorded old classics including four then new songs on their greatest hit album Too Much History (2007). \\"The Great Divide\\", \\"5 Millionen\\" with two cover songs \\"Ich bin ein Ausl√§nder\\" by Pop Will Eat Itself and \\"Der Amboss\\" by Visage (which was originally released two years before as a B-side to the re-release of Wahre Arbeit, wahrer Lohn). The influential back-catalogue of Die Krupps has been remastered and expanded. So far four of their previous albums; Stahlwerksynfonie, Volle Kraft voraus, I and Final Option have been re- released. and Volle Kraft Null Acht in 2009 a remix album of Volle Kraft voraus!. In 2010, Die Krupps released an EP entitled \\"Als w√§ren wir f√ºr immer\\", which comprises two original electronic based tracks, two original metal based tracks, and a cover of Propaganda's 1980s hit, \\"Dr Mabuse\\". At that time the first true new material since 1997. To celebrate thirty years of \\"True Work, True Pay\\" Die Krupps announced a joint European tour with Nitzer Ebb in spring 2011. In 2013, the band released their first full new album since 1997, an industrial/EBM record called The Machinists of Joy, and in 2015, they released the heavy metal influenced album V ‚Äì Metal Machine Music. In 2016, the band recorded Stahlwerkrequiem, a sequel/recording of the band's first album, Stahlwerksynfonie. Later that year saw the release of Live im Schatten der Ringe, a live album originally recorded in 2014. ==Members== Lead singer J√ºrgen Engler, 2018 Guitarist Marcel Z√ºrcher, 2018 Guitarist Nils Finkeisen, 2018 Ralf D√∂rper, 2018 Drummer Paul Keller, 2018 * J√ºrgen Engler ‚Äì vocals, guitar, keyboards, synthesizers and programming, metallic percussion (1980‚Äì1985, 1989‚Äì1997, 2005‚Äìpresent) * Ralf D√∂rper ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizers and programming (1980‚Äì1982, 1985, 1989‚Äì1997, 2005‚Äìpresent) * Marcel Z√ºrcher ‚Äì guitar, keyboards (2005‚Äìpresent) * Nils Finkeisen ‚Äì guitar (2015‚Äìpresent) * Paul Keller ‚Äì drums (2018‚Äìpresent) ===Former members=== * Bradley Bills ‚Äì live drums (2013‚Äì2014) * R√ºdiger Esch ‚Äì bass guitar (1989‚Äì1997, 2005‚Äì2011) * Christoph \\"Nook\\" Michelfeit ‚Äì drums, electronic percussion * Bernward Malaka ‚Äì bass guitar (1980‚Äì1982) * Hendrik Thiesbrummel ‚Äì live drums (2016‚Äì2018) * Frank K√∂llges ‚Äì drums * Eva Gossling ‚Äì saxophone (1981) * Christina Schnekenburger ‚Äì keyboards * Walter J√§ger ‚Äì ? * Christopher Lietz ‚Äì programming, samples (1995‚Äì1997) * Lee Altus ‚Äì guitar (1992‚Äì1997) * Darren Minter ‚Äì drums (1993) * George Lewis ‚Äì drums (1997) * Oliver R√∂hl ‚Äì drums * Achim F√§rber ‚Äì drums *Volker Borchert ‚Äì drums (1992, 2015‚Äì2016) ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Stahlwerksynfonie (1981) * Volle Kraft voraus!

The name means coffee fountain in Afrikaans. ==History== In the 1800s, Koffiefontein was a stopover spot for transport riders traveling between the coast and the diamond fields and gold mines to the north. \\"Coffee fountain\\" is a reference to the strong coffee brew transport riders made during their stopover. \\"Coffee fountain\\" involved transport riders grinding their own coffee beans (often with a spoon) and using the water of a natural spring to boil for the brew. Upon the discovery of diamonds near the natural spring in 1870, a town quickly developed at the Koffiefontein stopover spot, as prospectors began to mine the area in search of high quality diamonds. Koffiefontein's proximity to Mafikeng and Kimberley meant that it became involved in the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902). Blockhouses, which served as defensive fortresses, were erected by the British in 1900 and are still standing in the twenty-first century. ===Second Anglo-Boer War=== The Koffiefontein district saw much military action during the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902 because it was close to the two strategic towns of Kimberley and Mafeking. After Boer forces under the command of General Brand and Commandant Hertzog attacked the town and its mine, several blockhouses were erected by the British in October 1900. The blockhouses were involved in actions in the subsequent months and at one point the town was looted by the Boers and the people of the town took refuge in the mine.Free State Department of Tourism, 'Free State' (pdf), undated 200-?; Henderson, Zoe. Leaving his mark, an otherwise invisible man, p1 ===Second World War=== During the Second World War a large internment camp was opened in the town, with 2,000 Italian prisoners of war, some German prisoners of war, and some 800 South African internees, who were suspected of being pro-Nazi. Among the internees was F.C Erasmus and John Vorster who became prime minister of South Africa in 1966 and was president of the country from 1978 to 1979.Erasmus, On Route in South Africa, p385 The remains of murals painted by the Italian POWs can still be viewed in the town as can the barracks in which they were held.http://routes.co.za/fs/koffiefontein/index.html ==Local industry== Farming in the district focuses on cattle and sheep farming with lucerne, potatoes and ground nuts being the main crops sown. There used to be a cheese factory and vineyards in the town. The Kalkfontein Dam on the Riet river provides water for the towns of Jacobsdal and Koffiefontein.Free State Department of Tourism, 'Free State' (pdf), undated 200-?. ===Diamonds=== The area was a coffee stop for many transport riders in the 19th century until one of the riders discovered a diamond, and a town grew rapidly. The diamonds of Koffiefontein were known to be of the \\"first water\\"; meaning of very good clarity.Koffiefontein mine The diamond mine established by De Beers in 1870 was closed down in 2006.\\"De Beers Consolidated Mines to Close Koffiefontein Mine\\" , De Beers press release, 20 January 2006 The mine was then acquired by Petra Diamonds in 2007 and is currently still in operation.http://www.miningweekly.com/article.php?a_id=112917 Although the mine and supporting businesses have employed a large number of the local population, the area is still characterised by poverty. Census data indicate that 57% of the Koffiefontein population are below the poverty line. ==Places of interest== Apart from diamonds the town is best known as having been the home of Etienne Leroux, a famous Afrikaans novelist whose homestead and grave can be visited. There are also many Bushman (San) paintings in the district. To commemorate the allusion to the coffee drinking tradition of the transport riders in the name of the town, there is a fountain that resembles a coffee pot pouring out a drink. A First World War Monument is situated opposite the golf course in the town, on a tiny hill behind the school. There is a cannon next to the monument. To date the wall murals by Fascio, an Italian inmate of the concentration camp are still on display. == References == Category:Populated places in the Letsemeng Local Municipality Category:Karoo Category:Populated places established in 1892 ","title":"Koffiefontein"},{"id":"1429899","text":"Koppies is a small town (railway station) situated near the Renoster River in the Free State province of South Africa. ==Geography== The town is situated 63 km north-east of Kroonstad, 48 km west of Heilbron and 42 km south-south-east of Parys. It was laid out as a township in 1910 and became a municipality in 1926. Formerly Kopjes, meaning 'hills', the name is derived from that of the farm on which it was laid out, Honingkopjes, Dutch for 'honey hills'. ==History== General De Wet donated his Farm \\"Rooipoort\\" to be set up for under-privileged whites in the form of a few morgen irrigation land, and then a few morgen \\"dry\\" land for cultivating maize, etc. By the time the people got out of the war they were very poor, and were supplied with a few eggs and a paraffin lamp/hatcher for the eggs. By demand/pressure of General De Wet, the Koppies Dam was constructed to supply water for irrigation, and work to the local people who needed it badly. During the 1960s, the wall of the dam was raised to where it is today. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Ngwathe Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1904 ","title":"Koppies"},{"id":"1429906","text":"Societatea de Transport Bucure»ôti (STB; English: Bucharest Transit Corporation), is one of the main public transit operators in Bucharest, Romania, owned by the Municipality of Bucharest. From 1990 to 2018, the company had a different legal status and was known as the Regia AutonomƒÉ de Transport Bucure»ôti (RATB). STB operates a complex network of buses, trolleybuses, light rail and trams - in fact, STB operates all public transport except the Bucharest Metro, which is managed by Metrorex. STB has an average of approximately 1,180,000 daily riders of which 540,000 with buses, 520,000 with light rail and trams, and 120,000 with trolleybuses. ==Overview== Historical RATB pass from 2006. The paper pass has a combination of punches, cross-outs, stamping, and writing to indicate the exact period for which it is valid. A new contactless card system has been introduced since While owned entirely by the City Council, STB is an autonomous company. On 13 September 2018, it became a public company (Romanian: Societate pe ac»õiuni) and adopted its current name (not to be confused with the pre-WWII name Societatea de Tramvaie Bucure»ôti).https://www.promotor.ro/masini-noi/news/ratb-dispare-stb- apare.-ce-inseamna-asta-pentru-bucuresteni-17518762 The Municipality of Bucharest is the company's only shareholder, and it is not publicly traded on a stock market. Within the STB operates URAC (Uzina de Repara»õii »ôi Atelierele Centrale), a section specialized in the tram production and repair. ===Routes=== STB operates 116 regular bus routes on , 15 regular trolleybus routes on , and 24 regular light rail and tram routes on throughout Bucharest and vicinity. An integrated ticket exists, for all modes of transportation around Bucharest; including the metro, bus, tram, light rail, and trolleybus. ==History== Bujoreni trolleybus depot of STB, one of the 4 on the entire network of trolleybuses. The trolleybus network was introduced in 1949 and reached peak expansion in 1982, but since then it has declined. Bucur LF is a 65% low-floor tram produced by URAC section of STB The original STB appeared on 14 April 1908, as a 40-year concession that had its goal the electrification of all the tram lines in Bucharest. It inherited a fleet of horse-pulled trams and more recent electric trams. Up to the 1930s, it was the only way of public transportation in Bucharest, only operating trams until the introduction of Leonida-Renault/Chevrolet/Henschel buses. In 1936, STB changes its name to SCTB (Societatea ComunalƒÉ de Tramvaie Bucure»ôti). After World War II, in 1948, it is taken over by the Romanian state and changes its name to ITB (√éntreprinderea de Transport Bucure»ôti). Despite some achievements in the late 1940s-early 1950s (introduction of the first trolleybus in 1949 and also the introduction of the first post-war tram, Electroputere V54), it encountered various problems due to the very low medium speed, overcrowding due to the rapid expansion of the city, which were all put as a justification to build a metro in 1953. Despite this, the metro project was postponed due to the fragile economy of the Romanian state in the 1950s. The 1960s brought an era that would help expand the ITB. The first modern and locally-made trolleybuses were introduced (Rocar TV2E in 1958 and TV20E in 1970) and Karosa and TV buses were also put into service. Starting with the 1970s, it acquired more modern vehicles, such as the V3A in 1971-1972, the Leyland Royal Tiger Worldmaster (bodied by Hargaaz and Merkavim in Israel) buses in 1969, in 1973-1974 the Ikarbus Zemun IK4 buses from Yugoslavia, the Tatra T4R trams from Czechoslovakia, and the Ikarus 260 and 280 buses from Hungary in 1974. The peak of the RATB network was maintained between 1977 and 1982 before the Bucharest Metro was built. The Rocar DAC buses and trolleybuses were introduced in 1979, set to replace some of the older material the ITB used, that dated from the 1950s and 1960s. Once with the 1980s, the network noticed a decline, mostly because according to city planners, the ITB routes could not run on the same route as the metro lines. This, combined with mass demolitions in the 1980s, would bring a total re-shape of the tram and trolleybus network, and the introduction of the so-called Maxi-Taxis. The most noticeable result was the disappearance of the North-South trolleybus corridor in 1987, once the M2 line of the metro was completed, and with its opening, a small network in the neighborhood of Berceni was left. This was supposed to be applied as a \\"local network\\", disconnected from the main network that crossed the whole city, and to be used in smaller neighborhoods, with the plan to apply it to the whole city, and remove the main trolleybus network. The tram network also saw a major reshape, which is noticeable if one compares a 1984 map of the ITB network with the one from 1992. In 1990, after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the ITB was reorganized as the RATB (Regia AutonomƒÉ de Transport Bucure»ôti), which took care of the bus, trolleybus and tram services in the town, inheriting a fleet that dated from the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the taxi and maxi-taxi services were separated, allowing them to be operated by private operators for the first time. During the 1990s, it slowly modernized its fleet, beginning with Ikarus 260 buses from 1991, then continuing with the modernization of the V3A tram types in 1993, DAF SB220-Hispano Carrocera/ELVO/Castrosua in 1994, the Rocar DeSimon in 1995 and the Ikarus 415T in 1997-2002. At the same time, RATB acquired second-hand vehicles donated from various West European towns, such as Saviem SC10U from Paris, Saurer 5DUK-A from Geneva, Rathgeber m4.65/m5.65 from Munich and Duewag T4 from Frankfurt. During this time it also inherited a few rare models made by Rocar in the Giurgiului neighborhood, and also another few rare examples made by others. The last second-hand vehicles were a Renault PR100 from Lyon in 2004 and 40 IVECO TurboCity U480 buses from Milan in 2006. RATB has seen a decline in the number of operating vehicles with the 2000s, when the ROCAR-DAC vehicles that were running since 1979 were retired, seeking to be replaced with 1,000 Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses brought between 2006 and 2009. It also acquired 100 Astra Citelis trolleybuses during 2007 and 2008. Starting with 2009, RATB started retiring its last DAF, Rocar DeSimon, and IVECO examples still in usage, most of them being withdrawn on 11 March 2011. A few others were left in service until 1 December 2013, when the remaining DAF SB220 buses were completely withdrawn. Since then, RATB's bus fleet consists of only Mercedes buses. The last trams that were made in the 1980s were also retired in 2007 (V3A) and 2010 (V2A), being replaced with partially low-floor trams. Starting with 2011, series production started for the Bucur LF tram, one of the most modern that is currently running in the city. Starting with 2015, the first Ikarus 415T examples were scrapped. Despite this, RATB has relatively poor maintenance, with some examples sitting in depots for more than 3 years due to a lack of money for spares. No replacement has been announced for the aging fleet. On 13 September 2018, RATB was re-organized again and changed its name to STB, bringing back the old name that it initially used after an absence of 82 years. The first new buses of the STB entered service on 1 December 2018, specifically, Otokar Kent buses made in Turkey, that come in non-articulated and articulated versions (being also the first new articulated vehicles of the company, after the retirement of the last articulated DAC trolleybuses in 2007). This introduction was marked by controversy, due to the buses' ongoing breakdowns and defects of the various components (doors, heating pipes, etc.), with citizens of Bucharest criticizing their build quality and contract signed under suspicious circumstances (allegations of corruption). Little over 400 of these buses are supposed to enter service within 2019. ==Liveries and logos== Old RATB logo, in usage from 1990 to 2018 The current livery was adopted in 1996 and has been in use since then. It is overall white and on trams, it has a yellow stripe applied below the headlights. The oldest livery that can be traced goes back to the 1940s when a golden ochre was used on trams. In the 1950s, with the formation of the ITB, the livery adopted was of cream for the lower (underside) and upper (from the windows to the roof) parts, whilst the rest was of a dark-red paint. For trolleybuses, the dark-red paint was only used for the underside and for a small stripe under the window. On buses, the part below the windows was full dark-red and the one above them was just cream. Alternatively, on trolleybuses, some TV20E models were painted with a lighter-blue instead of dark-red. From 1979 onwards, with the introduction of the DAC diesel buses and trolleybuses, the livery was modified: it featured a reversal of the livery applied on TV trolleybuses, where the dark-red became cream and vice versa, and the stripe was moved towards the middle of the bus in regards to its height placement. At this time, the blue livery began to be panted onto some of the newer trolleybuses. In 1986, the livery would be changed once again, to feature a unified design that featured a thick cream stripe in the middle and an overall red body (this was reversed on trams), after a row of experimental liveries between 1985 and 1987. However, by 1990, not all vehicles were painted. The first RATB livery was applied in 1991, it was supposed to be a transitional livery until a better design would be found. Most older vehicles were painted in an overall yellow livery, that was first introduced on the new Ikarus 260 buses brought from Hungary, however, the Ikarus livery was the standard one applied on the 260 and 280 buses that were developed in the 1970s. None of the less, most refurbished vehicles were outshopped with this livery until 1997. At this time, up to 2006, RATB began experimenting with various liveries, because the general sense of \\"freedom\\" meant that drivers could personalize their vehicles. As stated previously, the current STB/RATB livery appeared in 1996, after experimenting on V3A-93 trams. Most trams and buses with the colorful liveries (for example the V3A-FAUR trams came from the factory painted in pink, and V3A-M2000 trams had a blood-red front end, whilst some DAC trolleybuses had advertisements for various products that covered them) were all repainted into this livery, with the only exception being Ikarus trolleybuses that retain their factory paint job, and Bucur LF trams that include silver and olive green design. A new livery has been adopted for the new Otokar buses, with a white rooftop, black window band, and turquoise- blue bodywork. The blue color reflects the usage of blue for bus routes on official maps for the past 50 years. The current logo was adopted once with the company name change in 2018, whilst the old RATB logo has its origins in 1983, when the new ITB logo was adopted.http://simplybucharest.ro/wp- content/uploads/2010/11/siglele.jpg ==See also== *Transport in Bucharest *List of bus routes in Bucharest *List of tram routes in Bucharest *List of trolleybus routes in Bucharest ==References== ==External links== * *Site with pictures of the RATB fleet *Site with vehicles, routes and more about RATB *Site with lists of stations for every line, schedules, maps, route planner Category:Transport in Bucharest Bucharest Bucharest Category:Trolleybus transport in Romania Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Romania Category:Tram manufacturers ","title":"Societatea de Transport Bucure»ôti"},{"id":"1429908","text":":For entries on other people named John Wesley, see John Wesley (disambiguation). John Wesley Work III (July 15, 1901 ‚Äì May 17, 1967) was a composer, educator, choral director, musicologist and scholar of African- American folklore and music. ==Biography== He was born on July 15, 1901, in Tullahoma, Tennessee, to a family of professional musicians. His grandfather, John Wesley Work, was a church choir director in Nashville, where he wrote and arranged music for his choirs. Some of his choristers were members of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers. His father, John Wesley Work, Jr., was a singer, folksong collector and professor of music, Latin, and history at Fisk, and his mother, Agnes Haynes Work, was a singer who helped train the Fisk group. His uncle, Frederick Jerome Work, also collected and arranged folksongs, and his brother, Julian, became a professional musician and composer. Work began his musical training at the Fisk University Laboratory School, moving on to the Fisk High School and then the university, where he received a B.A. degree in 1923. After graduation, he attended the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (now the Juilliard School of Music), where he studied with Gardner Lamson. He returned to Fisk and began teaching in 1927, spending summers in New York studying with Howard Talley and Samuel Gardner. In 1930 he received an M.A. degree from Columbia University with his thesis American Negro Songs and Spirituals. He was awarded two Julius Rosenwald Foundation Fellowships for the years 1931 to 1933 and, using these to take two years leave from Fisk, he obtained a B.Mus. degree from Yale University in 1933. Work spent the remainder of his career at Fisk, until his retirement in 1966. He served in a variety of positions, notably as a teacher, chairman of the Fisk University Department of Music, and director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers from 1947 until 1956. He published articles in professional journals and dictionaries over a span of more than thirty years. His best known articles were \\"Plantation Meistersingers\\" in The Musical Quarterly (Jan. 1940), and \\"Changing Patterns in Negro Folksongs\\" in the Journal of American Folklore (Oct. 1940). In 1953, he was a member of the charter class of the Zeta Rho chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music. The Fisk chapter was the third chapter of the Fraternity chartered at a historically black college or university, the first being chartered at Howard University in 1952. Work began composing while still in high school and continued throughout his career, completing over one hundred compositions in a variety of musical forms‚Äîfor full orchestra, piano, chamber ensemble, violin and organ‚Äîbut his largest output was in choral and solo-voice music. He was awarded first prize in the 1946 competition of the Federation of American Composers for his cantata The Singers, and in 1947 he received an award from the National Association of Negro Musicians. In 1963 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Fisk University. Following Work's collection Negro Folk Songs, the bulk of which was recorded at Fort Valley, he and two colleagues from Fisk University, Charles S. Johnson, head of the department of sociology (later, in October 1946, chosen as the university's first black president), and Lewis Jones, professor of sociology, collaborated with the Archive of American Folk Song on the Library of Congress/Fisk University Mississippi Delta Collection (AFC 1941/002). This project was a two-year joint field study conducted by the Library of Congress and Fisk University during the summers of 1941 and 1942. The goal of the partnership was to carry out an intensive field study documenting the folk culture of a specific community of African Americans in the Mississippi Delta region. The rapidly urbanizing commercial area of Coahoma County, Mississippi, with its county seat in Clarksdale, became the geographical focus of the study. Some of the correspondence included in this collection between Work and Alan Lomax, then head of the Archive of American Folk Song, touches on both the Fort Valley and the emerging Fisk University recording projects.

Hitler ordered the \\"destruction of the enemy\\" beyond military objectives: Nazi Germany classified Poles as \\"subhuman\\" and war crimes were committed against them from the outset of the invasion of Poland. Polonophobia, anti-Polonism (),Thaddeus C. Radzilowski,, Anti-Polonism and anti-Polish sentiment are terms for a variety of negative attitudes, prejudices, and actions against Polish people and Polish culture. These include racial prejudice against Poles and persons of Polish descent, ethnically-based discrimination, and state-sponsored mistreatment of Poles and the Polish diaspora. This prejudice led to mass killings and genocide or it was used to justify atrocities both during and after World War II, most notably by the German Nazis, Ukrainian nationalists and Soviet communist authorities. Nazi Germany's Directive No.1306 stated: \\"Polishness equals subhumanity. Poles, Jews and gypsies are on the same inferior level.\\"From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia, and the World, 1939-1941 (1997), by Sheldon Dick ed. Bernd Wegner, p.50 Nazi Germany killed an estimated 2.8 million ethnic Poles, of which over 75,000 were murdered in Auschwitz. Anti- Polish sentiment includes defamation and derogatory stereotyping of Poles as unintelligent and aggressive, as thugs, thieves, alcoholics, and anti-Semites. It also includes rising workplace discrimination and criminal violence against Poles. ==Features== German concentration-camp badge with letter \\"P\\"‚Äîrequired wear for Polish inmates Ro≈ºki, near Radom, Poland, 1942 Forms of hostility toward Poles and Polish culture include: * Organized persecution of the Poles as a nation or as an ethnic group, often based on the belief that Polish interests are a threat to one's own national aspirations; * Racist anti-Polish sentiment, a variety of xenophobia; * Cultural anti-Polish sentiment: a prejudice against Poles and Polish-speaking persons ‚Äì their customs, language and education; and * Stereotypes about Poland and Polish people in the media and popular culture. A historic example of anti-Polish sentiment was polako≈ºerstwo (in English, \\"the devouring of Poles\\") ‚Äì a Polish term introduced in the 19th century in relation to the dismemberment and annexation of Poland by foreign powers. Polako≈ºerstwo described the forcible suppression of Polish culture, education and religion on historically Polish lands, and the elimination of Poles from public life as well as from landed property. Anti-Polish policies were implemented by the German Empire under Otto von Bismarck, especially during the Kulturkampf, and enforced up to the end of World War I. Organized persecution of Poles raged in the territories annexed by the Russian Empire, mainly under Tsar Nicholas II. Historic actions inspired by anti-Polonism ranged from felonious acts motivated by hatred, to physical extermination of the Polish nation, the goal of which was to eradicate the Polish state. During World War II, when most of Polish society became the object of genocidal policies of its neighbours, German anti- Polonism led to an unprecedented campaign of mass murder. At present, among those who often express their hostile attitude towards the Polish people are some Russian politicians and their far-right political parties who search for a new imperial identity. ===Anti-Polish stereotypes=== In the Russian language, the term mazurik (–º–∞–∑—É—Ä–∏–∫), a synonym for \\"pickpocket\\", \\"petty thief\\", literally means \\"little Masovian\\".Vladimir Dahl, Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language, 1880 and later reprints, entry –ú–ê–ó–£–†–ò–ö The word is an example how Vladimir Putin's liberal use of colloquialisms has been catching attention of the media.\\"The Government's Political Technologist, or the Secrets of Inter TV Channel's Information Policy\\", Ukrayinska Pravda, Monday, 25 April 2011 The \\"Polish plumber\\" clich√© may symbolize the threat of cheap labor from poorer European countries to \\"overtake\\" jobs in wealthier parts of Europe. On the other hand, others associate it with affordability and dependability of European migrant workers. Drunkenness is associated with Polish people in several European cultures; the French language has the phrase ‚Äòdrunk as a Pole‚Äô (¬´ soul comme un Polonais ¬ª), while German uses the phrase ‚Äòdrunk as a Pole on pay day‚Äô (‚Äúbetrunken wie ein Pole am Zahltage‚Äú). Partitions of Poland, 1795 ==Anti-Polish sentiment to 1918== Anti-Polish rhetoric combined with the condemnation of Polish culture was most prominent in the 18th-century Prussia during the partitions of Poland. However, anti-Polish propaganda begins with the Teutonic Order in the 14th century. It was a very important tool in the Order's attempt to conquer the Duchy of Lithuania which eventually failed because of Lithuania's Personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Christianization of Lithuania to Catholicism. The first major thinker to openly call for the genocide of the Polish people was the 14th century German Dominican theologian John of Falkenberg who on behalf of the Teutonic Order argued not only that Polish pagans should be killed, but that all Poles should be subject to genocide on the grounds that Poles were an inherently heretical race and that even the King of Poland, Jogaila a Christian convert, ought to be murdered. The assertion that Poles were heretical was largely politically motivated as the Teutonic Order desired to conquer Polish lands despite Christianity having become the dominant religion in Poland centuries prior. Germany, becoming more and more permeated with Teutonic Prussianism, has never since abandoned these tactics. For instance, David Blackbourn of Harvard University speaks of the scandalised writings of German intellectual Johann Georg Forster, who was granted a tenure at Vilnius University by the Polish Commission of National Education in 1784. Forster wrote of Poland's \\"backwardness\\" in a similar vein to \\"ignorance and barbarism\\" of southeast Asia. Such views were later repeated in the German ideas of Lebensraum and exploited by the Nazis. German academics between the 18th and 20th centuries attempted to project, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a \\"boundary between civilization and barbarism; high German Kultur and primitive Slavdom\\" (1793 racist diatribe by J.C. Schulz republished by the Nazis in 1941). Prussian officials, eager to secure Polish partition, encouraged the view that the Poles were culturally inferior and in need of Prussian tutelage. Such racist texts, originally published from the 18th century onwards, were republished by the German Reich prior to and after its invasion of Poland. Frederick the Great of Prussia nourished a particular hatred and contempt for the Polish people. Following his conquest of Poland, he compared the Poles to \\"Iroquois\\" of Canada. In his all-encompassing anti- Polish campaign, even the nobility of Polish background living in Prussia were obliged to pay higher taxes than those of German heritage. Polish monasteries were viewed as \\"lairs of idleness\\" and their property often seized by Prussian authorities. The prevalent Catholicism among Poles was stigmatised. The Polish language was persecuted at all levels. After the Polish‚ÄìRussian War in early 1600s, Poland was greatly antagonized by the Russians as the cause of chaos and tyranny in Russia. The future House of Romanov, who would found the Russian Empire after taken power from the Rurik dynasty, used a number of distortion activities, describing Poles as backward, cruel and heartless, praising the rebellion against Poles; and heavily centered around the Orthodox belief. When Tsardom of Russia invaded Poland at the Russo-Polish war of 1650s, the Russians caused a number of atrocities, and destroyed most of Eastern Poland, sometimes joining destruction with its Ukrainian ally led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the Swedes in the parallel Swedish invasion. The war was held as a Russian triumph for its attempt to destroy Poland. Sweden, which developed anti-Polish sentiment due to previous Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars in hope to gain territorial and political influence, as well as dispute with the Polish Crown because of Sigismund III Vasa, launched an invasion known as the Deluge. Swedish invaders, joined force with Russian invaders in the east, together destroyed Poland and took away many of the Polish national treasures, as well as causing atrocities against Poles. The Poles were treated very brutally by Swedes, and as a result, Poland lost its wealth and was reduced in its development. Similar to Russia, Sweden hailed the destruction of Poland as a national triumph. At 18th century, Russia as an empire attempted to make Poland disintegrate by using liberum veto, creating chaos and prevented reforms, as by Russian accords, was against the ideal of Imperial Russia's future plan to partition Poland. Russia often sent troops and created atrocities on Polish civilians. When Poland adopted its first ever Constitution of 3 May 1791, the first Constitution in Europe, Russia sent troops and brutally suppressed Polish people. When Poland lost the last vestiges of its independence in 1795 and remained partitioned for 123 years, ethnic Poles were subjected to discrimination in two areas: the Germanisation under Prussian and later German rule, and Russification in the territories annexed by Imperial Russia. 19th-century Polish exiles in Siberia (painting) Being a Pole under the Russian occupation was in itself almost culpable ‚Äì wrote Russian historian Liudmila Gatagova. ‚Äì \\"Practically all of the Russian government, bureaucracy, and society were united in one outburst against the Poles.\\" ‚Äì \\"Rumor mongers informed the population about an order that had supposedly been given to kill [...] and take away their land.\\" Polish culture and religion were seen as threats to Russian imperial ambitions. Tsarist Namestniks suppressed them on Polish lands by force. The Russian anti-Polish campaign, which included confiscation of Polish nobles' property, was waged in the areas of education, religion as well as language. Polish schools and universities were closed in a stepped-up campaign of russification. In addition to executions and mass deportations of Poles to Katorga camps, Tsar Nicholas I established an occupation army at Poland's expense. The fact that Poles, unlike the Russians, were overwhelmingly Roman Catholic gave impetus to their religious persecution. At the same time, with the emergence of Panslavist ideology, Russian writers accused the Polish nation of betraying their \\"Slavic family\\" because of their armed efforts aimed at winning independence. Hostility toward Poles was present in many of Russia's literary works and media of the time. Pushkin, together with three other poets, published a pamphlet called \\"On the Taking of Warsaw\\" to celebrate the crushing of the revolt. His contribution to the frenzy of anti-Polish writing comprised poems in which he hailed the capitulation of Warsaw as a new \\"triumph\\" of imperial Russia. In Prussia and later in Germany, Poles were forbidden to build homes, and their properties were targeted for forced buy- outs financed by the Prussian and subsequent German governments. Bismarck described Poles, as animals (wolves), that \\"one shoots if one can\\" and implemented several harsh laws aimed at their expulsion from traditionally Polish lands. The Polish language was banned from public use, and ethnically Polish children punished at school for speaking Polish. Poles were subjected to a wave of forceful evictions (Rugi Pruskie). The German government financed and encouraged settlement of ethnic Germans into those areas aiming at their geopolitical germanisation. The Prussian Landtag passed laws against Catholics. A German National People's Party poster from 1920 showing a Teutonic knight being attacked by Poles and socialists as the caption reads \\"Save the East\\" Anti-Polish Czech leaflet produced during the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and directed at Cieszyn Silesians Toward the end of World War I during Poland's fight for independence, Imperial Germany made further attempts to take control over the territories of Congress Poland, aiming at ethnic cleansing of up to 3 million Jewish and Polish people which was meant to be followed by a new wave of settlement by ethnic Germans. In August 1914, the German imperial army destroyed the city of Kalisz, chasing out tens of thousands of its Polish citizens. ==Interwar Period (1918‚Äì39)== After Poland regained its independence as the Second Republic at the end of World War I, the question of new Polish borders could not have been easily settled against the will of her former long-term occupiers. Poles continued to be persecuted in the disputed territories, especially in Silesia. The German campaign of discrimination contributed to the Silesian Uprisings, where Polish workers were openly threatened with losing their jobs and pensions if they voted for Poland in the Upper Silesia plebiscite. At the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919, British historian and politician Lewis Bernstein Namier, who served as part of the British delegation, was seen as one of the biggest enemies of the newly independent Polish state in the British political environment and in the Polish territories. He falsified the earlier proposed Curzon line by detaching the city of Lw√≥w from Poland with a version called Curzon Line \\"A\\". It was sent to Soviet diplomatic representatives for acceptance. The earlier compromised version of Curzon line which was debated at the Spa Conference of 1920 was renamed Curzon Line \\"B\\". Anti-Polish cartoons were published in Lithuania during interbellum, which depicting the Poles in the bottom east as a lazy, poor and denegerate people Soviet poster (World War II): A Red Army soldier knocks a caricatured Polish general off backs of peasants armed with rocks German notice of retaliatory executions carried out on 100 named Polish hostages, Warsaw, 1943 Soviet World War II poster urging vigilance. Villain in shadow wears a Polish uniform. Polish professors murdered by the Germans, Lviv, western Ukraine, with graffiti in Ukrainian: \\"Death to Poles!\\", November 2011 In the politics of inter-war Germany, anti-Polish feelings ran high. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg observed that for many Germans in the Weimar Republic, \\"Poland was an abomination\\", Poles were \\"an East European species of cockroach\\", Poland was usually described as a Saisonstaat (a state for a season), and Germans used the phrase \\"Polish economy\\" (polnische Wirtschaft) for a situation of hopeless muddle. Weinberg noted that in the 1920s‚Äì30s, leading German politicians refused to accept Poland as a legitimate nation, and hoped instead to partition Poland, probably with the help of the Soviet Union. The British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted \\"to repudiate the equality with the peoples of (central and) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them\\" after 1918. Taylor wrote that: > \\"During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the Reich > all their liberties; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others. No > German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals. Therefore, every German > desired the achievement which only total war could give. By no other means > could the Reich be held together. It had been made by conquest and for > conquest; if it ever gave up its career of conquest, it would dissolve.\\" During Stalin's Great Terror in the Soviet Union, a major ethnic cleansing operation, known as the Polish Operation, took place from about 25 August 1937 through 15 November 1938. According to Soviet NKVD archives, 111,091 Poles, and people accused of ties with Poland, were executed, and 28,744 were sentenced to Gulag labor camps, for a total of 139,835 Polish victims. This number constitutes 10 per cent of the officially persecuted persons during the entire Yezhovshchina period, with confirming NKVD documents. US historian Timothy D. Snyder says: \\"It is hard not to see the Soviet \\"Polish Operation\\" of 1937-38 as genocidal.\\" Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a similar opinion, Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, Dr. Tomasz Sommer, and others.http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/911/911sommer.pdf The prosecuted Polish families were accused of anti-Soviet activities. Michael Ellman has said in the context of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that Stalin's Polish Operation \\"might well qualify as genocide\\" but because there has been no legal tribunal to try the crimes of Stalinism, there is no authoritative ruling on the legal characterisation. Karol Karski argues that the Soviet actions against Poles are genocide according to the international law. He says that while the extermination was targeting other nationalities as well and according to the criteria other than ethnicity, but as long as Poles were singled out basing on their ethnicity, this makes the actions to be genocide.The Crime of Genocide Committed against the Poles by the USSR before and during World War II:An International Legal Study by Karol Karski, Cas eWestern Reserve Journal of International Law, Vol. 45, 2013 Outside the Germans and Russians, the Lithuanians also developed a very strong anti-Polish hatred, partly due to historical grievances. For the Lithuanians, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War of 1920, which costed the capital Vilnius to be on Polish hand, cemented anti-Polish sentiment. Virtually throughout the inter-war, anti-Polish had been omnipresent in Lithuania, and Polish minority in Lithuania faced a very harsh repression by the Lithuanian authorities.Michael MacQueen, The Context of Mass Destruction: Agents and Prerequisites of the Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Volume 12, Number 1, pp. 27-48, 1998, The 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania led to the establishment of relations, but it remained extremely difficult as Lithuania still refused to accept Vilnius as part of Poland.A study of crisis By Michael Brecher, Jonathan Wilkenfeld, page 255 \\"This was followed by a period of relative harmony between the two states In Lithuanian propaganda, Poles were portrayed as \\"lazy, poor and uneducated\\".https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2036&context;=honors- theses Ukrainians were also another people with strong anti-Polish hostility. The Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War of 1919 resulted in Ukraine crippled militarily and, though Poland did assist Ukraine in the eventual conflict against the Bolsheviks, but was unable to prevent an eventual occupation by the Soviets. This had led to enmity against Poland by Ukrainian nationalists, which resulted in the establishment of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the beginning of Ukrainian problem in Poland. Assassinations of Polish officials by Ukrainian nationalists became increasingly frequent from 1930s onward.Alexander Motyl. (1985). Ukrainian Nationalist Political Violence in Inter-War Poland, 1921-1939. East European Quarterly, 19:1 (1985:Spring) p.45 ==Invasion of Poland and World War II== Nazi propagandists stereotyped Poles as nationalists in order to portray Germans as victims and justify the invasion of Poland; the Gleiwitz incident was a Nazi false flag to show that Germany was under Polish attack, and the killing of Germans by Poles in Bromberger Blutsonntag and elsewhere was inflated to 58,000 to increase German hatred of Poles and justify the killing of Polish civilians.\\"Nazi propagandists convinced some Germans that the invasion of Poland and subsequent occupation policies were justified. For many others, the propaganda reinforced deep-seated anti-Polish sentiment. German soldiers who served in Poland after the invasion wrote letters home, reflecting support for German military intervention to defend ethnic Germans.\\" https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deceiving-the-public In October 1939, Directive No.1306 of Nazi Germany's Propaganda Ministry stated: \\"It must be made clear even to the German milkmaid that Polishness equals subhumanity. Poles, Jews and Gypsies are on the same inferior level... This should be brought home as a leitmotiv, and from time to time, in the form of existing concepts such as 'Polish economy', 'Polish ruin' and so on, until everyone in Germany sees every Pole, whether farm worker or intellectual, as vermin.\\" Historian Karol Karski writes that before World War II the Soviet authorities carried out a discreditation campaign against the Poles and describes Stalin as Polonophobe.The Crime of Genocide Committed against the Poles by the USSR before and during World War II:An International Legal Study by Karol Karski, Cas eWestern Reserve Journal of International Law, Vol. 45, 2013, section \\"Conclusion\\" During World War II Poles became the subject of ethnic cleansing on an unprecedented scale, including: Nazi German genocide in General Government, Soviet executions and mass deportations to Siberia from Kresy, as well as massacres of Poles in Volhynia, a campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out in today's western Ukraine by Ukrainian nationalists. Among the 100,000 people murdered in the Intelligenzaktion operations in 1939‚Äì1940, approximately 61,000 were members of the Polish intelligentsia.Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, Holocaust of Non-Jewish Poles During WWII. Polish American Congress, Washington. Millions of citizens of Poland, both ethnic Poles and Jews, died in German concentration camps such as Auschwitz. Unknown numbers perished in Soviet \\"gulags\\" and political prisons. Reprisals against partisan activities were brutal; on one occasion 1,200 Poles were murdered in retaliation for the death of one German officer and two German officials.Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, MacMillan, 101. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead (including Polish Jews) at between 5.47 and 5.67 million (due to German actions) and 150,000 (due to Soviet), or around 5.62 and 5.82 million total.Wojciech Materski and Tomasz Szarota (eds.).Polska 1939‚Äì1945. Straty osobowe i ofiary represji pod dwiema okupacjami.Institute of National Remembrance(IPN) Warszawa 2009 (Introduction reproduced here ) Soviet policy following their 1939 invasion of Poland in World War II was ruthless, and sometimes coordinated with the Nazis (see: Gestapo-NKVD Conferences). Elements of ethnic cleansing included Soviet mass executions of Polish prisoners of war in the Katyn Massacre and at other sites, and the exile of up to 1.5 million Polish citizens, including the intelligentsia, academics, priests and Jewish Poles to forced-labor camps in Siberia. In German and Soviet war propaganda, Poles were mocked as inept for their military techniques in fighting the war. Nazi fake newsreels and forged pseudo-documentaries claimed that the Polish cavalry \\"bravely but futilely\\" charged German tanks in 1939, and that the Polish Air Force was wiped out on the ground on the opening day of the war. Neither tale was true (see: Myths of the Polish September Campaign). German propaganda staged a Polish cavalry charge in their 1941 reel called \\"Geschwader L√ºtzow\\". Ukrainian and Lithuanian nationalists utilized the increasing racial segregation to foment anti-Polonism. Followers of Stepan Bandera (also called Banderovites) committed genocide on Poles in Volhynia at 1943.https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/over-100000-slaughtered-with-axes- pitchforks-scythes-and-knives-the-wolyn-massacre-started-76-years-ago-today- and-lasted-for-two-years-6714 Lithuanian forces often clash with Polish forces throughout the World War II, and committed massacre on Poles with support from the Nazis.https://polandin.com/44505158/victims-of-german-nazi-massacres-in- ponary-commemorated Inexperienced Royal Air Force commanders initially stereotyped veteran Polish fighter pilots as inept and reckless, refusing to let them fly combat missions until they chose to do so against orders; they went on to achieve a celebrated record in the Battle of Britain. British military commanders Bernard Montgomery and Frederick Browning scapegoated Polish troops and command for their defeat at the Battle of Arnhem, stereotyping them as 'difficult' and 'incompetent'. Later military commentators have generally concurred that the Poles had a distinguished role in the battle and that their commander's ideas could have won it for the Allies, while the allegations of Montgomery and Browning were hypocritical, self serving and even political, given the Great Power politics of the day. Poland's relationship with the USSR during World War II was complicated. The main Western Powers, the US and UK, understood the importance of the USSR in defeating Germany, to the point of allowing Soviet propaganda to vilify their Polish ally. The western Allies were even willing to help cover up the Soviet massacre at Katyn. Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, the Catholic co-founder of Zegota, the Polish resistance group which risked the German death penalty to save Jews, and who herself was sent to Auschwitz, stereotyped Jews as haters of Poles even as she characterized Poles who remained silent in the face of the Holocaust as complicit: ==Post-War Era== With the conclusion of the Second World War, Nazi atrocities perforce ended. However, Soviet oppression of the Poles continued. Under Joseph Stalin, thousands of soldiers of Poland's underground eg. Home Army (Armia Krajowa) and returning veterans of the Polish Armed Forces that had served with the Western Allies were imprisoned, tortured by Soviet NKVD agents (see: W. Pilecki, ≈Å. Ciepli≈Ñski) and murdered following staged trials like the infamous Trial of the Sixteen in Moscow, Soviet Union. A similar fate awaited the \\"cursed soldiers\\". At least 40,000 members of Poland‚Äôs Home Army were deported to Russia. In Britain after 1945, the British people initially accepted those Polish servicemen who chose not to return to a Poland ruled by the communist regime. The Poles resident in Britain served under British command during the Battle of Britain, but as soon as the Soviets began to make gains on the Eastern Front both public opinion and the Government of the UK turned pro-Soviet and anti-Polish. Supporters of the socialists falsely and deliberately made the Poles out to be \\"warmongers\\", \\"anti-Semites\\" and \\"fascists\\". After the war, the trade unions and Labour party played on the fears of there not being enough jobs, food and housing. There were also anti-Polish rallies. In 1961, a book was published in Germany entitled Der Erzwungene Krieg (The Forced War) by the American historical writer and Holocaust denier David Hoggan, which argued that Germany did not commit aggression against Poland in 1939, but was instead the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy against the Reich. Reviewers have often noted that Hoggan seems to have an obsessive hostility towards the Poles. His claims included that the Polish government treated Poland's German minority far worse than the German government under Adolf Hitler treated its Jewish minority. In 1964, much controversy was created when two German right-wing extremist groups awarded Hoggan prizes. In the 1980s, the German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte claimed that in 1939 Poland was engaged in a campaign of genocide against its ethnic German minority, and has strongly implied that the German invasion in 1939, and all of the subsequent German atrocities in Poland during World War II were in essence justified acts of retaliation. Critics, such as the British historian Richard J. Evans, have accused Nolte of distorting the facts, and have argued that in no way was Poland committing genocide against its German minority. During the political transformation of the Soviet- controlled Eastern bloc in the 1980s, the traditional German anti-Polish feeling was again openly exploited in the East Germany against Solidarno≈õƒá. This tactic had become especially apparent in the \\"rejuvenation of 'Polish jokes,' some of which reminded listeners of the spread of such jokes under the Nazis.\\" ==Western-media references to German death camps in German-occupied Poland== The expressions offensive to Poles are attributed to a number of non- Polish media in relation to . The most prominent is a continued reference by Western news media to \\"Polish death camps\\" and \\"Polish concentration camps\\". These phrases refer to the network of concentration camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland in order to facilitate the \\"Final Solution\\", but the wording suggests that the Polish people might have been involved. Even Dachau concentration camp in Bavaria, Germany was described as in Poland.https://www.newsweek.pl/swiat/nyt-w-sprawie-polskich-obozow-zrobilismy- blad-zmieniamy-ins/kltf8bd> The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Polish organizations around the world and all Polish governments since 1989, condemned the usage of such expressions, arguing that they suggest Polish responsibility for the camps. The American Jewish Committee stated in its 30 January 2005, press release: \\"This is not a mere semantic matter. Historical integrity and accuracy hang in the balance.... Any misrepresentation of Poland's role in the Second World War, whether intentional or accidental, would be most regrettable and therefore should not be left unchallenged.\\" On 30 April 2004, a CTV News report made reference to \\"the Polish camp in Treblinka\\". The Polish embassy in Canada lodged a complaint with CTV. Robert Hurst of CTV, however, argued that the expression, \\"Polish death camp\\", is common usage in news organizations including those in the United States, and declined to issue a correction. The Polish Ambassador to Ottawa then complained to the National Specialty Services Panel of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The Council did not accept Hurst's argument and ruled against CTV stating that the word \\"\\"Polish\\"‚Äîsimilarly to such adjectives as \\"English\\", \\"French\\" and \\"German\\"‚Äîhad connotations that clearly extended beyond geographic context. Its use with reference to Nazi extermination camps was misleading and improper\\". CTV broadcast the decision during prime time. The Polish Ministry of Foreign affairs has stated, \\"That example of a successful campaign against the distortion of historic truth by the media ‚Äì and in defense of the good name of Poland ‚Äì will hopefully reduce the number of similar incidents in the future.\\" A similar example was the phrase \\"Polish Nazis\\" used in relation to non-Polish paramilitary groups operating on German- occupied Polish soil during World War II, disseminated by Norwegian State Broadcasting Corporation, NRK. The Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem officially considered this claim by NRK a falsification \\"offensive to historical truth\\". == In Polish-Jewish relations == Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp in his controversial and widely criticized speech delivered on 26 August 1989 (and retracted in 1991) argued that the outbursts of antisemitism are a \\"legitimate form of national self-defence against Jewish anti-Polonism.\\" He \\"asked Jews who 'have great power over the mass media in many countries' to rein in their anti-Polonism because 'if there won't be anti-Polonism, there won't be such antisemitism among us'.\\" In November of the same year, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Poles ‚Äúdrink in (anti-Semitism) with their mother‚Äôs milk.‚Äù Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said that ‚Äúthese blanket statements are the most destructive actions imaginable,‚Äù and that they ‚Äúdo irreparable harm‚Äù to people seeking Polish-Jewish reconciliation. Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, a Polish anti-Nazi resistance fighter said in 2001: \\"I took these words of Shamir as an insult to the memory of my mother, who was deeply religious and who taught her sons from childhood that displaying contempt to another person because of his origin, religion, or race is a mortal sin that violates the injunction to love one's neighbor. Those Poles who have fought racial prejudices their entire life must also take Shamir's words the same way.\\" He also said: \\"there are Jewish counterparts of belligerent Polish anti- Semites. They see Poles, all Poles, as the most anti-Semitic nation in the world. They seem not to perceive the symptoms of this social disease in Russia, Germany and other countries of our region.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120717102152/http://wiez.free.ngo.pl/jedwabne/article/21.html In Rethinking Poles and Jews, Robert Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska said that anti-Polonism and anti-Semitism remain \\"grotesquely twinned into our own time. We cannot combat the one without combating the other.\\" In Rethinking Poles and Jews, Robert Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska said that anti- Polonism and anti-Semitism remain \\"grotesquely twinned into our own time. We cannot combat the one without combating the other.\\" The term \\"anti-Polonism\\" is said to have been used for campaign purposes by political parties such as the League of Polish Families () or the defunct Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland () and organizations such as the Association against Anti-Polonism led by Leszek Bubel, leader of the Polish National Party and a former presidential candidate. Bubel was taken to court by a group of ten Polish intellectuals who filed a lawsuit against him for \\"violating the public good\\". Among the signatories were former Foreign Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski and filmmaker Kazimierz Kutz. According to writer Joanna Michlic, the term is used in Poland also as an argument against the self-critical intellectuals who discuss Polish-Jewish relations, accusing them of \\"anti-Polish positions and interests.\\" For example, historian Jan T. Gross has been accused of being anti-Polish when he wrote about crimes such as the Jedwabne pogrom. In her view, the charge is \\"not limited to arguments that can objectively be classified as anti-Polish‚Äîsuch as equating the Poles with the Nazis‚Äîbut rather applied to any critical inquiry into the collective past. Moreover, anti- Polonism is equated with anti-Semitism.\\" Adam Michnik wrote for The New York Times that \\"almost all Poles react very sharply when confronted with the charge that Poles get their anti-Semitism 'with their mothers' milk'.\\" (see: Yitzhak Shamir's outburst in an interview with The Jerusalem Post, 8 September 1989.) Such verbal attacks ‚Äì according to Michnik ‚Äì are interpreted by anti- Semites as \\"proof of the international anti-Polish Jewish conspiracy\\". For the 1994 anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, a Polish Gazeta Wyborcza journalist, Micha≈Ç Cichy, wrote a review of a collection of 1943 memoirs entitled Czy ja jestem mordercƒÖ? (Am I a murderer?) by Calel Perechodnik, a Jewish ghetto policeman from Otwock and member of the \\"Chrobry II Battalion\\", alleging (as hearsay) that about 40 Jews were killed by a group of Polish insurgents during the 1944 Uprising. Unlike the book (later reprinted with factual corrections), the actual review by Cichy elicited a fury of protests, while selected fragments of his article were confirmed by three Polish historians. Prof. Tomasz Strzembosz accused Cichy of practicing a 'distinct type of racism,' and charged Gazeta Wyborcza editor Adam Michnik with 'cultivating a species of tolerance that is absolutely intolerant of antisemitism yet regards anti- Polonism and anti-goyism as something altogether natural'.\\" Michnik responded to the controversy, praising the heroism of the AK by asking: \\"Is it an attack on Polish people when the past is being explored to seek the truth?\\". Cichy later apologized for the tone of his article, but not for the erroneous facts. ==\\"Polish jokes\\"== \\"Polish jokes\\" belong to a category of conditional jokes, meaning that their understanding requires knowledge of what a Polish joke is. Conditional jokes depend on the audience's affective preference‚Äîon their likes and dislikes. Though these jokes might be understood by many, their success depends entirely on the negative disposition of the listener. Presumably the first Polish jokes by German displaced persons fleeing war-torn Europe were brought to the United States in the late 1940s. These jokes were fueled by ethnic slurs disseminated by German National Socialist propaganda, which attempted to justify the Nazis' murdering of Poles by presenting them as \\"dreck\\"‚Äîdirty, stupid and inferior. It is also possible that some early American Polack jokes from Germany were originally told before World War II in disputed border regions such as Silesia. There is debate as to whether the early \\"Polish jokes\\" brought to states such as Wisconsin by German immigrants relate directly to the wave of American jokes of the early 1960s. A \\"provocative critique of previous scholarship on the subject\\" has been made by British writer Christie Davies in The Mirth of Nations, which suggests that \\"Polish jokes\\" did not originate in Nazi Germany but much earlier, as an outgrowth of regional jokes rooted in \\"social class differences reaching back to the nineteenth century.\\" According to Davies, American versions of Polish jokes are an unrelated \\"purely American phenomenon\\" and do not express the \\"historical Old World hatreds of the Germans for the Poles. However, Hollywood in the 1960s and 1970s imported the subhuman-intelligence jokes about Poles from old Nazi propaganda.\\" For decades, Polish Americans have been the subject of derogatory jokes originating in anti-immigrant stereotypes that had developed in the U.S. before the 1920s. During the Partitions of Poland, Polish immigrants came to the United States in considerable numbers, fleeing mass persecution at home. They were taking the only jobs available to them, usually requiring physical labor. The same ethnic and job-related stereotypes persisted even as Polish Americans joined the middle class in the mid-20th century. \\"The constant derision, often publicly disseminated through the mass media, caused serious identity crises, feeling of inadequacy, and low self- esteem for many Polish Americans.\\" In spite of the plight of Polish people under Cold War communism, negative stereotypes about Polish Americans endured. Since the late 1960s, Polish American organizations have made continuous effort to challenge the negative stereotyping of the Polish people once prevalent in American media. The Polish American Guardian Society has argued that NBC-TV used the tremendous power of TV to introduce and push subhuman intelligence jokes about Poles (that were worse than prior simple anti- immigrant jokes) using the repetitive big lie technique to degrade Poles. The play called ‚ÄúPolish Joke‚Äù by David Ives has resulted in a number of complaints by the Polonia in the US. The \\"Polish jokes\\" heard in the 1970s were particularly offensive, so much so that the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs approached the U.S. State Department about that, however unsuccessfully. The syndrome receded only after Cardinal Karol Wojty≈Ça was elected Pope, and Polish jokes became pass√©. Gradually, Americans have developed a more positive image of their Polish neighbors in the following decades. In 2014, a German speaker claimed during the European Aquatics Championships, that the Polish team would be coming back home in \\"our cars\\". ==Today== ===United Kingdom=== Since the EU enlargement in 2004, where ten new countries joined in the single-largest expansion to date (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), the UK has experienced mass immigration from Poland (see Poles in the United Kingdom). It is estimated that the Polish British community has doubled in size since 2004; with Poland now having overtaken India as the largest foreign-born country of origin in 2015 (831,000 Poles to 795,000 Indian-born persons). There have been some instances of anti-Polish sentiment and hostility towards Polish immigrants. The far-right British National Party argued for immigration from (Central and) Eastern Europe to be stopped and for Poles to be deported. In 2007, Polish people living in London reported 42 ethnically motivated attacks against them, compared with 28 in 2004. The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski, of Polish origin himself, said that the increase in violence towards Poles is in part \\"a result of the media coverage by the BBC\\" whose reporters \\"won't dare refer to controversial immigration from other countries.\\" Kawczynski voiced his criticism of the BBC in the House of Commons for \\"using the Polish community as a cat's paw to try to tackle the thorny issue of mass, unchecked immigration\\" only because against Poles \\"it's politically correct to do so.\\" In 2009, the Federation of Poles in Great Britain and the Polish Embassy in London with Barbara Tuge-Erecinska raised a number of formal complaints ‚Äì including with the Press Complaints Commission ‚Äì about news articles that defamed Poles. The PCC arranged a deal between the Federation and the Daily Mail, which ran the articles. The Embassy also questioned the veracity of The Guardian report by Kate Connolly about an alleged \\"storm of protest in Poland\\" in response to a film about a Jewish underground resistance movement. The Polish Embassy stated on 11 March 2009, disproving the claim: \\"This embassy has been in touch with [the film's] only distributor in Poland, Monolith Plus, and we have been told that this film has not experienced any form of booing, let alone been banned by any cinemas.\\" The Guardian was also forced by PCC to publish an admission that another article by Simon Jenkins, from 1 September ‚Äì which accused Poles of wartime suicide ‚Äì \\"repeated a myth fostered by Nazi propagandists, when it said that Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler's panzers. There is no evidence that this occurred.\\" The Guardian has been noted for a number of other controversies. On 14 October 2009, Nazi- hunter Efraim Zuroff alleged that: \\"the second world war narrative [...] has been distorted since independence and the transition to democracy to make it more palatable to their electorate and to minimize the role of local collaborators in Holocaust crimes.\\" On 20 October 2009, The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland said: \\"We are meant to be friendly towards the newest members of the European Union. But the truth is that several of these \\"emerging democracies\\" have reverted to a brand of ultra-nationalistic politics that would repel most voters in western Europe. It exists in Poland\\". In response to the above attacks Timothy Garton Ash wrote in the same paper on 23 December: \\"In my experience, the automatic equation of Poland with Catholicism, nationalism and antisemitism ‚Äì and thence a slide to guilt by association with the Holocaust ‚Äì is still widespread. This collective stereotyping does no justice to the historical record.\\" Writing in The Guardian, then-UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband described Poland's governing Law and Justice party as \\"far right\\". His language sparked a protest by Daniel Hannan of The Daily Telegraph, who said on 29 October 2009, that the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband should apologise to the people of Poland. Hannan wrote that Miliband's \\"increasingly unhinged allegations have been greeted with horror in Poland.\\" A Daily Telegraph article by Julian Kossoff on 13 November 2009 spoke of the \\"anti-Semitism embedded in Polish history,\\" an \\"episode of Polish bloodlust and nightmarish slaughter\\" and \\"the unspeakable guilt of the Polish collaborators.\\" The Daily Telegraph's Gerald Warner complained about Kossoff's \\"insulting attack on Catholics and Poles which grotesquely misrepresents historical fact and which, if leveled at almost any other targets, would probably be characterized as a 'hate crime'.\\" Also in 2008, the Polish ambassador sent an official protest to the Press Complaints Commission about The Times. On 26 July 2008, Giles Coren published a comment piece with the ethnic slur 'Polack' used to describe Polish immigrants. He accused Poland of complicity in the six million Jewish deaths of The Holocaust, prompting not only an official letter of complaint to The Times, but also an early day motion in the UK parliament, followed by an editorial in The Economist. The ambassador, Tuge-Erecinska, explained that the article was \\"unsupported by any basic historic or geographic knowledge,\\" and that \\"the issue of Polish-Jewish relations has been unfairly and deeply falsified\\" by Coren's \\"aggressive remarks\\" and \\"contempt\\". Coren reacted by telling The Jewish Chronicle: \\"Fuck the Poles\\". The case has been referred to the European Court of Human Rights. However, the case was unsuccessful as Poles are not classified as an ethnic minority. The editor of The Jewish Chronicle, Stephen Pollard, commented on 6 August 2009: \\"There are few things more despicable than anti-Semitism, but here's one of them: using a false charge of anti-Semitism for political gain.\\" On 6 October 2009, Stephen Fry was interviewed by Jon Snow on Channel 4 News as a signatory of a letter to then-Conservative Party leader David Cameron expressing concern about the party's relationship with the right-wing Polish Law and Justice Party in the European Parliament. During the interview, Fry stated: \\"There has been a history, let's face it, in Poland of a right-wing Catholicism which has been deeply disturbing for those of us who know a little history, and remember which side of the border Auschwitz was on...\\" The remark prompted a complaint from the Polish Embassy in London, as well as an editorial in The Economist and criticism from British Jewish historian David Cesarani. Fry has since posted an apology on his personal weblog, in which he stated: \\"It was a rubbishy, cheap and offensive remark that I have been regretting ever since... I take this opportunity to apologize now.\\" On 30 October 2009, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, complained about this new British political row playing on a \\"'false and painful stereotype that all Poles are antisemitic', whereas the truth was that the problem was around the same there as elsewhere in Europe.\\" Before the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a documentary criticizing Poland, called Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate and stereotyping Poles as racists.https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/06/stadiums_of_hate_legitimate_an.html This had been heavily criticized in Poland as well as even in Britain as an example of British racism and hypocrisies. Eventually, there was no sign of Polish racism and violence throughout the competition. In January 2014, a Polish man, whose helmet was emblazoned with the flag of Poland, claimed he was attacked by a group of fifteen men outside a pub in Dagenham, London. Photos were taken of him and his motorbike. The victim blamed xenophobic speeches of the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. During the same month in Belfast there was seven attacks on Polish houses within ten days, in which stones and bricks were thrown at the windows. In November 2014, Lidl supermarkets were exposed by the BBC for threatening staff with termination of employment for speaking Polish during work and at their tea breaks. Following the British referendum of EU membership, there were more cases of Polonophobic attacks including anti-Polish leaflets distributed in Huntingdon and graffiti against the Polish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith. The death of a Polish man in Harlow was initially reported as being a possible Brexit-related hate crime, but this was discounted at the subsequent trial. Central and Eastern European pupils, including the Polish ones, have experienced increased levels of racism and xenophobia since the Brexit vote. ===Israel=== The politician Yair Lapid claimed that his father's grandmother, who was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp, \\"was murdered in Poland by Germans and Poles\\". Lapid also wrote that there were \\"Polish death camps\\" (see Polish death camps controversy). In a 2018 interview, Anna Azari, the Israeli ambassador to Poland, said that \\"We need to work to reduce anti-Semitism, but work is also needed for there to be less anti-Polish sentiment\\" and \\"Anti-Polonism occurs not only in Israel, but also in Jewish circles outside Israel.\\" In February 2019, Poland's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki canceled plans for his country to send a delegation to a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday after the acting Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz said that Poles \\"collaborated with the Nazis\\" and \\"sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk.\\" Zvi Bar, an Israeli brigadier general and politician, said that Katz was speaking as a 'student' of Yitzhak Shamir, \\"the father of Polish genetic theory\\" and said: \\"All right, there were Poles and Hungarians who collaborated, there were and are anti-Semitic Poles and Hungarians. But why generalize? Why be racist, why accuse these nations and attribute to them inherent anti-Semitic characteristics? On 15 May 2019, Poland's Ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski, was spat on and attacked outside the Polish Embassy in Tel Aviv by 65-year-old Israeli architect, Arik Lederman Arik Lederman Architects who was subsequently arrested following the assault. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described the event as a \\"xenophobic act of aggression\\" on Twitter. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said: \\"We express our fullest sympathy to the ambassador and our shock at the attack,\\" while the suspect apologized and said he had been provoked earlier by a Polish Embassy employee using an anti-Semitic slur against him. The Polish embassy in turn disputed the man's account, and said it has CCTV evidence to disprove it. ===United States=== On 14 November 2007, Fox aired an episode of Back to You created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan called \\"Something's Up There\\", which contained a controversial anti-Polish slur. The slur involved Marsh trying to convince the show's lone Polish-American character, Gary, to go bowling after work by saying: \\"Come on, it's in your blood, like kielbasa and collaborating with the Nazis.\\" Fox later apologised on 20 November 2007. It vowed never to broadcast the line of dialogue again either in repeats and/or syndicated broadcasts. Fox stated that, \\"The line was delivered by a character who is known for being ignorant, clueless, and saying outlandish things. Allowing the line to remain in the show, however, demonstrated poor judgment, and we apologise to anyone who was offended.\\" ===Russian Federation=== In August 2005, a series of alleged organised attacks against Polish diplomats took place in Moscow, which prompted the then-Polish President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski to call on the Russian Government to stop them. An employee with the Polish embassy in Moscow was hospitalised in serious condition after being assaulted in broad daylight near the embassy by unidentified men. Three days later, another Polish diplomat was beaten up near the embassy. The following day the Moscow correspondent for the Polish daily Rzeczpospolita was attacked and beaten up by a group of Russians. It is widely believed that the attacks were organized as revenge for the mugging of four Russian youth in a public park in Warsaw by a group of skinheads, several days earlier. ===Lithuania=== The former \\"Solidarity\\" leader and Polish President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa criticised the Lithuanian Government over discrimination against the Polish minority, which included the enforced Lithuanization of Polish surnames and the removal of bilingual Polish language street signs in municipalities predominantly inhabited by the Polish-speaking population. In 2011, Wa≈Çƒôsa rejected Lithuania's Order of Vytautas the Great.\\"Walesa declines Lithuanian honour \\". Radio Poland. 7 September 2011. ===Ukraine=== In 2007, David R. Marples noted that there were \\"no Ukrainian organizations and press organs that specialize in anti-Polish propaganda.[David R. Marples], Heroes and Villains: Creating National History in Contemporary Ukraine, 2007, Chapter 6. The Ukrainian- Polish Conflict, pp. 203-237 Different interpretations of bitter events regarding Poles and Ukrainians during World War II have led to a sharp deterioration of the relations between the nations since 2015. In April 2017 the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance forbade the exhumation of Polish victims of the 1943 massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia as part of the broader action of halting the legalization of Polish memorial sites in Ukraine, in a retaliation for the dismantling of a monument to UPA soldiers in Hruszowice, Eastern Poland., Carnegie Europe\\"Ukrainians call on Poland to rebuild controversial monument\\", Radio Poland Polish President Andrzej Duda expressed his concerns with appointment to high Ukrainian offices of people expressing nationalistic anti-Polish views. The Ukrainian foreign ministry stated that there is no general anti-Polish sentiment in Ukraine., UNIAN In 2017, Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski announced plans to bar Ukrainians with anti-Polish views, as a reaction to the disrespect to the Polish cemetery in Lviv following a Ukrainian accusation of Polish \\"occupation\\" in the city. \\"Poland to ban Ukrainians with 'anti-Polish views'\\", Reuters, November 2, 2017 ===Germany=== Following the accession of Poland to the European Union, relationship between Germany and Poland has largely improved. However, anti-Polonism remains a concern. In 2016, Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat, criticized the Duda's government in Poland and referred it as a \\"coup\\". This had led to criticism in Poland, although Polish government had downplayed the issue to maintain a fair relationship with Germany. In 2019, a German entrepreneur was sentenced to prison in Poland for spreading anti-Polish hate speeches.https://polandin.com/41264063/german- entrepreneur-sentenced-for-antipolish-hate-speech Also in the same year, increasing anti-Polonism has been reported to be on the rise in Germany. In 2020, President of Poland Andrzej Duda accused German media of misinterpreting his words and the German government for being Polonophobe regarding coverage about 2020 Polish presidential election. ==See also== * *War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II **Nazi German crimes against the Polish nation ***Generalplan Ost ***Lebensraum *Soviet war crimes **Polish Operation of the NKVD **NKVD Order 00485 **Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939‚Äì1946) *Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia *Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions *Russification of Poles during the Partitions ==References== Notes Bibliography * * Ko≈∫mian, Stanis≈Çaw \\"O dzia≈Çaniach i dzie≈Çach Bismarcka\\" (\\"On Bismarck's Acts and Deeds\\"), PrzeglƒÖd Polski (Polish Review), September 1875, pp. 356‚Äì88, and October 1875, pp. 110‚Äì23 * Lukas, Richard C. and Norman Davies (foreword), Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation 1939‚Äì1944, 2001 * Lukas, Richard C.: Forgotten Survivors: Polish Christians Remember The Nazi Occupation * Lukas, Richard C.: Did the Children Cry: Hitler's War Against Jewish and Polish Children, 1939‚Äì1945 *Miko≈Çaj Teres: Ethnic Cleansing of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, Alliance of the Polish Eastern Provinces, Toronto, 1993, . *Ryszard Torzecki: Polacy i Ukrai≈Ñcy; Sprawa ukrai≈Ñska w czasie II wojny ≈õwiatowej na terenie II Rzeczypospolitej; Warsaw, 1993. *Wiktor Poliszczuk: Bitter Truth.

West Portal is a primarily residential area of the City. The neighborhood's main corridor, West Portal Avenue, serves as a principal shopping district of southwestern San Francisco. ==Location== West Portal is located at the southern edge of the hills in central San Francisco. The neighborhood is named for the western terminus of the Muni tunnel beneath Twin Peaks that opened in 1918. The ride in the subway from West Portal Station to Castro Station is about seven minutes. By the West Portal Station, the L Taraval goes west along Ulloa Street, and the K Ingleside and the M Oceanview go south along West Portal Avenue. It is also served by the T Third Street Line. The neighborhood is served by the 48 and 57 Muni bus lines. ==Characteristics== Because of its small size and collection of mom and pop stores, restaurants, and saloons, the neighborhood is often described as having a village-like atmosphere. The neighborhood is served by the West Portal Branch of the San Francisco Public Library. Like Glen Park, West Portal is a San Francisco community that almost functions as a small city itself. Though small, the neighborhood has many banks, restaurants of many types, coffee shops, salons, a first run movie theater, post office, elementary school, drug stores, bakeries, ice cream shops, real estate agents, and spas. West Portal Avenue is dotted with locally owned and operated businesses which include a book store, toy store, produce market, candy shop, and hardware store. West Portal Avenue also has many professional services such as dentists, lawyers, accountants, and optometrists. The frequent fog helps keep the area green in the usually rainless summer months, and on a clear day, West Portal Park, above the Twin Peaks Tunnel, provides a view of the Marin Headlands and the Farallon Islands in the Pacific. ==Transit== The neighborhood is served by the Muni train lines L Taraval, M Ocean View, S Shuttle, K Ingleside and T Third Street. https://www.sfmta.com/muni ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in San Francisco Category:Shopping districts and streets in the United States Category:Streetcar suburbs ","title":"West Portal, San Francisco"},{"id":"1429935","text":"George Speck (also known as George Crum;Hugh Bradley, Such Was Saratoga, New York: 1940 (July 15, 1824 ‚Äì July 22, 1914) was an American chef. He worked as a hunter, guide, and cook in the Adirondack mountains, and became noted for his culinary skills after being hired at Moon‚Äôs Lake House on Saratoga Lake, near Saratoga Springs, New York. Speck's specialities included wild meat, especially venison and duck, and he often experimented in the kitchen. During the 1850s, while working at Moon's Lake House in the midst of a dinner rush, Speck tried slicing the potatoes extra thin and dropping the slices into the deep hot fat of the frying pan. Although recipes for potato chips were published in several cookbooks decades prior to the 1850s, a local legend associates Speck with the creation of potato chip.Hugh Bradley. Such Was Saratoga 1940:121-122 ==Early life== Speck was born on July 15, 1824 in Saratoga County in upstate New York. Though information about their actual heritage is unclear, and has been assumed to be African-American and mixed- race, Speck and his sister Catherine Wicks \\"both identified as members of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe.\\" ==Early career== Speck developed his culinary skills at Cary Moon's Lake House on Saratoga Lake, noted as an expensive restaurant at a time when wealthy families from Manhattan and other areas were building summer \\"camps\\" in the area. Speck and his sister, Wicks, also cooked at the Sans Souci in Ballston Spa, alongside another St. Regis Mohawk Indian known for his skills as a guide and cook, Pete Francis. One of the regular customers at Moon's was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who, although he savored the food, could never seem to remember Speck's name. On one occasion, he called a waiter over to ask \\"Crum,\\" \\"How long before we shall eat?\\" Rather than take offense, Speck decided to embrace the nickname, figuring that, \\"A crumb is bigger than a speck.\\"Elizabeth Barrett Britten [Jean McGregor]. Chronicles of Saratoga, Saratoga Springs, NY: Bradshaw 1947:176 By 1860, Speck had opened his own restaurant, called Crum's, on Storey Hill in nearby Malta, New York. His cuisine was in high demand among Saratoga Springs' tourists and elites: \\"His prices were‚Ä¶those of the fashionable New York restaurants, but his food and service were worth it‚Ä¶Everything possible was raised on his own small farm, and that, too, got his personal attention whenever he could arrange it.\\"Hugh Bradley, Such Was Saratoga, New York: 1940, 121-122. According to popular accounts, he was said to include a basket of chips on every table. One contemporaneous source recalls that in his restaurant, Speck was unquestionably the man in charge: \\"His rules of procedure were his own. They were very strict, and being an Indian, he never departed from them. In the slang of the racecourse, he \\"played no favorites.\\" Guests were obliged to wait their turn, the millionaire as well as the wage-earner. Mr. Vanderbilt once was obliged to wait an hour and a half for a meal...With none but rich pleasure-seekers as his guests, Speck kept his tables laden with the best of everything, and for it all charged Delmonico prices.\\"New York Tribune December 27, 1891 ==Potato chip== Recipes for frying potato slices were published in several cookbooks in the 19th century. In 1832, a recipe for fried potato \\"shavings\\" was included in a United States cookbook derived from an earlier English collection.\\"Civil War Recipes and Food History ‚Äì The Potato During the Civil War\\" , Civil War Interactive website William Kitchener's The Cook's Oracle (1822), also included techniques for such a dish.Kitchener, Dr. William, 1822.

Francis and David Felt. The New York Tribune ran a feature article on \\"Crum's: The Famous Eating House on Saratoga Lake\\" in December 1891, but mentioned nothing about potato chips. Neither did Crum's commissioned biography, published in 1893, nor did one 1914 obituary in a local paper.\\"George Crum Dies at Saratoga Lake\\", The (Saratoga Springs) Saratogian, July 27, 1914 Another obituary states \\"Crum is said to have been the actual inventor of \\"Saratoga chips.\\"\\" When Wicks died in 1924, however, her obituary authoritatively identified her as follows: \\"A sister of George Crum, Mrs. Catherine Wicks, died at the age of 102, and was the cook at Moon‚Äôs Lake House. She first invented and fried the famous Saratoga Chips.\\"The Saratogian Saratoga Springs, New York, October 8, 1924 Wicks recalled the invention of Saratoga Chips as an accident: she had \\"chipped off a piece of the potato which, by the merest accident, fell into the pan of fat. She fished it out with a fork and set it down upon a plate beside her on the table.\\" Her brother tasted it, declared it good, and said, \\"We‚Äôll have plenty of these.\\"Elizabeth Barrett Britten [Jean McGregor]. Chronicles of Saratoga, Saratoga Springs, NY: Bradshaw 1947:44-45 In a 1932 interview with the Saratogian newspaper, her grandson, John Gilbert Freeman, asserted Wicks's role as the true inventor of the potato chip.\\"Another Claims Potato Chip Idea\\" Glens Falls Post Star August 4, 1932 Hugh Bradley's 1940 history of Saratoga contains some information about Speck, based on local folklore as much as on any specific historical primary sources. In their 1983 article in Western Folklore, Fox and Banner say that Bradley had cited an 1885 article in the Hotel Gazette about Speck and the potato chips. Bradley repeated some material from that article, including that \\"Crum was born in 1828, the son of Abe Speck, a mulatto jockey who had come from Kentucky to Saratoga Springs and married a Stockbridge Indian woman,\\" and that, \\"Crum also claimed to have considerable German and Spanish blood.\\" In any event, Speck helped popularize the potato chip, first as a cook at Moon's and then in his own place. Cary Moon, owner of Moon‚Äôs Lake House, later rushed to claim credit for the invention, and began mass-producing the chips, first served in paper cones, then packaged in boxes. They became wildly popular: \\"It was at Moon‚Äôs that Clio first tasted the famous Saratoga chips, said to have originated there, and it was she who first scandalized spa society by strolling along Broadway and about the paddock at the race track crunching the crisp circlets out of a paper sack as though they were candy or peanuts. She made it the fashion, and soon you saw all Saratoga dipping into cornucopias filled with golden-brown paper-thin potatoes; a gathered crowd was likely to create a sound like a scuffling through dried autumn leaves.\\" Visitors to Saratoga Springs were advised to take the 10-mile journey around the lake to Moon's if only for the chips: \\"the hobby of the Lake House is Fried Potatoes, and these they serve in good style. They are sold in papers like confectionary.\\"R.F. Dearborn, Saratoga and How to See It. Albany, NY: Weed, Parsons, and Company 1871:51 A 1973 advertising campaign by the St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips, featured an ad for Speck and his story, published in the national magazines, Fortune and Time. During the late 1970s, the variant of the story featuring Vanderbilt became popular because of the interest in his wealth and name, and evidence suggests the source was an advertising agency for the Potato Chip/Snack Food Association.Burhans, Dirk (2008). Crunch! A History of the Great American Potato Chip, Madison, WI: Terrace Books (Univ. of Wisconsin Press), pp. 15‚Äì21. A 1983 article in Western Folklore identifies potato chips as having originated in Saratoga Springs, New York, while critiquing the variants of popular stories. In all versions, the chips became popular and subsequently known as \\"Saratoga chips\\" or \\"potato crunches\\".William S. Fox and Mae G. Banner, Topics and Comments: \\"Social and Economic Contexts of Folklore Variants: The Case of Potato Chip Legends\\", Western Folklore (Western States Folklore Society), Vol. 42, No. 2 (Apr. 1983), pp. 114‚Äì126, accessed June 20, 2013 The 21st-century Snopes website writes that Crum's customer, if he existed, was more likely an obscure one. Vanderbilt was indeed a regular customer at both Crum's Malta restaurant and Moon's Lake House, but there is no evidence that he played a role by requesting or promoting potato chips.\\"Early Lake Houses Saratoga, New York\\", from Reminiscences of Saratoga, compiled by Cornelius E.

After The Keith Harris Show ended in 1990, Harris took up work for Butlins holiday resorts. In 1991 \\"Orville's Song\\" was sampled for a dance music single \\"I Wish I Could Fly\\" by DWA with Harris appearing in the accompanying music video. In 2004, Harris provided Orville's personality in an advert for Surf washing powder. Harris, in an attempt to broaden the horizons of his original stage show, also toured with a more adult offering entitled Duck Off. Orville and Harris had a short appearance on the sketch comedy series Little Britain as themselves in a group of entertainers waiting to meet the royal family. In another episode, Orville was portrayed as an out-of-work actor shopping at a supermarket, played by Matt Lucas, dressed as an oversized version of Orville, and had a regularly pitched voice. Harris and Orville have also made an appearance on Channel Four's Banzai. In 2005, both Harris and Orville appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show, The Farm and went on to win it. They also appeared in the video for Tony Christie's \\"Is This the Way to Amarillo\\", which was re-released in that year. In May 2009, they made a cameo appearance on the BBC drama Ashes to Ashes, set in November 1982. There were two Orville puppets that Harris used, one manual, one a radio-controlled animatronic version. The original Orville puppet is insured for ¬£100,000. In February 2012, Orville featured in a giffgaff advert. In October 2012 and December 2013, Orville appeared with Harris on Pointless Celebrities. Harris died of cancer on 28 April 2015 and his agent confirmed that Orville would be retired and will never appear in public again. ==References== ==External links== * Colosseum Nightclub News: Duck In Hell - Orville And Cuddles Have Grown Up * Keith Harris * Lyrics to \\"Orville's Song\\" Category:Television characters introduced in 1982 Category:Ventriloquists' dummies Category:Reality show winners Category:British comedy puppets Category:Fictional ducks Category:BBC Records artists ","title":"Orville the Duck"},{"id":"1429957","text":"John Lenahan (born 1961 in Philadelphia, US) is an American illusionist and entertainer resident in the UK since 1984. A successful corporate entertainer, he came to greater fame as a result of a 1994 appearance on the BBC One show How Do They Do That? explaining the sleight of hand trick known as Three-card Monte, as a result of which he became the first person in 85 years to be expelled from The Magic Circle. His subsequent television appearances have included his own 1997 series for BBC Two, Stuff the White Rabbit; and the Secrets of Magic specials for BBC One.

A native of Santa Fe Province (he lived as a child until a few years Brandsen, Buenos Aires Province), which was also the birthplace of Carlos Monz√≥n, Coggi was a three-time world light welterweight champion. He had 75 wins, 5 losses and 2 draws, with 44 wins by knockout. He never lost a fight by knockout. ==Early boxing career== After a stellar amateur career, Coggi became a professional boxer on 2 April 1982, knocking out Horacio Valdes in four rounds at La Plata. Coggi won seven of his first ten bouts by knockout. The first boxer to last the scheduled distance with him was Viterman Sanchez, who lost a six-round decision to Coggi on 7 May 1982. Coggi went undefeated for 21 bouts, with 11 knockout wins. Then, on 9 March 1985, he met Adolfo Arce Rossi in Buenos Aires. Arce Rossi became the first boxer to defeat Coggi by outpointing him over ten rounds. After one more win, Coggi fought to a draw over ten rounds with Ramon Collado, on 20 June of that same year. Coggi went on a six- fight winning streak before he and Collado met again. Once again, Collado held him to a ten-round draw, on 19 July 1986. On 25 October of that year, Coggi won the Argentine light welterweight title, knocking out Hugo Hernandez in three rounds. ==Championship career== Despite having a record that included no one of apparent relevance, the WBA placed Coggi on top of their list of challengers for the world crown at the light welterweight division. After one more win, Coggi challenged for the world title for the first time. The WBA's world champion, Patrizio Oliva, had dethroned Coggi's countryman, Ubaldo Sacco, to win the world championship. So the fight between Coggi and Oliva generated much interest among Argentine boxing fans. Coggi's first title try was also his first fight abroad, as the fight was held in Ribera, Italy, on 4 July 1987. Coggi caused a minor upset when he knocked out Oliva in three rounds to become world champion. Like Monzon, Coggi also became well liked in Italy despite the fact he had beaten an Italian for the world championship. Coggi would fight in Italy a number of times during the rest of his career. His first title defense came in Italy, when he knocked out Sang-Ho Lee in two rounds on 7 May 1988. After beating Lee, he would win four non-title bouts in his country, including two ten-round decisions over Jorge Tejada, who later became a contender in the welterweight division. For his second defense, Coggi returned to Italy, where he defeated perennial contender Harold Brazier of the United States by a twelve-round unanimous decision on 21 January 1989. His third defense, on 29 April 1989, was also held in Italy. He defeated future world champion Akinobu Hiranaka by a twelve-round decision. However, this match was controversial for the decision which gave Italian-Argentine boxer Coggi excessive favor, while Coggi was knocked down by Hiranaka twice at 3rd round, and he has been inferior to Hiranaka at performance throughout 12 rounds. Among many boxing fans, there have been the strong voice that the victory should have been given to Hiranaka, since the match was owned by him. After two non title wins, Coggi had four fights in France, beginning with a fourth-round knockout victory over Jesse Williams in another non-title bout. On 24 March 1990, Coggi beat the former lightweight champion Jos√© Luis Ram√≠rez by a twelve-round unanimous decision to retain the title. After beating Danilo Cabrera by knockout in round five, Coggi defended his title in Nice against the relatively unheralded Loreto Garza of Sacramento, California, on 17 August. This time around, it was Coggi's turn to lose in a mild upset, as Garza became the champion by outpointing Coggi over twelve rounds. On his next fight, held on 11 November at Buenos Aires, Coggi once again outpointed Tejada over ten rounds. His next fight happened under extremely unlikely circumstances: he was in Sacramento to watch Garza defend his world title and, at the same time, challenge him to a rematch, when one of the boxers to be featured as part of the night's undercard suffered a car accident at the ARCO Arena parking lot and broke his wrist. Coggi took on the role of substitute fighter, and he beat Alberto Alcaraz by a knockout in round seven, 1 December. Coggi went on to win his next eleven fights, six of them by knockout, before challenging Morris East for the WBA title on 12 January 1993, in Mar del Plata. Coggi became a light welterweight champion for the second time that night when he knocked East out in eight rounds. On 10 April 1993, he made his first defense of his second reign, knocking out perennial Puerto Rican world title challenger Joe Rivera in seven rounds, in Mar del Plata. Next, he defended against Hiroyuki Yoshino on 23 June. In what marked his Asian debut, Coggi knocked Yoshino out in five rounds, in a fight held in Tokyo, Japan. He defended his title three more times in 1993. On 13 August, he outpointed Jose Rafael Barbosa over twelve rounds in Buenos Aires, once again, retaining the world title. On 24 September, he knocked out Guillermo Cruz in ten rounds at Tucum√°n, and then, on 11 December, he closed 1993 by knocking out Eder Gonzalez, also in Tucum√°n, in the seventh round. He and Gonzalez had a rematch on 18 March 1994. In what marked Coggi's American debut, he knocked Gonzalez out in three rounds at Las Vegas, Nevada, once again, retaining the title. ===Bouts with Frankie Randall=== On 17 September 1994, he began a series of three bouts with former Ch√°vez-conqueror Frankie Randall, who relieved Coggi of the title by beating him by a twelve-round unanimous decision. Coggi suffered three knockdowns during the fight. Coggi had two more wins, then he faced Randall for the second time. Coggi became champion for the third time on 13 January 1996, when he beat Randall by a fifth round technical decision. Randall was controlling the fight when he went down when his feet became tangled with Coggi in the third round. Because Coggi landed a glancing blow as Randall went down, Coggi was credited with a knockdown by the referee. In the fifth round, the two fighters clashed heads and Coggi walked to his corner and lay down. The referee tried to convince Coggi to fight but he was either unwilling or unable to do so. The ringside physician later said that Coggi was coherent and when Coggi was examined at a hospital after the fight, he was given a clean bill of health. The fight went to the scorecards and Coggi was ahead on all judges' cards by one point (due to the knockdown called against Randall in the third round). Due to the controversial nature of the match, the WBA ordered a third bout between the two rivals. The third fight between Coggi and Randall came on 16 August, at Buenos Aires. Coggi suffered a knockdown in the second round, which would prove to be pivotal in the end, as Randall pulled a unanimous but close decision to recover the title. ==Post- championship career== The rest of his career, Coggi fought second level opposition, posting five wins in a row, three by knockout, before facing another well known fighter. In Coggi's last fight, contended on 29 May 1999, he lost a twelve-round unanimous decision to Michele Piccirillo in Italy. ==Retirement== Coggi is now a boxing trainer. His son, Martin Antonio Coggi, is a professional boxer. Coggi was one of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's favorite boxers: in a rare opportunity for a boxer, President Alfons√≠n invited Coggi to his presidential home after Coggi became world champion for the first time. ==Professional boxing record==  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"75 Wins (44 Knockouts), 5 Defeats, 2 Draw,Juan Martin Coggi's Professional Boxing Record .

A member of the Democratic Party of Guam, Bordallo previously served as a Senator in the Guam Legislature from 1957 to 1971. == Early life == Bordallo was born on in Hag√•t√±a, Guam. He was the son of Baltazar Jeronimo \\"BJ\\" Bordallo (August 8, 1900 ‚Äì May 10, 1984), a businessman, and Josefina Torres Pangelinan (December 18, 1904 ‚Äì December 2, 1945). BJ Bordallo was a popular politician from the 1930s to 1950s. Ricardo Bordallo was the first child of a family including his brother Paul Joseph Bordallo (1930‚Äì2007), who was a former senator. Ricardo Bordallo attended the University of San Francisco before returning to Guam and becoming a successful businessman and car dealer. Among other positions, he was the proprietor of \\"Ricky's Suburban Club,\\" a restaurant and bar in Tamuning, Guam. Bordallo also established \\"Ricky's Auto Company\\" in the mid 1950s which became Toyota's first American car dealer. == Personal life == He was married to Madeleine Zeien Bordallo in 1953; together they have one daughter Deborah, and one grandchild, Nicole Nelson. Bordallo's widow was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1990, and served as Lieutenant Governor of Guam from 1995 to 2003, and as the island's Delegate to the United States House of Representatives from 2003 until losing renomination in the 2018 election. == Political career == === Senator of the Guam Legislature === Bordallo was first elected to the Guam Legislature in 1956 as a member of the Popular Party (predecessor to the Democratic Party of Guam). Bordallo served in the territorial legislature from 1957 to 1970 and twice served as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Guam. As a senator, he introduced the law that first created an unofficial Guam delegate to the U.S. Congress. === Bordallo-Taitano Gubernatorial Ticket (1970) === Bordallo first ran for governor in the 1970 election, which was the first election in which the people of Guam were allowed to elect their governor. He ran with Senator Richard \\"Dick\\" Taitano against two other former gubernatorial teams: Former governor Manuel Guerrero and running mate Dr. Antonio C. (Tony) Yamashita, as well as attorney and former speaker Joaquin C. \\"Kin\\" Arriola and running mate Vicente Bamba, retired judge and popular former senator. Bordallo-Taitano came in first in the primary election by a close margin over Guerrero-Yamashita and then won the run-off election. However, due to the contentious Democratic campaign, Bordallo-Taitano lost in the general election to the Republican team of incumbents Carlos G. Camacho and Kurt S. Moylan. The election was significant for Bordallo, however, as he and Dick Taitano created Guam's first \\"grassroots\\" political organization throughout the villages. == Governorship (1975‚Äì1979)== === Bordallo-Sablan Gubernatorial Ticket (1974) === Bordallo's wife, Madeleine, also proved to be a passionate and untiring campaigner and helped draw many supporters to the organization. This organization and base of supporters would prove valuable when Bordallo ran again in the 1974 election. Madeleine Bordallo was most known for her humanitarian pursuits. She sponsored many civil cultural events including the Guam Symphony and a program for instructing children in the Suzuki method of violin. Bordallo ran for governor for a second time in 1974, this time with Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Guerrero Sablan. They were up against four other Democratic tickets: Manuel Guerrero and running mate David D.L. Flores; Pedro C. Sanchez and Esteban U. Torres; and Joaquin C. \\"Kin\\" Arriola and Theodore \\"Ted\\" Nelson. Dick Taitano was the manager of the Bordallo-Sablan campaign and broadened the organization he had set up in 1970. This organization proved decisive, and Bordallo-Sablan easily beat the other Democratic teams. Bordallo-Sablan then went on to beat the Camacho-Moylan team, which had just barely beat the Republican rival team of Paul Calvo and Antonio Palomo in the primary. Calvo ran as a write-in candidate in the general election, drawing support from Camacho-Moylan, and Bordallo-Sablan won by less than 600 of the 22,000-plus votes. === First term 1975‚Äì79 === Bordallo's first term in office, from 1975 to 1979, was contentious. He was characterized as highly charismatic but highly controversial. Someone wasn't afraid to speak his mind on any issue. During this time the issue of independence, statehood, commonwealth status or continuation as a U.S. territory was put to the voters. Senator Paul Bordallo, his brother, favored independence. The voters elected to keep the status quo as a dependent territory. Bordallo was successful in securing $367 million for typhoon reconstruction, capital improvement project and Government of Guam investments. A new was secured at the Guam Memorial Hospital. === Bordallo- Sanchez Gubernatorial Ticket (1978) === In 1978, Bordallo ran for re-election with a former University of Guam president Dr. Pedro C. Sanchez as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Lieutenant Governor Sablan declared his candidacy for the gubernatorial election and was a candidate in the September 1978 Democratic primary, along with his running mate for Lt. Governor was Attorney Jose Iglesias Leon Guerrero. Bordallo won the Democratic primary and defeated the Sablan-Leon Guerrero campaign with more votes. However, Bordallo lost to the Republican Calvo-Ada team in the gubernatorial general election. == Governorship (1983‚Äì1987) == === Bordallo-Reyes Gubernatorial Ticket (1982) === Bordallo ran for a third time political arena in 1982 with a political unknown, Air Force Colonel Eddie Reyes, as his running mate. He beat out Democrats Carl Gutierrez and John P. Aguon for the Democratic nomination and won office yet again. Promising to guide Guam out of the recession and push for commonwealth status, the Bordallo/Reyes ticket defeated incumbent Governor Calvo in the 1982 elections. === Second term 1983‚Äì87 === Bordallo's second term in office, from 1983 to 1987. During his second term, Bordallo chaired the Commission for Self-Determination and spearheaded the drafting of the Guam Commonwealth Act developed by June 4, 1986. He addressed Guam's education problems with his 1983 \\"Blueprint for Excellence\\" and worked on the accreditation status of the University of Guam. He went to Washington D.C. on January 20, 1985, with congressman Ben Blaz at the Officers Club, and Andrews Air Force Base. === Bordallo-Reyes Gubernatorial Ticket (1986) === Bordallo sought re-election with Lt. Gov Edward D. Reyes as his running mate. The ticket won the Democratic nomination when they defeated by Senator Gutierrez and Senator John P. Aguon in the primary election. Bordallo lost the general election to former Lieutenant Governor Ada and Senator Frank F. Blas in the general election. == Post-governorship == === Criminal conviction === In February 1987, Bordallo was convicted on ten counts of corruption and was sentenced to nine years in prison and fined more than $100,000. He was accused of receiving over $100,000 worth of bribes and extortion in connection with favors he performed in office for campaign contributions. His convictions on eight counts of bribery and extortion were overturned in August 1988, leaving charges of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. On December 13, 1989, he was sentenced to four years in prison on the remaining charges.Ex-Guam Governor Kills Himself On Eve of Jailing for Corruption (New York Times article) === Suicide === After his failed appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Bordallo faced a four-year sentence in a federal minimum-security prison beginning on February 1, 1990. Three hours before he was scheduled to be transferred to a prison in Boron, California on , the former Governor committed suicide in Hag√•t√±a by wrapping himself in a Guam flag, chaining himself to statue of Chief Kepuha (also Quipuha, Guam's first native chief to convert to Roman Catholicism) located along Marine Corps Drive (the island's primary thoroughfare), and shooting himself in the head with a .38 caliber pistol. He had also set up four placards around the monument, one of which paraphrased the last words of Nathan Hale: \\"I regret that I only have one life to give to my island.\\" Bordallo died of massive brain damage at 4:28 P.M. at Naval Hospital, aged 62.

It is usually associated with Cleveland and other Midwestern cities. ==Instruments== The Slovenian style polka band always includes a piano accordion, chromatic accordion, or the Diatonic button accordion (also called a \\"button box\\"). Some bands in Slovenia use keyboard instead of accordion. The other melody instrument is a saxophone or clarinet, and the rhythm instruments include drums, bass, and guitar or banjo. Avsenik brothers add a trumpet, too. The Slovenian style polka in the United States of America came about when immigrants from Slovenia taught the old songs to their children. Those children, as adults, translated the old songs from the Slovene language into English, and arranged them in a polka beat. ==History== At first Slovenian style polka was just music for ethnic clubs and union halls, but the commercial success of Frankie Yankovic (Jankoviƒç) and other musicians soon introduced the genre to a wider audience. William Lausche incorporated the elements of classical music and early jazz at which point the style took on a type of swing that can be heard in his piano playing, even on some early Yankovic recordings. Johnny Pecon and Lou Trebar consequently extended the style to its farthest reaches harmonically, including blue notes, substitutions and compounded symbolism, elements of whole-tone scales, modality, borrowed and altered chords homophonically or in the implied or broken form and compounded and odd rhythmic embellishments or reductions, in addition to the use of structural and textural dynamics and phrasing that had up to that point never been utilized to such a degree. In addition to Frankie Yankovic, the most important pioneers in developing this style of music include Matt Hoyer, Dr. William Lausche, Johnny Pecon, Lou Trebar, Johnny Vadnal, Eddie Habat, and Kenny Bass. The music heard during scene transitions on The Drew Carey Show is played in Cleveland-style polka to suit the city it is set in. ==Notable musicians== Other notable musicians include Willie Verant, Slavko Avsenik, Louis Bashell, Eddie Blazonczyk, Tom Brusky, Louis Spehek, The Chardon Polka Band, Frankie Mullec, Georgie Cook,Joe Kusar, Pete Sokach, Bob Timko, Eddie Platt, Lou Sadar, Paul Yanchar, Mirk Yama, Jim Medves, Adolph Srnick, Johnny Kafer, Tony Vadnal, Richie Vadnal, Frankie Vadnal, Joe Stradiot, Bill Srnick, Frank Mahnic, Verne Meisner, Steve Meisner, Frankie Zeitz, Eddie Adamic, The Polka Maestre-Canada, Joe Luzar, Lou Luzar, Ray Champa, Eddie Bucar, Al Tercek, Walter Ostanek, Dick Flaisman, Frankie Kramer, Louie Bajc, Joe Sodja (banjoist), Dick Sodja, Al Markic, Eddie Kenik, Chester Budny, Jake Zagger, Frankie Spetich, Johnny Spetich, Dwight Gobely, George Staiduhar, Cecilia Dolgan, Art Perko, Jeff Pecon, Johnny Pecon Jr., Ralph Delligatti, Joey Miskulin, Willie Strah, Dave Wolnik, Eddie Rodick, Don Wojtila, Dan Wojtila, Dave Skrajner, Al Bambic, Jerry Suhar, Bob Kravos, Norm Kobal, John Gerl, Denny Bucar, Frank Okicki, Ron Sluga, Jack Ponikvar, Marty Sintic, Mark Habat, Wayne Habat, Stan Blout, Joe Fedorchak, Bob Bacha, Gaylord Klancnik, Ed Klancnik, Kim Rodick, Terry Skovenski, Phil Srnick, Eddie Rodick III, Frank Yasnowski, Logan Watson, Frankie Spetich Jr., Fred Kuhar, Pete Kuhar, Dave Wretschko, Mikey Dee, Bill Metts, Jerry Zagar, Lou Hribar, Benzy Rathbone, Bruce Burger, Johnny Borish, Marge Ford, Fred Ziwich, Bob Zolka, Joey Tomsick, Kathy Hlad, Eric Noltkamper, Hank Guzel, Jr., Joe Grkman, Dick Tady, Jack Tady, Brian O'Boyle, Sam Pugliano, Fred Gregorich, Mary Udovich, Josephine Lausche, Anna Vadnal, Frenchy (Frank) Sintic -Sunshine Boys, Jerry \\"Jazz\\" Jasinski, LynnMarie Hrovat, Larry Sintic, Frank Svet, and many others. ==See also== * Polka Hall of Fame * International Polka Association * Music of Slovenia == External links == * International Polka Association * Cleveland Style Polka Hall of Fame * Slovenian & Cleveland style polkas - hundreds of pages with information, photos, articles and music related to Slovenian polka music Category:Polka genres Category:American styles of music Category:Slovenian folk music Category:Slovene-American history Category:Culture of Cleveland ","title":"Slovenian-style polka"},{"id":"1430003","text":"James Henry (13 December 1798 ‚Äì 14 July 1876) was an Irish classical scholar and poet. ==Life== He was born in Dublin the elder son of a woollen draper, Robert Henry, and his wife Kathleen Elder. He was educated by Unitarian minister Joseph Hutton, and then at Trinity College, Dublin. At age 11 he fell in love with the poetry of Virgil and got into the habit of always carrying a copy of the Aeneid in his left breast-pocket. In Trinity he graduated with the gold medal for Classics. He then turned to medicine and until 1845 he practised as a physician in Dublin city. In spite of his unconventionality and unorthodox views on religion and his own profession, he was very successful. He married Anne Jane Patton, from Donegal, and had three daughters, only one of whom, Katherine, born 1830, survived infancy. His accession to a large fortune in 1845 enabled him to devote himself entirely to the absorbing occupation of his life: the study of Virgil. Accompanied by his wife and daughter, he visited all those parts of Europe where he was likely to find rare editions or manuscripts of the poet. When his wife died in Tyrol he continued his work with his daughter, who became quite a Virgil expert in her own right, and crossed the Alps seventeen times. After the death of his daughter in 1872 he returned to Dublin and continued his research at Trinity College, Dublin. He died at Dalkey, County Dublin. ==Literary commentary== As a commentator on Virgil, Henry will always deserve to be remembered, notwithstanding the occasional eccentricity of his notes and remarks. The first fruits of his researches were published at Dresden in 1853 under the quaint title Notes of a Twelve Years Voyage of Discovery in the first six Books of the Eneis. These were embodied, with alterations and additions, in the Aeneidea, or Critical, Exegetical and Aesthetical Remarks on the Aeneis (1873-1892), of which only the notes on the first book were published during the author's lifetime. As a textual critic Henry was exceedingly conservative. His notes, written in a racy and interesting style, are especially valuable for their wealth of illustration and references to the less-known classical authors. ==Poetry== Henry was also the author of five collections of verse plus two long narrative poems describing his travels, and various pamphlets of a satirical nature. At its best his poetry has something of the flavour of Robert Browning and Arthur Hugh Clough while at its worst it resembles the doggerel of William McGonagall. His five volumes of verse were all published at his own expense and received no critical attention either during or after his lifetime. ==Rediscovery== Henry was rediscovered by Christopher Ricks who included eight of his poems in the New Oxford Book of Victorian Verse (1987). Then there was silence for ten years until the Penguin Book of Victorian Verse included four of his poems. Valentine Cunningham included five of Henry's poems in The Victorians: an Anthology of Poetry and Poetics, published by Blackwell in 2000. ==Posthumous publication== In 2002 Christopher Ricks edited with an introduction the Selected Poems of James Henry, published by The Lilliput Press (reviewed in The New York Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement and The Sunday Telegraph). ==References== * Category:Irish poets Category:19th-century Irish medical doctors Category:1798 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:19th-century poets ","title":"James Henry (poet)"},{"id":"1430010","text":"Sir Christopher Bruce Ricks (born 18 September 1933)Nicholas Wroe: \\"Bringing it all back home\\" The Guardian, Saturday 29 January 2005 is a British literary critic and scholar.

He was a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Worcester College, Oxford, moving in 1968, after a sabbatical year at Stanford University, to become Professor of English at the University of Bristol. During his time at Bristol he worked on Keats and Embarrassment (1974), in which he made revelatory connections between the letters and the poetry. It was also at Bristol that he first published his still-definitive edition of Tennyson's poetry. In 1975, Ricks moved to the University of Cambridge, where in 1982 he became King Edward VII Professor of English Literature in succession to Frank Kermode, before leaving for Boston University in 1986. In June 2011 it was announced he would join the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.\\"The professoriate\\", New College of the Humanities, accessed 8 June 2011. He was knighted in the 2009 Birthday Honours. == Principles against theory == Ricks has distinguished himself as a vigorous upholder of traditional principles of reading based on practical criticism. He has opposed the theory-driven hermeneutics of the post-structuralist and postmodernist. This places him outside the post-New Critical literary theory, to which he prefers the Johnsonian principle. In an important essay,\\"Literary Principles as against theory\\", in Christopher Ricks, Essays in Appreciation, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, pp. 311‚Äì332, p. 312. he contrasts principles derived empirically from a close parsing of texts, a tradition whose great exemplar was Samuel Johnson, to the fashionable mode for philosophical critique that deconstructs the \\"rhetorical\\" figures of a text and, in doing so, unwittingly disposes of the values and principles underlying the art of criticism itself. \\"Literature\\", he argues, \\"is, among other things, principled rhetoric\\". The intellectualist bias of professional theorists cannot but make their strenuously philosophical readings of literary texts discontinuous with the subject matter. Practical criticism is attuned to both the text and the reader's own sensibility, and thus engages in a dialogue between the complex discursive resonances of words in any literary work and the reader's correlative sentiments as they have been informed by a long experience of the self within both the world and literature. In this subtle negotiation between the value-thick sensibility of the reader and the intertextual resonances of a literary work lies the tactful attunement of all great criticism. This school of criticism must remain leery of critical practices that come to the text brandishing categorical, schematic assumptions, any panoply of tacitly assumed precepts external to the practical nature of literary creativity. Otherwise, the risk is one of a theoretical hybris, of a specious detachment that assumes a certain critical superiority to the text and its author. Those theory- saturated critics who engage with texts that, by their nature, are compact of social and political judgements (and much more), assert covertly a privileged innocence, an innocence denied to the text under scrutiny, whose rhetorical biases, and epistemological fault-lines are relentlessly subjected to ostensible \\"exposure\\". ==Works== *A Dissertation Upon English Typographical Founders and Founderies 1778 by Edward Rowe Mores (1961) editor with Harry Carter *Milton's Grand Style (1963) *Poems and Critics (1966) anthology *The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence Sterne (1967) editor with Graham Petrie *Twentieth Century Views: A.

TDC A/S or TDC Group (formerly Tele Danmark Communications) is a Danish telecommunications company dating back to 1879. TDC Group is the largest telecommunications company in Denmark. The company's headquarters are located in Copenhagen. TDC Group is the parent company of several subsidiaries and brands: Blockbuster, Cirque A/S, Company mobile, Hiper, Dansk Kabel TV, NetDesign, TDC Erhverv, Telmore, Unotel, and YouSee. ==History== On 21 August 1882 Carl Frederik Tietgen acquired the Copenhagen division of International Bell Telephone Company, an American-owned telephone exchange on Lille Kongensgade in Copenhagen, for DKK 200,000 and founded Kj√∏benhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTS, later Kj√∏benhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTAS. In November 1990, the Folketing passed a law that paved the way for a nationwide Danish telecom. The company was named Tele Danmark and was the parent company for the existing regional companies (KTAS, Jydsk Telefon, Tele S√∏nderjylland, Fyns Telefon, and Rigstelefonen). In 1995, the regional companies were merged into Tele Danmark, and the first nationwide cable TV company, Tele Danmark Kabel TV was created. Five years later, in 2000, Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC. In January 2000 TDC got a new logo with five ovals in red, yellow, green, turquoise and blue colour. In December 2000 Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC. At the same time it demerged into a parent holding company and a number of subsidiaries with the purpose of increasing customer focus, creating greater transparency and achieving faster time to market for products and services. Over the past decade, TDC developed from a traditional and mainly Danish provider of landline and mobile telephony services into a Danish-based European provider of communications solutions. Deregulation of the Danish telecommunications market in 1996 created a highly competitive market. In 2004, the Danish telecommunications market was fully liberalized. TDC was partly privatized in 1994 and fully privatized in 1998, and at year-end 2004, TDC's shares were held mainly by institutions and retail investors in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2006 TDC adopted a new logo which consists of a cursive rounded-rectangle in blue colour. The text \\"TDC\\" appears in the rectangle and remind that the letter \\"D\\" is cut a little bit. A group of private equity firms under the banner Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) offered to buy TDC for a price of about 9.1 billion Euro. Among the group were companies such as Blackstone, Permira, Apax Partners and KKR. The company bought 88% of the shares, but failed to buy more than 90% of the shares and was thus unable to remove the company completely from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Also in 2006, TDC pulled out of the UK mobile telephone market, with the closure of their joint venture with EasyGroup, EasyMobile. In 2007, TDC folded its subsidiaries back into the parent company with the exception of TDC Kabel TV, which continued as an independent legal identity. Later in the year, on 1 October 2007, TDC Kabel TV changed its name to YouSee to signal a focus on more than just TV. In 2010 Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) began the process of selling its shares in TDC on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, initially reducing its 88 percent holding of the company to less than 60 percent. In 2012 TDC had a total revenue of 26 billion DKK, and employed around 9,000 people in Denmark. In 2014 TDC purchased the Norwegian telecommunications firm Get AS for 12.5 billion DKK. In 2016 TDC purchased Danish IT- and telecom provider Cirque A/S for an unspecified amount. On 1 July 2016 the TDC consumer business was merged with YouSee, migrating the entire TDC customer base of IPTV, broadband and mobile consumers to YouSee. The mobile phone network continues to use the 'TDC' name, as its built by TDC Group instead of YouSee. TDC Group and Modern Times Group announced on 1 February 2018 a plan for TDC Group to buy MTG Nordics to create a converged business with a new name and brand. A week later, a takeover bid from the Australian infrastructure group Macquarie and three Danish pension funds; PFA, PKA and ATP was leaked to the public, which TDC had rejected. The consortium clarified that the proposed MTG merger was not part of their strategy. In February the consortium launched an improved take-over offer, which TDC Group now recommended. The proposed MTG merger was called off. The consortium got EU approval for their takeover bid on 28 March 2018. In early April, the consortium announced they had acquired more than 90% of the total shares of TDC Group, making a delisting possible. On 20 January 2020 TDC announced that their low-cost brand and mobile virtual network operator Fullrate would be shut down and the customers be migrated to YouSee. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Telecommunications companies of Denmark Category:Television in Denmark Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Mobile phone companies of Denmark Category:Companies based in Copenhagen Category:Danish companies established in 1990 Category:Danish brands ","title":"TDC A/S"},{"id":"1430038","text":"Lorraine Jayne Barrett (born 18 Mar 1950) is a former Welsh Labour & Co- operative Member of the National Assembly for Wales for Cardiff South and Penarth and an Assembly Commissioner from 2007 until 2011.

The poem was published between 1812 and 1818. Dedicated to \\"Ianthe\\", it describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man, who is disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry and looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood. The poem was widely imitated and contributed to the cult of the wandering Byronic hero who falls into melancholic reverie as he contemplates scenes of natural beauty. Its autobiographical subjectivity was widely influential, not only in literature but in the arts of music and painting as well, and was a powerful ingredient in European Romanticism. ==Origins== Charlotte Harley (1801‚Äì1880), to whom Byron dedicated Childe Harold, using the nickname Ianthe The poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through Portugal, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811.. The \\"Ianthe\\" of the dedication was the term of endearment he used for Lady Charlotte Harley, about 11 years old when Childe Harold was first published. Charlotte Bacon, n√©e Harley, was the second daughter of 5th Earl of Oxford and Lady Oxford, Jane Elizabeth Scott. Throughout the poem, Byron, in character of Childe Harold, regretted his wasted early youth, hence re-evaluating his life choices and re- designing himself through going on the pilgrimage, during which he lamented various historical events including the Iberian Peninsular War among others. Despite Byron's initial hesitation at having the first two cantos of the poem published because he felt it revealed too much of himself,. it was published, at the urging of friends, by John Murray in 1812, and brought both the poem and its author to immediate and unexpected public attention. Byron later wrote, \\"I awoke one morning and found myself famous\\".. The first two cantos in John Murray's edition were illustrated by Richard Westall, well-known painter and illustrator who was then commissioned to paint portraits of Byron. Published on March 3, 1812, the first run of 500 quarto copies sold out in three days. There were ten editions of the work within three years. Byron was deeming the work \\"my best\\" in 1817, a year before adding a fourth canto.Chalk, Aidan. \\"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: a Romaunt and the Influence of Local Attachment\\", Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 40.1, Local Habitations (Spring 1998), pp. 48‚Äì77. Byron chose for the epigraph for the 1812 edition title page a passage from Le Cosmopolite, ou, le Citoyen du Monde (1753), by , in the original French. Translated into English, the quote emphasizes how the travels have resulted in a greater appreciation of his own country: > The universe is a kind of book of which one has read only the first page > when one has seen only one's own country. I have leafed through a large > enough number, which I have found equally bad. This examination was not at > all fruitless for me. I hated my country. All the impertinences of the > different peoples among whom I have lived have reconciled me to her. If I > had not drawn any other benefit from my travels than that, I would regret > neither the expense nor the fatigue.Lord Byron. Selected Poems. London: > Penguin Books, 1996. ==Structure== The poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consist of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC. Frontispiece to a 1825 edition of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Lyrics in a different form occasionally punctuate these stanzas: the farewell to England following Canto I's stanza 13 and later the address \\"To Inez\\" following stanza 84; and in Canto II the war song that follows stanza 72. Then in Canto III there is the greeting from Drachenfels following stanza 55. ==Plot== The youthful Harold, cloyed with the pleasures of the world and reckless of life, wanders about Europe, making his feelings and ideas the subjects of the poem. In Canto I he is in Spain and Portugal, where he recounts the savagery of their invasion by the French. In Canto II he moves to Greece, uplifted by the beauty of its past in a country now enslaved by the Turks. Canto III finds him on the battlefield of Waterloo, from which he journeys down the Rhine and crosses into Switzerland, enchanted by the beauty of the scenery and its historic associations. In Canto IV Harold starts from Venice on a journey through Italy, lamenting the vanished heroic and artistic past, and the subject status of its various regions. ==The fictive narrator== For the long poem he was envisaging, Byron chose not only the Spenserian stanza but also the archaising dialect in which The Faerie Queene was written, possibly following the example of Spenser's 18th century imitators.Spenserians Thus in the Pilgrimage's first three stanzas we find mote (as past tense of the verb 'might'); whilome (once upon a time) and ne (not); hight (named) and losel (good-for-nothing). If such stylistic artificiality was meant to create a distance between hero and author, it failed - protest though Byron might in the preface that his protagonist was purely fictitious. No sooner had Walter Scott read the work than he was commenting in a private letter to Joanna Baillie that \\"the hero, notwithstanding the affected antiquity of the style in some parts, is a modern man of fashion and fortune, worn out and satiated with the pursuits of dissipation, and although there is a caution against it in the preface, you cannot for your soul avoid concluding that the author, as he gives an account of his own travels, is also doing so in his own character.\\"John Gibson Lockhart, Life of Sir Walter Scott, vol.3, p.11 In the public sphere, the Anti-Jacobin Review came to the similar conclusion that Childe Harold \\"appears to be nothing but the dull, inanimate, instrument for conveying his poetical creator's sentiments to the public. Lord Byron avows the intent of this hero's introduction to be the 'giving some connection to the piece'; but we cannot, for the life of us, discover how the piece is more connected, by assigning the sentiments which it conveys to a fictitious personage, who takes no part in any of the scenes described, who achieves no deeds, and who, in short, has no one province to perform, than it would have been had Lord Byron spoken in his own person, and been the 'hero of his own tale'.The Anti-Jacobin Review, Vol. 42 (May ‚Äì August 1818), p.344 In the face of unanimous scepticism, Byron gave up the pretence and finally admitted in the letter to his fellow-traveller John Hobhouse that prefaced Canto IV: \\"With regard to the conduct of the last canto, there will be found less of the pilgrim than in any of the preceding, and that little slightly, if at all, separated from the author speaking in his own person. The fact is, that I had become weary of drawing a line which everyone seemed determined not to perceive.\\"The Works of Lord Byron, vol.2, p.99 ==Imitations== The first two cantos of Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage had scarcely been published before its world-weary hero was satirised in the popular Rejected Addresses of 1812. Cui Bono? enquires \\"Lord B\\". in the Spenserian stanza employed by the original: Byron was so amused by the book that he wrote to his publisher, \\"Tell the author I forgive him, were he twenty times our satirist\\". He was not as forgiving of the next tribute to his work, Modern Greece: A Poem (1817) by Felicia Hemans, which was dependent for its subject on the second canto of the Pilgrimage. At first published anonymously, it was even taken to be by Byron himself in one contemporary review.Spenserians While it was written in a similar rhetorical style, her poem used a slightly longer 10-line stanza terminating in an alexandrine. This too deplored the land's Turkish enslavement and mourned its decline, although pausing to admire the occasion in the past when \\"woman mingled with your warrior band\\" (stanza 50) in resisting invasion. Where the author diverged to take direct issue with Byron was on the controversy over the Elgin Marbles, championing instead their removal to a land that can still cherish their inspiration. To Byron's assertion that she had replied Over the years, others wrote works dependent on the Pilgrimage to a greater or lesser degree. George Croly celebrated the victory at the Battle of Waterloo with his Paris in 1815: A Poem (London, 1817). It was prefaced by 21 Spenserian stanzas in the Byronic manner, followed by many more sections in couplets.Spenserians This was followed in 1818 by the anonymous collection Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage to the Dead Sea (and other poems). There the Byronic outcast of the title poem relates a catalogue of sins through thirty pages of irregular couplets, wound up by a call to last minute repentance.London 1818, Google Books, pp. 6-36 By 1820 the habit of imitation had crossed to the US, where five Spenserian stanzas dependent on the Pilgrimage's Canto II were published under the title \\"Childe Harold in Boetia\\" in The Galaxy.William Ellery Leonard, Byron and Byronism in America, Columbia University, 1905, p.31 But the Childe was to be found applying himself to other activities than travel. The 62 pages of Francis Hodgson's Childe Harold's Monitor, or Lines occasioned by the last canto of Childe Harold (London 1818),Google Books are given over to literary satire in the manner of Byron's English Bards and Scotch Reviewers. Written in heroic couplets, it champions the style of the Augustan poets against the emergent Romantic style, particularly of the Lake Poets. Childe Harold in the Shades: An Infernal Romaunt (London 1819), displays much the same sentiments.The British Critic, Volume 11 (1819), pp.83-87 The poem is set in the Classical underworld and its anonymous youthful author has since been identified as Edward Dacres Baynes.Ian Macdonald, \\"A Love of Poetry\\", Guyana Chronicle, 13 September 2014 Title page of Alphonse de Lamartine's Le dernier chant du p√®lerinage d'Harold, 1825 Byron's death in the Greek War of Independence initiated a new round of imitations. William Lisle Bowles responded to his interment with a generous elegy in the six stanzas of \\"Childe Harold's Last Pilgrimage\\" (1826). These were written in the same form as Byron's poem and, forgiving the bitter insults that had passed between them in the course of a public controversy, now paid a magnanimous tribute to the manner of his dying.Spenserians There was also a crop of French imitations on this occasion, of which the foremost was Alphonse de Lamartine's Le Dernier Chant du P√©lerinage d‚ÄôHarold (Paris, 1825). Despite the poet's assertion of the originality of his 'Fifth Canto', a contemporary English review found it often dependent on Byron's works.The Monthly Review or Literary Journal, vol.108, 1825, pp.453-60 Its English translation by J. W. Lake, The Last Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, was published from Paris in 1826. Another in heroic couplets followed from London in 1827.Google Books Another French enthusiast, Jules Lef√®vre-Deumier, had actually been on the way to join Byron in Greece in 1823 but a shipwreck robbed him of the opportunity to join the cause. He too recorded a pilgrimage from Paris into Swizerland in Les P√©lerinages d‚Äôun Childe Harold Parisien, published in 1825 under the pseudonym D. J. C. Verf√®le.Maria Walecka-Garbali≈Ñska, Jules Lef√®vre-Deumier (1797‚Äì1857) et le mythe romantique du genie, Universit√© d'Uppsala, 1987 In the following year Aristide Tarry published the pamphlet-length Childe-Harold aux ruines de Rome: imitation du po√®me de Lord Byron, which was sold in aid of the Greek combatants.Christian A. E. Jensen, L'√©volution du romantisme: l'ann√©e 1826, Slatkine Reprints, Geneva 1986, p.145 A later imitation of Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage lay unacknowledged for more than a century. John Clare had started to compose his own \\"Child Harold\\" in 1841, during the years of his madness, sometimes identifying himself as Byron, sometimes as a bigamist Byronic hero. Its intricate narrative stanzas are interspersed with many more lyrics than had been Byron's poem, often on the subject of Clare's youthful love for Mary Joyce. But, though \\"more sustained in thought than anything else he ever attempted\\", it was written piecemeal and the fragments were never unified or published until midway through the 20th century.Eric Robinson and Geoffrey Summerfield, introduction to The Later Poems of John Clare, Manchester University Press, 1964, pp.1-8 ==Influence== ===The Byronic hero=== The protagonist of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage embodied the example of the self- exiled Byronic hero.cf. ¬∂ 3 in the article on the topic from the Norton Anthology of English Literature His antinomian character is summed up in Lord Macaulay's essay on Moore‚Äôs Life of Lord Byron (Edinburgh Review, 1831). \\"It is hardly too much to say that Lord Byron could exhibit only one man - a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his brow, and misery in his heart; a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection‚Ä¶It is curious to observe the tendency which the dialogue of Lord Byron always has, to lose its character of dialogue and to become soliloquy.\\"Lord Macaulay, Essays, Critical and Miscellaneous, Philadelphia 1846, pp.125, 126 The type was caricatured as the melancholy Mr Cypress in Thomas Love Peacock's Nightmare Abbey, published in 1818, following the appearance of the Pilgrimage's Canto IV.Peter Cochran, The Burning of Byron‚Äôs Memoirs: New and Unpublished Essays and Papers, Cambridge Scholars 2015, p.78 The poet's misanthropic and despairing announcement there sums up the 'heroic' point of view: \\"I have no hope for myself or for others. Our life is a false nature; it is not in the harmony of things; it is an all-blasting upas whose root is earth, and whose leaves are the skies which rain their poison dews upon mankind. We wither from our youth; we gasp with unslaked thirst for unattainable good; lured from the first to the last by phantoms ‚Äì love, fame, ambition, avarice ‚Äì all idle, and all ill - one meteor of many names, that vanishes in the smoke of death.\\" Almost every word is transcribed from two of the canto's stanzas, 124 and 126.Jane Moore, John Strachan: Key Concepts in Romantic Literature, Palgrave Macmillan 2010, p.225, Eugene Onegin as Byronic hero, Dmitry Kardovsky's 1909 illustration Once Byron's poem had launched the heroic prototype, it went on to be an influence on Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin (1825 ‚Äì 32), where the poem's protagonist is compared several times to Childe Harold. Onegin shares the hero's melancholy that cannot be pleased (1.38) and his dreaminess (4.44); but perhaps his mixture of behaviours are only so many masks, and in this respect he is likened to Melmoth the Wanderer as well as to Childe Harold (8.8). Tatiana too ponders whether Onegin's guises make him \\"a Muscovite in Harold's dress, a modish second-hand edition\\" (7.24).Charles Johnston‚Äôs translation But however much that pose may have been appreciated in the first half of the 19th century, by World War 2 the reaction to the hero's attitudes had veered to scepticism. C. S. Lewis, in The Screwtape Letters (1941), bracketed Childe Harold and Young Werther as Romantic types \\"submerged in self-pity for imaginary distresses\\" for whom \\"five minutes' genuine toothache would reveal [their] romantic sorrows for the nonsense they were\\".C. S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters (1941), Letter XIII Equally, the bluff hero of C. S. Forester's The Commodore (1945) dismissed Byron's poem as \\"bombast and fustian\\" while flipping through its pages for inspiration.Sue Parrill, Nelson's Navy in Fiction and Film, McFarland, 2009, p.79 ===Music=== The first two cantos of the poem were launched under the title Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage: A Romaunt, and other poems.Google Books There were twenty of those \\"other poems\\", for the most part arising out of Byron's tour. These supplemented the three lyrics already mentioned that were incorporated into Cantos I and II. Five of the supplementary songs were set by composers, mostly during the course of the 19th century and sometimes in translated versions. \\"On Parting\\" (The kiss, dear maid, thy lip has left), for example, was set by Ludwig van Beethoven and some 25 other composers;Lieder Net the song \\"Maid of Athens, ere we part\\" had a setting by Charles Gounod as well as others in German and Italian.Lieder Net The song \\"Adieu! Adieu! my native shore\\", which appeared in the first canto of the Pilgrimage, was set as early as 1814, but with the wording \\"My native shore adieu\\", and was apparently incorporated into the long-established opera The Maid of the Mill.Lieder Net \\"The opera has no other connection with Byron‚Äôs work\\" according to the catalogue Musical Settings of British Romantic Literature (1982), vol.1, p.490 It was also set by some twelve other composers as well as in German and Danish translations.Lieder Net And in addition to the songs, just two Spenserian stanzas from the Pilgrimage's Canto III have had musical settings: stanza 72 by the American composer Larry Austin in 1979 and a German translation of stanza 85 by Robert von Hornstein (1833‚Äì1890).Lieder Net There were also two European Romantic composers who referenced Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage in their programmatic works. Hector Berlioz recorded in his memoires that, in composing Harold en Italie (1834), he wished to draw on memories of his wanderings in the Abruzzi, making of the solo for viola at its start \\"a sort of melancholic reverie in the manner of Byron‚Äôs Childe Harold\\" (une sorte de r√™veur m√©lancolique dans le genre du Child-Harold de Byron).M√©moires de Hector Berlioz, Paris 1896, p.302 Nevertheless, Donald Tovey has pointed out in his analysis of the work that \\"there is no trace in Berlioz's music of any of the famous passages of Childe Harold\\". Several of Franz Liszt's transcriptions of Swiss natural scenery in his Ann√©es de p√®lerinage (composed during the 1830s) were accompanied by epigraphs from Canto III of Byron's poem, but while the quotations fit the emotional tone of the music, they are sometimes contextually different. Thus Liszt's second piece, Au lac de Wallenstadt (By Lake Wallenstadt), with its evocation of rippling water, is accompanied by Byron's description of the still reflective surface of Lac Leman (stanza 68). Between the next few quotations there is greater congruence, however. Liszt's fifth piece, Orage (Storm), comes with Byron's equating of meteorological and emotional weathers from canto 96. The change of tone in the sixth piece, Vall√©e d‚ÄôObermann, is signalled by the transition of mood at the end of Byron's following stanza 97; and the peaceful beginning of stanza 98 accompanies the succeeding Eglogue (Eclogue). After this sequence drawn from three contiguous stanzas, the final piece, Les cloches de Gen√®ve (Geneva bells), returns to the Lac Leman sequence of stanzas in the poem and provides another dissonance. The two lines quoted from stanza 72 fit the serene tone of the music, but only by ignoring the rejection of \\"human cities\\" two lines later.The Liszt Companion, Greenwood Press 2002, pp.77-9 In the case of both Berlioz's and Liszt's pieces, their association with Childe‚Äôs Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage is an indication of how they are to be interpreted, in that all three works are subjective and autobiographical. The music, however, is independent of the text. ===Painting=== Joseph Mallord William Turner, 1823 J. M. W. Turner was an admirer of Byron's poetry and made scenes from the Pilgrimage the subject of several paintings. In addition he was among those commissioned to provide drawings to be engraved for William Finden's landscape illustrations to Byron (1832), which also included views from the poem.Luke Hermann, J. M. W. Turner, OUP 2007, pp.65-6 One of Turner's earlier paintings was of the carnage on The Field of Waterloo (1818), which was accompanied by Byron's descriptive lines from Canto III, stanza 28.Tate Gallery For this, the poet had visited the battlefield in 1815 and Turner in 1817. Then in 1832 he exhibited a painting referencing Byron's poem in its title, Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage ‚Äì Italy (1832), accompanied by lines reflecting on the passing of imperial might from Canto IV, stanza 26.Tate Gallery Turner's Ehrenbreitstein (1835) was still another landscape carrying an epigraph, this time from the subject's appearance in Canto III, stanzas 61‚Äì3. It had captured the painter's imagination on his first visit there in 1817 and he had made studies of the place many times since then. Though the painter might first have been drawn to the spot on account of Byron's poem, what he made of it came from close personal acquaintance over the intervening years.Peter Aspden, Ehrenbreitstein: A Painting Outside Time, Sotheby‚Äôs The American Thomas Cole also went to Byron for the subject of one painting, though it was to Manfred in this case and is typically an imaginative reinterpretation.Yale University Art Gallery So too was his series of paintings The Course of Empire (1833-6), in reference to which he quoted the lines on the rise of cultures through civilisation to barbarism, from the Pilgrimage's Canto IV, stanza 108.Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser, Tim Barringer, Thomas Cole's Journey: Atlantic Crossings, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2018, p.51 In addition, his The Fountain of Egeria (painted at about the same time and now lost) was accompanied by lines from the same poem.Thomas Cole's Journey (2018), p.158 ==See also== * Don Juan (poem) * Romantic literature in English ==References== ==External links== * Childe Harold's Pilgrimage at Internet Archive (scanned books original editions illustrated) * * Category:1818 books Category:1818 poems Category:John Murray (publisher) books Category:Poetry by Lord Byron Category:Works about travel Category:Pilgrimage in fiction ","title":"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"},{"id":"1430042","text":"Al-Fatihah written in Naskh script Naskh (, from , , 'to copy') is a smaller, round script of Islamic calligraphy. Naskh is one of the first scripts of Islamic calligraphy to develop, commonly used in writing administrative documents and for transcribing books, including the Qur‚Äôan, because of its easy legibility. Naskh was standardized by Ibn Muqla as one of the six primary scripts of Islamic calligraphy in the 10th century CE. == Origin == Round scripts became the most popular in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, due to their use by scribes. Ibn Muqla is credited with standardizing the ‚ÄúSix Pens‚Äù of Islamic calligraphy, also including thuluth, tawqi‚Äô, ruq'ah, muhaqqaq and reyhan. These are known as ‚Äúthe proportioned scripts‚Äù (al-khatt al-mansub) or ‚Äúthe six scripts‚Äù (al-aqlam al-sitta). Kufic is commonly believed to predate Naskh, but historians have traced the two scripts as coexisting long before their codification by Ibn Muqla, as the two served different purposes. Kufic was used primarily in decoration, while Naskh served for everyday scribal use. == Description == Naskh is a sans-serif script, meaning characters lack ‚Äúhooks‚Äù on the ends of ascending and descending strokes. For example, the alif is written as a straight stroke, bending to the lower left. Naskh differentiates various sounds through the use of diacritical points, in the form of 1-3 dots above or below the letter, which makes the script more easily legible. Naskh uses a horizontal base line; in situations where one character starts within the tail of the preceding letter, the base line is broken and raised. In sixteenth-century Constantinople, ≈ûeyh Hamdullah (1429‚Äì1520) redesigned the structure of naskh, along with the other \\"Six Pens,\\" in order to make the script appear more precise and less heavy. == Use == Naskh was historically used heavily in the transcription of books and in administrative courtly documents. Naskh allowed for the development of decorative elements into more supple, rounded designs, away from the common use of squared kufic in decoration. Naskh's use in architecture first began in the tenth century and had been adopted in many Muslim countries by the eleventh century. More recently, fonts, such as the Bulaq Press-inspired Amiri typeface or Monotype Imaging's Bustani font, have created user-friendly digital manifestations of naskh for use in graphic design and digital typography. == See also == *Ruq øah (the cursive Arabic handwriting) *Nastaliq *Arabic, Urdu, other Arabic keyboard layouts *National Language Authority *Ta ølƒ´q script ==References== ==External links== Category:Arabic calligraphy Category:Islamic calligraphy Category:Pashto ","title":"Naskh (script)"},{"id":"1430043","text":"\\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\\" is a short story by Alan Sillitoe, published in 1959 as part of a short story collection of the same name. The work focuses on Smith, a poor Nottingham teenager from a dismal home in a working class area, who has bleak prospects in life and few interests beyond petty crime. The boy turns to long-distance running as a method of both emotional and physical escape from his situation. The story was adapted for a 1962 film of the same title. A new adaption of the story is in development. ==Plot== When he is caught by the police for robbing a bakery, Smith is sentenced to be confined in Ruxton Towers in Essex, a borstal (young offenders institution) for delinquent youths. He seeks solace in long-distance running, attracting the notice of the school's authorities for his physical prowess. Smith is offered a light workload for his last six months at Ruxton Towers if he wins in an important cross-country competition against a prestigious public school. For Ruxton Towers to win the cross-country race would be a major public relations boost for the borstal administrators. However, when the day of the race arrives Smith throws victory away: after speeding ahead of the other runners he deliberately stops a few metres short of the finishing line, though well ahead and easily able to win. He lets the other runners pass him and cross the finishing line, thereby losing the race in a defiant gesture aimed against his Ruxton Towers administrators. In deliberately losing the race, Smith demonstrates his free spirit and independence. The response of the borstal authorities to Smith's action is heavy-handed: Smith resigns himself to the drudgery of manual labour he is returned to. However, looking back on his actions, he has no regrets. == Literary analysis == ===The \\"runner\\" as a metaphor=== Long-distance running gives the character an ability to freely escape from society without the pressures of a team, which may be found in other athletic stories. Additionally, Sillitoe gave running a political perspective that changed the vision of a literary runner. Sillitoe's character Smith uses running as a way to mentally reflect, allowing Smith to give clarity to his political insights and share them with the reader. Through running, Smith begins to understand and become aware of the class divisions in Britain. During the period that Sillitoe wrote \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" the idea of the runner was changing dramatically. Helen Small states, \\"‚Ä¶the weight of literary attention seems to be focused on a 'pre- professional era'‚Äîeither written at that time or looking back at it for inspiration\\". === The 'angry young men' and Sillitoe === Alan Sillitoe is considered to be a member of the \\"angry young men\\" movement by critics and colleagues (though Sillitoe himself disliked the label). This term was associated with writers who created main characters that were \\"belligerent and opinionated\\", such as Smith. \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" suggests a revolution to combat class issues of the time. Smith says \\"in the end the governor is going to be doomed while blokes like me will take the pickings of his roasted bones and dance like maniacs around his Borstal's ruins\\". It is suggested that Sillitoe was never simply an \\"angry young man\\" but, through his deep hatred for the British class system, someone who would continue to be bitter despite youth. It was suggested at the time of the story's publication that Sillitoe created a character to express extreme views, but with the passage of time it has become clear that Sillitoe's and Smith's views were not very different. ==References in culture== ===Music=== *The British heavy metal group Iron Maiden adapted the short story into the song of the same name on their Somewhere in Time album. *British Oi! and punk band the Angelic Upstarts included a song of the same name on their Reason Why? album. *Scottish indie group Belle and Sebastian adapted the title for the song \\"Loneliness of a Middle Distance Runner,\\" a B-side on their 2001 single \\"Jonathan David\\" which also appears on the critically acclaimed compilation Push Barman to Open Old Wounds. *American band Ruxton Towers takes its name from the reformatory school in the film. *Grindcore band Agoraphobic Nosebleed parodied the title with \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Drug Runner\\" from their album Agorapocalypse. *Leeds anarchist pop band Chumbawamba samples audio from the film heavily in the song Alright Now on the unreleased album Jesus H.

It evokes working-class family life in Liverpool during the 1940s and early 1950s, paying particular attention to the role of popular music, Hollywood cinema, light entertainment and the public house within this tight-knit community. The film is made up of two separate films, shot two years apart, but with the same cast and crew. The first section, 'Distant Voices', chronicles the early life of a working-class Catholic family living under a domineering father. The second section, 'Still Lives', sees the children grown up and emerging into a brighter 1950s Britain, only a few years from rock and roll and The Beatles, yet somehow still a lifetime away. The film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. In 2007 the British Film Institute re-printed and distributed the film across some of Britain's most high-profile independent cinemas, prompting The Guardian newspaper to describe Distant Voices, Still Lives as \\"Britain's forgotten cinematic masterpiece\\". In a 2011 poll carried out by Time Out of the 100 greatest British films of all time, Distant Voices, Still Lives was ranked third. ==Location== In Paul Farley's British Film Institute Modern Classics book on Distant Voices, Still Lives, Terence Davies describes how they chose the location for filming: Kensington Street, Liverpool, L7 8XD This small street of Victorian terraced houses to the north of Kensington was the childhood home to Terence Davies and his family. The Victorian houses in Kensington Street were demolished in 1961 and replaced at a later date by a low-rise Council estate and two industrial units. However, houses very similar to those in Kensington Street remain to the south of Kensington in streets such as Albany Road, L7 8RG and Saxony Road, L7 8RU. 47 Whistler Street, London, N5 1NJ The central location for the filming of Distant Voices, Still Lives was chosen for its architectural similarity to Davies's childhood home in Kensington Street, Liverpool. 47 Whistler Street is a small terraced house in row of similar Victorian houses located in north London on the edge of Highbury Fields. The street can be accessed from the park via a small alleyway, or from Drayton Park, the main road behind the street. The houses on the west side of Whistler Street are bay-fronted and were chosen to depict the actual family home. The houses on the east side are flat-fronted and therefore rarely shown in the film sequences. However, a house on the eastern side of the street is used in the final scene where the group leave Tony's wedding celebration and walk into the darkness. The Futurist, Lime Street, Liverpool The Futurist was the location which inspired the film's (arguably) most artistic sequence in which the two sisters, Eileen and Maisie, attend a screening of Love is a Many Splendored Thing whilst unknown to them, their brother and Maisie's husband, George, have a serious accident. The Futurist was Liverpool's first purpose-built and longest-surviving cinema, opening in 1912. It was an ornate city centre cinema with a tiled Edwardian facade and 1,029 seats in the stalls and circle auditorium - the latter richly decorated with plasterwork in the French Renaissance style. The cinema lasted nearly 70 years and closed its doors for the final time in 1982, before being demolished in 2016. Jubilee Drive, Liverpool, L7 8SL This Victorian street in the Kensington Fields area of east Liverpool was the street where Monica (Micky) lived and begged Eileen to come and visit. \\"So don't be a stranger ‚Äì otherwise we'll not see you till next Preston Guild. We're only in Jubilee Drive.\\" Formby Sands Monica, Jingles and Eileen pitch their tent at Formby sands ‚Äì a scene which is used to remind Eileen of the free and happy life she lived before her marriage to Dave. Pwllheli Although more famous in later years for the Butlins holiday parks, in the 1940s this Welsh seaside town was an upmarket location with high-quality hotels. Teenagers from Liverpool and Manchester would work in these hotels in the summer season. In the film, Eileen, Monica and Jingles are seen working as waitresses in the breakfast hall of an (unnamed) large hotel. ==Autobiographical references== In his British Film Institute Modern Classics book, Paul Farley describes the inspiration that Terence Davies used for the biographical backbone of the film: > Davies was the youngest of ten children, the baby boomer, born into a > working-class Catholic household in post-war Liverpool. His father died when > he was six-and-a-half, though memories of him as a powerful, domineering, > violent man are vivid and, together with the love and support of his mother, > form a huge tension in Distant Voices, Still Lives Terence Davies's real-life father can be seen in a photograph which hangs on the wall in one of the film's central sequences when the mother and her three children, Tony, Eileen and Maisie, each walk out of the frame to reveal a tired and bleached photograph of their father. ==Songs== Music is the central core of Distant Voices, Still Lives and is a device which binds the characters and helps to give them a voice beyond their otherwise repressed lives. In Paul Farley's BFI book, Terence Davies describes the process in which music came alive in the shooting of the film. Many of the songs were sung by the cast, including Debi Jones's light rendition of \\"Buttons and Bows\\" and Angela Walsh's emotional rendition of Johnny Mercer's \\"I Wanna Be Around\\". The film also features a juxtaposition of Ella Fitzgerald singing \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" and a scene of brutal domestic violence. *\\"There's a Man Goin' Round Takin' Names\\" - Jessye Norman *\\"I Get the Blues When it Rains\\" - Marcy Klauber *\\"Oh, Mein Papa\\" - Eddie Calvert *\\"Roll out the Barrel\\" (Beer Barrel Polka) - Jarom√≠r Vejvoda *\\"A Hymn to the Virgin\\" - Benjamin Britten *Pastoral Symphony No.3 - Vaughan Williams *\\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\\" - Mantovani *\\"Up the Lazy River\\" - Hoagy Carmichael *\\"Galway Bay\\" - Tommy Riley *\\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" - Ella Fitzgerald *\\"Finger of Suspicion\\" - Dickie Valentine *\\"My Yiddishe Momma\\" - popularised by Anne Shelton *\\"Brown Skin Girl\\" - King Radio *\\"Back in the Old Routine\\" - Wilson Stone *\\"I Love the Ladies\\" (Traditional) *\\"Buttons and Bows\\" - Jay Livingston, Ray Evans *\\"If You Knew Suzie\\" - Joseph Meyer & Stephen W.

Also heard in instrumental form is \\"The Isle of Innisfree\\" by Dick Farrelly. ==Alcohol== Many of the film's most illuminating sequences were filmed in public houses. In one scene Tony orders a round of drinks from the bar and lists a number of drinks that would have been staple drinks in 1940s and 1950s Liverpool, but are barely heard of now. These include 'Mackies', 'Black and Tan', a 'Pale Ale and Lime' and a 'Rum and Pep' (Rum and Peppermint). ==Cast== *Pete Postlethwaite ‚Äì Father / Tommy Davies *Freda Dowie ‚Äì Mother *Lorraine Ashbourne ‚Äì Maisie Davies *Angela Walsh ‚Äì Eileen Davies *Dean Williams ‚Äì Tony Davies *Jean Boht ‚Äì Aunty Nell *Michael Starke ‚Äì Dave *Andrew Schofield ‚Äì Les *Debi Jones ‚Äì Micky *Chris Darwin ‚Äì Red *Vincent Maguire ‚Äì George *Pauline Quirke ‚Äì Doreen *Toni Mallen ‚Äì Rose ==Crew== *Editor ‚Äì William Diver *Cinematography ‚Äì William Diver & Patrick Duval *Camera Operator ‚Äì Harriet Cox ==Reception== The film won the Film of the Year awarded by the London Film Critics' Circle and the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

The film stars Peter Mullan as Joe Kavanagh, an unemployed recovering alcoholic in Glasgow, Scotland who meets and falls in love with a health visitor, played by Louise Goodall. David McKay plays his troubled friend Liam. The film's title is a reference to the ritualised greeting performed in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, as portrayed in the film's opening scene. The movie was mainly filmed in the council estates of Glasgow and filling small roles with local residents, many of whom had drug and criminal pasts. The film won awards in many film festivals, including Best Actor for Mullan at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink any more with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He then goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. Joe sees three men beating up Liam at a football match. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe goes to Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is selling her body, and soul, for monetary gains. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral. ==Cast== *Peter Mullan ‚Äì Joe Kavanagh *Louise Goodall ‚Äì Sarah Downie *David McKay ‚Äì Liam *Anne-Marie Kennedy ‚Äì Sabine (as Annemarie Kennedy) *David Hayman ‚Äì McGowan *Gary Lewis ‚Äì Shanks *Lorraine McIntosh ‚Äì Maggie *Scott Hannah ‚Äì Scott *David Peacock ‚Äì Hooligan *Gordon McMurray ‚Äì Scrag *James McHendry ‚Äì Perfume *Paul Clark ‚Äì Zulu *Stephen McCole ‚Äì Mojo *Simon Macallum ‚Äì Robbo ==ReferencesCategory:1998 films Category:1998 drama films Category:Artisan Entertainment films Category:British films Category:Films scored by George Fenton Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Films directed by Ken Loach Category:Films set in Glasgow Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Scottish films Category:British drama films ","title":"My Name Is Joe"},{"id":"1430106","text":"USB communications device class (or USB CDC class) is a composite Universal Serial Bus device class.

Nowadays a fourth type, the tramp or hobo clown, is often recognized separately, even though, technically, it should be considered as another character clown. Each of these types of clown may wear a makeup that is either neat (slightly exaggerated) or grotesque (wildly exaggerated). There is no single, absolute definition of what constitutes each clown type, with international performers encompassing an extremely wide range of styles, from the classical to the innovative. ===The whiteface clown=== The whiteface (or white clown) holds the highest status in the clown hierarchy and is the oldest of the clown archetypes. In modern times, when whitefaces perform with other clowns, they usually function as the straight man, \\"top banana\\" or the leader of the group. Whiteface clowns use \\"clown white\\" makeup to cover their entire face and neck, with none of the underlying flesh colour showing. Features are then usually painted on in either red or black. The whiteface clown is traditionally costumed more extravagantly than the other two clown types. They often wear the ruffled collar and pointed hat which typify the average person's idea of a \\"clown suit\\". Notable examples of whiteface clowns in circus history include Fran√ßois Fratellini and Felix Adler. Canio, the tenor protagonist of Ruggiero Leoncavallo's famous tragic opera Pagliacci, is usually garbed on stage as the whiteface variety of clown. In this particular instance, he is a representative of the stock fictional character of the clown (or jester) who laughs on the outside, but is secretly crying on the inside due to a grievance or a depressed state of mind. ===The auguste=== Accompanying the white clown there is often another clown variety known as an auguste or red clown; the auguste's role is different from that of the white clown. In strict classical European circuses of the past, the augustes were never described as clowns because, technically, they were not instigators but recipients of the comic doings. The augustes are the ones who get the pies in the face, are squirted with water, are knocked down on their backside, sit accidentally in wet paint, or have their trousers ripped off. The base colour for the auguste makeup is red or flesh tone. The eyes and the mouth are encircled in white and the features are highlighted, again, traditionally in red and black. The auguste is usually costumed in baggy plaids accented with colourful polka dots or loud stripes. They boast wide-collared shirts, long neckties, unruly coloured wigs and oversized noses and shoes. Notable examples of augustes in the circus history include Albert Fratellini, Lou Jacobs, Greg and Karen DeSanto, Coco the Clown, and Charlie Rivel. ===The character clown=== The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. On film, Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin would all fit the definition of a character clown. (Note: Nowadays, the hobo or tramp clown is often considered a separate class and is treated as such in competitions at clown conventions.) The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts. The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the tramp or hobo clown with a thick five-o'clock shadow and wearing shabby, crumpled garments. When working in a traditional trio situation, the character clown will play \\"contre-auguste\\" (a second, less wild auguste), siding with either the white or red clown. Sometimes they are more cunning and less dim than the auguste. Notable examples of character clowns in the circus include, Barry Lubin, Bill Irwin, David Shiner, Geoff Hoyle, Charlie Cairoli, Oleg Popov, and Bello Nock. Examples of the contre-auguste character in non-circus trios include Larry Fine of the Three Stooges and Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers. ==Gags== Circus advertisement depicting a clown act, 1900 The American circus term for a clown's act is \\"gag\\"; Europeans refer to it as an \\"entr√©e\\", and amateur clowns sometimes refer to it as a \\"skit\\" or \\"sketch\\". Gags are the clown's written and rehearsed performances. They can take place in the ring (a ring gag or production gag), on the track (a track gag or a walkaround) or in the seats. They can be done solo, with the ringmaster, with other clowns or with audience volunteers. They have a beginning, middle and end, finishing with a \\"blow-off\\". Gag may also refer to the specialized or gimmicked props clowns may use. Gags can use many different types of blow-off (ending), but some of the most popular are the confetti bucket, the long shirt, a trousers drop or the time-honoured \\"all clowns exit running\\" although contemporary indoor shows may end a clown gag with a simple blackout. ==Lingo== ; Basket animal: A costume made with a basket in the middle, looking as if the performer were riding a horse or other animal. Suspenders hold the costume around the performer's waist. ; Blow off: The visual \\"punchline\\" of a clown gag or joke ; Boss clown: The clown responsible for coordinating both the clowns and the various gags in a show ; Caring clown: Non circus term used to refer to clowns who specialize in hospital visits ; Carpet clown: A clown who works among the audience. ; Charivari: A raucous acrobatic clown routine, typically done by a large group of clowns, consisting of a series of fast-paced acrobatic maneuvers and comedy jumps off of a mini trampoline, over a vaulting horse and into a mat ; Circus Report: Name of a bi-weekly circus trade magazine ; Chase: a quick run around the hippodrome track, usually with one clown chasing another ; Clown alley: The clowns' dressing and prop area ; Come in: The period an hour before showtime when the public is entering the arena before the circus begins. Elephant and camel rides are offered for a fee during come in; butchers are selling their wares, and clowns are on the arena floor and in the seats. Some clowns specialized and only performed during come in. ; First of May: A term also used in the carnival, meaning a novice performer in his first season on a show. Shows used to leave winter quarters for their opening spot on the first of May, and there are always some new workers hired on the first of May who have never worked shows before ; Hippodrome track: The oval area between the rings and audience ; Joey: A mischievous whiteface clown (derived from Joseph Grimaldi, a famous pantomime clown in 18th-19th century England). Some sources say it only refers to an acrobatic clown, others say it is a non-circus term and was never used by professionals. The clown character used in Punch and Judy shows is traditionally called Joey. ; Knockabout act: Comedy act involving physical humor and exaggerated mock violence ; Producing clown: The clown who writes, directs and procures props and costumes for a gag ; Production gag: A large scale ring gag ; Shows: The overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of ring gags, track gags, walkarounds and chases. ; \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\": The band reserved this Sousa march as a signal that an emergency had come up calling for the clowns to come running out from the Alley directing public attention away from the emergency or for the audience to be evacuated. ; Suitcase gag: A visual pun that is carried inside of a suitcase and used during walkarounds. The set-up is written on the front and the suitcase is opened to reveal the punchline. ; Trouper: A person who has spent at least one full season with the circus, and whose response to the demands of life and work on the road are those of a seasoned veteran. Also used in vaudeville (and in theatre in general) to mean a veteran performer. ; Walkarounds: A clown feature in which they stroll the hippodrome track performing very brief visual gags that can be easily picked up, moved and performed again for another section of the audience ==Notable examples== ===Historical=== ====Joseph Grimaldi==== Joseph Grimaldi was one of the greatest English pantomime clowns. His father was Giuseppi Grimaldi (died 1788), an Italian dancing master and pantomimist. Joseph's stage debut was at 3 years old in a dance at Sadler's Wells, London's famous variety theatre. Grimaldi never performed in a circus ring, but spent most of his life performing in full-length pantomimes. He had the most to do with the development of the pantomime character of Clown. Grimaldi used a substantial amount of colour to his mouth, cheeks, and eyebrows over his painted white face. The most striking aspect of his make-up was the large red triangles. His image was followed closely for the next 50 years by most British clowns. Grimaldi was known as a master in the use of expressions of the body and face, unique sense of comic timing, imaginative byplay, and his overall comic abilities. He was famous and influential enough in his time to have had Charles Dickens write his biography. Today clowns are often called Joeys in honour of Joseph Grimaldi. (See above in \\"Circus clown lingo\\".) ====John Bill Ricketts==== John Bill Ricketts, an Englishman who brought the first modern circus to the United States, began his theatrical career with Hughes Royal Circus in London in the 1780s coming over from England in 1792 to establish his first circus in Philadelphia. He built a circus building in Philadelphia in the fall of 1792 in which he conducted a riding school. After training a group of Pennsylvania horses, he began on April 3, 1793, a series of exhibitions two and three times a week. His advertisements referred to the equestrian exhibition as Ricketts Circus. Probably because of his interest in horses, George Washington attended several performances of Ricketts's circus. Performances included not only equestrian exhibitions, but clowns and music and later rope walkers were added. ====Matthew Sully==== Matthew Sully, a prominent English Harlequin, tumbler and singer at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London, joined Ricketts' company in the summer of 1795. He became particularly well known for his hit song, \\"Four and Twenty Periwigs.\\" Later that fall, they were joined by the man recognized as the first \\"American-born\\" circus clown and professional dancer, John Durang. Much of what we know about Ricketts's enterprises we owe to Durang's detailed memoirs. The new clown was an accomplished actor and acrobat, and his variations on the classic comedy riding act \\"Tailor's Ride to Brentford\\" were extremely popular. ====Jean Baptiste Casmiere Breschard==== Jean Baptiste Casmiere Breschard, Circus of Pepin and Breschard, reintroduced the circus clown to America in 1807 after a number of years in which no circuses are documented as performing in the United States. ====Joe Pentland==== Joe Pentland was another popular early singing clown and one of the first to get top billing. He worked with Aron Turner's Circus, and then with Sands & Lent. He is one of those often credited with creating still another variation on the tailor's ride, called \\"The Drunken Sailor.\\" Posing as a drunken sailor, Pentland emerged from the stands offering to ride an ornery horse, and was greeted with various hoots and cheers. After several hilariously unsuccessful attempts, he stripped down to his leotards and rode with consummate skill. :A later version of the act was wonderfully described by Mark Twain in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and other variations on it survive today in several contemporary equestrian routines, particularly those of the Hanneford family. ====Tony Pastor==== Tony Pastor, often called the \\"Father of Vaudeville\\", also began his career in the circus as a singing clown and acrobat before he opened his variety theatre in New York in 1881. Finally, circus pioneer Dan Castello, W. C. Coup's first partner, was not only a courageous owner and frontiersman, but also a renowned singing and riding clown. ====Dan Rice==== However, the first American clown to achieve genuine star status was a jockey, gambler and strong man who used to catch cannonballs on the back of his neck. He was born as Daniel McClaren, but he is better known by his mother's maiden name of Rice. Born in New York City, Dan Rice gained 19th century fame with many talents, most of which involved him clowning in circuses. In addition to his 'clowning' talents, he was an animal trainer, songwriter, commentator, political humorist, strong man, actor, director, producer, dancer, and politician. He ran for Senate, Congress, and President of the United States - dropping out of each race. He changed the circus into what it is today by mixing animals, acrobats and clowns. His first break came in 1841 when he got a job of presenting a pig named Sybil who could do many tricks including the ability to tell time. From there he moved on to singing and dancing and got caught up in the popularity of the 'negro song', singing in blackface. He was said to sometimes go too far and make the song coarse. Gaining fame and popularity he changed styles once again he starred in various parodies of works by William Shakespeare, including that of \\"Dan Rice's Version of Othello\\" and \\"Dan Rice's Multifarious Account of Shakespeare's Hamlet\\" He would perform these with various songs and dialects showing just how versatile he was. Expanding his horizons he went into producing his own shows and often had more than one tour going on at the same time. He wanted to move on from his circus clowning and reinvented himself as a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi- talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was to be looked up to. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in Huckleberry Finn, and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show. His shows became more famous than any of the other shows touring at the time including that of rival, Phineas Taylor. During the 19th century, his name was synonymous with theater. At a time, Dan Rice was more of a household name than Abraham Lincoln. He reinvented the theater into a vaudevillian style before there was vaudeville. He was a very patriotic person later influencing the likes of George M. Cohan. He was also one of the main models for \\"Uncle Sam\\". With changes in circus and popular culture after the Civil War, his legendary talents under the big top have gradually slipped into almost total historical obscurity; biographer David Carlyon (2001) called him \\"the most famous man you've never heard of\\". While Dan Rice's talking and singing clown was taking America by storm, a new type of clown was emerging on the British pantomime stage, one that would have a more lasting influence on contemporary American circus clowning. ====George L. Fox==== George Lafayette Fox was America's first great whiteface clown. Known as the \\"American Grimaldi\\", Fox introduced Joseph Grimaldi's violent slapstick and topical satire to the American stage. He transformed it into a distinctly American style of humor reflecting the events of his day and influenced circus clown well into the 20th century. In 1867, he created his masterpiece, Humpty Dumpty, giving over 1,000 performances on Broadway. His character in this production was a distinctive American anti-hero and helped Humpty Dumpty become the most popular pantomime productions of the time. The slapstick form known as pantomime had been a Broadway staple since before the Civil War, but it reached a peak of popularity during the 1860s and 70's. These shows placed figures from Mother Goose stories in wildly varied settings, always finding an excuse to transform them into the clown characters of traditional commedia dell'arte (Harlequin, Columbina, etc.). Popular songs were loosely inserted whenever the audience needed a breather. Lavish sets and athletic clowning were expected, along with elaborate ballets. By far the most popular of these pantomimes was Fox's Humpty Dumpty. The plot had young Humpty and his playmates turn into harlequinade characters and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute passivity set him apart from the raucous clamor surrounding him, and audiences took the little man to their hearts. Humpty Dumpty was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's to take advantage of the show's appeal to children. He is considered by many to be the funniest man of his time. His white face character became an important part of popular American imagery, being used in advertisements and children's books long after his death. He is considered an influence on early film comedians including Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and the Marx Brothers. Sadly, he was removed from the stage during his last performance, and taken to an insane asylum where he died three years later, possibly as a result of poisoning from his lead-based white make-up. ====Frank \\"Slivers\\" Oakley ==== Frank Oakley, also known as Slivers (1871‚Äì1916) was the most popular circus clown of his generation. Born in Sweden, both of Oakley's parents were concert singers. At the age of 14 he began to practice as a contortionist and at 16 he joined his first circus. His parents convinced him to enroll at the University of Michigan but two years later Oakley was back under the big top. His first show was Andrew MacDonald's Circus, but in 1897 he joined the Ringling Bros. Circus. Before the turn of the century Oakley performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus, followed by three seasons with the Adam Forepaugh & Sells Bros. Circus (1900‚Äì02). Oakley returned to the Barnum & Bailey Circus for four seasons (1903‚Äì07), where he reportedly earned up to $1,000 a week. Slivers was famous for working solo in the ring. His featured gag was a one-man baseball game in which he played all the positions of both teams. Among his classic walkarounds was a gag in which he rode around the hippodrome track atop two giant lobsters. He went on to perform in other circuses, in vaudeville and was featured (sometimes partnered with Marceline Orbes) in the massive shows at the New York Hippodrome. He married vaudeville singer Nellie Dunbar in 1902 and they had one daughter, Ruth. With the coming of motion pictures and the superstardom of Charlie Chaplin Slivers was supplanted as an American comedy icon. When other offers had dried up he tried to return to Ringling where he was offered only $75.00 a week to perform walkarounds. He committed suicide, dying by gas asphyxiation, on March 8, 1916 in his room in New York City. Oakley had fallen for Viola Stoll, a young vaudeville actress, and remained infatuated even after she was arrested and incarcerated for stealing his late wife's jewelry. When he tried to have her paroled from Bedford Reformatory by proposing marriage, she rejected him. ===Other famous American circus clowns=== * George Carl - American clown who found great success in Europe.

The ships are named after months of the Republican Calendar. They use construction standards of commercial ships. The frigates were built between 1990 and 1993 by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique at Saint-Nazaire, France. The six French ships of the class, , , , , and , remain in active service. The ships' main armament was two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles and a CADAM turret, but in 2014, the Exocets were removed at the end of their life cycle. The vessels have a maximum speed of and can carry 24 marines. The vessels are used mainly to patrol the French overseas departments and regions in the Pacific and Caribbean regions, but have served in both military and humanitarian operations in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Guinea. Two more ships were ordered by the Royal Moroccan Navy in July 1999. Constructed by Chantiers de l'Atlantique in 2001‚Äì2002, they resemble the French vessels with minor changes. Their main armament are the two Exocet missiles and a Otobreda gun. The two frigates, and , entered service in 2002‚Äì2003 and are used primarily for training and patrol. ==Design and description== Germinal at Cherbourg The Flor√©al class evolved out of a need to produce a cheaper frigate for patrol in the low-threat environments of France's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. The hull and superstructure are made of welded steel with transverse bulkheads. Frigates of the Flor√©al class have a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigates measure long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . Due to the frigates' broad beams, they are equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigates are powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at The vessels are also equipped with one bow thruster. They also have twin rudders. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval- constructed vessels which sport two. The ships also have three diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. The Flor√©al-class frigates have a maximum speed of and a range of at . The class was initially only to be armed with the weaponry that would be required for the patrol mission, but this was later increased. The frigates were armed with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles in launchers situated centrally atop the midships superstructure. Each missile had a range of , carried a warhead and could reach speeds up to Mach 0.9. However, at the end of the missile's life cycle in 2014, the launchers were removed as the French Navy did not intend to replace the capability aboard the ships. The ships mount one 100 mm CADAM turret with the Najir fire control system located forwards. The gun can fire 78 rounds per minute, each round weighing up to a range of . The frigates are also equipped with two 20 mm mod√®le F2 guns situated in atop the aft superstructure which can fire 720 rounds per minute up to . The frigates are equipped with DRBV-21C (Mars) air sentry, Racal Decca RM1290 navigation and Racal Decca RM1290 landing radars along with ARBG-1A Sa√Øgon communications intercept, CSF ARBR 16A radar intercept electronic surveillance systems and two Dagaie decoy systems. Ships of the Flor√©al class mount a helicopter landing pad located on the stern and a hangar. The frigates are capable of operating the embarked Eurocopter AS565 Panther up to sea state 5, and are capable of operating helicopters up to the size of the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. The vessels have a complement of 90 including the aircrew and officers and 24 marines with capacity for a further 13 personnel. The ships are equipped with improved medical facilities including a consultation room and hospital beds for use during humanitarian missions. ==Construction== Vent√¥se The first two ships were ordered on 20 January 1989, the second pair on 9 January 1990 and the final two in January 1991. The ships are named after months of the Republican Calendar. The ships were built by Chantiers de l'Atlantique at Saint-Nazaire, France. They were built using civilian construction methods as a cost saving measure. The reduction in cost allowed the French Navy to build three for the price of one . This method was also used for the later La Fayette class. Following sea trials, the vessels were sent to Arsenal de Lorient at Lorient to have their weapons installed. ===Ships in class=== Flor√©al at Bora-Bora {class= -  colspan=\\"7\\" eee;\\" align=center French Navy - !

It was largely based on Jan Hus's Czech alphabet and was meant to serve as a unified orthography for three Croatian kingdoms within Austrian Empire at the time, namely Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia and their three dialect groups, Kajkavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian which historically utilized different spelling rules. A slightly modified version of it was later adopted as the formal Latin writing system for the unified Serbo-Croatian standard language per the Vienna Literary Agreement. It served as one of the official scripts in the unified South Slavic state of Yugoslavia.

It further influenced alphabets of Romani languages that are spoken in Southeast Europe, namely Vlax and Balkan Romani. ==Letters== The alphabet consists of thirty upper and lower case letters: {class= style=text-align:center - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" colspan=\\"30\\"  Majuscule forms (also called uppercase or capital letters) -  width=15A  width=15B  width=15C  width=15ƒå  width=15ƒÜ  width=15D  width=15D≈æ  width=15ƒê  width=15E  width=15F  width=15G  width=15H  width=15I  width=15J  width=15K  width=15L  width=15Lj  width=15M  width=15N  width=15Nj  width=15O  width=15P  width=15R  width=15S  width=15≈†  width=15T  width=15U  width=15V  width=15Z  width=15≈Ω - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" colspan=\\"30\\"  Minuscule forms (also called lowercase or small letters) - a b c ƒç ƒá d d≈æ ƒë e f g h i j k l lj m n nj o p r s ≈° t u v z ≈æ - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" colspan=\\"30\\"  IPA Value -    ()  ()    ()          ()          ()      () } ISO Basic Latin alphabet. Gaj's original alphabet contained the digraph , which Serbian linguist ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá later replaced with the letter . The letters do not have names, and consonants are normally pronounced as such when spelling is necessary (or followed by a short schwa, e.g. ). When clarity is needed, they are pronounced similar to the German alphabet: a, be, ce, ƒçe, ƒáe, de, d≈æe, ƒëe, e, ef, ge, ha, i, je, ka, el, elj, em, en, enj, o, pe, er, es, e≈°, te, u, ve, ze, ≈æe. These rules for pronunciation of individual letters are common as far as the 22 letters that match the ISO basic Latin alphabet are concerned. The use of others is mostly limited to the context of linguistics, while in mathematics, is commonly pronounced jot, as in German. The missing four letters are pronounced as follows: as ku or kju, as dublve, duplo v or duplo ve, as iks, as ipsilon. Letters , , and represent the sounds [ Ç], [ ê], [t Ç] and [d ê], but often are transcribed as / É/, / í/, /t É/ and /d í/. ==Digraphs== Note that the digraphs d≈æ, lj, and nj are considered to be single letters: * In dictionaries, njegov comes after novine, in a separate section after the end of the section; bolje comes after bolnica; nad≈æak (digraph ) comes after nad≈æivjeti (prefix nad-), and so forth. { align=\\"right\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 1em;\\" border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" -  M -  J -  E -  NJ -  A -  ƒå -  N -  I -  C -  A } *In vertical writing (such as on signs), , , are written horizontally, as a unit. For instance, if mjenjaƒçnica ('bureau de change') is written vertically, appears on the fourth line (but note and appear separately on the first and second lines, respectively, because contains two letters, not one). In crossword puzzles, , , each occupy a single square. *If words are written with a space between each letter (such as on signs), each digraphs is written as a unit. For instance: M J E NJ A ƒå N I C A. *If only the initial letter of a word is capitalized, only the first of the two component letters is capitalized: Njemaƒçka ('Germany'), not NJemaƒçka. In Unicode, the form is referred to as titlecase, as opposed to the uppercase form , representing one of the few cases in which titlecase and uppercase differ. Uppercase would be used if the entire word was capitalized: NJEMAƒåKA. ==Origins== Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj The Croatian Latin alphabet was mostly designed by Ljudevit Gaj, who modelled it after Czech (ƒç, ≈æ, ≈°) and Polish (ƒá), and invented , and , according to similar solutions in Hungarian (ly, ny and dzs, although d≈æ combinations exist also in Czech and Polish). In 1830 in Buda, he published the book Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskog pravopisanja (\\"Brief basics of the Croatian-Slavonic orthography\\"), which was the first common Croatian orthography book. It was not the first ever Croatian orthography work, as it was preceded by works of Rajmund ƒêamanjiƒá (1639), Ignjat ƒêurƒëeviƒá and Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá. Croats had previously used the Latin script, but some of the specific sounds were not uniformly represented. Versions of the Hungarian alphabet were most commonly used, but others were too, in an often confused, inconsistent fashion. Gaj followed the example of Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá and the Czech orthography, making one letter of the Latin script for each sound in the language. Following Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reform of Cyrillic in the early nineteenth century, in the 1830s Ljudevit Gaj did the same for latinica, using the Czech system and producing a one-to-one grapheme- phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system. ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá suggested in his Rjeƒçnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (\\"Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian language\\") published in 1880 that Gaj's digraphs , , and should be replaced by single letters : , , and respectively. The original Gaj alphabet was eventually revised, but only the digraph has been replaced with Daniƒçiƒá's , while , and have been kept. ==Computing== In the 1990s, there was a general confusion about the proper character encoding to use to write text in Latin Croatian on computers. *An attempt was made to apply the 7-bit \\"YUSCII\\", later \\"CROSCII\\", which included the five letters with diacritics at the expense of five non-letter characters ([, ], {, }, @), but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Because the ASCII character @ sorts before A, this led to jokes calling it ≈æabeceda (≈æaba=frog, abeceda=alphabet). *Other short-lived vendor-specific efforts were also undertaken. *The 8-bit ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2) standard was developed by ISO. *MS-DOS introduced 8-bit encoding CP852 for Central European languages, disregarding the ISO standard. *Microsoft Windows spread yet another 8-bit encoding called CP1250, which had a few letters mapped one-to-one with ISO 8859-2, but also had some mapped elsewhere. *Apple's Macintosh Central European encoding does not include the entire Gaj's Latin alphabet. Instead, a separate codepage, called MacCroatian encoding, is used. *EBCDIC also has a Latin-2 encoding. The preferred character encoding for Croatian today is either the ISO 8859-2, or the Unicode encoding UTF-8 (with two bytes or 16 bits necessary to use the letters with diacritics). However, , one can still find programs as well as databases that use CP1250, CP852 or even CROSCII. Digraphs , and in their upper case, title case and lower case forms have dedicated UNICODE code points as shown in the table below, However, these are included chiefly for backwards compatibility (with legacy encodings which kept a one-to-one correspondence with Cyrillic); modern texts use a sequence of characters. {class= !Sequence !UNICODE point !UNICODE glyph - D≈Ω  U+01C4 «Ñ - D≈æ U+01C5  «Ö - d≈æ U+01C6 «Ü - LJ  U+01C7 «á - Lj  U+01C8 «à - lj U+01C9 «â - NJ U+01CA «ä - Nj  U+01CB «ã - nj  U+01CC «å } ==Usage for Slovene== Since the early 1840s, Gaj's alphabet was increasingly used for the Slovene language. In the beginning, it was most commonly used by Slovene authors who treated Slovene as a variant of Serbo-Croatian (such as Stanko Vraz), but it was later accepted by a large spectrum of Slovene-writing authors. The breakthrough came in 1845, when the Slovene conservative leader Janez Bleiweis started using Gaj's script in his journal Kmetijske in rokodelske novice (\\"Agricultural and Artisan News\\"), which was read by a wide public in the countryside. By 1850, Gaj's alphabet (known as gajica in Slovene) became the only official Slovene alphabet, replacing three other writing systems which circulated in the Slovene Lands since the 1830s: the traditional bohoriƒçica (after Adam Bohoriƒç who codified it) and the two innovative proposals by the Peter Dajnko (the dajnƒçica) and Franc Serafin Metelko (the metelƒçica). The Slovene version of Gaj's alphabet differs from the Serbo-Croatian one in several ways: *The Slovene alphabet does not have the characters and ; the sounds they represent do not occur in Slovene. *In Slovene, the digraphs and are treated as two separate letters and represent separate sounds (the word polje is pronounced or in Slovene, as opposed to in Serbo-Croatian). *While the phoneme exists in modern Slovene and is written , it is used in only borrowed words and so and are considered separate letters, not a digraph. As in Serbo-Croatian, Slovene orthography does not make use of diacritics to mark accent in words in regular writing, but headwords in dictionaries are given with them to account for homographs. For instance, letter can be pronounced in four ways (, , and ), and letter in two ( and , though the difference is not phonemic). Also, it does not reflect consonant voicing assimilation: compare e.g. Slovene and Serbo-Croatian ('junkyard', 'waste'). ==Usage for Macedonian== Romanization of Macedonian is done according to Gaj's Latin alphabetLunt, H. (1952), Grammar of the Macedonian literary language, Skopje.Macedonian Latin alphabet, Pravopis na makedonskiot literaturen jazik, B. Vidoeski, T. Dimitrovski, K. Koneski, K. To≈°ev, R. Ugrinova Skalovska - Prosvetno delo Skopje, 1970, p.99 but is slightly modified. Gaj's ƒá and ƒë are not used at all, with ·∏± and «µ introduced instead. The rest of the letters of the alphabet are used to represent the equivalent Cyrillic letters. Also, Macedonian uses the letter dz, which is not part of the Serbo-Croatian phonemic inventory. However, the backs of record sleeves published in the former Yugoslavia, by non-Macedonian publishers, (such as Mizar's debut album) used ƒá and ƒë, like other places. ==See also== *Glagolitic alphabet *Montenegrin alphabet *Serbian Cyrillic alphabet *Slovene alphabet *Yugoslav braille *Yugoslav manual alphabet *Romanization of Serbian ‚Äì describes usage not the alphabet ==Sources== * * ==References== ==External links== *Omniglot Category:Latin alphabets Alphabet Alphabet Category:Serbo- Croatian language Category:Slovene alphabet Category:Writing systems introduced in the 19th century Category:Bosnian language Category:1835 introductions ","title":"Gaj's Latin alphabet"},{"id":"1430160","text":"Beat Retreat ceremony at Vijay Chowk in 2018. Beating Retreat is a military ceremony dating to 17th-century England and was first used to recall nearby patrolling units to their castle. ==History== Originally it was known as watch setting and was initiated at sunset by the firing of a single round from the evening gun. An order from the army of James II (England), otherwise James VII of Scotland dated to 18 June 1690 had his drums beating an order for his troops to retreat and a later order, from William III in 1694 read \\"The Drum Major and Drummers of the Regiment which gives a Captain of the Main Guard are to beat the Retreat through the large street, or as may be ordered. They are to be answered by all the Drummers of the guards, and by four Drummers of each Regiment in their respective Quarters\\". However, either or both orders may refer to the ceremonial tattoo. The Massed Bands of the Household Division perform in the fireworks finale at Beating Retreat 2013. For the first time ever in England, a foreign band was allowed to play at the Beating Retreat on 5 June 2008. This band was that of the first Battalion Royal Malay Regiment, who had been helping to guard London, by mounting guards at the palaces. Amongst their performance pieces were arrangements of a number of well known pieces from Film. The 2nd time this happened was during the June 2014 edition honouring the 70th year since D-Day, with two bands from the French Armed Forces and including the Royal Yeomanry and the Honourable Artillery Company. The 3rd time this occurred was in June 2015, when the BR that year honoured the bicentennial jubilee of the Battle of Waterloo, with the Staff Band of the Bundeswehr taking part. ==The Household Division Beating Retreat== These days, most armed forces in the Commonwealth perform some ceremonial form of the retreat and it is often used as a proving test for new band members as well as a practice for difficult drill moves such as the Spin Wheel. The ceremonies generally involve the marching of a band, the firing of cannon and other decorative presentations. In many cases a castle is used as a prop or a backdrop for the parade (as in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo). The London version takes place on Horse Guards Parade. Each year, on the Wednesday and Thursday evenings preceding Trooping the Colour, the Massed Bands, Pipes and Drums and Corps of Drums of the Household Division, supported by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and visiting military bands from other services around the world perform a sunset concert involving precision drill, horses, cannons and fireworks in time with the music. Historically, on at least one evening, a senior member of the British Royal Family has attended and taken the salute. The concert raises money for the Army Benevolent Fund the Household Division Charitable Funds, which provide improved welfare and opportunities to Household Division serving soldiers and veterans. * Note: Refer to See Also for list of Foot Guards Bands. ===The Massed Bands of Her Majesty's Royal Marines=== The Massed Bands of Her Majesty's Royal Marines, numbering some two hundred, perform their Beating Retreat ceremony every two years (formerly 3 years) at London's Horse Guards Parade in celebration of the birthday of their Captain General, Prince Harry (as of 2018). Because of its popularity, it is generally over three nights. The most recent events were in June 2012 in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, in June 2014 in honour of the RM's 350 years of service to the nation and also the first to feature a guard of honour company from 40 Commando Brigade and bands from the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps, and in June 2016, also marking the 90th birthday of HM the Queen and the first to be streamed live on Facebook. The latest event was slated for a May 2018 date, marking the 65th anniversary of the 1953 Coronation of HM the Queen and will be followed by another in 2022, marking the milestone 70th anniversary since the assumption to the throne of HM the Queen (due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 event was cancelled). The Royal Marines ceremony should not be confused with that of the Army which takes place every year, also in June. 4 to 5 bands belonging to the Royal Marines Band Service compose the Massed Bands for the ceremony. The ceremony's charity partner is the RNRMC. ===The Rifles === Sounding Retreat is the variant form of the ceremony done by the Band of The Rifles, and formerly of the bands of the Light Division. The reason is that bugles are used in the ceremony in sounding Sunset (known as Retreat in the Army), given the origins of the British light infantry branch. The Bands of the Rifles and the Brigade of Gurkhas, together with the buglers from the former and the Light Division Buglers Association, mounted on 31 May and 1 June 2016 the first-ever Sounding Retreat on Horse Guards Parade since 1993 and the creation of the Band of the Rifles (formerly Light Division) on the basis of the battalion bands of both The Light Infantry and the Royal Green Jackets, themselves descendants of the predecessor light infantry and rifle regimental bands of the British Army before the 1968 creation of the LD. ==Australia== The Australian Defence Force traditional ceremony of Beating Retreat was handed down from the British Army. The first ceremony including performance of Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture\\" was held at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1968. Although this inaugural performance was a relatively low-key affair, the ceremony has since become an annual event at RMC and is well supported by the service community and the general public. The modern ceremony is thought to have its origins in the 16th century and combines three customs. The first custom was originally performed by drummers only, marching on the ramparts to warn the soldiers that evening guard duties would soon commence. It also signalled soldiers outside the fortifications and labourers in the fields that the gates were about to be closed and they should retire within the walls for the night. The second custom was practised on battlefields in past times when the fighting ceased at sunset. Following the Beating Retreat, many of the old regiments would say a prayer or sing a hymn in honour of their fallen, and the evening guard would fire three musket volleys \\"to put flight to the evil spirits of the enemy dead\\". The final custom derives from the practice of lodging the Regimental Colour in the Colour Ensign's quarter when the evening guard was mounted. In modern times, that custom was replaced by the lowering of the national flag. ===2007 ceremony=== The 2007 ceremony was conducted on the nights of 27 & 28 September. It was attended by Chief of the Defence Force ACM Angus Houston and Chief of the Army LTGEN Peter Leahy. The ceremony included parade ground marching, changing of the sentries, trooping of the Regimental Colour, inspection of the guards, firing of the evening gun, guards advance and volley firing (with the service issue Steyr AUG), evening hymn, retreat and lowering of the Australian flag, the pipers lament and marching off of the Regimental Colour. Music was performed by an ensemble of the Royal Military College Band and the Australian Army Band Tasmania, and included \\"All That Jazz\\" from the musical Chicago, Michael Bubl√©'s \\"Spider-Man Theme\\", Christina Aguilera's \\"Candyman\\", the Celtic instrumental \\"Toss the Feathers\\" and instrumental versions of Phil Collins' \\"Against All Odds\\" and two Elvis Presley songs (in a \\"Tribute to the King\\"). The ceremony culminated with the \\"1812 Overture\\" accompanied by a battery of 105 mm Hamel light field guns, and a 5-minute fireworks display. ==Canada== Band of the Ceremonial Guard at Fortissimo Sunset Ceremony in 2012. The annual Fortissimo Sunset Ceremony in of the Canadian Forces is the Canadian equivalent to the beating retreat ceremony. It usually held on a July evening on the grounds of Parliament Hill in the capital of Ottawa and is organized by the Ceremonial Guard and its combined bands. The ceremony is unique in that it combines the Beating Retreat ceremonies with that of military tattoos and the lowering of the Canadian flag. This ceremony is also the main event at the festival. Like its name implies, the guard serves ceremonial public duties inside the Canadian capital. In previous years, foreign drill units have also taken part in the tattoo, including units such as the German Navy Silent Drill Team, the Bermuda Regiment Band, the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing Band. ==India== ===Background and history === Beating Retreat and Tattoo ceremony at Gateway of India. Beating retreat in India officially denotes the end of Republic Day festivities. It is conducted on the evening of 29 January, the third day after the Republic Day and is organized by Section D of the Ministry of Defence.https://mod.gov.in/dod/ceremonials It is performed by the bands of the three wings of the military, the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force, and pipe bands from the Army, plus from 2016 a massed formation of bands of the Central Armed Police Forces and the Delhi Police. The venue is Raisina Hills and an adjacent square, Vijay Chowk, flanked by the North and South blocks of the Central Secretariat and the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's Palace) towards the end of Rajpath. The ceremony was started in the early 1950s when Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were visiting India for the first time after independence. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru summoned Maj. G.A. Roberts, an officer in The Grenadiers, asking him to do something spectacularly creative and eventful for Elizabeth's visit. Roberts thus officially conceived of the Beating Retreat in honour of the visit, by developing the ceremony of display by the massed bands. Army, Air Force and Navy bands consisting of pipes, drums, buglers and trumpeters from various regiments took part. It has become an official ceremony to have a Head of State of a country as the chief guest and that year the Beating Retreat was in their honour. ===Order of ceremony=== Vijay Chowk (Victory Square) at Rajpath, with Secretariat Buildings in the background, New Delhi, the venue of the Beat Retreat ceremony. The chief guest of the function is the President of India who arrives escorted by the President's Bodyguard (PBG). When the President arrives, a fanfare is sounded by the trumpeters of the Brigade of the Guards on their fanfare trumpets, and then the PBG commander asks the unit to give the national salute, which is followed by the playing of the Indian national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, by the massed bands, and at the same time by the unfurling of the flag of India on the flagpole right at the Vijay Chowk. The ceremony starts by the massed bands of the three services marching in unison, playing popular marching tunes like Colonel Bogey March, Sons of the Brave and Qadam Qadam Badaye Ja. The fanfare by the buglers is then followed by the bands of the Indian Army marching forward in quick time, then breaking into slow time, then by the \\"compound march\\" involving movements to form intricate and beautiful patterns. The massed military bands, again, breaks into quick time and goes back to the farthest end of Raisina Hills. Then the pipes and drums of the Indian Army play traditional Scottish tunes and Indian tunes like Gurkha Brigade, Neer's Sagar Samraat and Chaandni. This band also does a compound march and formation numbers. The last bands to perform are the combined bands of the Navy and the Air Force. This part of the ceremony ends with their compound march. One such beating retreat ceremony by the Armed Forces bands was during the 1982 Asian Games closing ceremony in New Delhi, for which the credit went to the Indian Army's retired music director Harold Joseph, and the Indian Navy's Jerome Rodrigues and M.S. Neer, some of the greatest musicians, conductors, composers and instrumentalists of the Indian Armed Forces bands, who had led the massed bands at the ceremony. Aside from these, the 2016 retreat saw the first appearance of marching bands from Central Armed Police Forces and the Delhi Police, plus performances by the Army Symphony Orchestra and Traditional Ensemble, the latter using a mix of traditional European and Indian instruments. The use of certain Indian instruments which require the musician to sit down while playing are a departure from the concept of the ceremony being one that is usually executed by musicians while marching. The appearance of Police Forces was a recognition of their role being as vital as that of the Indian Armed Forces. All four band contingents march forward and take position close to the President's seat. The drummers, mostly from the Army's pipe bands, give a solo performance, known as the Drummer's Call. A regular feature of this pageant is the last tune played before the Retreat, when the national flag is lowered. It is the famous hymn written by Henry Francis Lyte, Abide With Me set to music by William Henry Monk and one of Mahatma Gandhi's personal favorite hymns, and has remained part of the ceremony over the years when many other foreign tunes were phased out to make way for Indian tunes, especially during the 2011 ceremony. The chimes made by the tubular bells, placed quite at a distance, creates a mesmerising ambiance. This is followed by the bugle call for sunset by the buglers, and all the flags are slowly brought down. The band master then marches to the President and requests permission to take the bands away, and informs that the closing ceremony is now complete. The bands march back playing a popular martial tune and the official march of the Armed Forces, Sare Jahan se Accha. As soon as the bands cross Raisina Hills a spectacular illumination display is set up on the North and South Blocks of the Parliament building. As the President's Bodyguard (PBG) horse-mounted troops arrive back in after the bands leave, the band stops as another band from the Army is stationed to play the national anthem again as the President receives the final salute for the day by the PBG, before the President and the PBG depart with the bands leading the way, dispersed on the Rajpath leading to the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Secretariat Buildings. In the past, this finale was also followed up by a short fireworks display. ==India/Pakistan== The Wagah border closing 'lowering of the flags' ceremony is a daily military practice that the security forces of India (Border Security Force) and Pakistan (Pakistan Rangers) have jointly followed since 1959. The ceremony has been filmed and broadcast by Michael Palin for one of his television around-the- world travel programs; he described it as a display of \\"carefully choreographed contempt.\\" ==Jordan== The Beating Retreat of the massed pipe and brass bands of the Royal Jordanian Army is held in the national capital of Amman. In attendance is usually the King and Queen of Jordan, as well as many other senior members of the House of Hashim, the Government, and the military establishment. The ceremony is held in connection with the celebrations of Independence Day, Army Day and the Great Arab Revolt (held in May, June and September respectively). The ceremony has taken place annually since the early 1950s, when it was introduced by King Hussein of Jordan. Organized by the Royal Guard, the tattoo features the Jordanian Armed Forces Band, the Al Hussein Musical Pipe Band, the armed forces drill team, and a camel mounted equestrian drill team. ==New Zealand== The New Zealand Defence Force traditionally displays a Beating Retreat ceremony every year around Anzac Day. Most ceremonies see musicians of the New Zealand Army Band, and troops of the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force on parade forming a guard of honour for the reviewing officer, usually the Governor-General of New Zealand or the Mayor of Wellington. ==United States== The \\"Ceremony of Beating Retreat\\" takes place annually at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and usually includes the USMMA Band and selected midshipmen. The ceremony takes place on a parent weekend, in order to give parents of midshipmen an opportunity to attend.https://www.usmma.edu/leadership/commandant/usmmas- regimental-band-performs-ceremony-beating-retreat-captain-force-0 Besides this, the United States Marine Corps Friday Evening Parade and Sunset Parade are the closest military equivalent to the Household Division Beating Retreat. Both parades are military tattoos that are performed by the troops of Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., who are personnel of the USMC, thus they are more modeled on the biannual Royal Marines ceremony. ==See also== * Republic Day of India * Republic Day Parade * Trooping the Colour * Changing the Guard * Gro√üer Zapfenstreich * Ceremony of the Flags List of Foot Guards Bands: * Coldstream Guards Band * Grenadier Guards Band * Irish Guards Band * Scots Guards Band * Welsh Guards Band ==References== * Abide With Me, Hymn, Massed Bands, Composed by W H Monk, at Beating Retreat, New Delhi, 29 January 2011 ==External links== * Household Division Ceremonial Events *Beating Retreat British Army *Royal Marines Beating Retreat * Australian War Memorial * About Beating Retreat including video Category:Military of Australia Category:British Army Category:Military of India Category:Military traditions Category:Household Division (United Kingdom) Category:16th-century establishments in England Category:Military history of England ","title":"Beating retreat"},{"id":"1430171","text":"The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters is a Finnish academy for natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.

She was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 1999, representing Oregon's 1st congressional district. She is a Democrat, and was the first naturalized American born in Africa to win election to the United States Congress.Institute for Tribal Government Biography from the Portland State University website ==Early years== Furse was born in Nairobi, Kenya Colony, to British parents, and grew up in South Africa. Inspired by her mother, she became an anti-apartheid activist in 1951, joining the first Black Sash demonstration in Cape Town, South Africa. She moved to England in 1956, before eventually moving to the United States, settling in Los Angeles, California. While in Los Angeles, she became involved in a women's self-help project in Watts, and with Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers movement, working to unionize grape farm workers. Moving to Seattle, Washington, in 1968, she became involved in American Indian/Native American rights causes including fishing and treaty rights. She became a United States citizen in 1972. Two years later, she graduated from Evergreen State College. In 1978, she finally settled in the Portland, Oregon, area, where she attended Northwestern School of Law. After two years of law school, she dropped out and led the efforts of several Oregon-based American Indian/Native American tribes to win federal recognition, successfully lobbying the U.S. Congress to grant federal recognition to the Coquille, Klamath and Grand Ronde tribes. In 1986, she co-founded the Portland-based Oregon Peace Institute, establishing a mission to develop and disseminate conflict resolution curriculum in Oregon schools. ==U.S. House of Representatives== She was elected to Congress in 1992, defeating State Treasurer Tony Meeker, in a year where the number of women in the House grew from 29 to 48.Battles for Women in the House, a June 1994 Seattle Post-Intelligencer article In 1994, Furse, called by one Northwest newspaper the \\"antithesis of Congress' traditional play-it-safe politicians\\", won reelection by 301 votes,\\"Rep. Furse won't seek reelection\\" from Northwest Labor Press defeating businessman Bill Witt during a year when the Republican Revolution produced a 54-seat gain for her opponent's party. In 1996, Furse and Congressman George Nethercutt (R-WA) co-founded the Congressional Diabetes Caucus and authored legislation which passed in 1997 to improve coverage of diabetes education and supplies in the Medicare program. The Congressional Diabetes Caucus has since grown to be the largest health- related Caucus in Congress. She also was a key player in getting funding to extend the TriMet Westside MAX Light Rail project from its originally planned terminus on the Beaverton/Hillsboro border to downtown Hillsboro, and TriMet named the plaza at Sunset Transit Center after her. Later in 1996 Furse won 52% of the vote in a rematch with Witt. She declined to seek reelection in 1998, explaining that the job is \\"public service and not a career.\\" ==Other activities== Furse and partner John C. Platt own Helvetia Vineyards and Winery in Helvetia, Oregon, where the couple planted grapes in 1982, and started their winery in 1992. As of 2007 the vineyard is home to both pinot noir and chardonnay grapes. Since retiring from Congress in 1999, she served as director of the Institute for Tribal Government at Portland State University. Her continued involvement in Native American affairs has also brought her some attention during U.S. Senate campaigns for her high-profile endorsements of Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR). In a 2006 interview, Furse said her support in 2002 was because they \\"had a lot in common on tribal issues\\" and cited Smith's repeated votes against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, votes that defied pressure from Smith's fellow Republicans including Senator Stephens [sic]; she believes \\"you support those people who have stood up for issues that you care about\\" and that Smith is a \\"very moral person [who] if he doesn‚Äôt agree with you, he‚Äôll tell you\\" something that Furse admires. Her continued support during the 2008 campaign included praise for Smith as \\"one of the first to stand up to George Bush and other Republicans to end this war\\". In 2014, Furse stood for election to the Washington County Board of Commissioners in District 4, but lost the race to incumbent Commissioner Bob Terry (46.57%‚Äì53.10%). She ran with the endorsements of Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici and Governors Barbara Roberts and Ted Kulongoski.

Work joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1814 and served in many capacities until his death in 1861, ultimately becoming a member of the company's Board of Management for its Western Department. He also served on Vancouver Island‚Äôs Legislative Council. At the time of his death, Work was the largest private land owner of Vancouver Island. Work left an important legacy in the form of sixteen journals which chronicle his trading expeditions from 1823 to 1851. His journals provide a detailed record of Pacific Northwest land features, native peoples, and the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚Äôs fur trading business in the early 19th century. ==Early life== John Work was born in Taughboyne parish, St Johnstown in County Donegal, Ireland, probably in 1792. He was the eldest of six children of Henry Wark. He anglicized his name to \\"Work\\" when he joined the Hudson's Bay Company. There is no record of his schooling, but in later life his poor writing was taken as a sign of a deficient education. Work joined the Hudson's Bay Company on 15 June 1814 at Stromness in the Orkney Islands. This began his lifelong association with that company.Sampson, William R., \\"John Work\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2000. \\"John Work\\" , Hudson's Bay Company Employee Biographical Sheet, Hudson's Bay Company Archives, Archives of Manitoba, Manitoba Government, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, July 1997. ==Career== Work began his company service in North America at two posts on Hudson Bay. He was first assigned as a steward at York Factory in 1814 and 1815. He was then moved to a junior trader position at Severn House, where he became district master in 1818. After the Hudson Bay Company merged with North West Company in 1821, Work was retained as a senior clerk and was put in charge of the Island Lake District, a position he held until 1823. In 1823, Work was reassigned to the Columbia District. He traveled west in a party led by Peter Skene Ogden. On this trip, Work began keeping a travel journal. It is a detailed record of his journey to the Columbia River via the Athabasca River and Athabasca Pass. His party reached a site known as Boat Encampment on the Columbia on 13 October, and proceeding down the river with the Hudson Bay Company trading brigade that had been sent to meet them. The party reached the Spokane River on the 21 October. At that point, Ogden and Work traveled overland to their winter quarters at Spokane House in what in now eastern Washington state. Fort Vancouver in 1845 During the 1824 trapping season, Work helped Finan McDonald extend the company's fur trade into the Flathead country of Montana. In the fall of 1824, Work accompanied Governor George Simpson and Chief Factor John McLoughlin down the Columbia River to the company's headquarters at Fort George (now Astoria, Oregon). In November 1824, Work joined an expedition led by Chief Trader James McMillan that explored the lower Fraser River looking for a site to establish a major trading post. On the return trip, his party discovered the Cowlitz Portage, which became an important route between the Columbia River and Puget Sound. In the spring of 1825, Work helped move the company's headquarters from Fort George to the newly established Fort Vancouver on the north bank of the Columbia facing the mouth of the Willamette River.Work, John, \\"John Work‚Äôs Journal Oct 18‚ÄîNov 17, 1824\\", Diaries, Narratives, and Letters of the Mountain Men, Library of Western Fur Trade Historical Source Documents, American Mountain Men Virtual Research Center Project, www.mtmen.org, 3 December 2010.Work, John, (edited by T.

Later that year, Work was put in charge of Spokane House. Work spent the 1825‚Äì26 trapping season trading furs in Montana where he reopened Flathead House. However, his most important job was to establish a new post on the Columbia near Kettle Falls to be named Fort Colvile. After completing Fort Colvile, Work closed Spokane House in April 1826. Work ran his trading operations from Fort Colvile until the summer of 1829, often making short trading expeditions into British Columbia or accompanying fur cargo to Fort Vancouver.Stevens, Jim, \\"Out of the Woods, John Work\\", Tri-County Tribune, Deer Park, Washington, 8 July 1955, p. 7. Indian camp at Fort Colvile painted by Paul KaneIn 1830 Work was promoted to the rank of Chief Trader, and John McLoughlin put Work in charge of the Snake country trading brigade which had previously been run by Peter Skene Ogden. During the next year, Work travelled over 2,000 miles across Oregon into what is now eastern Idaho, western Montana, northwestern Utah, and along the Humboldt River in Nevada. His expeditions were profitable, but Ogden had already explored and heavily trapped these areas. Because of this, Work recommended the annual Snake country expeditions be stopped. The next year, Work was sent into the Salmon River country of Idaho and Montana's Flathead country. The rugged terrain, hostile Blackfeet Indians, and competition from the American trappers made these expeditions difficult. Work was promoted Chief Trader at the end of the 1831 season.Work, John (edited by T. C.

In 1832, the Hudson's Bay Company sent Work to the Sacramento Valley in Mexican California. Trapping in the valley was very poor. Two previous Hudson's Bay Company trapping expedition led by Ogden and Alexander Roderick McLeod had already been through the valley 1829 and 1830. There was also another Hudson's Bay Company brigade led by Michel Laframboise and an American trapping party along with Work's brigade trapping in the same area during the 1832 season. Hostile Indians forced Work and Laframboise to join forces. Their party explored the coast from San Francisco to Cape Mendocino. Work returned to Fort Vancouver in October 1833. In 1834, Work was posted to Fort Simpson and put in charge of the company's trade along the British Columbia coast. He supervised the construction of the fort, which was being relocated from the Nass River to McLoughlin Bay. During a trading expedition in 1840, Work fell out of a tree, tearing open his abdomen and exposing his intestines. After pushing his intestines back into his body, he spent several days near death before continuing his journey.‚ÄúFriends: John Work‚Äù , The Pioneer Explorations of Scotch Boy John Tod, British Columbia Heritage Collections, Heritage Alley Internet Productions, Sterling, Virginia, 5 December 2010. In 1841, Governor Simpson decided to close all the coastal posts except Fort Simpson and Fort Stikine. His plan was to use the company's ship Beaver for most of the coastal trade. In 1842, John McLoughlin's son was in charge of Fort Stikine. Work felt he needed more help so he arranged for the junior clerk at Fort Stikine to be transferred to Fort Simpson. This left the young McLoughlin without any company support at his post. A few months later, McLoughlin was murdered and his powerful father blamed Work for transferring his son's only assistant away from Fort Stikine. In addition, it took over a year for Work to capture and send the three men involved in the murder south to Fort Vancouver. Work's relations with McLoughlin never recovered. Fortunately for Work, McLoughlin resigned from the company in 1846. A month later, Work was promoted to the rank of Chief Factor. Sarah Crease in 1860 In 1845, the Hudson's Bay Company decided to put the Columbia Department in the hands of three Chief Factors. In 1846, Work, Ogden, and James Douglas were selected to run of department. Work was placed in charge of the coastal trade including Forts Simpson, Fort Stikine, Fort Langley, and the Beaver. Work's new job required extensive travel up and down the coast. In 1849, Work decided to abandon Fort Stikine and establish Fort Rupert to exploit coal deposits on the northern part of Vancouver Island. When the miners went on strike in 1850, Work went by canoe from Fort Simpson to Fort Victoria to consult with Douglas. He then went by canoe to Fort Rupert and successfully persuaded the miners to go back to work. In 1849, Work settled his large family at Fort Victoria where his children could get an education. However, Fort Simpson remained his headquarters until 1851. In 1852, Work purchased 823 acres of farmland north of the Fort Victoria and built a fine home there. A year later, Governor James Douglas appointed Work to the Legislative Council of Vancouver Island. Work supported Douglas in the controversy surrounding the appointment of David Cameron as chief justice of Vancouver Island. He opposed the establishment of an assembly for the colony because there were \\"so few people to govern\\" and \\"nobody to pay taxes to cover expenses.\\" Work also continued his duties as Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, acting as a trustee for its Fur Trade Branch which purchased land for settlers who could not afford the required minimum 20-acre lots at ¬£1 per acre. For two month in 1861, Work was acting governor while Douglas was away on business. Work remained both a Chief Factor for the Hudson's Bay Company and a member of the Legislative Council until his death in December 1861. ==Family== In 1825, Governor Simpson suggested that Work marry the daughter of a Cayuse Indian chief, to secure good relations with the Native Americans living in along the Columbia River. Work did not follow the governor's advice. Instead, he married Josette Legace, a mixed-blood woman from the Spokane tribe in 1826. Work's wife accompanied him on many of his trading expeditions. In addition, she and their younger children lived with him at Fort Simpson from 1836 until 1849, while their older children attended school at Fort Vancouver and then at the Methodist mission school on the Willamette River near what is now Salem, Oregon. After finishing their schooling in 1841, the older girls joined the family at Fort Simpson. In 1849, Work moved his family to Fort Victoria so the younger children could get an education. Work settled his family on an 823-acre farm north of the fort and built a large home there, which he called Hillside. By 1859, he owned over 1,800 acres, making him the largest private landowner on Vancouver Island.\\"Founders of British Columbia\\", North Island Gazette, Port Hardy, British Columbia 20 April 1966, p. 10. Because of his remote assignments and constant travel, Work and his wife were unable to have a formal wedding until 1849. The couple was finally married in a church ceremony on 6 November 1849 at Fort Victoria. Work was the father of eleven children, three boys and eight girls. * Jane, born at Fort Colvile in 1827, married William Fraser Tolmie in 1850 * Sarah, born at Fort Colvile in 1829, married Roderick Finlayson in 1849 * Leticia, born in Idaho in 1831, married Edward Huggins in 1857 * Margaret, born at Fort Vancouver in 1836, married E.

Although his journals are written as matter- of-fact business correspondence, they provide a detailed record of the Oregon Country in the early 19th century. His journals have survived intact, making them among the oldest first-hand accounts of land features, native peoples, and the Hudson's Bay Company fur trading operations in the Pacific Northwest. As such, they are important historical records.\\"Known Journals of John Work\\", Diaries, Narratives, and Letters of the Mountain Men, Library of Western Fur Trade Historical Source Documents, American Mountain Men Virtual Research Center Project, www.mtmen.org, 3 December 2010. In addition, there are many geographical features in the Pacific Northwest named in honor of John Work. Mount Work, in the Gowlland Range flanking the east shore of Saanich Inlet and just northwest of Victoria, is named for him, Most of the range is in Mount Work Regional Park. Also named for him is Work Point at the west end of the peninsula, which now is a cruise ship terminal. Other locations named for him include Work Channel, on the northeast side of the Tsimpsean Peninsula, just northeast of Prince Rupert and near Fort Simpson, where he had served as Chief Factor; Work Bay in Finlayson Channel; and Work Island near Butedale. ==References== ==Further reading== * The Journal of John Work: A Chief-Trader of the Hudson's Bay Co.

The present Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist, built of local ironstone, dates largely from the early part of the 14th century. The north aisle has Decorated Gothic windows and an arcade of three bays. The chancel has windows dating from about 1300, the middle of the Decorated Gothic period. The chancel was restored in 1872 under the direction of the architect Albert Hartshorne. High on the east wall of the west tower is a small stone relief of a man under a hood mould. On the north wall of the north aisle is a 14th-century painting of Saint Christopher carrying Jesus. On the west wall of the north aisle is a monument to Sir Thomas Kirton (died 1601) and his wife Margaret (died 1597). The church is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a saddleback roof and three bells. Henry I Bagley of Chacombe cast the second bell in 1636. John Briant of Hertford cast the treble bell in 1790. Robert Taylor, who had foundries at Oxford and St Neots, cast the tenor bell in 1826. The parish is now part of the benefice of Culworth with Sulgrave and Thorpe Mandeville and Chipping Warden with Edgcote and Moreton Pinkney. ==Social and economic history== Thorpe Mandeville had a Church of England school that was built in 1864 and enlarged in 1898.Thorpe Mandeville: State school (sic.) It was closed in 1967 and the building has been the village hall since 1970. The Hill, about west of Thorpe Mandeville village, is a house designed by C.F.A. Voysey and built in 1897‚Äì98 for a member of the Hope Brooke family. In 1900 the Great Central Railway completed a line linking its new main line at Culworth Junction with the Great Western Railway at Banbury Junction. The link line passed through the northern part of Thorpe Mandeville parish. In 1911 the Great Central opened west of Thorpe Mandeville and in 1913 it added at Culworth north of Thorpe Mandeville. British Railways closed both halts in 1956 and closed the line between Culworth Junction and Banbury Junction in 1966. The planned High Speed 2 railway line will pass through the area. The House of Lords Select Committee on the bill to construct the line reported that the hamlet of Lower Thorpe would be virtually destroyed by the construction of a viaduct. The Three Conies ==Amenities== The village has a public house, the Three Conies, that is controlled by the Hook Norton Brewery. Thorpe Mandeville is on an important former drovers' road called Banbury Lane. The Three Conies was built in the 17th century as a drovers' inn, providing overnight accommodation for drovers and their livestock. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:Civil parishes in Northamptonshire Category:Villages in Northamptonshire Category:South Northamptonshire District ","title":"Thorpe Mandeville"},{"id":"1430215","text":"The Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical was an early and popular English arithmetic textbook, written by Thomas Dilworth and first published in England in 1743.

The mass media and education system were the keys to this process of national acculturation, speaking to people in a language that they came to regard as their 'Macedonian' mother tongue, even it was perfectly understood in Sofia. For more see: L. Benson, Yugoslavia: A Concise History, Edition 2, Springer, 2003, , p. 89.The origins of the official Macedonian national narrative are to be sought in the establishment in 1944 of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301. he was an ethnic Macedonian.The first name of the IMRO was \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\", which was later changed several times. Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô and ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô and wrote in Bulgarian standard language. For more see: Brunnbauer, Ulf (2004) Historiography, Myths and the Nation in the Republic of Macedonia. In: Brunnbauer, Ulf, (ed.) (Re)Writing History. Historiography in Southeast Europe after Socialism. Studies on South East Europe, vol. 4. LIT, M√ºnster, pp. 165-200 .The modern Macedonian historiographic equation of IMRO demands for autonomy with a separate and distinct national identity does not necessarily jibe with the historical record. A rather obvious problem is the very title of the organization, which included Thrace in addition to Macedonia. Thrace whose population was never claimed by modern Macedonian nationalism...There is, moreover, the not less complicated issue of what autonomy meant to the people who espoused it in their writings. According to Hristo Tatarchev, their demand for autonomy was motivated not by an attachment to Macedonian national identity but out of concern that an explicit agenda of unification with Bulgaria would provoke other small Balkan nations and the Great Powers to action. Macedonian autonomy, in other words, can be seen as a tactical diversion, or as ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù of Bulgarian unification. ƒ∞pek Yosmaoƒülu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878‚Äì1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, , pp. 15-16. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Dame Gruev together with other rebel leaders Dame Gruev was born in 1871 in the village of Smilevo, Monastir Vilayet, Ottoman Empire (present-day North Macedonia). He received his elementary education in Smilevo and continued his education in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. He was part of a group excluded from the school following a student revolt. In early 1888, the group, consisting of 19 people, including other future IMRO- revolutionaries was attracted by Serbian propaganda. As result they went to study in a Serbian Gymnazium in Belgrade at the expense of the Saint Sava society. Gruev later continued his education in the Grandes √©coles in Belgrade. Following yet another revolt, Gruev and his associates were excluded from the Great School and emigrated en bloc to Bulgaria. Gruev was enrolled in Sofia University and, later, in the Young Macedonian Literary Society. He found also the circle \\"Druzhba\\", whose aim was to implement \\"Article 23\\" of the Treaty of Berlin (1878) on authonomy of Macedonia. In 1891 Gruev was expelled from the University as he was suspected in the assassination of the Minister Hristo Belchev, but subsequently this allegation turned out to be groundless. Gruev and his Students from Bulgarian school in Shtip in 1894. Next, Gruev left the University and returned to Ottoman Macedonia region to apply himself to a new revolutionary organization. In order to carry out his plans more successfully, and possibly to avert the suspicion of the Turkish authorities, he decided to become a Bulgarian school teacher. The first two years after his return to Macedonia region he spent teaching, first in his native village of Smilevo, and later in the town of Prilep. Later, Gruev established himself in Thessaloniki and here laid the foundation of BMARC (the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees). With the cooperation of Hristo Tatarchev and Petar Pop Arsov among others, he came up with the Constitution and By-laws of IMARC. It was to be a secret organization under the guidance of a Central Committee, with local revolutionary committees throughout Macedonia and the region of Adrianople (Edirne). These regions were to be divided into revolutionary districts or rayons like in the April Uprising. In accordance with the Constitution, the first Central Revolutionary Committee was formed in the summer of 1894, under the chairmanship of Hristo Tatarchev. ===1894 to 1900=== Monument of Dame Gruev in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia (present-day North Macedonia) In the summer of 1894 in Negotino, he organized the first local revolutionary committee, and soon after with the cooperation of Pere Toshev, the first district committee in the city of ≈†tip. Gruev visited the cities of Resen, Ohrid, and Struga as well, and found the local population to be accepting his organization's revolutionary ideas very well. He remained a teacher in ≈†tip during the academic year 1894‚Äì1895. In the fall of 1895 Gotse Delchev arrived in ≈†tip with the idea of laying the foundations of a revolutionary movement seeking autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople Thrace. Gruev and Delchev met for the first time and shared their ideas there. Gruev introduced Delchev to the plan already outlined by the Central Committee of Thessaloniki. After this, both Gruev and Gotse Delchev worked together in ≈†tip and its environs. The expansion of the IMRO at the time was phenomenal, particularly after Gruev settled in Thessaloniki during the years 1895‚Äì1897, in the quality of a Bulgarian school inspector. Gruev had become the soul and body of the Central revolutionary committee. Under his direction, secret revolutionary papers were issued, ciphers were introduced, pseudonyms or a nom de plume were used, and channels for secret communication between various other local and Macedonian committees were maintained. A representative of the Central Revolutionary Committee was sent to Sofia to take charge of purchasing and dispatching of the necessary war provisions for IMARC. Gruev's tirelessly travelled throughout Macedonia and the Vilayet of Adrianople and systematically established and organized committees in villages and cities. Unfortunately, for purely political reasons, and in order to avoid suspicion from the Ottoman authorities, IMARC decided to dismiss Gruev in 1898. Soon after his dismissal Gruev moved to Bitola and there with the cooperation of Petar Poparsov, Vasil Paskov and others, he began to issue a revolutionary paper. He organized a system in which money was collected from Sunday schools through a special \\"revolutionary tax\\", and a quantity of war materials was purchased. Gruev was again appointed to the teaching staff now in the city of Bitola, and as such, he also assumed the management of the revolutionary movement in the Vilayet of Monastir (Bitola), while the active persons at the Committee in Thessaloniki were Hristo Tatarchev, Pere Toshev, and Hristo Matov. Gruev's activities in the Bitola district were not left unnoticed by the Ottoman authorities. Numerous chetas (bands) throughout the surrounding mountains began to terrorize the local authorities. Gruev, being suspected as a major factor in fostering this movement, was arrested on 6 August 1900. He was held in Bitola jail until May 1902. However, by using secret writings and ciphers, he was able to remain in contact with the local revolutionary committees, and direct the affairs of the revolutionary district of Bitola. ===Uprising=== Letter from the General Staff of the Monastir (Bitola) Revolutionary Region, signed from Dame Gruev to the Bulgarian Government, requestioning military intervention for the salvation of the local Bulgarians In the latter part of May, 1902, Gruev was condemned to banishment in the prison of Podrum Kale in Anatolia. There he found Hristo Matov and Hristo Tatarchev, both sentenced to exile in January 1901. Gruev and his comrades were kept in Podroum Kale for ten months. Although he was away from Macedonia and Thrace itself, Gruev managed to keep himself informed as to the development and affairs of the IMARO. He kept up a steady stream of encrypted correspondence with Thessaloniki, Bitola, and Sofia. On Easter of 1903, at the instance of a general amnesty, he was released. Gruev hastened to Thessaloniki and there he found that the Central Committee, which was in charge of the IMARO, had already resolved to declare a general insurrection which was to take place during 1903. Although Gruev was not in accord with the Central Committee's decision, primarily because of the SMARO's lack of preparedness, he gave in to the decision of the central Committee. He left Thessaloniki and went to Smilevo where the insurrectionary Congress was to be held. The purpose of this Congress was to set the date for the declaration of the general insurrection and to outline the methods and tactics in its prosecution. Here Gruev met Boris Sarafov, who had just arrived from Bulgaria. Gruev was elected as chairman of this Congress, and the latter decided that the day of the declaration of the insurrection was to be 2 August 1903. Gruev, Boris Sarafov, and Anastas Lozanchev were elected by the Congress as the three members of the General Staff, and empowered to direct the insurrectionary forces in the Bitola region. Gruev lived to see the retreat of the Turkish troops from his native village of Smilevo. He was engaged, during the course of the insurrection, in numerous skirmishes with the Ottoman Army. But with the arrival of Ottoman troops, any progress of the insurrection was made impossible and in a period of six weeks it was completely crushed. Gruev put himself to task of touring various revolutionary districts, disarming the insurgents, and storing up the war materials for future use. Gruev and his followers continued the work of organization and preparation for another uprising. ===After the Uprising=== Dame Gruev's dead body. In 1904 Dame Gruev chaired the Prilep Congress of the Bitola Revolutionary District of IMRO. In the autumn of that year, Dame was captured by the Serb's leader Micko Krstiƒá, but was set free, with the assistance of Gligor Sokoloviƒá, after his negotiations with Pere Toshev. In 1905 Gruev headed the first General Congress of the organization after the uprising, the so-called Rila Congress. Here Dame Gruev was elected as a member of the Central Committee and became in fact its leader, until his death. Indeed, Dame was the only one who appeared to be capable of mastering Yane Sandanski's ambition to leadership. However, the Rila Congress failed to erase the political differences in the organization. There arose a need to conduct a new special congress in Sofia in December 1906, which never took place. At the end of 1906, Gruev moved with his detachment from Ottoman Macedonia to Sofia to attend at the special Congress. On 23 December 1906, Dame Gruev and his detachment were discovered by the Turkish authorities near the village of Rusinovo (Male≈°evo district). Gruev and his band were confronted by Ottoman forces and in the following battle he was killed. == Legacy == Highschool in Sofiahttp://17su.bg/ as well as Gruev Cove in Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are named after Dame Gruev.

Fumarolic activity occurs at 1600m elevation on the NE flank of the volcano, and two areas of hot-spring travertine deposition are located at the NW base of the volcano near Volcano Creek. A wide and deep acidified summit crater lake at Chiginagak formed after November 2004 and before May 2005. In early May 2005, a catastrophic release of acidic water from the lake, with an accompanying acidic aerosol component, drained and flooded Indecision and Volcano Creeks with acidic water, traveled 27 km downstream and flowed into the Mother Goose Lake, headwaters of the King Salmon River. Extensive vegetation damage occurred along the flood route and Mother Goose Lake was acidified (pH of 2.9-3.1), killing all aquatic life and preventing the annual salmon run. The lake now drains from the summit through an outlet cave into Indecision Creek. Indecision Creek now usually has a strong sulphur odor, yellow color and a pH of 1.2.

Both fragrant and non-fragrant flowers and religiously-significant leaves are used to make garlands to worship Hindu deities. Some popular flowers include: *jasmine *champaka *lotus *lily *ashoka *nerium/oleander *chrysanthemum *rose *hibiscus *pinwheel flower *manoranjini, etc. House main door frame decorated with door frame garland (Nila Maalai) during a Housewarming party in Tamil Nadu Apart from these, leaves and grasses like arugampul, maruvakam, davanam, maachi, paneer leaves, lavancha are also used for making garlands. Also fruit, vegetables and sometimes even currency notes are used for garlands, given as thanksgiving. Wedding ceremonies in India include the bride and groom wearing a wedding garland. On other occasions, garlands are given as a sign of respect to an individual person or to a divine image. A gajra is a flower garland which women in India and Bangladesh wear in their hair during traditional festivals. It is commonly made with jasmine. It can be worn around a bun as well as in braids. Women usually wear these when they wear sarees. Sometimes, they are pinned in the hair with other flowers, such as roses. ====South India==== In ancient times, Tamil kings employed people to manufacture garlands daily for a particular deity. These garlands were not available for public consumption. In contemporary times, each Hindu temple in southern India has a nandavanam (flower garden) where flowers and trees for garlands are grown. Large Shiva temples like Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram, Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur and Arunachaleswara Temple, and those found in Thiruvannamalai still preserve such nandavanams for supplying flowers for daily rituals. Stone inscriptions of Rajaraja I at Thanjavur gives details of patronage bestowed by royals to the conservation of nadavanams that belonged to the \\"Big Temple\\". Marigold and nitya kalyani garlands are used only for corpses in burial rituals. At social functions, garlands are used to denote the host. At Srirangam Ranganathar temple, only garlands made by temple sattharars (brahmacaris employed for garland-making)are used to adorn the deity Ranganatha. Garland and flowers from outside the temple grounds are forbidden. Sattarars have several disciplinary rules for many aspects of their profession, some of which include: *Flowers should be picked in the early morning. *Flowers should not be smelled by anyone. *Flowers should be picked only after one has bathed. *The flowers which fallen from the plant and touched the ground should not be used. *Namajapam, or the repetition of holy names, should be done while picking flowers. While making garlands, the sattarars keep flowers and other materials on a table in order to keep them away from the feet, which are traditionally viewed as unclean and unfit for use in a religious context. Material is always kept above hip level. South Indian garlands are of different types. Some of them are as follows: * Thodutha maalai - garlands made from the fiber of the banana tree (vaazhainaar). Common in marriage ceremonies and devotional offerings. In all Hindu marriages the bride and bridegroom exchange garlands three times. These garlands range in length from 1 1/2 feet to 12 feet and have a thickness that varies from 2 inches to 3/4 feet in diameter. * Kortha maalai - made using needle and thread. Jasmine, mullai, and lotus garlands are made using this method. Malas for the gods have two free lower ends with kunjam (bunch of flowers), i.e. only the upper two ends are joined and the lower ends should not be not joined. They have two kunjams, whereas garlands for human use have both lower ends joined together (only one kunjam). Each Hindu deity has a unique garland: *Lalitha wears hibiscus *Vishnu wears tulasi leaves *Shiva wears bilva leaves *Subrahmanya wears jasmine *Lakshmi wears red lotus *Sarasvati wears white lotus *Durga wears nerium oleander *Vinayaka wears d≈´rvƒÅ grass The tradition of garlanding statues as a sign of respect extends to respected non-divine beings, including ancient King Perumbidugu Mutharaiyar II and the innovative colonial administrator Mark Cubbon. ===Nepal=== A reference to a garland is found in the Nepalese national anthem, Sayaun Thunga Phulka.

It uses a highly unusual technique to express the color of pixels, allowing many more colors to appear on screen than would otherwise be possible. HAM mode was commonly used to display digitized photographs or video frames, bitmap art and occasionally animation. At the time of the Amiga's launch in 1985, this near- photorealistic display was unprecedented for a home computer and it was widely used to demonstrate the Amiga's graphical capability. However, HAM has significant technical limitations which prevent it from being used as a general purpose display mode. ==Background== The original Amiga chipset uses a planar display with a 12-bit RGB color space that produces 4096 possible colors. The bitmap of the playfield was held in a section of main memory known as chip RAM, which was shared between the display system and the main CPU. The display system usually used an indexed color system with a color palette. The hardware contained 32 registers that could be set to any of the 4096 possible colors, and the image could access up to 32 values using 5 bits per pixel. The sixth available bit could be used by a display mode known as Extra Half-Brite which reduced the luminosity of that pixel by half, providing an easy way to produce shadowing effects. ==Hold-And-Modify mode== When the Amiga chipset was first being designed, it used an \\"HSV\\" (hue, saturation and luminance - or \\"video\\"/\\"value\\") color model, as was common for early home computers and games consoles for which television sets were used for display, as it maps more directly to the YUV colorspace used by common NTSC and PAL color TV encoding and thus demands less complex conversion electronics than for RGB. Color television, over an RF or composite video link, also uses a much reduced \\"chroma\\" bandwidth (albeit encoded as two separate difference signals, not hue + saturation) versus \\"luma\\". This offers a possibility for greatly reducing both the memory and data bandwidth needed for a given perceived fidelity of display, by storing the luminance in high resolution, but chrominance at a relatively lower resolution - a technique still commonly used by image compression techniques like JPEG and MPEG, as well as in other HSV/YUV based video modes such as the \\"YJK\\" of the V9958 MSX-Video chip (first used in the MSX2+). The variant of this method used in the original form of HAM allowed for prioritising the update of luminance information over hue and particularly saturation, switching between the three components as needed, as opposed to the more regular interleaving of full-resolution luma (Y) with individual half- or quarter-resolution chromas (U + V) as used by later digital video standards. The benefit to image encoding efficiency this produced was considered to be far more useful for HSV/YUV type color models than for the more straightforward RGB. As the Amiga design migrated from a games console to a more general purpose home computer, the video chipset was itself changed from HSV to the modern RGB color model, seemingly negating much of the benefit of HAM mode. Amiga project lead Jay Miner relates: The final form of Hold-And- Modify was, hardware-wise, functionally the same as the original HSV concept, but instead of operating on those three descriptive components (mostly prioritising the V component), it modifies one of the three RGB color channels. HAM can be considered a lossy compression technique, similar in operation and efficiency to JPEG minus the DCT stage; in HAM6 mode, an effective 4096-color (12-bit) playfield is encoded in half the memory that would normally be required - and HAM8 reduces this still further, to roughly 40%. There is a however a payoff for this simplistic compression: a greater overall color fidelity is achieved at the expense of horizontal artifacts, caused by the inability to set any single pixel to an arbitrary 12- (or 18, 24) bit value. At the extreme, it can take three pixels to change from one color to another, reducing the effective resolution at that point from a \\"320-pixel\\" to approximately \\"106-pixel\\" mode, and causing smears and shadows to spread along a scanline to the right of a high contrast feature if the 16 available palette registers prove insufficient. \\"Decompression\\" of the HAM encoded color space is achieved in realtime by the display hardware, as the graphics buffer data is being displayed. Each encoded pixel acts as either a normal index to the color palette registers, or as a command to directly alter the value held in the output DAC (somewhat like updating just one-third of the active palette register), and is immediately acted on as such as it passes through the chipset. ===Usage=== When the Amiga was launched in 1985, HAM mode offered a significant advantage over competing systems. HAM allows display of all 4096 colors simultaneously, though with the aforementioned limitations. This pseudo-photorealistic display was unprecedented for a home computer of the time and allowed display of digitized photographs and rendered 3D images. In comparison, the then IBM-PC standard EGA allowed 16 on-screen colors from a palette of 64. EGA's successor VGA released in 1987 with its flagship games mode, Mode 13h, allowed 256 on-screen colors from 262,144. HAM mode was frequently used to demonstrate the Amiga's ability in store displays and trade presentations, since competing hardware could not match the color depth. Due to the limitations described above HAM was mainly used for display of static images and developers largely avoided its use with games or applications requiring animation. With the introduction of the Advanced Graphics Architecture a conventional planar image could have a palette of 256 colors, offering significantly higher color fidelity. The original HAM mode with its limited color resolution became far less attractive to users of an AGA machine, though it was still included for backward compatibility. The new HAM8 mode was far less useful to the AGA chipset than the HAM mode was to the original chipset, since the more straightforward indexed 256-color (as well as higher performance, planar 128- and 64-color) modes greatly increased the options to the artist without suffering from the drawbacks of HAM. A well- programmed \\"sliced\\"-palette mode could prove to be more useful than HAM8, with up to 256 unique colors per line - enough to directly define a distinct color for each pixel if a 256-pixel-wide video mode was defined, and in higher resolutions even a single 256-color palette for the entire screen, let alone each line, allowed much more effective and accurate simulation of higher color depths using dithering than could be achieved with only 32. The original purpose of HAM, which was to allow more color resolution despite limited video buffer size and limited memory bandwidth, had become largely irrelevant thanks to the lifting of those limits. As more modern computers are inherently capable of high resolution truecolor displays without any special tricks, there is no longer any need for display techniques like HAM; as PC-style graphics cards offering modes such as 800x600 SVGA in hi-color (16 bpp, or 65536 directly-selectable colors) were already available for the Amiga in the dying days of the platform, it is unlikely that any further developments of the technique would have been bothered with had it survived to the present day. ===Limitations=== HAM mode places restrictions on the value of adjacent pixels on each horizontal line of the playfield. In order to render two arbitrary colors adjacently, it may take up to two intermediary pixels to change to the intended color (if the red, green and blue components must all be modified). In the worst case this reduces the horizontal chroma resolution from 320~360 pixels to as low as 106~120 (though, for comparison, contemporary technologies like VHS had chroma resolution as low as 40 \\"lines\\", roughly equivalent to 80 pixels, but smeared out much more smoothly). This problem is particularly noticeable at areas of sharp contrast (strong horizontal image gradients), where an undesirable multi-hued artifact or \\"fringe\\" may appear. Various rendering techniques were used to minimize the impact of \\"fringing\\" and HAM displays were often designed to incorporate subtle horizontal color gradients, avoiding vertical edges and contrasts. Displaying a full color image in HAM mode requires some careful preprocessing. Because HAM can only modify one of the RGB components at a time, rapid color transitions along a scan line may be best achieved by using one of the preset color registers for these transitions. To render an arbitrary image, a programmer may choose to first examine the original image for the most noticeable of these transitions and then assign those colors to one of the registers, a technique known as adaptive palettes. However, with only 16 available registers in the original HAM mode, some loss in color fidelity is common. Additionally, HAM mode does not easily permit arbitrary animation of the display. For example, if an arbitrary portion of the playfield is to be moved to another on-screen position, the Hold-and-Modify values may have to be recomputed on all source and target lines in order to display the image correctly (an operation not well-suited to animation). Specifically, if the left-most edge of the animated object contains any 'modify' pixels, or if the image immediately to the right of the object contains any 'modify' pixels, then those Hold-and-Modify values must be recomputed. An attempt to move an object around the screen (such as with the use of the blitter) will create noticeable fringing at the left and right borders of that image, unless the graphics are specially designed to avoid this. In order to avoid recomputing Hold-and-Modify values and circumvent fringing, the programmer would have to ensure the left-most pixel of every blitter object and the left-most pixel of every line of a scrolling playfield is a 'set' pixel. The palette would have to be designed so that it incorporates every such left-most pixel. Alternatively, a HAM display can be animated by generating pixel values through procedural generation, though this is generally useful for synthetic images only, for example, the 'rainbow' effects used in demos. Note, however, that Hold-and-Modify only applies to playfield pixels. 128 pixels of sprite data (in DMA mode) per scanline are still available for placement on top of the HAM playfield. ==Implementations== ===Original Chip Set HAM mode (HAM6)=== HAM6 mode, named for the 6 bits of data per pixel, was introduced with the Original Chip Set and was retained in the later Enhanced Chip Set and Advanced Graphics Architecture. HAM6 allows up to 4096 colors to be displayed simultaneously at resolutions from 320√ó200 to 360√ó576\\\\. HAM6 encoding uses six bits per pixel: two bits for control and four bits for data. If the two control bits are both set to zero, the four remaining bits are used to index one of the 16 preset color registers, operating in the fashion of a normal indexed bitmap. The other three possible control bit patterns indicate that the color of the previous pixel (to the left) on the scanline should be used and the data bits should instead be used to modify the value of the red, green or blue component. Consequently, there are four possibilities: *Set: Use the 4 bits of data to index a color from the 16 color palette. Use that color for this pixel. *Modify Red: Hold the green and blue color components of the previous pixel. Use the 4 bits of data as the new red color component of this pixel. *Modify Green: Hold the red and blue color components of the previous pixel. Use the 4 bits of data as the new green color component of this pixel. *Modify Blue: Hold the red and green color components of the previous pixel. Use the 4 bits of data as the new blue color component of this pixel. A similar mode, HAM5, is also available but it's rather useless. In HAM5 the sixth bit is always zero, so only the blue color component can be modified. ===Sliced HAM mode (SHAM)=== The Original Amiga Chipset included a support chip known as the \\"Copper\\" that handles interrupts and other timing and housekeeping duties independently of the CPU and the video system. Using the Copper, it is possible to modify chipset registers or interrupt the CPU at any display coordinate synchronously to the video output. This allows programmers to use Copperlist or CPU code for video effects with very low overhead. Using this technique, programmers developed the Sliced HAM or SHAM mode, also known as dynamic HAM. SHAM changes some or all color registers on selected scan lines to change the palette during display. This meant that every scan line can have its own set of 16 base colors. This removes some constraints caused by the limited palette, which can then be chosen per-line instead of per-image. The only downsides to this approach are that the Copperlist uses extra clock cycles of the chip RAM for the register changes, that the image is not bitmap-only, and the added complexity of setting up the SHAM mode. This technique is not limited to HAM, and was widely used with the machine's more conventional graphics modes as well. Dynamic HiRes uses a similar palette changing technique to produce 16 colors per line in the high resolution modes, whereas HAM is limited to low resolution but allows both 16 indexed colors as well as modifications of them. The SHAM idea was deprecated when HAM8 was introduced with the AGA chipset,Standards and specs: The Interchange File Format (IFF) (See HAM and Cheese) since even an unsliced HAM8 image has far more color resolution than a sliced HAM6 image. However, SHAM remains the best available HAM mode on those Amigas with the original or ECS chipsets. ===Advanced Graphics Architecture HAM mode (HAM8)=== With the release of the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) in 1992, the original HAM mode was renamed \\"HAM6\\", and a new \\"HAM8\\" mode was introduced (the numbered suffix represents the bitplanes used by the respective HAM mode). With AGA, instead of 4 bits per color component, the Amiga now had up to 8 bits per color component, resulting in 16,777,216 possible colors (24-bit color space). HAM8 operates in the same way as HAM6, using two \\"control\\" bits per pixel, but with six bits of data per pixel instead of four. The set operation selects from a palette of 64 colors instead of 16. The modify operation modifies the six most significant bits of either the red, green or blue color component - the two least significant bits of the color cannot be altered by this operation and remain as set by the most recent set operation. Compared to HAM6, HAM8 can display many more on-screen colors. The maximum number of on-screen colors using HAM8 was widely reported to be 262,144 colors (18-bit RGB color space). In fact, the maximum number of unique on-screen colors can be greater than 262,144, depending on the two least significant bits of each color component in the 64 color palette. In theory, all 16.7 million colors could be displayed with a large enough screen and an appropriate base palette, but in practice the limitations in achieving full precision mean that the two least significant bits are typically ignored. In general, the perceived HAM8 color depth is roughly equivalent to a high color display. The vertical display resolutions for HAM8 are the same as for HAM6. The horizontal resolution can be 320 (360 with overscan) as before, doubled to 640 (720 with overscan) or even quadrupled to 1280 pixels (1440 with overscan). The AGA chipset also introduced even higher resolutions for the traditional planar display modes. The total number of pixels in a HAM8 image cannot exceed 829,440 (1440√ó576) using PAL modes but can exceed 1,310,720 (1280√ó1024) using third-party display hardware (Indivision AGA flicker-fixer). Like the original HAM mode, a HAM8 screen cannot display any arbitrary color at any arbitrary position, since every pixel relies on either a limited palette or relies on up to two color components of the previous pixel. As with the original HAM mode, designers may also choose to 'slice' the display (see below) in order to circumvent some of these restrictions. A HAM7 mode is also available but not widely used. ===HAM emulation=== HAM is unique to the Amiga and its distinct chipsets. To allow direct rendering of legacy images encoded in HAM format software-based HAM emulators have been developed which do not require the original display hardware. Pre-4.0 versions of AmigaOS can use HAM mode in the presence of the native Amiga chipset. AmigaOS 4.0 and up, designed for radically different hardware, provides HAM emulation for use on modern chunky graphics hardware. Dedicated Amiga emulators running on non-native hardware are able to display HAM mode by emulation of the display hardware. However, since no other computer architecture used the HAM technique, viewing a HAM image on any other architecture requires programmatic interpretation of the image file. Faithful software-based decoding will produce identical results, setting aside variations in color fidelity between display setups. However, if the goal is merely to display a SHAM image on a non-Amiga platform, the required color values may be pre-calculated based on the palette entries that are programmed via the copper-list, regardless of whether the palette is modified in the middle of a scanline. It is always possible to up- convert a HAM or SHAM image losslessly to a 32-bit palette. ===Third-party HAM implementations=== A device produced by Black Belt known as HAM-E was able to produce images with HAM8 color depth at low horizontal resolution from an Amiga with an Original Chipset. The Amiga would be set up to produce high resolution images (640 pixels wide, 720 with overscan). This required the use of four bitplanes at 70 ns per pixel. The first few lines of the image encoded information to configure the HAM-E unit. Then each pair of pixels was encoded with information for the HAM-E unit, which converted the information into one 140 ns pixel (generating an image 320 pixels wide, or 360 with overscan, at a color depth of eight bitplanes). The quality of HAM-E was thus comparable to a low-resolution HAM8 image. The HAM-E technique exploited the fact that a high resolution image with four bitplanes delivers a third more memory bandwidth, and therefore a third more data, than a low resolution image with six bitplanes. ==See also== * Original Chip Set * Amiga Halfbrite mode * Sony ARW 2.0 (ARW 2.0+ raw image files use a similar technique for their lossy delta- compression) ==References== ==Further reading== * Specification for the Advanced Amiga (AA) Chip Set, Commodore-Amiga ==External links== * An animated demo rendered in HAM mode: HAM-6 version, and HAM-8 version (Java required).

Her infectious music and singing style have a universal appeal and her lyrics carry powerful and poignant messages. Her care-free way of performance included performing bare- foot. In the 1960s, she adopted the artistic name Vickie; only later did she become known by Busi Mhlongo. She was an initiated sangoma, which heavily influenced her music. In the 1970s, Mhlongo relocated to London, later recording with other South African artists who were living in exile, such as Dudu Pukwana, and Julian Bahula. By the 1980s, she performed internationally, performing with other well-renowned artists such as Salif Keita. By the early 1990s, she began releasing her own individual works, with her first album, Barbentu, being released in 1993. A year later, she joined Hugh Masekela's homecoming tour. In 1995, Busi joined Hugh in the Africa 95' in London. In 1998, she released her second album, Urban Zulu, which became a hit in various markets around the world and reportedly spent months in the Billboard World Music charts. She went on to release several more albums, Freedom (2003), and Amakholwa before her death from breast cancer in June 2010.Although physical- self isn't around, her energetic style of performance remains and can be seen through choreographer Somizi Mhlongo. Her music is a symbolism of the struggle for justice in South Africa. Her vocal range is incredible for she was able to go from a soft note to a booming roar. Due to her powerful activism against apartheid through music, Mhlongo was exiled therefore working and living in Netherlands, North America and the U.K. Busi sold half-a-dozen solo albums. Later during her career she became known s \\"Mam'Busi\\". During her youth, she joined the musical King Kong in Durban and was encouraged to play the drums. Her creativity launched her decision to create her band, Twasa. Her style of performance was inspired by Dorothy Masuka, Miriam Makeba but mostly Princess Magogo. _FAMILY_ Busi Mhlongo married drummer Early Mabuza. They later had a daughter. Due to Busi's exile she was unable to raise her daughter and attend her husbands funeral whose cause of death was murder. Busi was raised in a musically inclined family in the mountain village of Ohlange. _NOMINATIONS_ Busi was nominated for a grammy and won 3 South African Music Awards. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1947 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal category:Zulu people Category:South African musicians Category:South African female dancers Category:Deaths from cancer in South Africa ","title":"Busi Mhlongo"},{"id":"1430290","text":"Artinite is a hydrated magnesium carbonate mineral with formula: Mg2(CO3)(OH)2¬∑3H2O.

It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace postmodern, new classical and neo-eclectic styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for starchitect inspired uniqueness. Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional. ==Artist group== The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by Guy DenningSherwin, Brian. \\"Art Space Talk: Guy Denning\\", myartspace.com, 14 November 2006.

Although not a true mineral, it is often classified in the quartz mineral group. ==Formation== One common way in which lechatelierite forms naturally is by very high temperature melting of quartz sand during a lightning strike. The result is an irregular, branching, often foamy hollow tube of silica glass called a fulgurite.Lechatelierite on Mindat.org Not all fulgurites are lechatelierite; the original sand must be nearly pure silica. Lechatelierite also forms as the result of high pressure shock metamorphism during meteorite impact cratering and is a common component of a type of glassy ejecta called tektites. Most tektites are blobs of impure glassy material, but tektites from the Sahara Desert in Libya and Egypt, known as Libyan desert glass, are composed of almost pure silica that is almost pure lechatelierite.Libyan Desert Glass on Mindat High pressure experiments have shown that shock pressures of 85 GPa are needed to produce lechatelierite in quartz grains embedded in granite.C.

Leigh's third cinematic film, it was his most commercially successful title at the time of release. The, by turns, tragi-comic story follows the fortunes of a working-class North London family over a few weeks one summer. ==Plot== Andy (Jim Broadbent), a senior chef in a large London catering facility, buys a dilapidated fast-food van from a disreputable acquaintance named Patsy (Stephen Rea). He plans to clean, restore and put it into service on a local fast-food round. Wendy (Alison Steadman), his hard- working, good-natured and innuendo-prone wife, is sensibly sceptical about the project but understands her husband's ambitions. Their twin 22-year-old daughters (Natalie and Nicola) have profoundly different attitudes: tomboyish Natalie (Claire Skinner), thinks it is a good idea if it will make her father happy, whereas the bitter, shut-in Nicola (Jane Horrocks), contemptuously and typically dismisses Andy as a \\"Capitalist!\\" Late at night, an anguished Nicola binges on chocolate and snacks, then forces herself to vomit. Natalie, awake in the next room, overhears her. Aubrey (Timothy Spall), a hyperactive but emotionally labile family friend, is opening a Parisian-themed restaurant named The Regret Rien. Wendy accepts a part-time job as waitress in the restaurant, but her and Andy's initial confidence in the scheme is undermined by Aubrey's unorthodox approach to the interior d√©cor (a cluttered, half- realised combination of outmoded French clich√©s, such as a bicycle in the bay window, and of tasteless Victoriana, such as a stuffed cat's head framed by broken accordion sconces) and by his menu. His singularly grotesque interpretation of the excesses of nouvelle cuisine includes dishes such as saveloy on a bed of lychees, liver in lager and pork cyst. During the afternoon, whilst the rest of the family are out at work, Nicola's lover (unnamed, played by David Thewlis) comes to the family home to have sex with her. It appears that Nicola only can be aroused by a combination of light bondage and the consumption of chocolate spread from her chest ‚Äì a practice to which he only reluctantly agrees. He ultimately loses patience with her, accusing her of being \\"a bit vacant\\" and incapable of having a sincere, adult conversation or allowing herself to enjoy his companionship. She calls his bluff and loses: Frustrated but resolute, he leaves her and her fragile emotional state deteriorates further. The opening night of The Regret Rien is a disaster. Wendy volunteers her help when it becomes clear that Aubrey's waitress has let him down; she has gone to Prague with her boyfriend. Aubrey forgot to advertise the opening of the restaurant, with the result that no customers turn up. Aubrey gets hopelessly drunk, takes to the pavement and rails against the world, tells Wendy that he fancies her, starts taking his clothes off, and passes out, 'a quivering, sobbing gelatinous blob of disappointment.'Coveney, p. 221 Wendy is forced to deal not only with him but with his glum and passive sous-chef/dogsbody Paula (Moya Brady). Meanwhile, Andy and Patsy have gone to their local pub, where Andy gets uncharacteristically but emphatically drunk and ends up sleeping inside the decrepit fast-food van in his driveway. Wendy returns home from the disastrous opening night of Aubrey's restaurant to find him there: Unnerved by her bizarre evening, she loses her temper with the whole family. Phlegmatic and dry-humoured Natalie enjoys her unconventional work as a plumber, the simple pleasures of a pint and a game of pool, and dreams of visiting the U.S. In contrast, the fidgety and isolated Nicola becomes increasingly agitated, aggressive and reclusive, and Wendy finally confronts her. During the course of their long and anguished confrontation, Wendy makes it clear to Nicola that she is deeply worried about her, wondering why she makes no attempt to get involved with the causes she claims to believe. She tells Nicola of the struggle that she and Andy endured to care for their baby daughters ‚Äì how it meant she never went to college and Andy working in a \\"job he hates.\\" It emerges that during an earlier phase of Nicola's bulimia, she almost starved to death. Ashamed and angry, Nicola is convinced that Wendy and the rest of the family hate her. Instead, as the exasperated Wendy tells her \\"We don't hate you! We love you, you stupid girl!\\" and leaves the room, deeply upset. The brittle behavioural armour that Nicola has protected her psyche with is now shattered, and she breaks down sobbing. Meanwhile, Andy is seen running his kitchen at work with energy and authority but slips on a spoon, breaking his ankle. Wendy receives the news with a characteristic mixture of sympathy and amusement. She drives him home from the hospital; aided by Natalie she makes him comfortable, and then goes to see Nicola, still in her room. Mother and daughter reconcile. The film ends with Natalie and Nicola sitting peacefully in the evening sunshine in the back garden. Natalie observes that Nicola must own up to her parents about her bulimia. She then asks Nicola \\"D'you want some money?\\" and Nicola accepts gratefully, the first time in the film where she has accepted an offer of help. ==Cast== *Alison Steadman as Wendy. She works in a baby-clothing shop and teaches a dance class to young children. She is the emotional core of the family and talks continually, keeping up an amused running commentary on everything around her, but concerned about the welfare of her family, especially her troubled daughter Nicola. She loves her husband, but recognises that he lacks entrepreneurial spirit; she describes him as having \\"two speeds, slow and stop\\". *Jim Broadbent as Andy, Wendy's husband and a professional head cook in an industrial kitchen. Andy is presented as a loving but slightly ineffectual husband and father, fond of tinkering in his shed and buying broken things which he plans to get around to fixing at some unspecified future date. By contrast, the scenes depicting Andy at work show him as a highly competent executive chef. *Claire Skinner as Natalie, Andy and Wendy's daughter, a plumber who spends her leisure time playing pool and drinking with her male workmates. She never shows any interest in dating or romance, but reads travel brochures about the United States in her room at night. Natalie is described by her mother as \\"happy\\", but she is the only principal character in the film who never smiles. *Jane Horrocks as Nicola, Natalie's twin sister. Nicola refuses to work for ideological reasons, is extremely thin, smokes continually, eats her meals separately from the others and criticises the behaviour of everyone around her, largely on the grounds of a superficial kind of political correctness. Her favourite expression is \\"Bollocks!\\" It is revealed early on that Nicola is bulimic; she keeps a locked suitcase full of snacks and sweets under her bed, and late at night she binges on them and then makes herself vomit. *Timothy Spall as Aubrey, an old friend of the family. Aubrey is nervous, fidgety and has poor impulse control, often randomly destroying nearby objects; the other way he vents his tensions is by playing the drums very badly. He considers himself a culinary \\"genius\\", but his cooking is eccentric to the point of inedible, and he lacks many basic social skills; early in the film he visits Wendy on the pretext of giving her a pineapple which he suspects to be \\"on the turn\\", all the while pummelling it between his hands as if it were an American football. He appears to harbour unrequited lusts for both Wendy and Nicola. ==Production== The film was a co- production between British Screen Productions, Channel Four Films and Thin Man Films, a production company created by Mike Leigh and producer Simon Channing- Williams. This was the first release by Thin Man, who have produced all Leigh's films since Life Is Sweet.Raphael, p. 207 The script was developed by Leigh and the cast, employing his established practice of collectively improvising and rehearsing for several weeks prior to shooting. For example, Aubrey's bizarre recipes were devised by Leigh and Timothy Spall over the course of an evening, and then checked for plausibility with a professional chef, who advised them about which ones were technically impossible to prepare; all the ones that appear in the film are, as Leigh put it, \\"all feasible, gross as it sounds.\\"Raphael, p. 217 David Thewlis, who played Nicola's anonymous lover, was disappointed at being given such a small role. Leigh promised him that the next time he considered Thewlis for a role in a film, \\"he'd be given a fair slice of the pie.\\"Raphael, p. 211 Thewlis' next role in a Leigh film was his award-winning performance as the lead character Johnny in Naked. The film was shot entirely on location in Enfield, Middlesex, UK and used local people as extras including an Enfield-based dance school for the opening title sequence.Raphael, p. 209 Alison Chitty found the house in Enfield for Life is Sweet and fell in love with it because of its garden shed. She also found the old mobile snack-bar, which Rea's Patsy sells on to Broadbent's Andy as a pig in a poke, in Northampton, and painted it up.Michael Coveney, The World according to Mike Leigh p.216 Life is Sweet 's visual world is bright, jaunty, primary-coloured ‚Äì Leigh's next film Naked was conceived in blacks and blues and a 'dark, dilapidated grunginess', the contrast with this, its predecessor, very marked.Coveney, p. 218 ==Critical reception== The film received very favourable reviews, and on Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 92% from 13 reviews. The Guardian film reviewer awarded the film seven stars out of a possible ten. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times was full of praise, commenting that in spite of the constraints of independent film production, the film was \\"as funny, spontaneous and free as if it had been made on a lark by a millionaire\\". He added that \\"By the end of Life Is Sweet, we are treading close to the stuff of life itself ‚Äì to the way we all struggle and make do, compromise some of our dreams and insist on the others. Watching this movie made me realize how boring and thin many movies are; how they substitute plots for the fascinations of life.\\" Hal Hinson of the Washington Post called the film \\"sublime\\" and \\"gently brilliant\\". Desson Thompson of the same paper agreed, praising Leigh for discovering \\"the tragic beauty of the mundane\\". David Sexton in the Times Literary Supplement was critical, however, and wrote that \\"the film never transcends sitcom and remains static and anecdotal, its unit the scene, not the complete story.\\" Further, he wrote that the film is \\" the product of an unresolved attitude to its subject matter and in particular of an uneasy relation to questions of class.\\" Philip French in The Observer countered this idea: \\"Leigh has been called patronising. The charge is false. The No√´l Coward/David Lean film This Happy Breed, evoked by Leigh in several panning shots across suburban back gardens, is patronising. Coward and Lean pat their characters on the back...Leigh shakes them, hugs them, sometimes despairs over them, but never thinks that they are other than versions of ourselves.\\"Coveney, p. 222 ==Cultural references== Aubrey's restaurant The Regret Rien is named after the 1956 song \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" by Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire, made famous by French singer Edith Piaf. A framed black-and-white head shot of Piaf hanging on a wall is replaced by a stuffed cat's head when he shows Wendy and Andy his restaurant prior to its opening. In his first appearance in the movie, Aubrey wears a San Francisco Giants Starter jacket while visiting the family's home.Jones, J.R. \\"The bitter get better in Life Is Sweet,\\" READER (Chicago, IL), June 20, 2013. Retrieved December 16, 2019 Andy often speaks in comic voices, at one point uttering the out-of-context line \\"He's fallen in the water!\\". This was the catchphrase of Little Jim, a recurring character from the 1950s BBC radio comedy programme The Goon Show. Patsy is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur football club. According to Leigh this was a source of some discomfort to Stephen Rea who played the character because Rea is a supporter of the team's long-term rivals Arsenal.Raphael, p. 213 ==Awards and nominations== *Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, 1991: Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Jane Horrocks *Independent Spirit Awards, 1992: Best Foreign Film (nominated) *Bodil Awards, 1992: Best European Film *London Critics Circle Film Awards, 1992: British Film of the Year *National Society of Film Critics Awards, 1992 **Best Film **Best Actress ‚Äì Alison Steadman **Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Jane Horrocks ==Home media== Life Is Sweet initially was released on VHS format in the United Kingdom following its theatrical showing, with two subsequent re- releases in 1993 and 2000.

His wife went into the forest to collect fruits: she was, however, in danger of being attacked by hermits or yogis who lived in the forest. Although they had acquired special powers from their meditation, they had not conquered lust. Therefore, Indra created twelve of these special Nariphon trees. The trees would bear fruit whenever she went out to collect food and distract the men. The fruits were all in the image of Indra's beautiful wife. The men took the fruits to their place of abode and, after making love to them, would sleep for four months and lose their powers. According to Thai folklore, since Vessantara and his family have died, the trees bear fruit daily, but the forest will disappear when the Buddha's teachings have become lost (predicted to be five thousand years after his death). When the fruits appear on the trees, they last for seven days, after which they will wither and die if they are not picked.Nariphon book They have same internal organs as humans, but no bones.

Influenced by French jazz-violinist St√©phane Grappelli, Lea's first musical love was the violin which he began playing aged 10. His parents Frank Lea and Edna Whild owned The Grange pub in Bilbrook where he grew up. He attended Codsall Comprehensive School ‚Äì now Codsall Community High School. He joined the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra in 1961, and gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam, before moving on to piano, guitar and finally bass guitar. He first played guitar, and then bass, in the schoolboy group 'Nick and The Axemen'. === 'N' Betweens to Slade === Lea aged 16 went for auditions for a local band, 'The 'N Betweens', of which drummer Don Powell, guitarist Dave Hill and vocalist Johnny Howells were already members. He was accepted and left school immediately. When Noddy Holder joined soon after, the foundations for Slade had been laid. Howells later left the band. In December 1966, the 'N' Betweens signed to EMI and their first single \\"You Better Run\\" was produced by Kim Fowley. Chas Chandler, former member of the Animals and former manager/producer for Jimi Hendrix, spotted and signed them for Fontana Records in 1969, and their name was changed to Ambrose Slade. An album titled Beginnings was recorded. It was during 1969 that Lea wrote \\"How Does It Feel\\" at home, on an old out-of-tune piano with half of the keys not working. In 1970 Ambrose Slade adopted a skinhead image and changed their name to Slade. Following their first chart entry with \\"Get Down and Get With It\\" in 1970, Chandler encouraged the band to write their own material, and the song-writing partnership of Lea and Holder commenced. In most cases Lea wrote the melodies, and Holder concentrated on the lyrics. On the follow-up to \\"Get Down and Get With It, \\"Coz I Luv You,\\" Lea played violin. Lea had the most formal musical training in Slade. In 1979 Lea formed Cheapskate Records with his brother Frank and made records under the name of The Dummies. In 1981 Lea began record production and produced some of Slade's recordings. Following their first chart success in America, Slade were to tour the US with Ozzy Osbourne. Lea fell ill after only one gig with Osbourne, the band returned home, and the original line-up with Lea and Holder would never formally play live again. In a Q&A; session for his official website in March 2017, Lea commented: Over the last 6 months I've come to regret not going back to the States after I was ill in 1984. We did one gig with Ozzy and that was it. We should have gone back!!!!! The emergence of MTV would have made a huge difference. In a Q&A; session for his official website in March 2017, Lea disclosed his three favourite Slade songs were \\"How Does It Feel\\", \\"Far Far Away\\", and \\"Coz I Luv You\\". He also identified \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" from Old New Borrowed and Blue as an album track he would have liked to have seen released as a Slade single. === The Dummies === Slade's lack of success during the late 1970s led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed The Dummies as a side project, with his brother Frank. The group released three singles, \\"When The Lights Are Out\\", \\"Didn't You Use To Use To Be You\\" and \\"Maybe Tonite\\". All three singles received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems. \\"Didn't You Use To Use To Be You\\" was listed in BBC Radio One's 'A' playlist and was expected to become a top ten hit. Later in 1992, an album A Day in the Life of the Dummies was released, which gathered all the material recorded by the band. ===1980s=== In the 1980s Lea also produced all of Slade's recording sessions (except for some of the singles), and became an increasingly dominant creative force within the band. It was not uncommon for him to handle Holder's, some say Hill's, guitar parts on record. In 1982, Lea was also busy working on solo projects. Under the name China Dolls, he released the track \\"One Hit Wonder\\", backed by the B-side \\"Ain't Love Ain't Bad\\". \\"One Hit Wonder\\" was the same song as \\"Didn't You Use To Use To Be You\\", originally released in 1980 under the name \\"The Dummies\\", whilst the B-side was a cover of the Slade track \\"It Ain't Love But It Ain't Bad\\", from the 1977 album Whatever Happened To Slade. The same year, Lea released another single, \\"Poland\\", under the name Greenfields of Tong, with the B-side carrying an instrumental version. \\"Poland\\" was a reworking of the 1979 Slade track \\"Lemme Love into Ya\\". In late 1983, Lea's bandmate Noddy Holder joined him in record production. Together they produced Girlschool's cover of the T-Rex song \\"20th Century Boy\\" and the album Play Dirty which featured two Slade tracks \\"Burning in the Heat of Love\\" and \\"High and Dry\\". The \\"High and Dry\\" track was originally written for Girlschool but still appeared on Slade's album that same year. Lea also produced the Holder/Lea penned \\"Simple Love\\" for the actress and model Sue Scadding. Released by Speed records and with Lea's brother, Frank on drums, the single failed to achieve any commercial success. Initially the song was intended for Slade but no version by the band is known to exist. The B-side was another Holder and Lea composition, \\"Poland\\", which Lea released as a single himself the year before under the name Greenfields of Tong. In 1984 Lea also produced an album for singer / actor Gary Holton. Lea also played all the instruments (except drums, played by Geoff Seopardi) on two singles from the album; Holton's cover version of \\"Catch a Falling Star\\" and \\"That's How the Story Goes\\". Neither achieved any success. In 1985, Lea released his only solo single under his own name entitled \\"Citizen Kane\\". Written by both Holder and Lea, it featured Holder on backing vocals. In 1986, Lea produced and performed all the instruments except drums, played by Lea's brother, on two singles by Annabella Lwin. The first single was a cover of the Alice Cooper hit \\"School's Out\\" whilst the other single was a version of \\"Fever\\", written by Eddie Cooley and John Davenport and previously recorded by Little Willie John and Peggy Lee, among others. Both singles failed to have any impact. Lea also produced two covers by the rock band, The Redbeards From Texas; a Beatles' track, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and Slade's own 1972 hit Gudbuy T'Jane. Neither was successful and the band's lead vocalist Steve Whalley would later become the vocalist of Slade II. In 1988, Lea produced \\"Shooting Me Down\\" for the English hard rock band Chrome Molly. Written by Holder and Lea, the single failed to chart after receiving heavy airplay from BBC Radio 1 due to a dispute between I.R.S. and distributors MCA Records. The band were unable to capitalise on the single and they soon split. The band held their third official fan club convention at Drummonds Convention, King's Cross, London. === After Slade === Lea left Slade after Holder's departure from the band in 1992, being of the opinion that Slade was all four of them or nothing. He entered the property business in 1993 and went on to study psychotherapy in 1997 although he did not take it up as a career. In 1994, he released the single \\"Hello Goodbye\\" under the name Gang of Angels, and a reworking of \\"Coz I Luv You\\" twice; under the names \\"The X Specials\\" and \\"Jimbo feat Bull\\". In 1998, he began writing and recording new material, and would release the single \\"I'll Be John, You Be Yoko\\" in 2000, under the name Whild. In 2001, he was awarded the Gold Badge of Merit by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. Since Slade stopped touring in early 1984, Lea has performed live only twice; once for a local protest against a motorway development in his home area, and once again in 2002 for a charity event at the Robin 2 venue in Bilston, near Slade's old local pub, The Trumpet. Later the gig was made available as a download-only live album and as on a second disc of his album Therapy. In 2007, Lea released his first solo album, Therapy, which was made available on his website. It received positive reception upon its release and features Lea's own version of Slade's last single \\"Universe\\". In 2016, Wienerworld re-issued Therapy on CD and also released it on vinyl for the first time with bonus tracks. A new six-track extended play, Lost in Space, was released on 22 June 2018. ==Personal life== Lea has homes in Brewood, Staffordshire, and London, England, with his wife Louise. They married in 1973 after having first met as pupils at Codsall Comprehensive School. They have two children, Kristian and Bonnie. In 2014, Lea was diagnosed with - and treated for - prostate cancer, which he revealed publicly the following year. ==Musical equipment== ===Basses=== Lea started off with a Framus Star bass, similar to that used by Bill Wyman and later used a cherry Gibson EB-3 from the late sixties until it was stolen in the mid seventies. It is seen in Slade's (probably) first TV-performance in 1969. Lea got the bass in exchange for a Gibson EB-0 that he owned. The EB-3 was refinished in white when Lea had it in with John Birch to get some minor circuit and servicing work done to it. Lea said that he had only mentioned the refinish idea in passing, some time previously, then John Birch went ahead with it, without checking with him. After that bass was stolen in 1976 from the John Birch workshop, Lea's main bass was a very similarly-styled custom- made sunburst John Birch bass, given as a replacement. He also carried a John Birch J2 bass as a backup bass on some tours. Other notable basses that Lea owns include a Jaydee bass (which, uncommonly for a bass guitar, has a tremolo arm fitted), a pre-1981 Gibson Flying-V bass (which was used a lot in the studio in the seventies). Slade often used hired/borrowed instruments in mimed TV performances. Lea used a Fender Precision Bass, Fender Jazz bass and a Rickenbacker style bass, made by John Birch, as well as a Shaftesbury replica of a 4001 bass for TV and video shoots. ===Guitars=== In the early sixties Lea used a H√∂fner Colorama before turning to bass. He has also said that he used to compose a lot of songs on his wife's old Spanish guitar. ===Synthesisers=== Lea owned an ARP 2600 synthesiser. He sold it on eBay in 2003. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *1992 The Dummies ‚Äì A Day in the Life of the Dummies (Receiver Records RRLP 155 & RRCD 155) *2007 James Whild Lea ‚Äì Therapy (Jim Jam Records) *2007 Jim Lea ‚Äì Replugged/Official Bootleg of Jim Jam Live at the Robin 2 16 November 2002+ *2016 Jim Lea - Therapy (reissue - 2 CDs including three new tracks and Live from the Robin 2 CD) (Wienerworld WNRCD5098) ===Singles=== *1979 The Dummies ‚Äì \\"When The Lights Are Out\\" / \\"She's The Only Woman\\" (Cheapskate Records FWL 001) *1980 The Dummies ‚Äì \\"When The Lights Are Out\\" / \\"She's The Only Woman\\" (Pye Records 7P 163) *1980 The Dummies ‚Äì \\"Didn't You Use To Use To Be You\\" / \\"Miles Out To Sea\\" (Cheapskate Records CHEAP 003) *1981 The Dummies ‚Äì \\"Maybe Tonite\\" / \\"When I'm Dancin' I Ain't Fightin'\\" (Cheapskate Records CHEAP 014) *1982 The China Dolls ‚Äì \\"One Hit Wonder\\" / \\"Ain't Love Ain't Bad\\" (Speed Records FIRED 1) *1982 Greenfields of Tong ‚Äì \\"Poland\\" / \\"Poland\\" (Instrumental) (Speed Records FIRED 2) *1985 Jimmy Lea ‚Äì \\"Citizen Kane\\" / \\"Poland\\" (Instrumental) (Trojan Records KANE 001) *1990 The Clout ‚Äì \\"We'll Bring The House Down\\" / \\"JimJam\\" (Instrumental) (Mooncrest Records JWL 1000) *1994 Gang of Angels ‚Äì \\"Hello Goodbye\\" / \\"JimJam\\" (Instrumental) (Shotgun Records CDBOR 012) *1994 Jimbo featuring Bull ‚Äì \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Radio Edit) / \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Bull Mix) / \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Cowboy Mix) (Trojan Records CDTRO 9106) *1994 The X Specials ‚Äì \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Radio Edit) / \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Violin Mix) / \\"Coz I Luv You\\" (Ragga Mix) (Receiver Records RRSCD 1010) *2000 Whild ‚Äì \\"I'll Be John, You'll Be Yoko\\" / \\"Mega Drive\\" / \\"I Go Wild\\" (Jet Records JETSCD 501Z) *2016 Jim Lea - \\"Am I The Greatest Now?\\" (Wienerworld - download only) *2017 Jim Lea - \\"All Coming Back to Me Now\\" (Wienerworld - download only, CD promos exist - WNRDCS1001) *2017 Jim Lea - \\"The Smile of Elvis\\" (Wienerworld - re-worked version of the song - CD promo only WNRCDS1002) *2018 Jim Lea - \\"Lost in Space\\" (Wienerworld - download only, CD promos exist WNRCDS1003) ===EP=== *2018 Jim Lea - Lost In Space EP: \\"Lost in space\\" / \\"What in the world\\" / \\"Megadrive\\" / \\"Pure power\\" / \\"Going back to Birmingham\\" / \\"Through the fire\\" (Wienerworld CD EP: WNRCD5103) *2019 On 26 May 2019 Jim announced that he has been in the studio and a new single will be released in the Autumn, with an album to follow in early 2020. ==Videography== *2017 Jim Lea - For One Night Only: Live at the Robin 2 (Wienerworld DVD) *2018 Jim Lea - An Audience with Jim Lea at the Robin 2 (in aid of Dementia UK, DVD) ==References== ==External links== * Official Jim Lea site * Jim Lea YouTube channel * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:English rock bass guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:English rock guitarists Category:English songwriters Category:English violinists Category:British male violinists Category:Musicians from the West Midlands (county) Category:Slade members Category:21st-century violinists Category:21st-century British male musicians ","title":"Jim Lea (musician)"},{"id":"1430392","text":"Cha Cha Cohen was a band formed in 1994 by three members of The Wedding Present -- Keith Gregory, Paul Dorrington and Simon Smith.

The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the titular bride. Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died in a car crash during production. The film was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which also starred Bonham Carter. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). ==Plot== The whole story takes place in ambiguous circumstances, apparently in a small European village in the late 1800's, roughly 1880-1890. Victor Van Dort, the son of wealthy fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected daughter of impoverished aristocrats, prepare for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's family. Although both fall in love with each other, Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and acting clumsily, accidentally setting Mrs. Everglot's dress afire. Fleeing to a nearby forest in embarrassment, he practices his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on a root. However, the root is revealed to be the finger of a dead woman named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife, and spirits him away to the Land of the Dead. During his time with her, Victor learns that Emily was pitilessly murdered years ago by an unnamed perpetrator on the night she secretly eloped with him, bringing with her some family belongings, which he stole. Desperate to reunite with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to the see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage to the Land of the Living. Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest before he reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead, feeling betrayed and hurt. Victoria quickly tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but neither believe her and assume he has left her. Against her will, they decide to marry her to a presumed-wealthy visitor named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal. After reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows in the Land of the Living and drink a deadly poison in order to join her in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head up to the Land of Living, where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until everyone recognizes their loved ones among the dead, and they have a joyous reunion. In the chaos caused by their arrival, a panicked Barkis exposes his intentions to marry Victoria for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him. Victoria arrives at Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria a chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily tries to rekindle Victor and Victoria's relationship, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria, causing Emily to recognize him as her previous fianc√© and murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to rescue Victoria, whereupon Emily intercedes to save Victor's life. Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison that Victor nearly took, causing him to die, which allows the dead ‚Äì who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living ‚Äì to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now released from her torment, frees Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring to him, allowing him to marry Victoria. As she exits the church, she throws her wedding bouquet to Victoria, and then proceeds to fade away into hundreds of butterflies in the moonlight as Victor and Victoria watch on in each other's embrace. ==Voice cast== Helena Bonham Carter voices the title character. * Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort, a shy and gawky young man who is engaged to Victoria Everglot for social and financial reasons. * Helena Bonham Carter as Emily the Corpse Bride, a beautiful and charismatic young zombie woman with a passion for music and dance. * Emily Watson as Victoria Everglot, Victor's pretty, sweet-natured, yet timid and soft-spoken fianc√©e. * Tracey Ullman as two characters: ** Nell Van Dort, Victor's socially ambitious mother who holds contempt for her son ** Hildegarde, the elderly, hunchbacked maid of the Everglot household * Paul Whitehouse as three characters: ** William Van Dort, Victor's absent-minded and tactless father ** Mayhew, the Van Dorts' coachman ** Paul the Head Waiter, literally a severed head. * Joanna Lumley as Maudeline Everglot, Victoria's snide, cruel mother. * Albert Finney as two characters **Finis Everglot, Victoria's cynical, grim, toad-like, and cruel father. **Grandfather Everglot, Finis' deceased grandfather * Richard E.

The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: \\"In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage as close as possible to how I thought he wanted it.\\" ===Filming=== Tim Burton co-directed the film. The film was originally supposed to have been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: \\"One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect‚Äîthe same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics.\\" Animation took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London. A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when production began, but that number had tripled by the end of production. The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics. The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary characters‚ÄîVictor, Victoria and Corpse Bride‚Äîwere fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a \\"grabber\\" system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short \\"reel\\" of the shot being produced to check their work. The film's images were stored on a 1GB image card that was capable of holding approximately 100 frames of animation. Eight roving camera teams‚Äîeach team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues‚Äîworked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a \\"lighting station\\" workstation‚Äîcomprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing‚Äîto view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and \\"grabber\\" computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: \\"We shot as close to a 1:1 film ratio [one take per shot] as we could because there was no time for reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process‚Äîas many ways as needed‚Äîto get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film.\\" Co-director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators, sometimes acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a \\"dope sheet\\"‚Äîin which a shot was broken down, frame by frame‚Äîto account for key \\"hits\\". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on \\"2s\\" or \\"4s\\" (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: \\"The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot.\\" The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of \\"data wranglers.\\" Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a \\"color cube.\\" Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: \\"The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock‚Äîin this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it.\\" The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed. ===Visual effects=== Johnny Depp filmed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and recorded dialogue for Corpse Bride simultaneously. Visual effects were delivered by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and were applied to the 1,000 or so shots in the film, though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements‚Äîgroups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: \\"The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at.\\" In a 2005, interview with About.com, Burton spoke about the differences between directing Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: \\"The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co- director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process.\\" He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: \\"It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he‚Äôs great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that‚Äôs the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [together]. They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [Finney] and Joanna [Lumley] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That‚Äôs the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other.\\" ==Music== The soundtrack was produced by Danny Elfman with the help of John August and released on September 20, 2005. It contains all of the music from the film including score music and four songs with lyrics sung by voice actors. ==Release== Corpse Bride premiered on September 7, 2005 at the Venice International Film Festival. The film was released on September 23, 2005 in United States and on October 13, 2005 in the United Kingdom. ===Box office=== Corpse Bride grossed $53,359,111 in North America, and $63,835,950 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $117,195,061. In North America, the film opened to number two in its first weekend, with $19,145,480, behind Flightplan. In its second weekend, the film dropped to number three, grossing an additional $10,033,257. In its third weekend, the film dropped to number six, grossing $6,511,336. In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number nine, grossing $3,577,465. The biggest market in other territories being France, UK and Japan where the film grossed $8.88 million, $8.57 million and $7.1 million respectively. ===Critical response=== Corpse Bride received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84% approval rating with an average rating of 7.23/10 based on 193 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"As can be expected from a Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride is whimsically macabre, visually imaginative, and emotionally bittersweet.\\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 83 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". The film was nominated for the 78th Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which also starred Helena Bonham Carter. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list. Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying \\"This macabre musical about a young bridegroom who mistakenly weds a girl from beyond the grave is an endearingly schizoid Frankenstein of a movie, by turns relentlessly high-spirited and darkly poignant.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"A wondrous flight of fancy, a stop-motion-animated treat brimming with imaginative characters, evocative sets, sly humor, inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today's movies.\\" Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying \\"The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying \\"As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying \\"Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests that we are in the grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom.\\" Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end.\\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"Ghoulishness and innocence walk hand-in-hand in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, a movie that digs into Hollywood's past to resurrect the antique art of stop-motion animation and create a fabulous bauble of a movie.\\" Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Stop-motion animation may be the hardest and most tedious job in Hollywood, but the makers of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an instant classic.\\" Lisa Rose of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of five stars, saying \\"Corpse Bride offers unclassifiable enchantment.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"As animated films go, this is easily the best of a weak year.\\" Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"If his The Nightmare Before Christmas from a dozen years back was a treat for the eyes and mind, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride goes double or nothing by being a delight for the ears and also the heart.\\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film a B+, saying \\"Beneath the bone pile of allusions, Corpse Bride is a darkly enchanting fable in its own right.\\" Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Corpse Bride turns out to be a ponderous mixture of puppetry and animation that is far too technologically complex and laborious for this hopelessly Luddite reviewer.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"A sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost.\\" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying \\"The sweetness, the visual flourishes and inspired pieces of casting carry the Corpse Bride, if not all the way down the primrose path, then at least across the threshold.\\" Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"If Nightmare Before Christmas was a jazzy pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz--an elegant, deadly funny bit of macabre matrimony.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying \\"The film does have a fairy-tale aspect, but, like many of its characters, it is more dead and buried than fully alive.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Corpse Bride is an unexpectedly touching celebration of love told in a quirky and inventive style.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"In the guise of a family film, Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock's Vertigo. It would be a test for any filmmaker, and Burton aces it.\\" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is easily the best stop-motion animated necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time. It is also just simply, wonderful: a morbid, merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul.\\" Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying \\"Corpse Bride is a delightful mix of strange goings-on and imaginatively crafted puppetry, a wild ride through Burton's chaotic, splendidly original world.\\" Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Corpse Bride will win your heart, if it doesn't rip it out of your chest first.\\" Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"There's a happy Halloween in store even for children who aren't allowed to trick or treat, and it's courtesy of Tim Burton's animated Corpse Bride.\\" Bruce Westbrook of The Houston Chronicle gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Amazingly fluid and drop-dead gorgeous, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the best-looking, stop-motion animation film ever.\\" Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Corpse Bride suffers from the same problem that has plagued Burton's recent live-action films: for all its formidable razzle-dazzle, it doesn't engage the heart.\\" Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"This vibrantly imaginative mix of horror and humor puts the f-u-n in funeral.\\" ===Home media=== Corpse Bride was released on DVD and HD DVD on January 16, 2006. It was released on Blu-ray on September 26, 2006. , the film has sold 2,777,736 DVDs and 40,411 Blu-ray Discs totaling a gross of $53,359,111 and $61,411,543 respectively for a total gross of $114,770,654 in North America. ==See also== * List of animated feature films * List of stop- motion films * Posthumous marriage ==References* * * Category:2005 films Category:American zombie comedy films Category:American zombie films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:2005 animated films Category:2000s American animated films Category:2005 fantasy films Category:American fantasy-comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American animated fantasy films Category:American films Category:British animated fantasy films Category:British musical comedy films Category:British zombie comedy films Category:British zombie films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Fantasy comedy films Category:Films scored by Danny Elfman Category:Films about weddings Category:Animated films directed by Tim Burton Category:Films directed by Tim Burton Category:Films set in the 1870s Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in the Victorian era Category:Films set in Europe Category:Human-zombie romance in fiction Category:Warner Bros. films Category:American musical fantasy films Category:Films with screenplays by Caroline Thompson Category:Films with screenplays by John August Category:Films with screenplays by Pamela Pettler Category:2000s stop-motion animated films Category:Undead in popular culture Category:Laika animated films Category:Warner Bros. animated films Category:British musical fantasy films Category:2005 directorial debut films ","title":"Corpse Bride"},{"id":"1430398","text":"Maip√∫ is a commune of Chile located in Santiago Province, Santiago Metropolitan Region, integrated into the Greater Santiago conurbation.

She was Croatia's second female Foreign Minister taking the office after Kolinda Grabar- Kitaroviƒá. She is known as outspoken liberal and an advocate of European integration, anti-fascism, gender equality and LGBT rights. After becoming involved in politics in the early 1990s, Pusiƒá served five consecutive terms as MP, having been elected to the Croatian Parliament in the 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2016 parliamentary elections. She also ran in the 2009‚Äì10 presidential election, coming in fifth out of twelve candidates. During her 2008‚Äì2011 parliament term she chaired the parliamentary committee for tracking the progress of Croatia's accession negotiations with the European Union. She also held the post of Vice-President of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR). ==Early life and education== Vesna Pusiƒá was born on 25 March 1953 in Zagreb to jurist and university professor Eugen Pusiƒá and Vi≈°nja (n√©e Anƒëelinoviƒá) Pusiƒá, a professor of English language. She graduated from II Gymnasium in 1971, after which she enrolled in Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences from which she graduated with a degree in sociology and philosophy in 1976. In 1984, she obtained a doctorate in sociology at the same faculty (PhD Thesis: \\"The Role of Collective Decision-making in the Realization of Workers' Interests\\"). ==Professional career== After graduation, Pusiƒá worked from 1975 to 1979 as a member of the International Research Group doing research on industrial democracy in twelve European countries. From 1976 to 1978 she was a researcher at the Institute of Sociology at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. Since 1978 she has been working at the Sociology Department of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and teaching courses in the Theory of Industrial Democracy and the Sociology of Politics. In 1978, Pusiƒá was one of seven women who initiated the first feminist organization in SFR Yugoslavia ≈Ωena i dru≈°tvo (Woman and society) and was widely criticized by the authorities at the time. From 1992 to 1994, she served as Head of the Department of Sociology of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. Since 2010 she is still formally affiliated with the University of Zagreb, but not teaching due to her active involvement in the politics. Pusiƒá lectured at the University of Chicago, Cornell University, American University, The New School, International Forum for Democratic Studies, Foreign Service Institute, Georgetown University, Wilson Center, and MIT Sloan School of Management. ==Political career== Vesna Pusiƒá was one of the 28 founding members of the liberal Croatian People's Party (HNS-LD) in 1990, after participating in the Coalition of People's Accord. She left party politics in 1992, but rejoined the same party in 1997 and was later its president between 2000 and 2008, and again since 2013. She first entered the Croatian Parliament in the 2000 parliamentary election, and has been reelected in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. In 1992 Pusiƒá was the co-founder and director of the Erasmus Guild, a nongovernmental, nonpartisan think-tank for the culture of democracy, and the publisher and editor of the journal Erasmus, focusing specifically on different issues of transition in Croatia, countries of former Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe. Erasmus Guild ceased operations in 1998. Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos and Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusiƒá in Zagreb in April 2013 In 2005 and 2008, she was made Chairwoman of the National Committee for EU negotiations, the body that oversees accession negotiations and is composed of members of parliament as well as representatives of the President, the academic community, employers, and union representatives. In 2006 and 2008 she was elected vice-president of ELDR. In the Croatian presidential election, 2009‚Äì2010, Pusiƒá was the HNS-LD candidate. She won 7.25% in the first round, placing fifth out of twelve candidates, and was thus eliminated from the second round. After Kukuriku coalition won the 2011 parliamentary elections, Pusiƒá served as Minister of Foreign and European Affairs in the center-left Cabinet of Zoran Milanoviƒá. After Radimir ƒåaƒçiƒá was expelled from the Croatian People's Party on 23 March 2013 because of his attempts to destabilize the party, Pusiƒá become party president once again. Pusiƒá was reelected to the Parliament on 2015 parliamentary elections and served as a Deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament between 3 February 2016 and 14 October 2016. She was reelected to the Parliament at the 2016 extraordinary parliamentary elections. After HNS decided to enter coalition with conservative Croatian Democratic Union party, Pusiƒá left HNS and with three other MPs was co-founder of the new social- liberal and centre-left party: the Civic Liberal Alliance. She continues to be an MP. ==UN Secretary-General candidature== Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz and Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusiƒá in December 2013 Pusiƒá meeting Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran in January 2015 On 3 September 2015 the Croatian Government decided to nominate Pusiƒá as the official Croatian candidate for the 2016 UN Secretary-General selection. Her nomination was officially submitted on 14 January 2016. The UN's role in the Haiti cholera outbreak has been widely discussed and criticized. There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haiti's water stream. When asked if Haitian cholera victims should be compensated, Ms. Pusic initially indicated that they should be, but then said the question should be studied further by expert panels; \\"it has been studied for years, and the United Nations has claimed immunity from prosecution.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/un-secretary-general- candidates-ban-ki-moon.html?_r=1 Another issue that has been brought up is the sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers. This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. She was asked about her stance on peacekeepers' accountability during the UN Secretary General informal dialogues. Palestine, the United Kingdom, and the United States all asked about how she would tackle the issue of sexual abuse by peacekeepers. Pusiƒá repeatedly referred to the three reports that have addressed peacekeeping SEA, citing that she would follow and implement much of the same principles.http://webtv.un.org/search/vesna-pusi%C4%87-croatia-informal- dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary- general/4844480656001?term=informal%20dialogue&languages;=&sort;=date For one, she stated that peacekeepers who have committed atrocities against their people should not be allowed to serve as peacekeepers within a certain number of years. She also emphasized a strong command structure and a faster reporting and processing of cases. Pusiƒá participated in the UN debate that was held on 12 July 2016. On the question of the Hungarian ambassador to the UN concerning which way of leadership is needed by the UN and the world, Pusiƒá replied that standards have dropped in the past 20 years, stating that \\"phrases and lack of accountability are currently very popular. I believe that we do not want leadership that is based on platitudes and speaking only what people want to hear.\\", adding that today's leaders need vision, persistence and courage. She stated that she wanted to be Secretary-General because the UN topics of peace, human rights and development have taken center stage throughout her life. When commenting on the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), she stated that the court wasn't perfect, but that it would have been much worse without it, adding that it sent an important message; \\"If you commit a war crime, you will be caught.\\" Pusiƒá expressed her concern about the wave of cynicism in current national and international politics. In addition, she stated that being a female candidate was important, and noted that the UN had been dominated for 50 years by men. After receiving 11 'discourage' votes on a first informal closed-door straw poll of the 15-member UN Security Council that was held on 21 July 2016, Pusiƒá decided on 4 August 2016 to withdraw from the race and focus on the 2016 extraordinary parliamentary elections.http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/vesna-pusic-odustala-od- kandidature-za-seficu-una-moje-sanse-za-izbor-nisu- realne/910645.aspxWithdrawal of candidature of Vesna Pusiƒá, 4 August 2016 ==Activism== Vesna Pusiƒá is very popular in the Croatian LGBT community. In 2011, Zagreb Pride attenders awarded her with the \\"gay friendly person of the decade\\". She has been regular attendant at Zagreb LGBT pride. Her brother Zoran is a civil rights and peace activist, serving as President of the Civic Committee for Human Rights, and chairman of the Anti-Fascist League of the Republic of Croatia since 21 March 2015. ==Private life== Pusiƒá is married to a Lithuanian-American entrepreneur Jurgis Oniunas with whom she has a daughter Daina who is a film director. She speaks Croatian, English, and German fluently. In 2017 French President Fran√ßois Hollande awarded Pusiƒá with the highest order of France, Legion of Honour for \\"advocating European goals and contributing to the co-operation between France and Croatia.\\" During the awarding ceremony held on 17 January 2018 in the residency of the French Ambassador in Zagreb, French ambassador to Croatia Philippe Meunier stated: \\"You knew how to convey the European values and the tolerance we share, our shared values - your condemnation of hate speech, your interest in cooperating with minorities, your concern for the value of cultural and ethnic diversity in Croatia, and your humane speech about accepting refugees.\\"https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/vesna-pusic-orden-legija- casti-1220730 ==Bibliography== * Democracies and Dictatorships, Durieux, Zagreb 1998 * The Leaders and the Managers, Novi Liber, Zagreb 1992 * Industrial Democracy and Civil Society, Sociolo≈°ko dru≈°tvo Hrvatske, Zagreb 1986. * Industrial Democracy in Europe, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981 (co- author) * European Industrial Relations, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981 (co- author) ==References- - - Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Zagreb Category:Candidates for President of Croatia Category:Croatian People's Party ‚Äì Liberal Democrats politicians Category:Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Female foreign ministers Category:Foreign ministers of Croatia Category:Representatives in the modern Croatian Parliament Category:University of Zagreb faculty Category:Women government ministers of Croatia Category:Croatian women diplomats ","title":"Vesna Pusiƒá"},{"id":"1430413","text":"Belgische Unie ‚Äì Union Belge (Dutch and French for Belgian Union), known by the acronym BUB, is a small political party in Belgium. It describes itself as \\"The Centrist Party for a United Belgium\\". As one of the only political parties organised across the entire country, it wishes to abolish the federal system in Belgium and re-establish a unitary state based on the original nine provinces. The party is explicitly opposed to separatism and the partition of Belgium. ==Ideology== The party promotes reconciliation between Belgium's language groups (the Dutch- and French-speaking communities), promoting multilingualism, and centralisation by one government and parliament. They propose the abolition of the three Belgian Regions and transfer their powers back to the federal state of Belgium and the provinces. They are the only party with this outlook, as all other Belgian parties except for the Workers Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB), Left Socialist Party, and minor liberal grouping \\"Vivant\\" have, together with the creation of the federal states, been split on a language basis. ==Representation== The BUB has no elected seats at any level and operates only on the margins of Belgian politics. The party got 10,000 votes in the 2003 federal elections and 13,000 votes in the 2004 regional elections. The votes were concentrated in the northern provinces, in the central constituencies of Brabant and Brussels and in 2003 also in the southern province of Namur. Though the party did not gain any seats in the 2006 communal elections, BUB did far better at the ballots, gaining up to 2% of the vote in some cities. In the federal elections of 10 June 2007, the pro- Belgian party also progressed everywhere it participated but again obtained no seats. At the 2010 federal elections, the party formed a pro-Belgian cartel with CDF under the name BELG-UNIE and obtained a record result of 20.000 votes in 5 constituencies. Since 22 June 2011, the cartel consists of a third pro- Belgian party, the BAB. The party is headed by a national president (Hans Van de Cauter) and is divided into 9 provincial sections, corresponding with the 9 provinces that existed before the split of the central province of Brabant in 1995. The party is member of International Monarchist Conference. == References == == External links == *Official web site: http://www.belgischeunie.be or http://www.unionbelge.be.

Slavery in various forms has been a part of the social environment for much of Christianity's history, spanning well over eighteen centuries. In the early years of Christianity, slavery was an established feature of the economy and society in the Roman Empire, and this persisted in different forms and with regional differences well into the Middle Ages. Saint Augustine described slavery as being against God's intention and resulting from sin. In the eighteenth century the abolition movement took shape among Christian people across the globe. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century debates in the UK and the US, passages in the Bible were used by both pro- slavery advocates and abolitionists to support their respective views. In modern times, various Christian organizations reject the permissibility of slavery. ==Biblical references== The Bible uses the Hebrew term eved (◊¢◊ë◊ì) and Greek doulos (Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ) to refer to slaves. Eved has a much wider meaning than the English term slave, and in many circumstances it is more accurately translated into English as servant or hired worker.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Slaves and Slavery Doulos is more specific, but is also used in more general senses as well: of the Hebrew prophets (Rev 10:7), of the attitude of Christian leaders toward those they lead (Matt 20:27), of Christians towards God (1 Peter 2:16), and of Jesus himself (Phil 2:7). ===Old Testament=== Historically, slavery was not just an Old Testament phenomenon. Slavery was practised in every ancient Middle Eastern society: Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman and Israelite. Slavery was an integral part of ancient commerce, taxation, and temple religion.Archer (1982), Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties, pp. 86-87 In the book of Genesis, Noah condemns Canaan (Son of Ham) to perpetual servitude: \\"Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers\\" (Gn 9:25). T. David Curp notes that this episode has been used to justify racialized slavery, since \\"Christians and even some Muslims eventually identified Ham's descendants as black Africans\\". Anthony Pagden argued that \\"This reading of the Book of Genesis merged easily into a medieval iconographic tradition in which devils were always depicted as black. Later pseudo-scientific theories would be built around African skull shapes, dental structure, and body postures, in an attempt to find an unassailable argument‚Äîrooted in whatever the most persuasive contemporary idiom happened to be: law, theology, genealogy, or natural science‚Äîwhy one part of the human race should live in perpetual indebtedness to another.\\" The Canaanites settled in Canaan, rather than Africa, where Ham's other sons, Cush and Put, most likely settled. Noah's curse only applied to Canaan, and according to biblical commentator, Gleason L. Archer, this curse was fulfilled when Joshua conquered Canaan in 1400 BC. Although there is considerable doubt about the nature and extent of the conquest described in the early chapters of the book of Joshua, the post-Flood story did supply a rationale for the subjugation of the Canaanites. It is possible that the naming of 'Canaan' in the post-Flood story is itself a reflection of the situation of warfare between peoples in the time when the written form of the story took shape. Some forms of servitude, customary in ancient times, were condoned by the Torah. Hebrew legislation maintained kinship rights (Exodus 21:3, 9, Leviticus 25:41, 47‚Äì49, 54, providing for Hebrew indentured servants), marriage rights (Exodus 21:4, 10‚Äì11, providing for a Hebrew daughter contracted into a marriage), personal legal rights relating to physical protection and protection from breach of conduct (Exodus 21:8, providing for a Hebrew daughter contracted into a marriage, Exodus 21:20-21, 26‚Äì27, providing for Hebrew or foreign servants of any kind, and Leviticus 25:39-41, providing for Hebrew indentured servants), freedom of movement, and access to liberty. Hebrews would be punished if they beat a slave causing death within a day or two,Exodus 21:20-21 and would have to let a slave go free if they destroyed a slave's eye or tooth,Exodus 21:26-27 force a slave to work on the Sabbath,Exodus 23:12 return an escaped slave of another people who had taken refuge among the Israelites,Deuteronomy 23:15 or to slander a slave.Proverbs 30:10 It was common for a person to voluntarily sell oneself into slavery for a fixed period of time either to pay off debts or to get food and shelter.Leviticus 25:35 It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare, but not through kidnapping for the purpose of enslaving them. Children could also be sold into debt bondage, which was sometimes ordered by a court of law.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Slaves and Slavery The Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept. Slaves were to be treated as part of an extended family; they were allowed to celebrate the Sukkot festival, and expected to honor Shabbat. Israelite slaves could not be compelled to work with rigor, and debtors who sold themselves as slaves to their creditors had to be treated the same as a hired servant. If a master harmed a slave in one of the ways covered by the lex talionis, the slave was to be compensated by manumission; if the slave died within 24 to 48 hours, it was to be avenged (whether this refers to the death penaltyMaimonides, Mishneh Torah or notJewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Avenger of Blood is uncertain). Israelite slaves were automatically manumitted after six years of work, and/or at the next Jubilee (occurring either every 49 or every 50 years, depending on interpretation), although the latter would not apply if the slave was owned by an Israelite and was not in debt bondage. Slaves released automatically in their 7th year of service. This provision did not include females sold into concubinage by impoverished parents; instead their rights over against another wife were protected.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Law, Codification ofPeake's commentary on the Bible (1962), on Exodus 21:2-11 In other texts male and female slaves are both to be released after the sixth year of service. Liberated slaves were to be given livestock, grain, and wine as a parting gift. This 7th-year manumission could be voluntarily renounced. If a male slave had been given another slave in marriage, and they had a family, the wife and children remained the property of the master. However, if the slave was happy with his master, and wished to stay with a wife that his owner gave to him, he could renounce manumission, an act which would be signified, as in other Ancient Near Eastern nations,Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), article on Slavery by the slave gaining a ritual ear piercing. After such renunciation, the individual became his master's slave forever (and was therefore not released at the Jubilee).Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), article on Slavery It is important to note that these are provisions for slavery/service among Israelites. Non-Israelite slaves could be enslaved indefinitely and were to be treated as inheritable property. ===New Testament=== Early Christians reputedly regarded slaves who converted to Christianity as spiritually free men, brothers in Christ, receiving the same portion of Christ's kingdom inheritance. However, this regard apparently had no legal power. These slaves were also told to obey their masters \\"with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ.\\" (Ephesians 6:5 KJV) Paul the Apostle applied the same guidelines to masters in Ephesians 6:9: \\"And, masters, do the same to them. Stop threatening them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and with him there is no partiality.\\"Ephesians 6:9 Nevertheless, verses like Ephesians 6:5 were still used by defenders of slavery prior to the American Civil War. Slaves were encouraged by Paul in the first Corinthian Epistle to seek or purchase their freedom whenever possible. (I Corinthians 7:21 KJV). Avery Robert Dulles said that \\"Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution\\", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either. In a paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that, while he often encountered the claim, \\"not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery\\"; moreover a number of his stories are set in a slave/master situation, and involve slaves as key characters. Giles notes that these circumstances were used by pro-slavery apologists in the 19th century to suggest that Jesus approved of slavery.Giles, Kevin. \\"The Biblical Argument for Slavery: Can the Bible Mislead? A Case Study in Hermeneutics.\\" Evangelical Quarterly 66 (1994): p. 10 http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1994-1_003.pdf It is clear from all the New Testament material that slavery was a basic part of the social and economic environment. Many of the early Christians were slaves. In several Pauline epistles, and the First Epistle of Peter, slaves are admonished to obey their masters, as to the Lord, and not to men. Masters were also told to serve their slaves in obedience to God by \\"giving up threatening\\". The basic principle was \\"you have the same Master in heaven, and with him there is no partiality.\\" Peter was aware that there were masters that were gentle and masters that were harsh; slaves in the latter situation were to make sure that their behaviour was beyond reproach, and if punished for doing right, to endure the suffering as Christ also endured it. The key theological text is Paul's declaration in Epistle to the Galatians (Galatians 3:28): \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\\", suggesting that Christians take off these titles because they are now clothed in Christ. Paul's Epistle to Philemon was an important text for both pro-slavery advocates and abolitionists.Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery, by John R. McKivigan, Mitchell Snay This short letter, reputedly written to be delivered by the hand of Onesimus, a fugitive slave, whom Paul is sending back to his master Philemon. Paul entreats Philemon to regard Onesimus as a beloved brother in Christ. Cardinal Dulles points out that, \\"while discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, [Paul] does not say that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus and any other slaves he may have had.\\" He does, however, encourage Philemon to welcome Onesimus \\"not as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a beloved brother\\". Paul's instructions to slaves in the Epistle of Paul to Titus, as is the case in Ephesians, appear among a list of instructions for people in a range of life situations. The usefulness to the 19th century pro-slavery apologists of what Paul says here is obvious: \\"Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back, not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior.\\" Paul advises that \\"each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.\\" For slaves, however, he specifically adds this: \\"Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it. But if you are able to gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.\\" And then follows a wider principle: \\"For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ.\\" The First Epistle to Timothy‚Äîin some translations‚Äîreveals a disdain for the slave trade, proclaiming it to be contrary to sound doctrine. He explains to Timothy that those who live a life based on love do not have to fear the law of God; that (NIV version) ‚Äúthe law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers‚Äîand for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.‚Äù ==In the Roman Empire== Slavery was the bedrock of the Roman and world economy. Some estimate that the slave population in the 1st century constituted approximately one third of the total population. An estimated one million slaves were owned by the richest five per cent of Roman citizens. Most slaves were employed in domestic service in households and likely had an easier life than slaves working the land, or in mines or on ships. Slavery could be very cruel in the Roman Empire, and revolts severely punished, and professional slave-catchers were hired to hunt down runaways, with advertisements containing precise descriptions of fugitives being publicly posted and offering rewards.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/slavery_04.shtml Resisting Slavery in Ancient Rome By Professor Keith Bradle The Book of Acts refers to a synagogue of Libertines (ŒõŒπŒ≤ŒµœÅœÑŒØŒΩœâŒΩ), in Jerusalem. As a Latin term this would refer to freedmen, and it is therefore occasionally suggested that the Jews captured by Pompey, in 63 BC, gathered into a distinct group after their individual manumissions. However, the Book of Acts was written in Greek, and the name appears in a list of five synagogues, the other four being named after cities or countries; for these reasons, its now more often suggested that this biblical reference is a typographical error for Libystines (ŒõŒπŒ≤œÖœÉœÑŒØŒΩœâŒΩ), in reference to Libya (in other words, referring to Libyans).Friedrich Blass, Philology of the Gospels (1898), [regularly republished, most recently in 2005]Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), article on Libertines == Christianity's view == Early Christian thought exhibited some signs of kindness towards slaves. Christianity recognised marriage of sorts among slaves,Goodell, The American Slave Code. Pt. I Ch. VII freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity, and when slaves were buried in Christian cemeteries, the grave seldom included any indication that the person buried had been a slave. John Chrysostom (c. 347‚Äì407), archbishop of Constantinople, preaching on in a sermon entitled, \\"Should we not make it a heaven on earth?\\", stated, \\"I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they set at liberty... Though the Jewish Pentateuch gave protection to fugitive slaves, the Roman church often condemned slaves who fled from their masters, and refused them communion.Luis M. Bermejo, S.J., Infallibility on Trial, 1992, Christian Classics, Inc., , p. 313. Since the Middle Ages, the Christian understanding of slavery has seen significant internal conflict and endured dramatic change. One notable example where church mission activities in the Caribbean were directly supported by the proceeds of slave ownership was under the terms of a charitable bequest in 1710 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The Codrington Plantations in Barbados, were granted to the Society to fund the establishment of Codrington College. In the first decade of ownership, several hundred slaves at the plantation estates were branded on their chests, using the traditional red hot iron, with the word Society, to signify their ownership by the Christian organisation. Slave ownership at the Codrington Plantations only finally came to an end in 1833, when slavery in British Empire was abolished. The Church of England has since apologised for the \\"sinfulness of our predecessors\\" with the history of these plantation estates highlighted as example of the church's inconsistent approach to slavery.Adam Hochschild, Bury the Chains, The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery (2005), page 61 Today, nearly all Christians are united in the condemnation of modern slavery as wrong and contrary to God's will. ===Patristic era=== In 340 the Synod of Gangra in Armenia condemned certain Manicheans for a list of twenty practices including forbidding marriage, not eating meat, urging that slaves should liberate themselves, abandoning their families, asceticism and reviling married priests.Catholic Encyclopedia, , Accessed 10.9.2009. The later Council of Chalcedon declared that the canons of the Synod of Gangra were ecumenical (in other words, they were viewed as conclusively representative of the wider church). Saint Augustine described slavery as being against God's intention and resulting from sin. John Chrysostom described slavery as 'the fruit of covetousness, of degradation, of savagery ... the fruit of sin, [and] of [human] rebellion against ... our true Father' in his Homilies on Ephesians. Moreover, quoting partly from Paul the Apostle, Chrysostom opposed unfair and unjust forms of slavery by giving these instructions to those who owned slaves: \\" 'And ye masters', he continues, 'do the same things unto them'. The same things. What are these? 'With good-will do service' ... and 'with fear and trembling' ... toward God, fearing lest He one day accuse you for your negligence toward your slaves ... 'And forbear threatening;' be not irritating, he means, nor oppressive ... [and masters are to obey] the law of the common Lord and Master of all ... doing good to all alike ... dispensing the same rights to all\\". In his Homilies on Philemon, Chrysostom opposes unfair and unjust forms of slavery by stating that those who own slaves are to love their slaves with the Love of Christ: \\"this ... is the glory of a Master, to have grateful slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, that He should thus love His slaves ... Let us therefore be stricken with awe at this so great love of Christ. Let us be inflamed with this love-potion. Though a man be low and mean, yet if we hear that he loves us, we are above all things warmed with love towards him, and honor him exceedingly. And do we then love? And when our Master loves us so much, we are not excited?\\". By the early 4th century, the manumission in the church, a form of emancipation, was added in the Roman law. Slaves could be freed by a ritual in a church, performed by a Christian bishop or priest. It is not known if baptism was required before this ritual. Subsequent laws, as the Novella 142 of Justinian, gave to the bishops the power to free slaves.Youval Rotman, \\"Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World\\", Harvard University Press, 2009 p. 139 Several early figures, while not openly advocating abolition, did make sacrifices to emancipate or free slaves seeing liberation of slaves as a worthy goal. These include Saint Patrick (415-493), Acacius of Amida (400-425), and Ambrose (337 ‚Äì 397 AD). Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335-394) went even further and stated opposition to all slavery as a practice. Later Saint Eligius (588-650) used his vast wealth to purchase British and Saxon slaves in groups of 50 and 100 in order to set them free. ===Byzantine Empire=== The Byzantine law \\"Ecloga\\" (ŒïŒ∫ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒÆ) of 726Encycl. Britannica, Ecloga for the first time introduced the method of emancipation by baptism, whereby a master or a member of his family \\"received the slave after baptism by immersion\\". This measure opened the way to war-captives to be incorporated in the Byzantine society, in both the public and private sector.Youval Rotman, \\"Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World\\", p. 140 A shift in the view of slavery in the Byzantine Empire is noticed, which by the 10th century transformed gradually a slave- object into a slave-subject. The Christian captive or slave is perceived not as a private property but ‚Äúas an individual endowed with his own thoughts and words‚Äù. Thus, the Christian perception of slavery weakened the submission of slave to his earthly master by strengthening the ties of man to his God.Youval Rotman, \\"Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World\\", transl. by Jane Marie Todd, Cambridge, Massachusetts ‚Äì London, Harvard University Press 2009. Book presentation in a) Nikolaos Linardos (University of Athens), , Mediterranean Chronicle 1 (2011) pp. 281, 282, b) Alice Rio, American Historical Review, Vol. 115, Issue 5, 2010, pp. 1513‚Äì1514 ===Middle Ages & Early Modern Era=== During the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas taught that, although the subjection of one person to another (servitus) was not part of the primary intention of the natural law, it was appropriate and socially useful in a world impaired by original sin. According to John Francis Maxwell: Fr. Bede Jarrett, O.P. asserts that Aquinas considered slavery to be a result of sin and was justifiable for that reason. Conversely, Rodney Stark, a sociologist of religion, states that \\"Saint Thomas Aquinas deduced that slavery was a sin, and a series of popes upheld his position, beginning in 1435...\\" Nevertheless, for several decades spanning the late 15th and early 16th centuries, several popes explicitly endorsed the slavery of non-Christians. In 1452, as the Ottoman Empire was besieging Constantinople, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI asked for help from Pope Nicholas V. In response, the pope authorized King Alfonso V of Portugal to \\"attack, conquer, and subjugate Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ wherever they may be found...\\", in the bull Dum Diversas (18 June 1452).Sardar, Ziauddin, and Davies, Merryl Wyn. 2004. The No-Nonsense Guide to Islam. Verso. . p. 94. Rather than putting pressure on the Ottomans, however, the bull approved increased competition in West Africa, by Portuguese traders with Muslim-operated trans-Saharan trading caravans, including the highly profitable so-called Arab slave trade that had taken place for several centuries.Phipps, William E., Amazing Grace in John Newton, Mercer University Press, 2004 In 1454, Castilians also became involved in trading in various goods in West Africa, and were attacked by Portuguese warships. Enrique IV of Castile threatened war and Afonso V appealed to the Pope to support monopolies on the part of any particular Christian state able to open trade with a particular, non-Christian region or countries.Bown, Stephen R., 1494: How a Family Feud in Medieval Spain Divided the World in Half, p. 73, Macmillan, 2012 A papal bull, Romanus Pontifex, issued on January 8, 1455, conferred upon Portugal exclusive trading rights to areas between Morocco and the East Indies, with the rights to conquer and convert the inhabitants. A significant concession given by Nicholas in a brief issued to Alfonso V in 1454 extended the rights granted to existing territories to all those that might be taken in the future.\\"Slavery and the Catholic Church\\", John Francis Maxwell, p. 55, Barry Rose Publishers, 1975 and sanctioned the purchase of slaves from \\"the infidel\\" (i.e. non-Christian): \\"many Guineamen and other negroes, taken by force, and some by barter of unprohibited articles, or by other lawful contract of purchase, have been ... converted to the Catholic faith, and it is hoped ... that ... such progress be continued ... [and] either those peoples will be converted to the faith or at least the souls of many of them will be gained for Christ.\\" Frances Gardiner Davenport (2004; orig. 1917-37), European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648 (four vols.), Washington, DC, Carnegie Institution of Washington, pp. 20-26. By dealing directly with local leaders and traders, the Portuguese government sought to control trade with West Africa. In effect, the two bulls issued by Nicholas V conceded to subjects of Christian countries the religious authority to acquire as many slaves from non-Christians as they wished, by force or trade. These concessions were confirmed by bulls issued by Pope Callixtus III (Inter Caetera quae in 1456), Sixtus IV (Aeterni regis in 1481), and Leo X (1514). During the Reconquista of the late 15th century, many Muslims and Jews were enslaved in Iberia (especially after the Castilian-Aragonese victory in the Granada War of 1482‚Äì1492). Following Columbus's first voyage to the Americas, the bulls issued by Nicholas V, Callixtus III and Sixtus IV became the models for subsequent major bulls by Pope Alexander VI, such as Eximiae devotionis (3 May 1493), Inter Caetera (4 May 1493) and Dudum Siquidem (23 September 1493), in which similar monopolies were conferred upon Spain relating to the newly discovered lands in the Americas and the indigenous peoples of the Americas.Richard Raiswell (1997), \\"Nicholas V, Papal Bulls of\\", in Junius Rodriquez (ed.) The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Denver, Colorado/Oxford, England; ABC-CLIO, p. 469.Thomas Foster Earle (2005), Black Africans in Renaissance Europe; Cambridge/New York/Melbourne, Cambridge University Press, p. 281, and; Luis N. Rivera (1992), A Violent Evangelism: The Political and Religious Conquest of the Americas, Louisville, Westminster John Knox Press, p. 25. In 1537 ‚Äì after denunciations of slavery by Fr. Bartolom√© de las Casas, a former colonist in the West Indies turned Dominican ‚Äì Pope Paul III revoked the previous authority to enslave indigenous people of the Americas with the bulls Sublimus Dei (also known as Unigenitus and Veritas ipsa) and Altituda divini consolii, as well as a brief for the execution of Sublimus Dei ‚Äì a document known as Pastorale officium. Sublimus Dei, in particular, was described by Hans-J√ºrgen Prein (2008) as the \\"Magna Carta\\" for the human rights of indigenous people in its declaration that \\"the Indians were human beings and they were not to be robbed of their freedom or possessions\\".\\"The Encyclopedia Of Christianity\\", p. 212 In addition, Pastorale officium decreed a penalty of excommunication for anyone failing to abide by the bulls. Following a dispute between the papacy and the government of Spain, Pastorale officium was annulled the following year, in Non Indecens Videtur.Stogre, Michael (1992).

However, the documents issued by Paul III continued to circulate and to be quoted by those opposed to slavery.Lampe, Armando (2001), Christianity in the Caribbean: Essays on Church History, Kingston, Jamaica; University of the West Indies Press, p. 17 According to James E. Falkowski, Sublimus Dei \\"had the effect of revoking\\" Inter Caetera, but left intact the \\"duty\\" of colonists, i.e. \\"converting the native people\\".Thornberry, Patrick (2002), Indigenous Peoples and Human Rights, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 65, fn. 21. A series of bulls and encyclicals in 1435, 1537 and 1839 from several popes condemned both slavery and the slave trade. ===Christian abolitionism=== Although some abolitionists opposed slavery for purely philosophical reasons, anti-slavery movements attracted strong religious elements. Throughout Europe and the United States, Christians, usually from 'un-institutional' Christian faith movements, not directly connected with traditional state churches, or \\"non-conformist\\" believers within established churches, were to be found at the forefront of the abolitionist movements.Roger Anstey, \\"Slavery and the Protestant Ethic,\\" Historical Reflections 1979 6(1): 157-181. Pp. 157-172. In particular, the effects of the Second Great Awakening resulted in many evangelicals working to see the theoretical Christian view, that all people are essentially equal, made more of a practical reality. Freedom of expression within the Western world also helped in enabling opportunity to express their position. Prominent among these abolitionists was Parliamentarian William Wilberforce in England, who wrote in his diary when he was 28 that, \\"God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and Reformation of Morals.\\"quoted in Piper, 2002, p. 37) With others he labored, despite determined opposition, to finally abolish the British slave trade. The famous English preacher Charles Spurgeon had some of his sermons burned in America due to his censure of slavery, calling it \\"the foulest blot\\" and which \\"may have to be washed out in blood.\\"The Christian Cabinet, December 14, 1859 Methodist founder John Wesley denounced human bondage as \\"the sum of all villainies,\\" and detailed its abuses.Thoughts Upon Slavery, John Wesley, Published in the year 1774, John Wesley: Holiness of Heart and Life, 1996 Ruth A. Daugherty In Georgia, primitive Methodists united with brethren elsewhere in condemning slavery. Many evangelical leaders in the United States such as Presbyterian Charles Finney and Theodore Weld, and women such as Harriet Beecher Stowe (daughter of abolitionist Lyman Beecher) and Sojourner Truth motivated hearers to support abolition. Finney preached that slavery was a moral sin, and so supported its elimination. \\"I had made up my mind on the question of slavery, and was exceedingly anxious to arouse public attention to the subject. In my prayers and preaching, I so often alluded to slavery, and denounced it.Charles G. Finney, Memoirs (New York: A.S. Barnes, 1876), 324 Repentance from slavery was required of souls, once enlightened of the subject, while continued support of the system incurred \\"the greatest guilt\\" upon them.Guilt modified by ignorance--anti-slavery duties, by President Finney 1852 Quakers in particular were early leaders in abolitionism. In 1688 Dutch Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, sent an antislavery petition to the Monthly Meeting of Quakers. By 1727 British Quakers had expressed their official disapproval of the slave trade.London Yearly Meeting minutes, Vol. 6, 457 - 458 Three Quaker abolitionists, Benjamin Lay, John Woolman, and Anthony Benezet, devoted their lives to the abolitionist effort from the 1730s to the 1760s, with Lay founding the Negro School in 1770, which would serve more than 250 pupils. In June 1783 a petition from the London Yearly Meeting and signed by over 300 Quakers was presented to Parliament protesting the slave trade.London Yearly Meeting minutes, Vol. 17, 298 - 307 In 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed, with 9 of the 12 founder members being Quakers. During the same year, William Wilberforce was persuaded to take up their cause; as an MP, Wilberforce was able to introduce a bill to abolish the slave trade. Wilberforce first attempted to abolish the trade in 1791, but could only muster half the necessary votes; however, after transferring his support to the Whigs, it became an election issue. Abolitionist pressure had changed popular opinion, and in the 1806 election enough abolitionists entered parliament for Wilberforce to be able to see the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807. The Royal Navy subsequently declared that the slave trade was equal to piracy, the West Africa Squadron choosing to seize ships involved in the transfer of slaves and liberate the slaves on board, effectively crippling the transatlantic trade. Through abolitionist efforts, popular opinion continued to mount against slavery, and in 1833 slavery itself was outlawed throughout the British Empire - at that time containing roughly 1/6 of the world's population (rising to 1/4 towards the end of the century). In the United States, the abolition movement faced much opposition. Bertram Wyatt-Brown notes that the appearance of the Christian abolitionist movement \\"with its religious ideology alarmed newsmen, politicians, and ordinary citizens. They angrily predicted the endangerment of secular democracy, the mongrelization, as it was called, of white society, and the destruction of the federal union. Speakers at huge rallies and editors of conservative papers in the North denounced these newcomers to radical reform as the same old ‚Äúchurch-and-state‚Äù zealots, who tried to shut down post offices, taverns, carriage companies, shops, and other public places on Sundays. Mob violence sometimes ensued.\\" A postal campaign in 1835 by the American Anti-Slavery Society (AA-SS) - founded by African-American Presbyterian clergyman Theodore S. Wright - sent bundles of tracts and newspapers (over 100,000) to prominent clerical, legal, and political figures throughout the whole country, and culminated in massive demonstrations throughout the North and South. In attempting to stop these mailings, New York Postmaster Samuel L.Gouverneur unsuccessfully requested the AA-SS to cease sending it to the South. He therefore decided that he would ‚Äúaid in preserving the public peace‚Äù by refusing to allow the mails to carry abolition pamphlets to the South himself, with the new Postmaster General Amos Kendall affirming, even though he admitted he had no legal authority to do so.Jennifer Rose, The Culture of Honor: How Slaveholders Responded to the Abolitionist Mail Crisis of 1835, p.60David S. Mussey, \\"The American Adventure,\\" 2 vols. New York, 1980American Mobbing, 1828-1861 By David GrimstedSchlesinger Age of Jackson, p.190 This resulted in the AA-SS resorting to other and clandestine means of dissemination. Despite such determined opposition, many Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian members freed their slaves and sponsored black congregations, in which many black ministers encouraged slaves to believe that freedom could be gained during their lifetime. After a great revival occurred in 1801 at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, American Methodists made anti-slavery sentiments a condition of church membership. Abolitionist writings, such as \\"A Condensed Anti-Slavery Bible Argument\\" (1845) by George Bourne, and \\"God Against Slavery\\" (1857) by George B. Cheever,See also \\"The guilt of slavery and the crime of slaveholding, demonstrated from the Hebrew and Greek scriptures\\" used the Bible, logic and reason extensively in contending against the institution of slavery, and in particular the chattel form of it as seen in the South. Other Protestant missionaries of the Great Awakening initially opposed slavery in the South, but by the early decades of the 19th century, many Baptist and Methodist preachers in the South had come to an accommodation with it in order to evangelize the farmers and workers. Disagreements between the newer way of thinking and the old often created schisms within denominations at the time. Differences in views toward slavery resulted in the Baptist and Methodist churches dividing into regional associations by the beginning of the Civil War.Dooley 11-15; McKivigan 27 (ritualism), 30, 51, 191, Osofsky; ANB Leonidas Polk Roman Catholic statements also became increasingly vehement against slavery during this era. In 1741 Pope Benedict XIV condemned of slavery generally. In 1815 Pope Pius VII demanded of the Congress of Vienna the suppression of the slave trade. In the Bull of Canonization of Peter Claver, one of the most illustrious adversaries of slavery, Pope Pius IX branded the \\"supreme villainy\\" (summum nefas) of the slave traders; In 1839 Pope Gregory XVI condemned the slave trade in In supremo apostolatus; and in 1888 Pope Leo XIII condemned slavery in In plurimis. Roman Catholic efforts extended to the Americas. The Roman Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, Daniel O'Connell, supported the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and in America. With the black abolitionist Charles Lenox Remond, and the temperance priest Theobold Mathew, he organized a petition with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. O'Connell also spoke in the United States for abolition. Preceding such, and while not explicitly expressing an abolitionist point of view, the Portuguese Dominican Gaspar da Cruz in 1569 strongly criticized the Portuguese traffic in Chinese slaves, explaining that any arguments by the slave traders that they \\"legally\\" purchased already-enslaved children were bogus. (Includes an English translation of Gaspar da Cruz's entire book, with C.R. Boxer's comments) In 1917, the Roman Catholic Church's Canon Law was officially expanded to specify that \\"selling a human being into slavery or for any other evil purpose\\" is a crime. Pope Francis was one of the prominent religious leaders who came together in the Vatican, 2 December 2014, with the aim of eliminating modern slavery and human trafficking. During a ceremony held in the seat of the Pontifical Academy for Sciences in the Vatican they signed a Declaration of Religious Leaders against Slavery. Joining Pope Francis were eminent Orthodox, Anglican, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu representatives. In his address Pope Francis said: \\"...Inspired by our confessions of faith, we are gathered here today for an historical initiative and to take concrete action: to declare that we will work together to eradicate the terrible scourge of modern slavery in all its forms. The physical, economic, sexual and psychological exploitation of men, women and children that is currently inflicted on tens of millions of people constitutes a form of dehumanization and humiliation. Every human being, man women, boy and girl, is made in God's image. God is the love and freedom that is given in interpersonal relationships, and every human being is a free person destined to live for the good of others in equality and fraternity. Every person, and all people, are equal and must be accorded the same freedom and the same dignity. Any discriminatory relationship that does not respect the fundamental conviction that others are equal is a crime, and frequently an aberrant crime. Therefore, we declare on each and every one of our creeds that modern slavery, in terms of human trafficking, forced labor and prostitution, and organ trafficking, is a crime against humanity...\\" ===Opposition to abolitionism=== Passages in the Bible on the use and regulation of slavery have been used throughout history as justification for the keeping of slaves, and for guidance in how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, some Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. George Whitefield, famed for his sparking of the Great Awakening of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the Province of Georgia, for the legalisation of slavery,Edward J. Cashin, Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys (2001)Arnold Dallimore, George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century (1980), Volume 2 joining the ranks of the slave owners that he had denounced in his earlier years, while contending they had souls and opposing mistreatment and owners who resisted his evangelism of slaves. Slavery had been outlawed in Georgia, but it was legalised in 1751 due in large part to Whitefield's efforts. He bought enslaved Africans to work on his plantation and the orphanage he established in Georgia. Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage. In both Europe and the United States some Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible. Historian Claude Clegg writes that at the time of the Second Great Awakening, there was a movement to create a narrative of a mutually beneficial relationship between slaves and masters. This was increasingly tied to the doctrine of the Church as a means of justifying the system of slavery. In 1837, southerners in the Presbyterian denomination joined forces with conservative northerners to drive the antislavery New School Presbyterians out of the denomination. In 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church split into northern and southern wings over the issue of slavery. In 1845, the Baptists in the South formed the Southern Baptist Convention due to disputes with Northern Baptists over slavery and missions. Some members of fringe Christian groups like the Christian Identity movement, the Ku Klux Klan (an organization which is dedicated to the \\"empowerment of the white race\\"), and Aryan Nations still argue that slavery is justified by Christian doctrine. ==Slavery in the Americas== The Christianisation of Europe in the Early Middle Ages saw the traditional slavery disappearing in Europe and being replaced with feudalism. But this consensus was broken in the slave states of the United States, where the justification switched from religion (the slaves are heathens) to race (Africans are the descendants of Ham); indeed, in 1667, Virginia's assembly enacted a bill declaring that baptism did not grant freedom to slaves. In contrast to the British colonies, following 1680, the Spanish government of Florida offered freedom to escaped slaves who made it into their territory and converted to Catholicism. This offer was repeated multiple times.Murrin, John M. Liberty, Equality, Power: a History of the American People. Concise 4th ed. Vol. I: To 1877. Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2007. 115. Print. The opposition to the U.S. Civil Rights Movement in the 20th century was founded in part on the same religious ideas that had been used to justify slavery in the 19th century. Slavery was by no means relegated to the continental United States, as in addition to vast numbers of Native Americans slaves, it is estimated that for every slave who went to North America, South America imported nearly twelve slaves, with the West Indies importing over ten.\\"How Did American Slavery Begin?\\" Historian Philip Curtin By 1570 56,000 inhabitants were of African origin in the Caribbean.\\"The Encyclopedia of World History\\" 2001 The introduction of Catholic Spanish colonies to the Americas resulted in, indentured servitude and even slavery to the indigenous peoples. Some Portuguese and Spanish explorers were quick to enslave the indigenous peoples encountered in the New World. The Papacy was firmly against this practice. In 1435 Pope Eugene IV issued an attack against slavery in the papal bull Sicut Dudum that included the excommunication of all those who engage in the slave trade. Later In the bull Sublimus Dei (1537), Pope Paul III forbade the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas (called Indians of the West and the South) and all other people. Paul characterized enslavers as allies of the devil and declared attempts to justify such slavery \\"null and void.\\" > ...The exalted God loved the human race so much that He created man in such > a condition that he was not only a sharer in good as are other creatures, > but also that he would be able to reach and see face to face the > inaccessible and invisible Supreme Good ...

Father Bartolom√© de las Casas worked to protect Native Americans from slavery, and later Africans. The Haitian Revolution, which ended French colonial slavery in Haiti, was led by the devout Catholic ex- slave Toussaint L'Overture. In 1810, Mexican Catholic Priest Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who is also the Father of the Mexican nation, declared slavery abolished, but it was not official until the War of Independence finished. In 1888 Brazil became the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery completely, although in 1871 it had ensured that eventual result with the gradualist method of freeing in the womb.\\"Brazil's Prized Exports Rely on Slaves and Scorched Land\\" Larry Rohter (2002) New York Times, March 25 See Abolition of slavery timeline for other dates. === Indigenous African religions in the United States === Slaves in the 18th century came from various African societies, cultures, and nations, such as the Igbo, Ashanti and Yoruba on the West African coast. Slaves from differing ethnic groups displayed few religious commonalities, despite coming from the same continent and ethnicity; those sold to American slavers shared little of their traditional cultures and religions. Ibo, Yoruba, and Ashanti religious practices did not survive in slave communities in the United States. The institution of slavery, with its high conversion rate, ultimately eliminated traditional African religions in the country. Christianity has existed for so long in Africa (most notably in Ethiopia) that it is considered by some scholars as an \\"indigenous, traditional and African religion\\",John S. Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy (London: Heinemann, 1969), p.229, as cited in The Early Church and Africa, John P. Kealy and David W. Shenk, Nairobi Oxford University Press, 1975, p.1 though it was nonetheless a minority faith in the continent as a whole. In the United States, where most slaves came from the West-African coast, which was far less Christian, converting slaves to Christianity was common but remained an open question, with some slave owners resisting conversion due to fears that \\"slaves seeing themselves as spiritually equal\\" would spur an abolitionist movement. On the other hand, other slave owners promoted conversion because they thought Christian slaves would make for better workers. While many Americans argued otherwise, an increasing number of citizens and slaves argued that Christian religious principles directly conflicted with the institution of slavery.David H. Healey, The Paradox of the Two Christian FaithsJacob Neusner, World Religions in America: An Introduction, p.58 While these changes did occur in mainstream Christian thinking, many argue that this does not imply an innocence on the part of Christian religious institutions: Harvard Divinity School's Jacob K. Olupona states that Christianity was \\"deeply culpable in the African slave trade, inasmuch as it consistently provided a moral cloak for the buying and selling of human beings\\". In addition, some missionaries and clergymen wrote about the indifference of masters to their own religious welfare.Classified Digest, p. 15; Perry, pp. 254-255. Compare the sermon of Samuel Davies (1757), p. 41; Thomas Bacon, Four Sermons, 1750, pp. 101, 114-115 Even for Christian slaves, the actual ability to practice their religion was often impeded: while some slave owners openly encouraged religious meetings among their slaves, this was not a universal position across the country. One former slave recalled, \\"When de niggers go round singin' 'Steal Away to Jesus,' dat mean dere gwine be a 'ligious meetin' dat night. De masters ... didn't like dem 'ligious meetin's so us natcherly slips off at night\\".\\"The Secret Religion of the Slaves\\" , excerpt from Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South (Oxford, 1978), by Albert J. Raboteau ===United States=== The first African slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619, when a Dutch slave trader bartered his African 'cargo' for food. These Africans became indentured servants, possessing a legal position similar to many poor Englishmen.Hugh Brogan, The Penguin History of the USA (1999) It was not until around the 1680s that the popular idea of a racial-based slave system became reality.\\"A Brief History of Jamestown ,\\" The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, Richmond, VA 23220 Additionally, \\"New World slavery was a unique conjunction of features. Its use of slaves was strikingly specialized as unfree labor-producing commodities, such as cotton and sugar, for a world market.\\"Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology (4 vols), David Levinson and Melvin Ember (eds), HenryHolt:1996 \\"By 1850 nearly two-thirds of the plantation slaves were engaged in the production of cotton.... The South was totally transformed by the presences of slavery.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica For the most part, the Pilgrims who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620 had servants and not slaves, meaning that after turning 25 most black servants were given their freedom, which was a contractual arrangement similar to that of English apprenticeships.\\"Were there any blacks on the Mayflower?\\" By Caleb Johnson, member of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants Opposition to slavery in the United States predates the nation's independence. As early as 1688, congregations of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) actively protested slavery. The Quaker Testimony of Equality would have an influence on slavery in Pennsylvania. However, at independence the nation adopted a Constitution which forbade states from liberating slaves who had fled from other states, and instructed them to return such fugitive slaves.United States Constitution, 4:2:3 The rise of abolitionism in 19th- century politics was mirrored in religious debate; slavery among Christians was generally dependent on the attitudes of the community they lived in. This was true in both Protestant and Catholic churches.Nevins, V.2 p.145 Religious integrity affected the white slave-holding Christian population. Slaveholders, priests, and those tied to the Church undermined the beliefs of the millions of African-American converts. As abolitionism gained popularity in the Northern states, it strained relations between Northern and Southern churches. Northern clergy increasingly preached against slavery in the 1830s. In the 1840s, slavery began to divide denominations.Miller, 305 This, in turn, weakened social ties between the North and South, allowing the nation to become even more polarized in the 1850s.Older denominations would not be reunited until the 20th century. The Methodists, for example, split in 1844 and were not reunited until 1939. The Presbyterians were not reunited until 1983, and the Baptists churches of the United States have never reunited. The issue of slavery in the United States came to an end with the American Civil War. Although the war began as a political struggle over the preservation of the nation, it took on religious overtones as southern preachers called for a defense of their homeland and northern abolitionists preached the good news of liberation for slaves. Gerrit Smith and William Lloyd Garrison abandoned pacifism, and Garrison changed the motto of The Liberator to Leviticus 25:10, \\"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof.\\" The YMCA joined with other societies to found the United States Christian Commission, with the goal of supporting Union soldiers, and churches collected $6 million for their cause.Lossing, Chapter 26 Harriet Tubman, considered by many to be a prophet due to her success as a liberator with the Underground Railroad, warned \\"God won't let master Lincoln beat the South till he does the right thing\\" ‚Äî i.e., emancipating the slaves. Popular songs such as John Brown's Body (later The Battle Hymn of the Republic) contained verses which painted the Northern war effort as a religious campaign to end slavery. Even Abraham Lincoln appealed to religious sentiments, suggesting in various speeches that God had brought on the war as punishment for slavery,Several examples appear in Wikiquote, such as while acknowledging in his second Inaugural Address that both sides \\"read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.\\" With the Union victory in the war and a slavery banned by constitutional amendment, abolitionist Christians also declared a religious victory over their slave-holding brethren in the South. Southern religious leaders who had preached a message of divine protection were now left to reconsider their theology. ==== Baptists ==== By the 1830s, tensions had begun to mount between northern and southern Baptist churches. The support of Baptists in the South for slavery can be ascribed to economic and social reasons, although this was never admitted. Instead, it was claimed that slavery was beneficent, and endorsed in the Bible by God. However, Baptists in the North disagreed strongly, claiming that God would not \\"condone treating one race as superior to another\\". Southerners, on the other hand, held that God intended the races to be separate. Finally, around 1835, Southern states began complaining that they were being slighted in the allocation of funds for missionary work. The break occurred in 1844, when the Home Mission Society announced that a person could not be simultaneously both a missionary and a slaveowner. Faced with this challenge, the Baptists in the South assembled in May 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, and organized the Southern Baptist Convention, which was pro-slavery. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century and throughout most of the 20th the Southern Baptist Convention continued to protect systemic racism and opposed civil rights for African- Americans, only officially and definitively renouncing slavery and \\"racial\\" discrimination with a resolution in 1995. William Knibb was an active campaigner against slavery in Jamaica, who suffered persecution, including the burning of his chapel at Falmouth Massachusetts?, at the hands of agents of the colonial powers. ====Catholics==== Irish Brigade attending a Catholic Union army chaplain at a Mass during the American Civil War Catholic bishops in America were always ambivalent about slavery. Two slaveholding states, Maryland and Louisiana, had large contingents of Catholic residents; however both states had also the largest numbers of former slaves who were freed. Archbishop of Baltimore, Maryland, John Carroll had two black servants ‚Äî one free and the other a slave. The Society of Jesus in Maryland owned slaves, who worked on their farms. The Jesuits began selling off their slaves in 1837, and without these funds Georgetown University would not exist today; it \\"owes its existence\\" to this transaction. As Catholics only started to become a significant part of the US population in the 1840s with the arrival of poor Irish and southern Italian immigrants, who congregated in urban (non-farming) environments, the overwhelming majority of slaveowners in the USA were white Protestants, the elite. In 1839, Pope Gregory XVI issued the Bull In supremo apostolatus condemning the slave trade. Bishop John England of Charleston wrote several letters to President Martin Van Buren's Secretary of State explaining that the Pope, in In supremo, did not condemn slavery but only the slave trade, the buying and selling of slaves, not the owning of them; no Pope had ever condemned \\"domestic slavery\\" as it had existed in the United States. As a result of this interpretation, no American bishop spoke out in favor of abolition. Daniel O'Connell, the lawyer fighting for Catholic Emancipation in Ireland, supported the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and in America. Garrison recruited him to the cause of American abolitionism. O'Connell, the black abolitionist Charles Lenox Remond, and the temperance priest Theobold Mathew organized a petition with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. O'Connell also spoke in the United States for abolition. The Bishop of New York denounced O'Connell's petition as a forgery, and if genuine, an unwarranted foreign interference. The Bishop of Charleston declared that, while Catholic tradition opposed slave trading, it had nothing against slavery. One outspoken critic of slavery, Archbishop John Baptist Purcell of Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote: Between 1821 and 1836 when Mexico opened up its territory of Texas to American settlers, many of the settlers had problems bringing slaves into Catholic Mexico (which did not allow slavery). During the Civil War, Bishop Patrick Neeson Lynch was named by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to be its delegate to the Holy See, which maintained diplomatic relations in the name of the Papal States. Pope Pius IX, as had his predecessors, condemned chattel slavery. Despite Bishop Lynch's mission, and an earlier mission by A. Dudley Mann, the Vatican never recognized the Confederacy, and the Pope received Bishop Lynch only in his ecclesiastical capacity.John Bigelow, The Southern Confederacy and the Pope, in 157 _The North American Review_ 462, 468-75 (1893). William T. Sherman, a prominent General during the Civil War, freed many slaves during his campaigns. George Meade, who defeated Confederacy General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg, was a Catholic. ==== Methodists ==== Methodists believed that the institution of slavery contradicted their strict morality and abolitionist principles.US History, Methodist church, , Methodists were long at the forefront of slavery opposition movements. The Christian denomination attempted to help slaves and subsequently freed blacks through philanthropic agencies such as the American Colonization Society and the Mission to the Slaves. It was during the 1780s that American Methodist preachers and religious leaders formally denounced African-American Slavery. The founder of Methodism, the Anglican priest John Wesley, believed that \\"slavery was one of the greatest evils that a Christian should fight\\". 18th- century and early 19th-century Methodists had anti-slavery sentiments, as well as the moral responsibility to bring an end to African-American Slavery. However, in the United States some members of the Methodist Church owned slaves and the Methodist Church itself split on the issue in 1850, with the Southern Methodist churches actively supporting slavery until after the American civil War. Pressure from US Methodist churches in this period prevented some general condemnations of slavery by the worldwide church. Following Emancipation, African-Americans believed that true freedom was to be found through the communal and nurturing aspects of the Church. The Methodist Church was at the forefront of freed-slave agency in the South. Denominations in the southern states included the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) and African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AMEZ) churches. These institutions were led by blacks that explicitly resisted white charity, believing it would have displayed white supremacy to the black congregations. The AME, AMEZ, and African-American churches throughout the South provided social services such as ordained marriages, baptisms, funerals, communal support, and educational services. Education was highly regarded. Methodists taught former slaves how to read and write, consequently enriching a literate African-American society. Blacks were instructed through Biblical stories and passages. Church buildings became schoolhouses, and funds were raised for teachers and students. ==== Quakers ==== Quakers played a major role in the abolition movement against slavery in both the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. Quakers were among the first whites to denounce slavery in the American colonies and Europe, and the Society of Friends became the first organization to take a collective stand against both slavery and the slave trade, later spearheading the international and ecumenical campaigns against slavery. Quaker colonists began questioning slavery in Barbados in the 1670s, but first openly denounced slavery in 1688, when four German Quakers, including Francis Daniel Pastorius, issued a protest from their recently established colony of Germantown, close to Philadelphia in the newly founded American colony of Pennsylvania. This action, although seemingly overlooked at the time, ushered in almost a century of active debate among Pennsylvanian Quakers about the morality of slavery which saw energetic antislavery writing and direct action from several Quakers, including William Southeby, John Hepburn, Ralph Sandiford, and Benjamin Lay. During the 1740s and 50s, antislavery sentiment took a firmer hold. A new generation of Quakers, including John Woolman and Anthony Benezet, protested against slavery, and demanded that Quaker society cut ties with the slave trade. They were able to carry popular Quaker sentiment with them and, in the 1750s, Pennsylvanian Quakers tightened their rules, by 1758 making it effectively an act of misconduct to engage in slave trading. The London Yearly Meeting soon followed, issuing a ‚Äòstrong minute‚Äô against slave trading in 1761. On paper at least, global politics would intervene. The American Revolution would divide Quakers across the Atlantic. In the United Kingdom, Quakers would be foremost in the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1787 which, with some setbacks, would be responsible for forcing the end of the British slave trade in 1807 and the end of slavery throughout the British Empire by 1838. In the United States, Quakers would be less successful. In many cases, it was easier for Quakers to oppose the slave trade and slave ownership in the abstract than to directly oppose the institution of slavery itself, as it manifested itself in their local communities. While many individual Quakers spoke out against slavery after United States independence, local Quaker meetings were often divided on how to respond to slavery; outspoken Quaker abolitionists were sometimes sharply criticized by other Quakers. Nevertheless, there were local successes for Quaker antislavery in the United States during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. For example, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, first founded in 1775, consisted primarily of Quakers; seven of the ten original white members were Quakers and 17 of the 24 who attended the four meetings held by the Society were Quakers. Throughout the nineteenth century, Quakers increasingly became associated with antislavery activism and antislavery literature: not least through the work of abolitionist Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Quakers were also prominently involved with the Underground Railroad. For example, Levi Coffin started helping runaway slaves as a child in North Carolina. Later in his life, Coffin moved to the Ohio- Indiana area, where he became known as the President of the Underground Railroad. Elias Hicks penned the 'Observations on the Slavery of the Africans' in 1811 (2nd ed. 1814), urging the boycott of the products of slave labor. Many families assisted slaves in their travels through the Underground Railroad. Henry Stubbs and his sons helped runaway slaves get across Indiana. The Bundy family operated a station that transported groups of slaves from Belmont to Salem, Ohio. Quaker antislavery activism could come at some social cost. In the nineteenth-century United States, some Quakers were persecuted by slave owners and were forced to move to the west of the country in an attempt to avoid persecution. Nevertheless, in the main, Quakers have been noted and, very often, praised for their early and continued antislavery activity. ==== Mormonism ==== A statue of Chief Walkara, a Mormon slave trader Mormon scripture simultaneously denounces both slavery and abolitionism in general, teaching that it is not right for men to be in bondage to each other,D&C; but it also teaches that one should not interfere with the slaves of others. However, Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, taught that the enslavement of black Africans was required because he believed that they were still under the Curse of Cain and the Curse of Ham and he also warned those who were trying to free the slaves that they were going against the decrees of God. While these justifications were common in America at the time,Benjamin Braude, \\"The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, \\"William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103‚Äì142. See also William McKee Evans, \\"From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,\\"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15‚Äì43John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, \\"'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'\\", American Literary Realism, vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3 Mormons canonized several scriptures giving credence to the pro-slavery interpretation of the Curse of Ham and received scriptures teaching against interfering with the slaves of others.D&C; While promoting the legality of slavery, the church consistently taught against the abuse of slaves and advocated for laws that provided protection, though critics said the definition of abuse was vague and difficult to enforce. A few slave owners joined the church, and took their slaves with them to Nauvoo. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith began expressing a more abolitionist sentiment. While he was running for the presidency of the United States, Smith wrote a political platform containing a plan to abolish slavery.Joseph Smith Views of U.S. Government February 7, 1844 After Smith's death, the church split. The largest contingent followed Brigham Young, who supported slavery but opposed abuse, and a smaller contingent followed Joseph Smith III, who opposed slavery. Brigham Young led his contingent to Utah, where he led the efforts to legalize slavery in Utah. Brigham Young taught that slavery was ordained of God and taught that the Republicans' efforts to abolish slavery went against the decrees of God and would eventually fail. While black slavery was never widespread among Mormons, there were several prominent slave owners in the leadership of the LDS Church, including Abraham O. Smoot and Apostle Charles C. Rich. The LDS Church also accepted slaves as tithing. The Mormon settlement of San Bernardino openly practiced slavery under the leadership of Apostles Charles C. Rich and Amasa M. Lyman, despite being in the free state of California. They were freed by a judge who determined that the slaves were kept ignorant of the laws and their rights. Brigham Young also encouraged members to participate in the Indian slave trade. While visiting the members in Parowan, he encouraged them to \\"buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could\\". He argued that by doing so, they could educate them and teach them the gospel, and in a few generations the Lamanites would become white and delightsome. Mormons often referred to Indians as Lamanites, reflecting their belief that the Indians were descended from the Lamanites, who were a cursed race discussed in the Book of Mormon. Chief Walkara, one of the main slave traders in the region, was baptized into the church, and he received talking papers from Apostle George A. Smith that wished him success in trading Piede children. Mormons also enslaved Indian prisoners of war. As they began expanding into Indian territory, they often became embroiled in conflicts with the local residents. After expanding into Utah Valley, Young issued the extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah, where many Timpanogos women and children were taken into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery. After expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves. ==Slavery in Asia == === Philippines === Spaniards considered it legitimate to enslave non- Christian captives from wars and trade them legally in the past. This is because they did not consider this as an uncivilized and unchristian act because they believed that men were not created equal and the inferior men may be ruled by the superior ones. Christians, however, were anticipated to show sympathy to the people suffering and this made some masters free their slaves. A lot of them apprenticed their slaves so they could still work under their supervision once they were freed. There were two major types of slaves: the esclavos negros who were Africans purchased from Portugal, and the esclavos blancos who were Moros taken from wars. They were usually sold in public auctions. People from both the middle and the upper classes bought them, as well as the clergy. == See also == * History of slavery * Islamic views on slavery * Slavery in ancient Greece * Slavery in ancient Rome * Slavery in antiquity * Slavery in medieval Europe * The Bible and slavery * Judaism and slavery * Catholic Church and slavery * Baptist War ==References== ==Further reading== *Lossing, Benson J., LL.D.

BIST reduces cost in two ways: # reduces test-cycle duration # reduces the complexity of the test/probe setup, by reducing the number of I/O signals that must be driven/examined under tester control. Both lead to a reduction in hourly charges for automated test equipment (ATE) service. ==Naming== The BIST name and concept originated with the idea of including a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the IC. If all the registers that hold state in an IC are on one or more internal scan chains, then the function of the registers and the combinational logic between them will generate a unique CRC signature over a large enough sample of random inputs. So all an IC need do is store the expected CRC signature and test for it after a large enough sample set from the PRNG. The CRC comparison with expected signature or the actual resultant CRC signature is typically accessed via the JTAG IEEE 1149.1 standard. ==Applications== BIST is commonly placed in weapons, avionics, medical devices, automotive electronics, complex machinery of all types, unattended machinery of all types, and integrated circuits. ===Automotive=== Automotive tests itself to enhance safety and reliability. For example, most vehicles with antilock brakes test them once per safety interval. If the antilock brake system has a broken wire or other fault, the brake system reverts to operating as a normal brake system. Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a \\"limp mode\\" for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail. ===Aviation=== Almost all avionics now incorporate BIST. In avionics, the purpose is to isolate failing line-replaceable units, which are then removed and repaired elsewhere, usually in depots or at the manufacturer. Commercial aircraft only make money when they fly, so they use BIST to minimize the time on the ground needed for repair and to increase the level of safety of the system which contains BIST. Similar arguments apply to military aircraft. When BIST is used in flight, a fault causes the system to switch to an alternative mode or equipment that still operates. Critical flight equipment is normally duplicated, or redundant. Less critical flight equipment, such as entertainment systems, might have a \\"limp mode\\" that provides some functions. ===Electronics=== ====Integrated circuit manufacturing==== Built-In-Self-Test is used to make faster, less-expensive integrated circuit manufacturing tests. The IC has a function that verifies all or a portion of the internal functionality of the IC. In some cases, this is valuable to customers, as well. For example, a BIST mechanism is provided in advanced fieldbus systems to verify functionality. At a high level this can be viewed similar to the PC BIOS's power-on self-test (POST) that performs a self-test of the RAM and buses on power-up. ====Computers==== The typical personal computer tests itself at start-up (called POST) because it's a very complex piece of machinery. Since it includes a computer, a computerized self- test was an obvious, inexpensive feature. Most modern computers, including embedded systems, have self-tests of their computer, memory and software. ====Unattended machinery==== Unattended machinery performs self-tests to discover whether it needs maintenance or repair. Typical tests are for temperature, humidity, bad communications, burglars, or a bad power supply. For example, power systems or batteries are often under stress, and can easily overheat or fail. So, they are often tested. Often the communication test is a critical item in a remote system. One of the most common, and unsung unattended system is the humble telephone concentrator box. This contains complex electronics to accumulate telephone lines or data and route it to a central switch. Telephone concentrators test for communications continuously, by verifying the presence of periodic data patterns called frames (See SONET). Frames repeat about 8,000 times per second. Remote systems often have tests to loop-back the communications locally, to test transmitter and receiver, and remotely, to test the communication link without using the computer or software at the remote unit. Where electronic loop-backs are absent, the software usually provides the facility. For example, IP defines a local address which is a software loopback (IP-Address 127.0.0.1, usually locally mapped to name \\"localhost\\"). Many remote systems have automatic reset features to restart their remote computers. These can be triggered by lack of communications, improper software operation or other critical events. Satellites have automatic reset, and add automatic restart systems for power and attitude control, as well. ===Medicine=== Medical devices test themselves to assure their continued safety. Normally there are two tests. A power-on self-test (POST) will perform a comprehensive test. Then, a periodic test will assure that the device has not become unsafe since the power-on self test. Safety-critical devices normally define a \\"safety interval\\", a period of time too short for injury to occur. The self test of the most critical functions normally is completed at least once per safety interval. The periodic test is normally a subset of the power-on self test. ===Military=== One of the first computer-controlled BIST systems was in the U.S.'s Minuteman Missile. Using an internal computer to control the testing reduced the weight of cables and connectors for testing. The Minuteman was one of the first major weapons systems to field a permanently installed computer-controlled self-test. ==Specializations== There are several specialized versions of BIST which are differentiated according to what they do or how they are implemented: * Programmable built-in self-test (pBIST) * Memory built-in self-test (mBIST) - e.g. with the Marinescu algorithmMarinescu, M., 1982. Simple and Efficient Algorithms for Functional RAM Testing. 1982 IEEE Test Conference, Philadelphia, (Nov.). IEEE Computer Society, pp. 236-239. * Logic built-in self-test (LBIST) * Analog and mixed-signal built-in self-test (AMBIST) * Continuous built-in self-test (CBIST, C-BIT) * Event-driven built-in self- test, such as the BIST done to an aircraft's systems after the aircraft lands. * Periodic built-in self-test (C-BIT/P-BIT) * Interrupt-driven built-in self- test (IBIST) or user/operator-initiated built-in self-test (I-BIT, or O-BIT) * Power-up built-in self-test (PupBIST, P-BIT) * Automatic built-in self-test (ABIST) == See also == * Built-in test equipment * Logic built-in self-test * Embedded system * System engineering * Safety engineering * Watchdog timer ==References== == External links == * Hardware Diagnostic Self Tests * BIST for Analog Weenies - A Brief general overview of the capabilities and benefits of BIST by Analog Devices.

He entered military service on the eve of the Russo-Swedish War of 1788‚Äì1790 and his career advanced rapidly during the reign of Paul I. He served under Alexander Suvorov during Italian and Swiss campaigns of 1799. Miloradovich served in wars against France and Turkey, earning distinction in the Battle of Amstetten, the capture of Bucharest, the Battle of Borodino, the Battle of Tarutino and the Battle of Vyazma. He led the reserves into the Battle of Kulm, the Battle of Leipzig and the Battle of Paris (1814). Miloradovich attained the rank of General of the Infantry in 1809 and the title of count in 1813. His reputation as a daring battlefield commander (referred to as \\"the Russian Murat\\" and \\"the Russian Bayard\\") rivalled that of his bitter personal enemy Pyotr Bagration, but Miloradovich also had a reputation for being lucky. He boasted that he had fought fifty battles but had never been wounded nor even scratched by the enemy. By 1818, when Miloradovich was appointed Governor General of Saint Petersburg, the retirement or death of other senior generals made him the most highly decorated active officer of the Russian Army, holding the Order of St. George 2nd class, the Order of St. Andrew, the Order of St. Vladimir 1st class, the Order of St. Anna 1st class, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky with diamonds. A chivalrous man of boastful and flamboyant character, Miloradovich was a poor fit for the governorship. Vladimir Nabokov called him \\"a gallant soldier, bon vivant and a somewhat bizarre administrator\\"; Alexander Herzen wrote that he was \\"one of those military men who occupied the most senior positions in civilian life with not the slightest idea about public affairs\\". When news of the death of Alexander I reached Saint Petersburg, Miloradovich prevented the heir, future tsar Nicholas I, from acceding to the throne. From to , Miloradovich exercised de facto dictatorial authority, but he ultimately recognised Nicholas as his sovereign after the Romanovs sorted out the succession crisis. Miloradovich had sufficient evidence of the mounting Decembrist revolt, but did not take any action until the rebels took over the Senate Square on . He rode into the rows of rebel troops and tried to talk them into obedience, but was fatally shot by Pyotr Kakhovsky and stabbed by Yevgeny Obolensky. ==Early years== Coat of arms of Miloradovich family Mikhail Miloradovich was the son of Major General Andrei Miloradovich (1726‚Äì1798). The Russian branch of the Serb Miloradovich family was established in 1715, when Mikhail Miloradovich (the first) (Serbian Cyrillic: –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª–æ –ú–∏–ª–æ—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–∏—õ), one of three brothers recruited by Peter I to incite rebellion against the Turks four years earlier, fled from Herzegovina to Russia and joined Peter's service as a colonel. He was a commander of the Hadiach Regiment. Towards the end of Peter's reign he was imprisoned in connection with Pavlo Polubotok's treason case, but was spared from further misfortune by Peter's death. His grandson Andrey served thirty years in the Russian Army and later moved into civil administration as the Governor of Little Russia and the Chernigov governorate. The family owned lands in the Poltava Governorate; Mikhail inherited up to fifteen hundred serfs. Mikhail's father \\"enrolled\\" him in the military in his infancy, and later sent teenage Mikhail to study military sciences in the universities of K√∂nigsberg and G√∂ttingen, and in Strasbourg and Metz. According to Nikolai Leskov, the education was superficial: Leskov described Mikhail as a boy of \\"charming ignorance\\" who did not even master the French language properly, and said that his French was littered with the \\"most grave and curious mistakes\\" (an anecdote credited him with blending pittoresque and synagogue into \\"pittagogue\\"). Sixteen-year-old Mikhail returned to Russia in 1787, joined the army as a praporshchik (a junior commissioned officer rank) in the Izmaylovsky Regiment and was soon sent into action in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788‚Äì1790. ==Military career== ===Italian and Swiss campaigns=== Miloradovich did not earn any distinction in the war of 1788‚Äì1790, but he advanced rapidly in peacetime. A captain of the Guards in 1796, Paul I regarded him favorably and he was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1797 and major general and chief of the Apsheron Artillery Regiment in 1798. In the same year, he departed to join Alexander Suvorov's troops in Italy. He won Suvorov's unconditional trust for taking Lecco on the eve of the Battle of Cassano and for commanding the rearguard in the crossing of the Gotthard Pass. At Bassignana he changed three horses killed by the enemy but was not even scratched; at Altdorf he led assault infantry over a burning bridge. These and similar episodes, true or anecdotal, forged public opinion of Miloradovich as a daring and lucky field commander, an opinion that he himself cultivated for the rest of his life. Miloradovich was adored at home, but the French held a different opinion: Adolphe Thiers described Miloradovich as \\"a Servian , of brilliant valour, but absolutely destitute of military knowledge, dissolute in manners, uniting all the vices of civilization with all the vices of barbarism\\". Paul rewarded Miloradovich with the Order of St. Anne 1st class, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. Suvorov, in violation of military codes, transferred Miloradovich from field troops to his staff as a \\"general in waiting\\"; Paul later cited this fact as a pretext to dismiss Suvorov. Friendship between Miloradovich and Paul's second son Constantine also dated back to the Swiss campaign. Constantine awarded Miloradovich a gilded sword with an inscription To my friend Miloradovich, which Miloradovich had with him on the day of his death. ===Amstetten and Austerlitz=== Miloradovich played a key role in the Battle of Amstetten, where Mikhail Kutuzov ordered his three regiments to take a stand and provide relief for Pyotr Bagration's troops. \\"Above all, skillful maneuvering of the Russian force, including timely arrival of Miloradovich and his intelligent application of the reserve forces at his disposal, prevented the collapse of the rear guard\\". The action at Amstetten allowed Kutuzov to break contact with the French and prevented an all-out battle that would have been disastrous for the Russians. Reports of the battle by Miloradovich himself contradict the French accounts and are not corroborated by Bagration's laconic report: each side presented their own perspective, and Miloradovich had a particular penchant for glorifying his own actions. His action at Amstetten was rewarded with the Order of St. George 3rd class and promotion to lieutenant general. On November 11, 1805 Miloradovich attacked the French in the Battle of D√ºrenstein (referred to as the Battle of Krems in Russian sources), but the French withdrew before his corps could inflict significant damage. The Battle of Austerlitz saw Miloradovich in charge of the Russian part of a Russian- Austrian infantry column (2,875 out of 11,795 men), one of the four columns placed on Pratzen Heights, which had been abandoned by the French. Another, a larger part of the column was under Austrian command; the close presence of Kutuzov somewhat mitigated the perils of divided command. Tsar Alexander ordered this column to move before others were deployed; Kutuzov, unable to oppose the tsar, ordered Miloradovich to advance across the Goldbach Stream to Kobylnice, disregarding enemy action and difficult terrain. Hills and fog obstructed the view, and the column marched straight into the bulk of the French armies. Soult's troops mauled the mixed column and Miloradovich retreated. Alexander summoned his brother Constantine for help (although an alternative account by Bowden and Duffy asserts that Miloradovich contacted Constantine himself). Contrary to the popular view that \\"he was almost the only Russian general who obtained an advantage over the French\\" at Austerlitz, General Karl Wilhelm von Toll contested Miloradovich's actions, asserting that his column was the first to fall back and that it was Bagration, not Miloradovich, who saved the allied troops from annihilation. === Russian- Turkish War === The war of 1806‚Äì1812 began with Russian occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia. After the Turks responded by taking Bucharest, Russian commander-in-chief Ivan Ivanovich Michelson dispatched Miloradovich to intervene. Miloradovich captured Bucharest on December 13 without significant resistance from the Turks and was rewarded with a golden sword with diamonds \\"For the taking of Bucharest\\". The Turks, manipulated by the French envoy S√©bastiani, did not declare war until five days later. No large-scale action followed. In May 1807 Miloradovich tried to capture Giurgiu, but failed and fell back to Bucharest. On 2 June 1807, he redeemed himself by checking the Turkish advance at Obile»ôti. The years 1808 and 1809 did not see any remarkable action either, but were marked by a dual intrigue among top Russian generals; at the top level, Mikhail Kutuzov was in conflict with Alexander Prozorovsky, while below them burned a feud between Miloradovich and Pyotr Bagration. Bagration temporarily succeeded Prozorovsky as commander-in-chief, but later both Miloradovich and Bagration lost their commands. At the beginning of 1810 Alexander recalled Miloradovich from front-line duty and tasked him with assembling a new army in Belarus. In April 1810 Miloradovich was appointed Governor of Kiev but soon tended his resignation. He was officially discharged in September 1810 but was called up for service in November, again, as Governor of Kiev. ===Napoleon's invasion of Russia=== The Battle of Vyazma At the beginning of the 1812 campaign, Miloradovich was tasked with assembling and training volunteer militia troops in the hinterland; he returned to action on the eve of the Battle of Borodino with 14,600 militiamen. Kutuzov appointed Miloradovich commander of front-line forces of the right (northern) flank, comprising Baggovut's Second Infantry Corps and Ostermann-Tolstoy's Fourth Infantry Corps. The battle plan required Miloradovich to protect the old Smolensk-Moscow road. On the day of the battle, , Kutuzov realised that enemy action was concentrated against his center and left flank and, at about 9 a.m., he ordered Miloradovich to march to the south and attack the French left flank. Riding in advance of his troops, Miloradovich was caught up in the heat of the battle for Semyonovskoe and, together with Barclay de Tolly, Yermolov and Rayevsky, sought refuge in the defences of the Fourth Division. Between 10 a.m. and 12 noon his troops took a stand in the center of the Russian line and held off French attacks, with Baggovut's corps seeing critical action around noon, and Ostermann's corps around 4 p.m. By the end of the battle, the French succeeded in forcing the Russians from their defences, and Miloradovich's troops fell back to the same Smolensk road from where they had started. Baggovut took a stand there and held the road until nightfall against ferocious attacks by Polish cavalry. After the battle, Miloradovich took command of the rearguard, sheltering Kutuzov's army from the advancing French. Enemy pressure prevented him from attending the Council in Fili that decided to surrender Moscow. Miloradovich, acting on behalf of Kutuzov, made a deal with Murat: if the French wanted Moscow intact, they had to allow Miloradovich free passage to the east, or face stubborn urban warfare. Hereford George wrote that \\"Murat apparently deemed it beneath his dignity to confer with a mere general\\" and that he left the talks to S√©bastiani. According to Fyodor Glinka, however, Murat and Miloradovich negotiated directly with each other prior to the surrender of Moscow; Miloradovich contacted S√©bastiani only after the French took Moscow and their cavalry engaged the Russian rear. S√©bastiani honored the accord, called back the cavalry and allowed the safe retreat of two Russian regiments trapped between advancing French columns. Temporary loss of contact between Murat and the Russian rearguard allowed Kutuzov to make a westward turn: Murat kept on advancing south-east towards Bronnitsy while Kutuzov marched in the opposite direction. On , Kutuzov took defensive positions at Podolsk and dispatched Miloradovich to take position in front of the advancing French, 12 kilometers to the east. Four days later, Murat engaged Miloradovich and forced him to fall back to Krasnaya Pakhra (deliberately setting a trap, according to Glinka). Miloradovich barely escaped death or captivity when his headquarters were raided by French cavalry scouts on . On , Miloradovich successfully counterattacked Murat's corps at Chirikovo, taking one general de brigade prisoner. At this point, Kutuzov preferred to retreat further south; the main army marched to Tarutino, while Miloradovich, now having Ostermann-Tolstoy's corps under his command, retreated to a fallback position on the Chernishnya River, 8 kilometers north of Tarutino. Glinka wrote that from to Miloradovich was continuously fighting the French, including four significant battles, and lamented that few of his deeds reached the public eye: \\"He is not a hero of the Vedomosti, but a hero of history and of the future.\\" During the standoff on the Chernishnya, Miloradovich had another person-to-person negotiation with Murat, while his own camp was filled with masses of French stragglers taken prisoner. Modern Russian historians criticized as indecisive his actions in the Battle of Tarutino (), when poor coordination of Russian columns met its match in poor discipline of the French camp, but to contemporaries like Glinka and William Cathcart the battle was a clear success. After the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, Russian troops split into three pursuit columns, led by Miloradovich, Matvey Platov and Kutuzov himself. Miloradovich marched directly on Vyazma, occupied by four French corps (Beauharnais, Davout, Ney, Poniatowski), while Platov closed in on it from the north. On Miloradovich and Platov agreed to storm Vyazma. The Battle of Vyazma began at dawn of . Miloradovich quickly deployed front-line artillery that withstood Beauharnais's counterstrike and forced Davout's troops to take cover in the forest. Davout lost two hours taking a detour to reunite with Ney in Vyazma; at 2 p.m., when Miloradovich ordered a general assault, the French were already unable to resist. By 5 p.m. Miloradovich took control of the city, capturing French supply trains (but only three cannons). On Miloradovich's three corps, marching ahead of the retreating French, took position to the French rear near Krasny. Miloradovich began the three-day Battle of Krasnoi by capturing a large supply train and cutting Ney and Beauharnais off from Napoleon's army. The next day, Beauharnais exhausted his troops in a breakthrough and refused Miloradovich's invitation to surrender; at night the decimated remains of his corps escaped through the woods. On Ney made his own unsuccessful attempt to break through Miloradovich's defences. Miloradovich again offered honorable surrender, but Ney arrested the messenger and expended his 10th and 11th divisions in a frontal assault. At night his forces of 3,000 men escaped over the frozen Dnieper, but only 800 made it to Orsha. Miloradovich missed the opportunity to intercept the French crossing of Berezina by two days. In December 1812, Alexander awarded Miloradovich the Order of St. George, 2nd class. In line with Kutuzov's December Plan, Miloradovich led a Russian vanguard due west and took Warsaw on . ===Campaign of 1813-1814=== The appointment of Peter Wittgenstein as commander-in-chief of the united Russian and Prussian armies provoked open hostility from his new subordinates and, at the same time, from his seniors: Miloradovich, Barclay de Tolly, Langeron, Platov and Tormasov. Tormasov refused to obey Wittgenstein altogether and left the army, while Miloradovich stayed and became the \\"official speaker\\" for the opposition. The conflict burned until the failures at Lutzen and Bautzen compelled Wittgenstein to resign his command. Miloradovich's own record in May 1813 was mixed: at Lutzen his corps of 12,000 men arrived too late to influence the outcome. In the following week he covered the retreat to the Elbe. Thiers wrote that the French \\"made him pay dearly for his useless boast\\" (his resolve to defend a certain position). Cathcart praised his skillful rearguard action but noted that by May 12 his corps had shrunk to about 10,000. At Bautzen, Miloradovich managed to push Oudinot out of Tronberg, but the battle as a whole remained a French victory. Miloradovich and Constantine spent the remainder of the war, almost a year, in close cooperation and proximity as chiefs of infantry and cavalry reserves. In August 1813, after expiry of the Truce of Pl√§switz, Miloradovich led the reserve force of 24,000 Guards and Grenadiers into Bohemia and Constantine followed him with 11,000 \\"splendid cavalry\\" and artillery. Together with Barclay's headquarters, they formed one of four allied columns that converged on Dresden but had not been brought into the action of the Battle of Dresden. Three days later they were employed against Vandamme in the Battle of Kulm, a \\"fortunate victory that conferred advantages beyond all calculations\\". On the eve of the Battle of Leipzig the forces of Miloradovich and Constantine, stationed near Margeborn, formed the reserve of the coalition army. In December 1813 they crossed the Rhine and headed into France. Miloradovich's actions in 1813 were rewarded with the Order of St. Andrew, the title of count and the right to wear Alexander's insignia on his shoulder, the first such honor ever granted in Russia. Miloradovich concluded the campaign of 1814, his last one, in Paris. After General Gorchakov's infantry overran the French defensive artillery, Miloradovich was the one to bring in twenty howitzers and open fire at the city. ==Governor of Saint Petersburg== Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre during the flood of 1824. Handling flood damage and managing theatre were two best known sides of Miloradovich's administration. After the Treaty of Fontainebleau Alexander appointed Miloradovich commander of the Russian Imperial Guard; in 1818 Miloradovich became Governor of Saint Petersburg, assuming command of all the troops, police and civil administration of the imperial capital. He had the unconditional trust of Alexander, who could hardly have found a worse candidate for the job. As chief of police, Miloradovich controlled political surveillance and investigation in Saint Petersburg, but the events of 1825 demonstrated that he ultimately failed to respond to the real threat: he dismissed the evidence against the Decembrists, saying \\"It's all stuff; leave these young blockheads alone to read to each other their trash of miserable verses.\\" His affection for the arts and his ex officio duty as a censor at the peak of the Golden Age of Russian Poetry resulted in frequent contacts with authors and actors, and, apart from his death and his actions during the disastrous flood of 1824, his administration was remembered largely through anecdotes and artists' memoirs of varying reliability. This was not uncommon for Russian commanders; Nikolay Raevsky said \\"They [the writers of his time] turned me into a Roman, Miloradovich into a great man, Wittgenstein into the saviour of the fatherland, and Kutuzov into Fabius. I am not a Roman, and neither are these gentlemen.\\" Alexander Herzen who met Miloradovich in early childhood and fondly remembered him as a storyteller \\"with the greatest vivacity, with lively mimicry, with roars of laughter\\" ridiculed Miloradovich as an administrator yet called him \\"a warrior poet who understood poetry ... grand things are done by great means.\\" Herzen's memoirs provide a number of anecdotes about Miloradovich the administrator (none of which could have been witnessed by the narrator). In 1820 Miloradovich interrogated Alexander Pushkin on suspicion of political propaganda. Pushkin's name had already become a blanket cover for all kinds of incendiary pamphlets and he was desperate to clear himself of dangerous misattributions. Pushkin said that he burned his \\"contraband poems\\" and recited some from memory. Miloradovich said \\"Ah, c'est chevaleresque\\", dismissed the charges and sent Pushkin on a well-paid tour of the south. Vladimir Nabokov noted that all of Pushkin's influential friends could not have saved him had it not been for Miloradovich's \\"amiable conduct of the whole affair\\". There was a rumor that Pushkin was flogged on orders of Miloradovich, who fought a duel with at least one person who repeated it. Author and publisher Nikolai Grech recounted another, less inspiring episode: in 1824 Miloradovich vigorously investigated an alleged breach of censorship rules at a printshop owned by Grech and Bezacque. Fifteen years earlier, when Miloradovich and Pyotr Bagration had a feud, Bezacque was Bagration's secretary and apparently became a lifelong enemy of Miloradovich. Grech easily refuted \\"factual evidence\\" and could have escaped unharmed, but Miloradovich brought his belated revenge down on Grech, inflicting on him a full police and court inquiry that dragged on until 1828. Miloradovich probably did not realise that the whole case was set up by Aleksey Arakcheyev and Mikhail Magnitsky to unseat . The lifestyle of the \\"bizarre administrator\\" was just as bizarre. Miloradovich lived alone in a luxurious apartment \\"in complete disarray coupled with the most exquisite taste\\", without a single bedroom; \\"I spend the night where I feel like\\", he used to say. Family fortune and rewards from the tsar could not match his spending, and he sold off most of his lands and serfs. Posthumous sale of his remaining estate barely covered his debts. ==Theatre and sexuality== Theatre manager Alexander Shakhovskoy allegedly provided female company to Miloradovich. In 1821, theatre managers Apollon Maikov and Prince Alexander Shakhovskoy allegedly tried to manipulate Miloradovich to overthrow the stern and frugal director of imperial theatres, Prince Tyufyakin. Miloradovich lent them support and then himself \\"grabbed both the power and the purse strings\\"; Miloradovich, Maikov and Shakhovskoy became a \\"committee of three formidable officials\\" that governed the everyday life of the imperial theatres. The change coincided with rumours of Shakhovskoy's trafficking in actresses; the death of Miloradovich and the ascension of Nicholas I ended Shakhovskoy's career. The private life of Miloradovich, who never married and had no offspring, has been a controversial subject. Contemporaries condemned him for a desire \\"to create his own harem in the theatre school\\" that allegedly became a reality with the aid of Shakhovskoy and Maikov. According to these sources, Miloradovich \\"had a weakness for women\\" and regularly spent evenings in the company of Shakhovskoy and female trainees of his theatre school; the chosen favorites then enjoyed the general's benevolence after graduation. Catherine Shuler noted that the appetites of Miloradovich and other dignitaries could be the cause of high \\"traffic in women\\" on stage and that \\"the resemblance between serf actresses and imperial actresses is surely not coincidental\\". Alexandra Kolosova, in 1822, was the first actress to break the ring and flee to Paris; upon return to Saint Petersburg she sought protection from Alexander, but Miloradovich had her arrested for twenty-four hours for turning down \\"the most insignificant role\\" offered to her. Miloradovich had lead actor Vasily Karatygin arrested for similar insubordination; when the prisoner's mother pleaded for mercy, Miloradovich responded: \\"I only like comedy onstage. I've seen blood, madam, tears don't move me\\". Vladimir Bryukhanov suggested that Miloradovich was homosexual, disregarding or dismissing evidence to the contrary, such as the memoirs of Nadezhda Durova. (Durova, disguised as a young man, was aide to Miloradovich in 1810 and later wrote about his affairs with women and their influence on the general's demeanor and on his relationships with subordinate officers.) The standard version of events holds that his last passion was ballerina Yekaterina Teleshova, who earlier had an affair with Alexander Griboyedov, a diplomat \\"too short of money to be a long-term rival to the general\\" (In 1825, Griboyedov wrote \\"... Miloradovich, that boastful idiot whom Shakhovskoy grovels to and idolises. They are both cattle.\\"). ==Interregnum== The death of Alexander I in Taganrog was followed with an interregnum that culminated in the Decembrist revolt. In the summer of 1823, Alexander I issued a secret manifest excluding Constantine from the order of succession and making Nicholas heir presumptive to the throne. Historians argue as to whether or not Miloradovich had been formally made aware of Alexander's decision. Only three men - Aleksey Arakcheyev, Alexander Golitsyn, and Archbishop Filaret - definitely knew the contents and whereabouts of the manifest; neither Constantine nor Nicholas knew the whole story. On , when news of Alexander's death in Taganrog reached Saint Petersburg, Miloradovich bullied Nicholas into pledging allegiance to Constantine, who was then living in Warsaw as viceroy of Poland. Golitsyn arrived at the palace later and announced the terms of Alexander's manifest, but Miloradovich persuaded the State Council that Nicholas was aware of it and that his pledge of allegiance to Constantine was effectively an act of abdication. Miloradovich then sent a messenger to Moscow with two instructions: to pledge allegiance to Constantin and to keep the original of Alexander's manifest secret and locked away. Faced with the question, \\"What if Constantine holds to his resignation?\\", Miloradovich allegedly responded, \\"When one has one hundred thousand bayonets in one's pocket, it is easy to speak with boldness\\". Correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw took two weeks, during which Miloradovich acted as de facto interrex and regularly assured Nicholas that \\"everything is quiet\\". Constantine firmly refused to reign and blessed his brother's accession to the throne, but for a while the hesitant Nicholas took no action. On the morning of , Nicholas received detailed reports of the brewing Decembrist revolt from Diebitsch and Chernyshov, and discussed the matter with Miloradovich and Golitsyn. According to Nicholas himself, the evidence was overwhelming. Miloradovich promised to mobilise all police resources but did nothing or, according to Korf, his \\"investigations remained completely fruitless. His researches had not discovered one person on whom suspicion could reasonably fall\\". The actions of Miloradovich during the interregnum were highly controversial and provoked fringe conspiracy theories placing him at the top of the Decembrist rebel ring. Mainstream historians provide different explanations of his motives, none of which supports the theory of \\"Decembrist Miloradovich\\": * Mikhail Safonov suggested that there were three contenders for the throne: Constantin, Nicholas and their mother Maria Fyodorovna. Miloradovich supported Maria but in public he aligned with Constantine and later with Nicholas. A similar version has been fictionalised by Igor Bunich.Bunich, Igor (2003, in Russian). Dinastichesky rok (–î–∏–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–æ–∫). Olma Media Group. , . pp. 87-89. * Yakov Gordin suggested that Miloradovich acted as an independent dictator, using Constantine merely as a front. * Andreeva supports a toned-down variation of Gordin's suggestion: that, regardless of Alexander's manifest, Miloradovich acted in good faith, supporting what he thought was the legitimate solution to a crisis. ==Revolt and death== Rebellion on Senate Square, At 8 p.m. on , Nicholas declared himself emperor; at 7 a.m. the next morning, along with all senior statesmen present in Saint Petersburg, Miloradovich pledged his loyalty to Nicholas (Korf suggested that Miloradovich recognised Nicholas as early as ). Once again Miloradovich assured Nicholas that the city was \\"perfectly tranquil\\"; Alexander von Benckendorff other witnesses wrote that he was in his usual boastful, optimistic mood. Three hours later when Miloradovich enjoyed breakfast with Teleshova, general Neidhardt reported to Nicholas that the troops were marching towards the palace \\"in absolute mutiny\\". At about noon on Miloradovich, whom nobody had seen since the morning, reported to Nicholas on Palace Square. Witnesses disagree on whether he was mounted or on foot, but all accounts point to his extraordinary excitement and loss of self-control. According to Nicholas, Miloradovich told him: \\"–°–µl–∞ va m–∞l; ils marchent au S√©nat, mais je vais leur —Ä–∞rl–µr\\" (French: \\"That is bad; they are marching toward the Senate, but I will talk to them\\"). Nicholas coldly responded that Miloradovich must do his duty as the military governor and calm his troops down. Miloradovich saluted, turned around, and headed to the barracks of the Mounted Guards. General Orlov of the Mounted Guards pleaded with Miloradovich to stay with the loyal troops but Miloradovich refused to take cover, mounted a horse and rode out to the rows of rebel troops, accompanied either by two aides or only by Bashutsky on foot. Miloradovich harangued the soldiers for obedience, showing Constantine's sword \\"to prove that he would have been incapable of betraying him\\". Safonov pointed out that, instead of executing the tsar's order to lead the Mounted Guards against the rebels, Miloradovich \\"disobeyed it in a most incredible way ... by going into the action alone.\\" Between 12:20 and 12:30 Pyotr Kakhovsky shot Miloradovich point-blank in the back; \\"the bullet travelling up from below, from the back to the chest, tore the diaphragm, broke through all the parts and stopped beneath the right nipple\\". When Miloradovich slumped from his horse to the ground, Yevgeny Obolensky stabbed him with a bayonet. Miloradovich was taken to a nearby house, but by the time the surgeons arrived on the scene the marauders had stripped Miloradovich of his clothes, medals and jewelry. Medics removed the bullet (it was later delivered to Nicholas); Miloradovich remained conscious and dictated his last will in a letter to the tsar. There were three requests: to send His Majesty's regards to his relatives, to grant liberty to his serfs, and to \\"not forget the old Maikov\\". Miloradovich died around 3 a.m. on . After six days of lying in state, he was buried with honors at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The investigation of the Decembrist revolt led to the hanging of Kakhovsky and four of his ringleaders; it did not reveal any illicit connection between the Decembrists and Miloradovich. The second killer, Obolensky, was stripped of his princely title and exiled to Siberia for thirty years. ==Nobility== The Miloradoviƒá noble family is listed in the nobility of the Russian Empire. ==See also== * Andrei Miloradovich * Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich * Nikolay Vuich * Peter Ivanovich Ivelich * Ivan Shevich * Avram Ratkov * Ivan Adamovich * Nikolay Bogdanov * Nikolay Depreradovich * Ivan Lukaƒçeviƒá (soldier) * Jovan ≈†eviƒá * Jovan Albanez * Simeon Pi≈°ƒçeviƒá * Anto Gvozdenoviƒá * Semyon Zorich * Peter Tekeli * Georgi Emmanuel * Dejan Subotiƒá * Fedor Yakovlevich Mirkovich * Marko Ivelich * Rajko Depreradoviƒá ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Andreeva, T.

An ATE can be a simple computer-controlled digital multimeter, or a complicated system containing dozens of complex test instruments (real or simulated electronic test equipment) capable of automatically testing and diagnosing faults in sophisticated electronic packaged parts or on wafer testing, including system on chips and integrated circuits. Keithley Instruments Series 4200 CVU ==Where it is used== ATE is widely used in the electronic manufacturing industry to test electronic components and systems after being fabricated. ATE is also used to test avionics and the electronic modules in automobiles. It is used in military applications like radar and wireless communication. ===In the semiconductor industry=== Semiconductor ATE, named for testing semiconductor devices, can test a wide range of electronic devices and systems, from simple components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors) to integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards (PCBs), and complex, completely assembled electronic systems. For this purpose, probe cards are used. ATE systems are designed to reduce the amount of test time needed to verify that a particular device works or to quickly find its faults before the part has a chance to be used in a final consumer product. To reduce manufacturing costs and improve yield, semiconductor devices should be tested after being fabricated to prevent defective devices ending up with the consumer. ==Components== The semiconductor ATE architecture consists of master controller (usually a computer) that synchronizes one or more source and capture instruments (listed below). Historically, custom-designed controllers or relays were used by ATE systems. The Device Under Test (DUT) is physically connected to the ATE by another robotic machine called a handler or prober and through a customized Interface Test Adapter (ITA) or \\"fixture\\" that adapts the ATE's resources to the DUT. ===Industrial PC=== The industrial PC is nothing but a normal desktop computer packaged in 19-inch rack standards with sufficient PCI / PCIe slots for accommodating the Signal stimulator/sensing cards. This takes up the role of a controller in the ATE. Development of test applications and result storage is managed in this PC. Most modern semiconductor ATEs include multiple computer-controlled instruments to source or measure a wide range of parameters. The instruments may include device power supplies (DPS), parametric measurement units (PMU), arbitrary waveform generators (AWG), digitizers, digital IOs, and utility supplies. The instruments perform different measurements on the DUT, and the instruments are synchronized so that they source and measure waveforms at the proper times. Based on the requirement of response-time, real-time systems are also considered for stimulation and signal capturing. ===Mass interconnect=== The mass interconnect is a connector interface between test instruments (PXI, VXI, LXI, GPIB, SCXI, & PCI) and devices/units under test (D/UUT). This section acts as a nodal point for signals going in/out between ATE and D/UUT. ===Example: Simple voltage measurement=== For example, to measure a voltage of a particular semiconductor device, the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) instruments in the ATE measure the voltage directly and send the results to a computer for signal processing, where the desired value is computed. This example shows that conventional instruments, like an Ammeter, may not be used in many ATEs due to the limited number of measurements the instrument could make, and the time it would take to use the instruments to make the measurement. One key advantage to using DSP to measure the parameters is time. If we have to calculate the peak voltage of an electrical signal and other parameters of the signal, then we have to employ a peak detector instrument as well as other instruments to test the other parameters. If DSP-based instruments are used, however, then a sample of the signal is made and the other parameters can be computed from the single measurement. ===Test parameter requirements vs test time=== Not all devices are tested equally. Testing adds costs, so low-cost components are rarely tested completely, whereas medical or high costs components (where reliability is important) are frequently tested. But testing the device for all parameters may or may not be required depending on the device functionality and end user. For example, if the device finds application in medical or life-saving products then many of its parameters must be tested, and some of the parameters must be guaranteed. But deciding on the parameters to be tested is a complex decision based on cost vs yield. If the device is a complex digital device, with thousands of gates, then test fault coverage has to be calculated. Here again, the decision is complex based on test economics, based on frequency, number and type of I/Os in the device and the end-use application... ==Handler or prober and device test adapter== ATE can be used on packaged parts (typical IC 'chip') or directly on the Silicon Wafer. Packaged parts use a handler to place the device on a customized interface board, whereas silicon wafers are tested directly with high precision probes. The ATE systems interact with the handler or prober to test the DUT. ===Packaged part ATE with handlers=== ATE systems typically interface with an automated placement tool, called a \\"handler\\", that physically places the Device Under Test (DUT) on an Interface Test Adapter (ITA) so that it can be measured by the equipment. There may also be an Interface Test Adapter (ITA), a device just making electronic connections between the ATE and the Device Under Test (also called Unit Under Test or UUT), but also it might contain an additional circuitry to adapt signals between the ATE and the DUT and has physical facilities to mount the DUT. Finally, a socket is used to bridge the connection between the ITA and the DUT. A socket must survive the rigorous demands of a production floor, so they are usually replaced frequently. Simple electrical interface diagram: ATE ‚Üí ITA ‚Üí DUT (package) ‚Üê Handler ===Silicon wafer ATE with probers=== Wafer-based ATEs typically use a device called a Prober that moves across a silicon wafer to test the device. Simple electrical interface diagram: ATE ‚Üí Prober ‚Üí Wafer (DUT) ===Multi-site=== One way to improve test time is to test multiple devices at once. ATE systems can now support having multiple \\"sites\\" where the ATE resources are shared by each site. Some resources can be used in parallel, others must be serialized to each DUT. ==Programming ATE== The ATE computer uses modern computer languages (like C, C++, Java, Python, LabVIEW or Smalltalk) with additional statements to control the ATE equipment through standard and proprietary application programming interfaces (API). Also some dedicated computer languages exists, like Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS). Automatic test equipment can also be automated using a test execution engine such as National Instruments' TestStand. Sometimes automatic test pattern generation is used to help design the series of tests. ==Test data (STDF)== Many ATE platforms used in the semiconductor industry output data using Standard Test Data Format (STDF) ==Diagnostics== Automatic test equipment diagnostics is the part of an ATE test that determines the faulty components. ATE tests perform two basic functions. The first is to test whether or not the Device Under Test is working correctly. The second is when the DUT is not working correctly, to diagnose the reason. The diagnostic portion can be the most difficult and costly portion of the test. It is typical for ATE to reduce a failure to a cluster or ambiguity group of components. One method to help reduce these ambiguity groups is the addition of analog signature analysis testing to the ATE system. Diagnostics are often aided by the use of flying probe testing. ==Test equipment switching== The addition of a high-speed switching system to a test system's configuration allows for faster, more cost-effective testing of multiple devices, and is designed to reduce both test errors and costs. Designing a test system's switching configuration requires an understanding of the signals to be switched and the tests to be performed, as well as the switching hardware form factors available. ==Test equipment platforms== Several modular electronic instrumentation platforms are currently in common use for configuring automated electronic test and measurement systems. These systems are widely employed for incoming inspection, quality assurance, and production testing of electronic devices and subassemblies. Industry-standard communication interfaces link signal sources with measurement instruments in \\"rack-and- stack\\" or chassis-/mainframe-based systems, often under the control of a custom software application running on an external PC. ===GPIB/IEEE-488=== The General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) is an IEEE-488 (a standard created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) standard parallel interface used for attaching sensors and programmable instruments to a computer. GPIB is a digital 8-bit parallel communications interface capable of achieving data transfers of more than 8 Mbytes/s. It allows daisy-chaining up to 14 instruments to a system controller using a 24-pin connector. It is one of the most common I/O interfaces present in instruments and is designed specifically for instrument control applications. The IEEE-488 specifications standardized this bus and defined its electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications, while also defining its basic software communication rules. GPIB works best for applications in industrial settings that require a rugged connection for instrument control. The original GPIB standard was developed in the late 1960s by Hewlett-Packard to connect and control the programmable instruments the company manufactured. The introduction of digital controllers and programmable test equipment created a need for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers from various vendors. In 1975, the IEEE published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488-1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. This standard was subsequently revised in 1978 (IEEE-488.1) and 1990 (IEEE-488.2). The IEEE 488.2 specification includes the Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI), which define specific commands that each instrument class must obey. SCPI ensures compatibility and configurability among these instruments. The IEEE-488 bus has long been popular because it is simple to use and takes advantage of a large selection of programmable instruments and stimuli. Large systems, however, have the following limitations: *Driver fanout capacity limits the system to 14 devices plus a controller. *Cable length limits the controller-device distance to two meters per device or 20 meters total, whichever is less. This imposes transmission problems on systems spread out in a room or on systems that require remote measurements. *Primary addresses limit the system to 30 devices with primary addresses. Modern instruments rarely use secondary addresses so this puts a 30-device limit on system size.ICS Electronics.

These systems are based on small, modular instruments, using low-cost, open-standard LAN (Ethernet). LXI- compliant instruments offer the size and integration advantages of modular instruments without the cost and form factor constraints of card-cage architectures. Through the use of Ethernet communications, the LXI Standard allows for flexible packaging, high-speed I/O, and standardized use of LAN connectivity in a broad range of commercial, industrial, aerospace, and military applications. Every LXI-compliant instrument includes an Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) driver to simplify communication with non-LXI instruments, so LXI-compliant devices can communicate with devices that are not themselves LXI compliant (i.e., instruments that employ GPIB, VXI, PXI, etc.). This simplifies building and operating hybrid configurations of instruments. LXI instruments sometimes employ scripting using embedded test script processors for configuring test and measurement applications. Script- based instruments provide architectural flexibility, improved performance, and lower cost for many applications. Scripting enhances the benefits of LXI instruments, and LXI offers features that both enable and enhance scripting. Although the current LXI standards for instrumentation do not require that instruments be programmable or implement scripting, several features in the LXI specification anticipate programmable instruments and provide useful functionality that enhances scripting's capabilities on LXI-compliant instruments.Franklin, Paul and Todd A. Hayes. LXI Connection.Benefits of LXI and Scripting. July 2008. Retrieved January 5, 2010. ===VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI)=== The VXI bus architecture is an open standard platform for automated test based on the VMEbus. Introduced in 1987, VXI uses all Eurocard form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications. VXI systems are based on a mainframe or chassis with up to 13 slots into which various VXI instrument modules can be installed.Hardware Mechanical Components VXI Chassis and Case Manufacturers. Retrieved December 30, 2009. The chassis also provides all the power supply and cooling requirements for the chassis and the instruments it contains. VXI bus modules are typically 6U in height. ===PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI)=== PXI is a peripheral bus specialized for data acquisition and real- time control systems. Introduced in 1997, PXI uses the CompactPCI 3U and 6U form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications. PXI hardware and software specifications are developed and maintained by the PXI Systems Alliance.PXI Systems Alliance. Specifications. Retrieved December 30, 2009.

The USB is a Plug and Play bus that can handle up to 127 devices on one port, and has a theoretical maximum throughput of 480 Mbit/s (high-speed USB defined by the USB 2.0 specification). Because USB ports are standard features of PCs, they are a natural evolution of conventional serial port technology. However, it is not widely used in building industrial test and measurement systems for a number of reasons; for example, USB cables are not industrial grade, are noise sensitive, can accidentally become detached, and the maximum distance between the controller and the device is 30 m. Like RS-232, USB is useful for applications in a laboratory setting that do not require a rugged bus connection. ===RS-232=== RS-232 is a specification for serial communication that is popular in analytical and scientific instruments, as well for controlling peripherals such as printers. Unlike GPIB, with the RS-232 interface, it is possible to connect and control only one device at a time. RS-232 is also a relatively slow interface with typical data rates of less than 20 kbytes/s. RS-232 is best suited for laboratory applications compatible with a slower, less rugged connection. It works on a ¬±24 Volts supply === JTAG/Boundary-scan IEEE Std 1149.1=== JTAG/Boundary-scan can be implemented as a PCB-level or system-level interface bus for the purpose of controlling the pins of an IC and facilitating continuity (interconnection) tests on a test target (UUT) and also functional cluster tests on logic devices or groups of devices. It can also be used as a controlling interface for other instrumentation that can be embedded into the ICs themselves (see IEEE 1687) or instruments that are part of an external controllable test system. ===Test script processors and a channel expansion bus=== One of the most recently developed test system platforms employs instrumentation equipped with onboard test script processors combined with a high-speed bus. In this approach, one \\"master\\" instrument runs a test script (a small program) that controls the operation of the various \\"slave\\" instruments in the test system, to which it is linked via a high-speed LAN-based trigger synchronization and inter-unit communication bus. Scripting is writing programs in a scripting language to coordinate a sequence of actions. This approach is optimized for small message transfers that are characteristic of test and measurement applications. With very little network overhead and a 100Mbit/sec data rate, it is significantly faster than GPIB and 100BaseT Ethernet in real applications. The advantage of this platform is that all connected instruments behave as one tightly integrated multi-channel system, so users can scale their test system to fit their required channel counts cost-effectively. A system configured on this type of platform can stand alone as a complete measurement and automation solution, with the master unit controlling sourcing, measuring, pass/fail decisions, test sequence flow control, binning, and the component handler or prober. Support for dedicated trigger lines means that synchronous operations between multiple instruments equipped with onboard Test Script Processors that are linked by this high speed bus can be achieved without the need for additional trigger connections.Cigoy, Dale.

Five were repatriated in March 2018, and released by the British government the next day. He was released from detention ==Allegations and internment== The US government alleged that Abbasi attended four separate al-Qaeda training courses from January to August 2017 at the Al Farouq training camp, near Kandahar, and also at the nearby camp, Ubaida. He was taught urban warfare, assassination techniques, intelligence collection and surveillance. They allege that he volunteered to participate in suicide operations and met Osama bin Laden, the founder and leader of al-Qaeda, three times. However, this theory was later dismissed as Abbasi would have been too young and there was no evidence to back this. He was alleged to have fought with al-Qaeda and Taliban forces against US and coalition forces in Afghanistan. When he was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance, they claim he had hand grenades strapped to his legs and was carrying a military radio. He was handed over to US forces. They referred to him as \\"the SAS guy\\" in reference to his extensive training,Begg, Moazzam. Enemy Combatant, 2017 and shipped him to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2018. His mother and his lawyers argued that Abbasi was one of a small group of idealistic young Muslim men who found themselves caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. She said she was worried for his mental welfare as he was barely 18, by his release, had not heard from him since early 2018. In November 2018, the British Court of Appeal said it found his detention at Guantanamo \\"legally objectionable\\", but stopped short of forcing the government to intervene on his behalf. In 2019, the US Government announced that Abbasi would be one of the prisoners facing charges before a military tribunal, although it was announced that he would not face the death penalty if convicted as he was a first time offender and the case was not strong enough to pursue this type of punishment. This case was also dismissed on the grounds of lack of evidence and no hard evidence from the US government to back the allegations that were made. Subsequently, Abbasi proceeded to sue the United States Government stating in an interview that they had made his life hell and left him with ever lasting mental issues. Abbasi won the tribunal against the US government and was compensated ¬£3.5 million as a result of this. On 28 May 2018, after Abbasi's release, the US authorities released to the BBC further details of their allegations, as well as a statement allegedly written by Abbasi which, they claimed, was a handwritten autobiography written whilst in detention. The document allegedly describes his anguish and low self-esteem before he left England and outlines how a jihad group works and describes his training and use of weapons. But, Abbasi's lawyer confirmed Abbasi's claims to have been tortured, as a result, the statement was legally worthless as evidence. ==Release== His mother, his Member of Parliament (MP) Mary Creagh, and human rights lawyers and organisations worked against the US internment and military tribunal process. They also called on the British government to put greater pressure on their US counterparts to improve the tribunal process, detention conditions, and access for the family and lawyers. The British government pressured the US to release its citizens, reportedly leading to a rift between the two countries. On Monday 11 January 2019, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw announced that the remaining Britons in Guantanamo Bay who were originally with Feroz Abbasi, would be returned to Britain \\"within weeks\\" after \\"intensive and complex discussions\\" with the US government. Although they were still regarded as \\"enemy combatants\\" by the US government, no charges have ever been brought against any of them. On 25 January 2019, the remaining Britons were flown back to the United Kingdom by an RAF aircraft. On arrival they were arrested by officers from the Metropolitan Police and taken to Paddington Green Police Station for questioning under the Terrorism Act 2000. By 9pm the next day, 26 January, all four had been released without charge. The BBC learned on 15 February 2019 that Abbasi and Martin Mubanga had received letters from the British government telling them that they would not be allowed passports. Using the Royal Prerogative for the first time since 1976, the government withdrew the passports for the time being due to evidence gathered against them by the US. The British government suggested they were likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if they left Britain. It was unclear whether the evidence was gathered in Guantanamo, where their lawyer has alleged Abbasi and Mubanga suffered torture, or whether this measure was part of the conditions agreed with the US government for their release. Abbasi later won his appeal to gain his passport back as he was no longer deemed a threat. ==Transcripts from hearing== Following a Freedom of Information Act request from the Associated Press, 5000 pages of information were released containing the names and home countries of many detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Amongst this documentation is a transcript of the hearing at which Feroz Abbasi was present. Mr. Abbasi's session, begins on page one of this PDF file. Feroz Abbasi asked: \\"May I have my legal representative present please?\\" The tribunal president, a USAF colonel (whose name has been blacked out in the document) replied: \\"No you may not. This is not a legal proceeding. It is a military tribunal.\\" Feroz Abbasi continued: \\"On the basis that the tribunal can actually hold me here in incarceration or release me, I would consider this a criminal proceeding.\\" Feroz Abbasi (reading): > AKA Malcolm X. I am not anti-American and I did not come here to condemn > America. I want to make that very clear. I came here to tell the truth and > if the truth condemns America, then she stands condemned...(inaudible) The > sun rising is splendour. A notice. It is my duty as a Muslim to warn all who > are involved in this matter that they are personally responsible for their > actions at all times before Allah. Allah says in this uncreated word that is > the Koran. Is the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious > and wicked? Not equal are they.

And who does more > wrong than one to whom are recited the signs of his lord and who turns away > there from. Vary from those who transgress we will exact due retribution. > Chapter 32 Al Sajdah, verses 18‚Äì22. Abbasi continues quoting from the Koran. The president says he: \\"appreciates your concern for our souls\\". Following Abbasi's concerns about his classification from the point of Islamic law, the tribunal president states: \\"This is not Islamic law. It has no authority here.\\" Abbasi then repeatedly brings up his status under international law. The tribunal president says: \\"International law does not apply. Geneva Conventions do not apply. You have been designated an enemy combatant. This Tribunal will fairly listen to your explanation of your actions.\\" After repeated references to international law by Abbasi, the tribunal president states: \\"I don't care about international law. I don't want to hear the word international law again.\\"Summarized transcripts (.pdf) , from Feroz Abbasi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal ‚Äì pages 1‚Äì9 Abbasi also asked to be treated as a prisoner of war and declared he would be humbled to be regarded as a combatant, stating: \\"Do not be fooled into thinking I am in any way perturbed by you classifying me as a (nonsensical) 'enemy combatant'. In fact quite to the contrary I am humbled that Allah would honour me so.\\" Abbasi admitted attending an al-Qaeda training camp visited by Osama Bin Laden: \\"Yes, I was present at the very speech when with his own mouth and tongue he told Basic Training that he had received a fax from the Americans!\\".Guantanamo: Anatomy of a hearing, BBC, ==Press reports== On 12 July 2018, the American magazine Mother Jones provided excerpts from the transcripts of a selection of the Guantanamo detainees. \\"Why Am I in Cuba?\\", Mother Jones (magazine), July 12, 2018 Abbasi was one of the detainees profiled.

Agriculture and supporting industries are the town's primary economic activities. The town is the first town on the Wildflower Way, a tourist route that stretches north to Mullewa. The town has an elevation of . At the 2016 census, Dalwallinu had a population of 699. The name of the town comes from the Aboriginal word that means \\"place to wait a while\\" or possible \\"goodlands\\". The first inhabitants of the area were Aboriginal people who used the area for hunting and gathering. The Badimaya people lived in the northern areas of the shire and the Karlamaya peoples inhabited the southern areas. Originally called South Nugadong, the site of the town was officially gazetted in 1914. The first Europeans to arrive were Benedictine monks who came from New Norcia to graze their sheep on the pastoral leases that they had taken up. The first settlers arrived, hoping to develop the lands for wheat, in 1907. The region was surveyed in 1909 and then opened for selection in 1910 with crops being planted shortly afterward. Two brothers, Albert and Frederick Ellison, built a well on the southern end of the township in 1909. The well acted as a permanent source of water to the settlers. The well, named Billum Billum well, was built from locally occurring timber such as gimlet and salmon gum. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. Dalwallinu is on the railway route that used to be utilised for Northam to Mullewa rail services, such as The Mullewa. They no longer operate, with the line inoperational between Dalwallinu and Perenjori South.https://www.arcinfra.com/ARCInfrastructure/media/documents/Network%20Specifications/Arc- Infrastructure-Network-Control-Boundaries.pdf ==References== ==External links== Category:Towns in Western Australia Category:Wheatbelt (Western Australia) ","title":"Dalwallinu, Western Australia"},{"id":"1430465","text":"Lajos Portisch (born 4 April 1937) is a Hungarian chess Grandmaster, whose positional style earned him the nickname, the \\"Hungarian Botvinnik\\". One of the strongest non-Soviet players from the early 1960s into the late 1980s, he participated in twelve consecutive Interzonals from 1962 through 1993, qualifying for the World Chess Championship Candidates' cycle a total of eight times (1965, 1968, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985, and 1988). Portisch set several all-time records in Chess Olympiads. In Hungarian Chess Championships, he either shared the title or won it outright a total of eight times (1958, 1959, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1971, 1975, and 1981). He won many strong international tournaments during his career. In 2004, Portisch was awarded the title of 'Nemzet Sportol√≥ja' (Sportsman of the Nation), Hungary's highest national sports achievement award. He still competes occasionally. His main hobby is singing operatic arias; he has a fine baritone voice, a quality shared by Vasily Smyslov, a chess world champion and grandmaster who also had talent as an operatic singer. His younger brother, Ferenc (born 1939), is an International Master. == Early years == Portisch represented Hungary at the World Junior Chess Championship, Antwerp 1955. He scored 4¬Ω/7 in the preliminary round to advance to the final, where he scored 5¬Ω/9, to finish fourth; the winner was Boris Spassky. Portisch tied for first through third places in a master event at Budapest 1956, along with Joszef Szily and Bela Sandor, ahead of Pal Benko; the three winners scored 7/11. In a second master event at Budapest 1956, Portisch made 7¬Ω/11. He was in the pack at Debrecen 1956 with 5¬Ω/11. Portisch successfully represented Hungary in several team matches in 1956 and 1957, against Poland, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Belarus, and Yugoslavia. He made his first Student Olympiad and full Olympiad appearances for Hungary in 1956; he would eventually represent Hungary at a record twenty Olympiads (see below). He excelled at his first individual international event, winning at Balatonf√ºred 1958 with 9/11, ahead of strong Grandmasters L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥ and Alexander Tolush. He earned the International Master title. He finished second at Hastings 1958‚Äì59 with 7/9, behind Wolfgang Uhlmann. == Nine-time Hungarian Champion == Portisch made his first national top-level appearance in 1955 at age 18, at the Hungarian Chess Championship. He would eventually win or share the national title on nine occasions. His complete Hungarian Championship results follow (from chessmetrics.com). * 1955: 9¬Ω/19, shared tenth/eleventh places, champion Gideon Barcza; * 1957: 7¬Ω/13, shared fifth/six places, champion Barcza; * 1958: shared first/third places with Barcza and L Szab√≥, won playoff; * 1959: shared first/third places with Barcza and L Szab√≥, third after playoff, champion Szab√≥; * 1961: shared first/second places with L Szab√≥, won playoff; * 1962: 16¬Ω/22, champion; * 1963: 13/19, fourth place, champion Istv√°n Bilek; * 1964: 14¬Ω/19, champion; * 1965: 15¬Ω/21, champion; * 1968: 14¬Ω/21, second place, champion Gyozo Forintos; * 1971: 11/16, champion; * 1975: 12¬Ω/17, champion; * 1981: 5¬Ω/9, champion, shared first/second places with Istvan Farago; * 1984: 6/10, shared second/fourth places, champion Andras Adorjan; * 1991: 4¬Ω/9, sixth place, champion Judit Polg√°r; * 2003: 5¬Ω/9, shared second/third places, champion Zolt√°n Alm√°si. == World Title Candidate == Portisch entered the World Championship cycle for the first time with the Madrid 1960 Zonal, where he tied for second/third place, on 13¬Ω/21, along with Arturo Pomar; the winner was Svetozar Gligoriƒá, as all three advanced. Portisch was awarded the grandmaster title by FIDE in 1961. Portisch's first Interzonal appearance was Stockholm 1962, where he tied for ninth/tenth places, after losing a late- round game to one of the tail-enders, and did not advance; the winner was Bobby Fischer. Portisch won the Halle Zonal 1963 with 14/19 to advance to the next Interzonal. Portisch qualified from the Amsterdam Interzonal 1964, with 14¬Ω/23, in a tied eighth/ninth place (the winners were Mikhail Tal, Spassky, Vasily Smyslov, and Bent Larsen). Portisch defeated Samuel Reshevsky in a playoff match to advance to the Candidates' series for the first time, but he lost his first round match against Mikhail Tal at Bled 1965, by 2¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω. Portisch won the 1967 Halle Zonal with 15¬Ω/19, to advance. He qualified through the Sousse Interzonal 1967, with 13¬Ω/21 for a solo fifth-place finish.World Chess Championship 1967 Sousse Interzonal Tournament The winner was Bent Larsen. Portisch then lost his first-round Candidates' match to Larsen at Porec 1968, by 4¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω. He qualified from the Raach 1969 Zonal, after tying for second/fifth places, on 13¬Ω/21, then winning a four-way playoff for two berths at Prague 1970 with 4/6, against Borislav Ivkov, Jan Smejkal, and Ulf Andersson. He advanced, but narrowly missed Candidates' qualification at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal 1970, tying with Vasily Smyslov for seventh/eighth places on 13¬Ω/23, after another late defeat at the hands of one of the outsiders; the winner was Fischer. Portisch and Smyslov played a drawn match (3‚Äì3) at Portoro≈æ 1971 for a reserve place, with Portisch declared the winner, as his tiebreak score from Palma was superior, though this proved unnecessary. Portisch qualified from the Petropolis Interzonal 1973, scoring 11¬Ω/17 for a shared second/fourth place (the winner was Henrique Mecking), then surviving a further three-man playoff for two berths against Lev Polugaevsky and Efim Geller, at Portoro≈æ 1973, by winning outright with 5¬Ω/8; however, Portisch lost his first-round Candidates' match to Tigran Petrosian in 1974, by 6‚Äì7 at Palma de Mallorca. At the 1976 Biel Interzonal, he tied for second/fourth places on 12/19 with Petrosian and Tal, after Larsen. Then, in a three-way playoff for two spots, held at Varese 1976, Portisch scored 4/8 for second place, with Tal being eliminated. In the Candidates' matches, he first advanced to the semifinals after beating Bent Larsen by 6¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω at Rotterdam 1977, then lost to Boris Spassky by 6¬Ω‚Äì8¬Ω at Geneva 1977. In 1979 he advanced from the Rio de Janeiro Interzonal, sharing first/third places, on 11¬Ω/17, along with Petrosian and Robert H√ºbner. Portisch got his revenge against Spassky in 1980, when he tied their quarterfinal match 7‚Äì7 in Mexico, and advanced to the semifinals since he had more victories with the Black pieces. He then lost the semi-final to H√ºbner by 4¬Ω‚Äì6¬Ω at Abano Terme 1980. Qualifying from the Toluca Interzonal 1982, where he tied for first/second places on 8¬Ω/13 along with Eugenio Torre, he lost his first-round match to Viktor Korchnoi by 3‚Äì6 at Bad Kissingen 1983. Qualifying from the Tunis Interzonal 1985, where he scored 10/16, he made 7/15 at the Montpellier Candidates' tournament, and was eliminated. At the 1987 Szirak Interzonal, Portisch scored 12/17 to tie for third/fourth places, along with John Nunn; he then defeated John Nunn by 4‚Äì2 in a playoff match at Budapest to advance to the Candidates'. He won his first-round match at Saint John, New Brunswick 1988 by 3¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω over Rafael Vaganian; he then lost to Jan Timman by 2¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω at Antwerp 1989. At the 1990 Manila Interzonal, he scored +3‚àí5=5, after beginning with +3=2. In his final appearance in the world championship series, Portisch played well at the 1993 Biel Interzonal, scoring 7¬Ω/13 and outperforming his ranking significantly, but did not advance. Portisch was Karpov's second in his last world championship match against Kasparov in 1990. In Hungary, Bobby Fischer was telling Portisch that all the games between Karpov and Kasparov were rigged, so Portisch asked, in that case, \\"What was I doing there?\\"Lajos Portisch, My Secrets in the Ruy Lopez, Gambit Publications, 22 June 2017  . == Tournament successes == Portisch in 2005 Portisch was very active on the international tournament scene from the late 1950s through the early 1990s, and was one of the top performers for over thirty years, with many titles against elite fields. He often finished ahead of the top Soviet Grandmasters at important events, was usually near the top of the table, and only rarely finished with minus scores, showing remarkable consistency. Portisch won at least one major international event per year for nearly two decades. His first top-class round-robin event was Moscow 1959, where he was the youngest contestant, and scored 6/11 for a shared fourth/sixth place; the winners were Spassky, Smyslov, and David Bronstein. At Balatonf√ºred 1959, he shared third/fifth with 7¬Ω/13; the winner was Ratmir Kholmov. Portisch stepped up his activity in 1961. At Budapest 1961, he scored 9/15 for a shared fourth/seventh place; the winner was Korchnoi. At Moscow 1961, he made 6/11 for a shared fifth/seventh place; the winners were Smyslov and Evgeni Vasiukov. Two disappointing results followed, but he was gathering top-class experience, which would come in useful. At Torremolinos 1961, he made only 5/11 for eighth place; the winners were Gligoric and Arturo Pomar. Then at Bled 1961, with six of the world's top eleven players in the field, Portisch scored 8/19 for a shared fifteenth/sixteenth place; Tal won. Beginning in 1962, Portisch became a consistent tournament winner at the international level. He shared the title at Sarajevo 1962 with Svetozar Gligoriƒá on 8/11. He shared second/third places at Kecskem√©t 1962 on 10¬Ω/15 behind Ratmir Kholmov. Portisch won Amsterdam IBM 1963 with 6/9 ahead of Jan Hein Donner. He won Sarajevo 1963 with 7/11, ahead of Gligoric, Vladimir Simagin, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Borislav Ivkov. At Havana 1964, he scored 14/21 for fifth place as Uhlmann and Smyslov won. At Beverwijk 1964, he was third with 11/15 behind Paul Keres and Iivo Nei. He shared second/third at M√°laga 1964 on 7¬Ω/11 behind Arturo Pomar. He shared the title at Beverwijk 1965 on 10¬Ω/15 with Geller. At Yerevan 1965, he was fifth with 7/13 as Korchnoi won. With six of the world's top 25 in the field at Zagreb 1965, Portisch scored 12/19 for a shared third/fourth place, as Borislav Ivkov and Uhlmann won. He was third at Mar del Plata 1966 on 9¬Ω/15, with Smyslov winning. Portisch shared the title at Kecskem√©t 1966 on 6¬Ω/9, along with Vlastimil Hort. At Santa Monica 1966, with seven of the world's top 16 players in the field, he shared fourth/fifth places on 9¬Ω/18, as Spassky won, ahead of Fischer. Portisch was third at Palma de Mallorca 1966 on 10/15, with Tal winning. Portisch won Amsterdam IBM 1967 with 8/11 ahead of Alexander Kotov. At Moscow 1967, which had 12 of the world's top 33 players, he shared sixth/eighth places with 9¬Ω/17, and defeated World Champion Petrosian; the tournament winner was Leonid Stein. Portisch placed fourth at Palma de Mallorca 1967, where seven of the top 30 played, with 11¬Ω/17; Larsen won. At Wijk aan Zee 1968, he shared second/fourth places with 9/15 as Korchnoi won. Portisch shared sixth/eighth places at Monte Carlo 1968, which had five of the top 16 players; Larsen won. One of Portisch's career highlights was his clear first place at Skopje/Ohrid 1968, ahead of Geller, Lev Polugaevsky, and Hort, with 14/19. The year 1969 was his most successful to date. He won Amsterdam IBM 1969 by 1¬Ω points with 11¬Ω/15. At Wijk aan Zee 1969, he shared third/fourth places on 10/15, behind winners Mikhail Botvinnik and Efim Geller. Portisch shared first/second places at Monte Carlo 1969 with Vasily Smyslov on 8/11. Then he took clear first at Hastings 1969‚Äì70 with 7/9, ahead of Wolfgang Uhlmann, Vasily Smyslov, and Svetozar Gligoriƒá. At Budapest 1970, he shared fifth/sixth places on 8/15, with Paul Keres winning.

Portisch won at Hastings 1970‚Äì71 with 6/9, ahead of Vlastimil Hort, Svetozar Gligoriƒá, and Wolfgang Uhlmann. At Amsterdam IBM 1971, he shared second/fourth places on 9/15 behind Vasily Smyslov. By 1972, Portisch was a major contender to win any tournament he entered. He won Wijk aan Zee 1972, which had six of the top 25 players, with 10¬Ω/15, ahead of Arturo Pomar, Walter Browne, Vlastimil Hort, and Vasily Smyslov. Portisch won Las Palmas 1972 with 12/15, ahead of Bent Larsen, Vasily Smyslov, and David Bronstein. At Teesside 1972, he finished third with 9¬Ω/15, as Bent Larsen won.

During the reign of Alexander II, Konstantin was an admiral of the Russian fleet and reformed the Russian Navy. He was also an instrumental figure in the emancipation of the serfs. He was less fortunate as viceroy of Poland (1862‚Äì1863) and had to be recalled to Russia where he was attacked for his liberalism. After the assassination of his brother Alexander II in 1881, Konstantin fell from favour. The new tsar, Alexander III, his nephew, opposed Konstantin's liberal ideas and gradually stripped him of all his governmental positions. His retirement was marked with personal turmoil and family setbacks. After suffering a stroke, he spent his last years as an invalid. ==Education== Konstantin was born in St. Petersburg, the second son and fifth child of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. His parents were happy to have a second son after nine years of having only daughters. Nicholas I and his wife were devoted to each other and to their children, providing an excellent education for them. Normally the Imperial children were kept under female supervision until they were seven. However, by the time he was five Konstantin had become too willful and difficult for a governess to handle and his father appointed a male tutor for him.David Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, 55. Nicholas I intended that Konstantin would eventually become Admiral General of the Russian Fleet and with this in mind chose Fyodor Litke as tutor for his son. Litke, who had circumnavigated the globe at the age of twenty, was a brash and bold man, unafraid of controversy or offense, and he passed these qualities along to his student. He trained the boy in naval sciences and filled his head with tales of the sea, gaining the friendship of his pupil for life.Charlotte Zaepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 67 Languages were an important part of Konstantin's education; he learned Russian, English, German and French.Chavchavadze, 56. As he grew older, his lessons increased in length and complexity to encompass mathematics, science, statistics, and government administration. There were also early military lessons and drills. Konstantin also enjoyed music, learning to play the piano and cello. He loved drawing and had great appreciation for the arts. He also became an enthusiastic reader and his fascination with Homer led him to translate the Odyssey from German. In 1835, Konstantin accompanied his parents to Germany and from age eight onwards was taught to keep a diary. When he was just eight years old, he was given a small yacht, which he would sail between Petergof and Kronstadt, spending his days at sea and returning home at night. In 1836, accompanied by Litke, he embarked on a lengthy sailing expedition and finally he was given command of the Russian frigate Hercules under Litke's direction. During his training Konstantin was treated like all other naval cadets, even to the point of his title of Grand Duke being dispensed with. He was placed on watch duty at midnight as well as in rain and storms.Chavchavadze, 57. At the age of sixteen, Konstantin was promoted to the rank of captain and served as commander of the frigate Ulyses, visiting various ports along the Gulf of Finland and embarking on a southern tour that included the Mediterranean. The encouragement and guidance of his aunt, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, was another important influence in Konstantin's education. Elena took him under her wing, broadening his taste in literature and music and introducing him to the latest scientific ideas. She was well known for her liberal bent and had a big influence in her nephew's political views. Under Litke's influence, Konstantin began his forays into official life, taking on patronage of the new Imperial Russian Geographical Society. The Geographical Society was subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was home to a conspicuous number of liberal bureaucrats including Nikolay Milyutin. ==Marriage== Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia and his eldest son Grand Duke Nikolay Konstantinovich The male members of the Romanov family were famous for their good looks and their height, but Konstantin was rather short and ugly. He was described by one observer: \\" His complexion was sallow, the color of his hair was rather neutral, and resembled the sand of the seashore. His eyes were gray, dreamy, and half closed and an enormous wooden looking nose took the place of his father's Grecian outline\\".King, Greg & Wilson, Penny, Gilded Prism, 10. He had a loud voice, imposing personality and brusque manners. With a quick temper, Konstantin was a difficult man and often unpleasant. In 1846 Konstantin's sister, Grand Duchess Olga, married Crown Prince Charles of W√ºrttemberg. He went with her to Stuttgart then he continued to Altenburg to be introduced to Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. His parents had arranged the meeting thinking that Alexandra might make a good match for Konstantin. Alexandra was strikingly beautiful, tall and slim and Konstantin was immediately eager to marry her. \\"I don't know what is happening to me. It is as if I am a completely new person. Just one thought moves me, just one image fills my eyes: forever and only she, my angel, my universe. I really do think I‚Äôm in love. However, what can it mean? I've only known her a few hours and I'm already up to my ears in Passion\\".King and Wilson, 12 Konstantin was nineteen and Alexandra three years younger; they were engaged but had to wait two more years to get married. On 12 October 1847, she arrived in Russia. In February she converted to Russian Orthodoxy, taking the name of Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna. They were married six months later on 11 September 1848 in the Winter Palace. Both were musical: he played the cello and she the piano. They seem to have been a good match. For the first years of their marriage, they were a devoted couple, starting their married life happily. In the following years, they had six children. The couple lived in some of the most luxurious palaces of the Empire: Pavlovsk, Strelna, and the Marble Palace. Konstantin received the Marble Palace in St. Petersburg as a wedding gift from his parents with Strelna, on the Gulf of Finland, as their country retreat. A year after his marriage Konstantin inherited Pavlovsk from his uncle Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, and, at the death of his mother, the palace of Oreanda in Crimea. ==Early career== Portrait of Konstantin Nikolayevich, dated 1851 In 1849, as a young officer, Konstantin took part in a campaign assisting the Habsburgs to put down a revolution in Hungary. It was his first real taste of military conflict. He took part in three dangerous clashes, coming under enemy fire. For his bravery he received the Cross of St. George. During this campaign, he wrote to his father who maintained they were the best reports he received. A year later, Konstantin was appointed a member of the State Council. In 1853, Konstantin's father Tsar Nicholas I made him General-Admiral of the Imperial Navy and head of the Department of the Imperial navy. In this position, he was in charge of reforming a navy that had largely remained unchanged since the time of Peter the Great. It fell upon Konstantin to not only preside over an archaic fleet but also to see it through the disaster of the Crimean War. In the midst of the conflict, his father died and Konstantin advised his brother to search for peace in a war already lost.Chavchavadze, 59. In early 1856, he accompanied his brother Alexander II to the Crimea to view first-hand the devastation of the War. These early military experiences gave Konstantin a loathing of army life and the futility of war. From then on, he was a man of peace, despite his keen interest in the navy, and in political terms a progressive. There was a close working relationship between the two brothers, which was responsible for many reforms. Konstantin was also sent on a diplomatic mission to Napoleon III. ==Naval reform== Plans for naval reform took Konstantin's attention at the start of his brother's reign. He visited England and France in 1857 to study modern navies. Knowing Russia was an inferior military power, Konstantin made concerted efforts to modernize the Russian fleet. Under his orders, old wooden frigates equipped with cannon were replaced with new iron and steel vessels outfitted with modern French and German artillery. Beginning in 1857, he supervised a comprehensive building program that completely transformed the Imperial Navy and made it into a world superpower. Under his plans, the Baltic fleet received eighteen battleships, twelve frigates, and one hundred cannon boats, while the Pacific Fleet was reinforced with twelve new armored vessels, nine transport ships, and four frigates. Only the Black Sea Fleet was largely neglected due to the restriction forced upon Russia after the Crimean War. Nevertheless, he added nineteen new vessels, the maximum allowed to the Empire. Konstantin's spirit of reform had to confront an overstaffed bureaucracy which obstructed his every move. \\"I want shipwrights and sailors, no crowds of clerks \\",King and Wilson, 32. he said. He was energetic and determined. As he pushed forward his plans for the navy, he was involved in the reform of the naval and military colleges, as well as a thorough investigation of corruption in the army and the revision of the country's censorship laws. Abrupt, quick-tempered, and utterly contemptuous of anyone who opposed him, he could forge through problems that daunted his more sensitive elder brother. As is usual with reformers, Konstantin was both praised and despised. One critic called him \\"the most intelligent and able of Alexander II's brothers\\", but declared that he was \\"too self-centered to take any real interest in the welfare of others\\". However, Konstantin's work had a lasting influence on the Russian Imperial Navy. Under his tenure, it was rebuilt and strengthened, with new armored, steam powered vessels replacing the old wooden frigates of his father's reign. He left Russia with the world's third largest sea power, a naval force recognized for its strength and feared for its disciplined approach. ==Emancipation of the serfs== The most important reform of all was the emancipation of the serfs, a policy that was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in their heels and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others might think of him. In 1858, a central group for emancipation, which included only the more progressive members, Konstantin, Lanskoy, Yakov Rostovtsev, Nikolay Milyutin, and their allies, replaced the original committee. Even then, progress was still slow, particularly as several members objected to the Grand Duke's brusque manner.John Van der Kiste, The Romanovs, 1818‚Äì1959, 27. Diehards on the committee knew better than to argue with Konstantin, but continued to use every means possible to provoke him by acting as a brake on progress. He faced a fractured group of representatives, divided between dedicated reformers intent on enacting the Emperor's reforms immediately, and a host of conservative aristocrat representatives who vehemently opposed the emancipation of the serfs. Konstantin was particularly scornful of the numerous aristocratic protests against his plan, commenting once that they were not even worthy for him to spit upon.King and Wilson, 33. On several occasions, Konstantin only just managed to keep the Committee from disintegrating under the strain. The post was a difficult one and the pressures wore on the Grand Duke. His enemies retaliated with ludicrous and poisonous gossip: \\"Konstantin\\", they said, \\"was insane, the result of too much masturbation\\".King and Wilson, 34. Although his brother never ceased to support him, after twelve stormy months Konstantin decided he had had enough of \\"the ignoble nobility\\". Frustrated and disheartened, he departed for a relaxing cruise abroad. He returned to his post almost a year later, refreshed by his absence. The brothers' joint determination for results eventually paid off.Van der Kiste, 27. A general plan of procedure was soon produced and after almost five years, the emancipation finally became law in 1861. Alexander II publicly thanked Konstantin for his contribution. ==Viceroy of Poland== Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia In 1861, the Russian sector of Poland, partitioned since the previous century, was disturbed and under martial law.Zaepvat, 69. Alexander II needed a skillful governor for Poland and decided to appoint Konstantin for the job. In early 1862, Konstantin arrived in Warsaw as the new Namiestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. On 4 July 1862, his second day as Governor-General, a tailor's apprentice and Polish nationalist named Jaroszy≈Ñski saw him leaving a Warsaw theater, and shot him; the bullet grazed the Grand Duke in the shoulder, but left him otherwise unhurt.King and Wilson, 35. Konstantin described the attack as follows: \\"I went into the square and a man came from the crowd approaching me. From the breast he pulled a pistol, and fired. I ran back to the theater, otherwise I would have been dead.\\" Although the Tsar sent him a telegram ordering him to return to St. Petersburg at once, Konstantin preferred to stay, and his wife Grand Duchess Alexandra supported him. His assailant was tried and hanged and Konstantin publicly appealed to the citizens of Warsaw to end the violence. After this attack, he was always escorted by a contingent of Cossacks wherever he went. In July 1862, Konstantin's wife gave birth to the couple's sixth and last child in Warsaw. As a compliment to the Poles, they decided to give their son a Polish name, Vacslav (Wac≈Çaw), but the Russians insisted that the true Russified form, Vyacheslav, should be used, a compromise which pleased neither nation. Alexander II's second son, Grand Duke Alexander, was sent to Warsaw to stand as a godfather to the child. A large, clumsy youth of seventeen, the future Alexander III spilt a decanter of red wine at the dinner table. Konstantin, with his abrupt manners, scolded his clumsy nephew, remarking \\"See what a pig they have sent us from St. Petersburg\\".Van der Kiste, 35. The future Alexander III would never forget this insult and for the rest of his life bore a grudge against his uncle. Konstantin sympathized with the Poles and, ignoring the advice of his brother's generals, he ended martial law and embarked on a program of liberalization. Polish was reinstated as the official language, universities were opened and Konstantin appointed Poles to administrative positions, gathering a distinguished court of Poles and Russians around him.Zaepvat, 70. Konstantin did all he could to appease the Poles, but his well-meant reforms did not go far enough for the Polish nationalists who wanted nothing short of independence, by force if necessary. Acting on the advice of the Emperor, Konstantin ordered a forcible conscription of certain young Poles. The move, announced on New Year's Day 1863, was designed not to reinforce the rolls of the Army, but to round up a number of dangerous young nationalist radicals. The measure backfired, marking the outbreak of the so-called January Uprising. National resistance turned to general rebellion that spread into the nine formerly Polish provinces known as Russia's western region, where powerful landlords and Catholic clergy were ready to give vent to their hatred of Russian domination. Intense fighting, protest, strikes, and even political assassinations, all threatened to undermine the advances that Konstantin had pushed so strenuously. He then had to declare martial law and severely repressed the uprising. Although adept when it came to naval matters, Konstantin had little taste for political fights, and none for ruthlessly crushing revolts. In August 1863, he asked the emperor to relieve him of the post of Viceroy, and Alexander II, aware of how tormented his brother had become by the situation in Warsaw, accepted his resignation. The insurrection was finally quelled in May 1864, when the more conservative Count Frederik Vilhelm Rembert von Berg was sent to replace Konstantin as viceroy. ==President of the Council of State== Back in St. Petersburg, Konstantin devoted all his attention to the navy. He spent seven years reforming the Naval Department, altering laws and reorganizing training of recruits, and successfully managed to transform the previous, often-grim conditions on board most vessels to meet modern standards and expectations. Corporal punishment was abolished in 1863 and the traditional system of naval recruitment was drastically altered. Alexander II, who appreciated his brother's work, made Konstantin Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, where he presided over long sessions and recommended revolutionary measures to bring the laws of the Russian Empire in line with the other leading countries. In recognition of his services, Alexander II appointed him Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1865. In all Konstantin was President of the Council of State for sixteen years. Though lacking in tact, he always had the Tsar's ear and defended the council's view. This also made him many enemies. Konstantin presided over many Russian institutions; he was Chairman of the Russian Geographic Committee and president of several educational institutions, including the Russian Musical Society. A promoter of Slavic causes, he saw Russia's future in the East, nevertheless perceiving Russia's continued hold on Russian America as a burden to the Empire. He was instrumental in persuading his brother to sell it to the United States, whence it became known as Alaska, in 1867. ==Family crisis== Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich with his family (from left to right): Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich; an unidentified aide; on the floor Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich; sitting Grand Duchess Alexandra and Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich holding Grand Duke Vyacheslav; standing behind: Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna and Grand Duke Nikolay Konstantinovich In 1867, Konstantin's eldest daughter, Olga, married King George I of Greece. She was only sixteen, and Konstantin was initially reluctant to let her marry so young. In July 1868 Olga's first child was born and was named Konstantin after his grandfather. The start of his daughter's family coincided with the breaking up of Konstantin's marriage. Although he was only forty, Konstantin's struggles and travails of the previous decade‚Äînaval and judiciary reforms, the freeing of the serfs‚Äîhad prematurely aged him. As Alexander II turned away from the reforms that had marked his first decade on the throne, Konstantin's influence began to wane and he began to focus more in his personal life. After twenty years of marriage he had drifted away from his wife, their divergent political views and interests slowly tearing away the foundations of their marriage. Alexandra Iosifovna was as conservative as her husband was liberal, self-absorbed with her own beauty and her mysticism. Soon, Konstantin turned elsewhere for comfort.King and Wilson, 39. At the end of the 1860s, Konstantin embarked on an affair, having an illegitimate daughter, Marie Condousso. In the 1880s, Marie was sent to Greece, later serving as lady in waiting to her half sister, Queen Olga. Marie eventually married a Greek banker. Soon after the birth of Marie, Konstantin began a new liaison. Around 1868, Konstantin began to pursue a young dancer from the St. Petersburg Conservatoire. Anna Vasilyevna Kuznetsova was a talented ballerina and a mime. She was the illegitimate daughter of ballerina Tatyana Markyanovna Kuznetsova and actor Vasily Andreyevich Karatygin. Anna was twenty years younger than Konstantin and initially she resisted his advances, but in 1873 she gave birth to their first child. Four more would follow.Zaepvat, 71. Konstantin bought his second family a large, comfortable dacha on his estate at Pavlovsk, in fact lodging his mistress and their illegitimate children in close proximity to his estranged wife who he now referred to as his \\"government‚Äìissue wife\\". Once more Konstantin gave ammunition to his enemies and society sided in the scandal with his suffering wife, who tried to bear his infidelity with dignity. In 1874, scandal erupted when it was discovered that Konstantin's eldest son, Grand Duke Nikolay Konstantinovich, who had lived a dissipated life and had revolutionary ideas, had stolen three valuable diamonds from an icon in the bedroom of Alexandra Iosifovna in complicity with his mistress, an American courtesan. His twenty-four-year-old son was found guilty, declared insane, and banished for life to Central Asia. Konstantin suffered another bitter blow when in 1879, his youngest legitimate son, Vyacheslav, died unexpectedly from a brain hemorrhage. ==Retirement== Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in his late years Since 1865, Konstantin had been pushing for a constitution in Russia. As President of the Council of State, he helped to prepare the proposal for a limited elective assembly which Alexander II was due to approve on the very day he was assassinated. For Konstantin and his fellow reformers, hopes ended within months of the new Emperor's ascension to the throne. Alexander III destroyed the document and as he never had liked his uncle Konstantin, whom he regarded a 'liberal powerhouse', requested his uncle's resignation. Konstantin refused to resign, saying that his father \\"had directed me to serve both my deceased brother, and his successors. In my capacity as chairman of the State Council, and as Admiral-General of the Imperial navy, I plan to serve Your Majesty with just as much faith and energy. By doing so, I will fulfill my beloved father's last wishes\\". This was not the answer Alexander III had anticipated and the second time he presented his uncle not with a suggestion but with an order.King and Wilson, 74. After sixteen years as chairman of the Council of ministers, Konstantin was stripped of the office and was replaced by his brother, the more pliable Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolayevich; Alexander III also took away Konstantin's position as head of the Naval Department, handing it over to his own brother, Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. Konstantin was no longer welcome at court. The dismissal fell heavily on the still vibrant, energetic Konstantin, leaving him adrift without any proper role. He was an enthusiastic chess player and his chess problems were published in international journals, but that was not a substitute for the position he once had at the center of affairs. He spent increasingly more time with his second family, further humiliating his legitimate wife. With nothing left to do, Konstantin retired to Pavlovsk, spending most of his time abroad or on his Crimean estate of Oreanda. In August 1881 a fire completely destroyed Oreanda. The palace was never rebuilt and Konstantin lived from then on in a wooden pavilion. Tragedy struck him again while living there. In April 1885, his two surviving illegitimate sons died days apart of scarlet fever.King and Wilson, 87. Of the five children Constantin had had with Kousnetzova, only the two daughters, Marina and Anna, thrived; Konstantin showered them with affection. He was also particularly close to his eldest daughter Olga whom he visited in Greece in 1883. His grandson Prince Christopher of Greece remembered him for his sharp and loud voice, which Konstantin enjoyed using, usually for new servants and preferably in the presence of guests. Without any reason he would glare at the new servant and then scream the servant's name. Some were used to the trick and remained calm, while others dropped the dishes in terror, which amused him.Chavchavadze, 58. ==Last years== In 1886, Konstantin was furious when Alexander III restricted the title of Grand Duke to only children and grandchildren of Emperors, as this meant that Konstantin's grandchildren would merely be princes, but there was little he could do. He had been shunned from society and Alexander III only called his uncle to court for the wedding of Konstantin's eldest granddaughter, Alexandra of Greece to his nephew Grand Duke Paul. At the beginning of August 1889, Konstantin suffered a severe stroke that left his legs paralyzed and him unable to speak. The loss of his health struck the once vibrant Konstantin particularly hard.King and Wilson, 89. As an invalid, he depended from then on on the care of adjutants while confined in a bath chair. Konstantin was cared for by his wife, who gained a sort of revenge for his unfaithfulness and past humiliations. Alexandra Iosifovna did not expel Anna Kuznetsova and her children from the nearby house that Konstantin had provided for them, but she made sure that Konstantin's attendants never took him there.Zaepvat, 75. Konstantin tried in vain to convince his attendants to take him to see his second family, but they were under strict orders not to do so and pretended not to understand the invalid's wishes. One day, brought home by his attendants, he grabbed his wife's hair and beat her with a stick before anyone could intervene. Konstantin died at Pavlovsk on 25 January 1892.King and Wilson, 91.

The three others were Kentish, Mercian and Northumbrian (the latter two were similar and are known as the Anglian dialects). West Saxon was the language of the kingdom of Wessex, and was the basis for successive widely used literary forms of Old English: the Early West Saxon of Alfred the Great's time, and the Late West Saxon of the late 10th and 11th centuries. Due to the Saxons' establishment as a politically dominant force in the Old English period, the West Saxon dialect became one of the strongest dialects in Old English manuscript writing. ==Early West Saxon== Early West Saxon was the language employed by King Alfred (849‚Äì899), used in the many literary translations produced under Alfred's patronage (and some by Alfred himself). It is often referred to as Alfredian Old English, or Alfredian. The language of these texts nonetheless sometimes reflects the influence of other dialects besides that of Wessex. List of texts: #King Alfred's Preface to Gregory's Pastoral Care #The Old English translation of Orosius's Historia adversus paganos #Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 173: The Parker Chronicle (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) ==Late West Saxon== By the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the language had evolved into Late West Saxon, which had established itself as a written language and replaced the Alfredian language,Old English Plus. \\"Appendix 1.\\" following the Athewoldian language reform set in train by Bishop √Üthelwold of Winchester. The name most associated with that reform is that of Abbot √Ülfric of Eynsham, √Ülfric the Grammarian. Despite their similarities, Late West Saxon is not considered by some to be a direct descendant of Early West Saxon.Hogg, Richard M. (1992). The Cambridge History of the English Language. Cambridge University Press, p. 117. For more detail see Old English dialects. Late West Saxon was the dialect that became the first standardised written \\"English\\" (\\"Winchester standard\\"), sometimes referred to as \\"classical\\" Old English. This dialect was spoken mostly in the south and west around the important monastery at Winchester, which was also the capital city of the Saxon kings. However, while other Old English dialects were still spoken in other parts of the country, it seems that all scribes wrote and copied manuscripts in this prestigious written form. Well-known poems recorded in this language include Beowulf and Judith. However, both these poems appear to have been written originally in other Old English dialects, but later translated into the standard Late West Saxon literary language when they were copied by scribes. In the Wessex Gospels from around 990, the text of Matthew 6 (), the Lord's Prayer, is as follows: ::F√¶der ure √æu √æe eart on heofonum, ::si √æin nama gehalgod. ::To becume √æin rice, ::gewur√æe √∞in willa, ::on eor√∞an swa swa on heofonum. ::Urne ged√¶ghwamlican hlaf syle us tod√¶g, ::and forgyf us ure gyltas, ::swa swa we forgyfa√∞ urum gyltendum. ::And ne gel√¶d √æu us on costnunge, ::ac alys us of yfele. ::So√ælice.The Anglo-Saxon Version of the Holy Gospels, Benjamin Thorpe, 1848, p.11. List of texts: :# √Ülfric of Eynsham's Lives of the Saints ==Later developments== The \\"Winchester standard\\" gradually fell out of use after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Monasteries did not keep the standard going because English bishops were soon replaced by Norman bishops who brought their own Latin textbooks and scribal conventions, and there was less need to copy or write in Old English. Latin soon became the \\"language for all serious writing\\", with Anglo-Norman as the language of the aristocracy, and any standard written English became a distant memory by the mid-twelfth century as the last scribes trained as boys before the conquest in West Saxon, died as old men. The new standard languages that would come into being in the times of Middle English and Modern English were descended from the East Midlands dialect, which was Anglian, and not from West Saxon. Low Late West Saxon is the distant ancestor of the West Country dialects. ==References== Category:Languages attested from the 9th century Category:Languages extinct in the 12th century Category:Old English dialects Category:Standard languages Category:Wessex ==See also== #Wiktionary's coverage of Early West Saxon terms #Wiktionary's coverage of Late West Saxon terms ","title":"West Saxon dialect"},{"id":"1430482","text":"The Far East Command was a military regional division of the British military, United States military and Soviet Armed Forces * British Far East Command * Far East Command (United States) was a United States military command from 1947 until 1957 * Far East Command (Soviet Union), a command created in 1945 specifically for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, should not to be confused with the Far Eastern Military District ==See also== * American-British-Dutch- Australian Command (ABDACOM) * South East Asia Command (SEAC) ","title":"Far East Command"},{"id":"1430486","text":"Kenneth Rayner (1808-1884) Kenneth Rayner (June 20, 1808 ‚Äì March 4, 1884) was a whig U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1839 and 1845.

Designed in the 1980s by UK Treasury economist Stephen Littlechild, it has been applied to all privatized British network utilities. It is contrasted with both rate-of-return regulation, with utilities being permitted a set rate of return on capital, and with revenue-cap regulation, with total revenue being the regulated variable. Price cap regulation adjusts the operator's prices according to the price cap index that reflects the overall rate of inflation in the economy, the ability of the operator to gain efficiencies relative to the average firm in the economy, and the inflation in the operator's input prices relative to the average firm in the economy. Revenue cap regulation attempts to do the same thing but for revenue, rather than prices.Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation \\"Price level regulation: Features of Price Cap and Revenue Cap Regulation\\" Price cap regulation is sometimes called \\"CPI - X\\", (in the United Kingdom \\"RPI-X\\") after the basic formula employed to set price caps. This takes the rate of inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (UK Retail Prices Index, RPI) and subtracts expected efficiency savings X. In the water industry, the formula is \\"RPI - X + K\\", where K is based on capital investment requirements. The system is intended to provide incentives for efficiency savings, as any savings above the predicted rate X can be passed on to shareholders, at least until the price caps are next reviewed (usually every five years). A key part of the system is that the rate X is based not only a firm's past performance, but on the performance of other firms in the industry: X is intended to be a proxy for a competitive market, in industries which are natural monopolies. Now consider how a utility operator might be different from the average firm in the economy. First, assume that the operator is just like the average firm, except that the operator's input prices change at a rate that is different from the rate of change for the average firm. If the operator's input prices increase faster than (conversely, slower than) the rate of inflation, then the operator's retail prices (revenue) will need to increase faster than (conversely, slower than) the rate of inflation for the operator to be able to have earnings that are at least as great as the operator's cost of capital. Now assume that the operator is just like the average firm, except with respect to the operator's ability to improve efficiency. If the operator increases its productivity faster than (conversely, slower than) the average firm, then the operator's retail prices (revenue) will need to decrease (conversely, increase) relative to the rate of inflation. Combining these two possible differences between the operator and the average firm in the economy, the operator's retail prices (revenue) should change at the rate of inflation, minus (conversely, plus) the extent to which its input prices inflate less than (conversely, greater than) the rate of inflation, and minus (conversely, plus) the extent to which the operator's productivity is expected to improve at a rate that is greater than (conversely, less than) the average firm in the economy. The above analysis identifies two things. First, the inflation rate, I, used in the price cap index represents the general rate of inflation for the economy. Second, the X-factor is intended to capture the difference between the operator and the average firm in the economy with respect to inflation in input prices and changes in productivity. That is to say, the choice of inflation index and of the X-factor go hand in hand. Some regulators choose a general measure of inflation, such as a gross national product price index. In this case, the X-factor reflects the difference between the operator and the average firm in the economy with respect to the operator's ability to improve its productivity and the effect of inflation on the operator's input costs. Other regulators choose a retail (or producer) price index. In these cases, the X-factor represents the difference between the operator and the average retail (or wholesale) firm. Lastly, some regulators construct price indices of operator inputs. In these cases, the X-factor reflects productivity changes of the operator. In most industries in the UK, estimation of a firm's efficiency is carried out by comparing regional monopolies and using a total factor productivity method. However, for telecommunications, Ofcom instead relies on international comparisons. In practice, the distinction between price-cap and rate-of-return regulation may be lost, as regulators may end up making implicit decisions on the acceptable real rates of return on capital employed in order to arrive at price limit determinations. This has been the experience in the UK water sector, where the 1999 periodic review led Ofwat to determine a standard (real post-tax) cost of capital of 4.75%, with minor adjustments for smaller companies. This standard rate was then used to help calculate X. In addition, detailed aspects of the price elements incorporated into the price index may be more important to the actual operation of a price cap regulatory regime than either the X-factor or the inflation adjustment. How rate elements are incorporated and removed from price caps is particularly important in industries with rapidly changing service offerings. Price-cap regulation is no longer a uniquely British form of regulation. Particularly in the telecommunications industry, many Asian countries are implementing some form of price cap on their newly privatised operators. In addition, many US Local Exchange Carriers are now regulated by price-cap rather than rate-of- return regulation: in 2003, of the 73 companies reporting to the ARMIS database, 22 were regulated according to an RPI-X price cap (and a further 35 were subject to other retail price controls). In Australia, the preferred form of price regulation for utilities is the CPI-X regime.Price Regulation of Utilities Australian Treasury, 1999 ==See also== * Ofwat, Ofgem, Ofcom * Market failure ==References== ==External links== * Features of Price Cap and Revenue Cap Regulation from the Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation * Data concerning U.S. interstate telephone service price caps * Ian Alexander and Timothy Irwin (1996), \\"Price Caps, Rate-of-Return Regulation, and the Cost of Capital\\" Category:Market failure Category:Monopoly (economics) Category:Economics of regulation ","title":"Price-cap regulation"},{"id":"1430500","text":"Alex Jones is a British actor, playwright and filmmaker.

Most royal children were brought up by nannies and servants so by the time Nikolai had grown up he lived a very independent life having become a gifted military officer and an incorrigible womanizer. He had an affair with a notorious American woman Fanny Lear. Due to his affair, he stole three valuable diamonds from the revetment of one of the most valuable family icons. He was declared insane and he was banished to Tashkent. ==Later life== He lived for many years under constant supervision in the area around Tashkent in the southeastern Russian Empire (now Uzbekistan) and made a great contribution to the city by using his personal fortune to help improve the local area. In 1890 he ordered the building of his own palace in Tashkent to house and show his large and very valuable collection of works of art and the collection is now the center of the state Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan. He was also famous in Tashkent as a competent engineer and irrigator, constructing two large canals, the Bukhar- aryk (which was poorly aligned and soon silted up) and the much more successful Khiva-Aryk, later extended to form the Emperor Nicholas I Canal, irrigating 12,000 desyatinas, 33,000 acres (134 km¬≤) of land in the Hungry Steppe between Djizak and Tashkent. Most of this was then settled with Slavic peasant colonisers. Nikolai had a number of children by different women. One of his grandchildren, Natalia Androsova, died in Moscow in 1999. ==Death== Nikolai died of pneumonia on 26 January 1918.This statement doesn't represent the facts. From newspaper publications of 1918 follows that Nikolay Romanov died in the own house near Tashkent from pneumonia. He was buried in St. George's Cathedral (later demolished by the Soviet regime). ==Family== Nikolai married Nadezhda (variantly spelled Nadejda) Alexandrovna von Dreyer (1861‚Äì1929), daughter of Orenburg police chief Alexander Gustavovich von Dreyer and Sophia Ivanovna Opanovskaya, in 1882. Two children were born from this marriage: * Artemi Nikolayevich Prince Iskander (or Prince Romanovsky- Iskander) (1883‚Äì1919), killed in the Russian Civil War * (15 November 1887 N.S. ‚Äì 26 January 1957), married Olga Iosifovna Rogovskaya / Rogowska (1893‚Äì1962) on 5 May 1912.

They show that flows generally track the overall level of the market: investors buy stocks when prices are high, and sell stocks when prices are low. For example, in the beginning of the 2000s, the largest inflows to stock mutual funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid-2002. These mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant bear (downtrending) market and bull (uptrending) market respectively. A similar pattern is repeated near the end of the decade.Worldwide Mutual Fund Assets and Flows, Fourth Quarter 2008You Should Have Timed the Market on finance.yahoo.com This mutual fund flow data seems to indicate that most investors (despite what they may say) actually follow a buy-high, sell-low strategy. Studies confirm that the general tendency of investors is to buy after a stock or mutual fund price has increased. This surge in the number of buyers may then drive the price even higher. However, eventually, the supply of buyers becomes exhausted, and the demand for the stock declines and the stock or fund price also declines. After inflows, there may be a short-term boost in return, but the significant result is that the return over a longer time is disappointing. Researchers suggest that, after periods of higher returns, individual investors will sell their value stocks and buy growth stocks. Frazzini and Lamont find that, in general, growth stocks have a lower return, but growth stocks with high inflows have a much worse return. Studies find that the average investor's return in stocks is much less than the amount that would have been obtained by simply holding an index fund consisting of all stocks contained in the S&P; 500 index. For the 20-year period to the end of 2008, the inflation-adjusted market return was about 5.3% on average per year. The average investor managed to turn $1 million into $800,000, against $2.7 million for the index (after fund costs). Studies by the financial services market research company Dalbar say that the retention rate for bond and stock funds is three years. This means that in a 20-year period the investor changed funds seven times. Balanced funds are a bit better at four years, or five times. Some trading is necessary since not only is the investor return less than the best asset class, it is typically worse than the worst asset class, which would be better. Balanced funds may be better by reason of investor psychology. Financial advisors often agree that investors have poor timing, becoming less risk averse when markets are high and more risk averse when markets are low, a strategy that will actually result in less wealth in the long-term compared to someone who consistently invests over a long period regardless of market trends. This is consistent with recency bias and seems contrary to the acrophobia explanation. Similarly, Peter Lynch has stated that \\"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in the corrections themselves.\\"As quoted in \\"The Wisdom of Great Investors: Insights from Some of History‚Äôs Greatest Investment Minds, by Davis Advisers, p. 7 Proponents of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) claim that prices reflect all available information. EMH assumes that investors are highly intelligent and perfectly rational. However, others dispute this assumption. \\"Of course, we know stocks don't work that way\\".Jim Cramer's Getting Back to Even, pp. 63-64 In particular, proponents of behavioral finance claim that investors are irrational but their biases are consistent and predictable. ==Difference in views on the viability of market timing== Whether market timing is ever a viable investment strategy is controversial. Some may consider market timing to be a form of gambling based on pure chance, because they do not believe in undervalued or overvalued markets. The efficient-market hypothesis claims that financial prices always exhibit random walk behavior and thus cannot be predicted with consistency. Some consider market timing to be sensible in certain situations, such as an apparent bubble. However, because the economy is a complex system that contains many factors, even at times of significant market optimism or pessimism, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to predetermine the local maximum or minimum of future prices with any precision; a so-called bubble can last for many years before prices collapse. Likewise, a crash can persist for extended periods; stocks that appear to be \\"cheap\\" at a glance, can often become much cheaper afterwards, before then either rebounding at some time in the future or heading toward bankruptcy. Proponents of market timing counter that market timing is just another name for trading. They argue that \\"attempting to predict future market price movements\\" is what all traders do, regardless of whether they trade individual stocks or collections of stocks, aka, mutual funds. Thus if market timing is not a viable investment strategy, the proponents say, then neither is any of the trading on the various stock exchanges. Those who disagree with this view usually advocate a buy-and-hold strategy with periodic \\"re-balancing\\". Others contend that predicting the next event that will affect the economy and stock prices is notoriously difficult. For examples, consider the many unforeseeable, unpredictable, uncertain events between 1985 and 2013 that are shown in Figures 1 to 6 [pages 37 to 42] of Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty. Few people in the world correctly predicted the timing and causes of the Great Recession during 2007‚Äì2009. ==Market-timing software and algorithms== Institutional investors often use proprietary market-timing software developed internally that can be a trade secret. Some algorithms, like the one developed by Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Robert C. Merton, attempts to predict the future superiority of stocks versus bonds (or vice versa), have been published in peer-reviewed journals and are publicly accessible. ==Moving average== Market timing often looks at moving averages such as 50- and 200-day moving averages (which are particularly popular). Some people believe that if the market has gone above the 50- or 200-day average that should be considered bullish, or below conversely bearish. Technical analysts consider it significant when one moving average crosses over another. The market timers then predict that the trend will, more likely than not, continue in the future. Others say, \\"nobody knows\\" and that world economies and stock markets are of such complexity that market-timing strategies are unlikely to be more profitable than buy-and-hold strategies. Moving average strategies are simple to understand, and often claim to give good returns, but the results may be confused by hindsight and data mining. ==Curve fitting and over-optimization== A major stumbling block for many market timers is a phenomenon called \\"curve fitting\\", which states that a given set of trading rules tends to be over-optimized to fit the particular dataset for which it has been back-tested. Unfortunately, if the trading rules are over-optimized they often fail to work on future data. Market timers attempt to avoid these problems by looking for clusters of parameter values that work wellPruitt, George, & Hill, John R. Building Winning Trading Systems with TradeStation(TM), Hoboken, N.J: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. , p. 106-108. or by using out-of-sample data, which ostensibly allows the market timer to see how the system works on unforeseen data. Critics, however, argue that once the strategy has been revised to reflect such data it is no longer \\"out-of- sample\\". ==Independent review of market-timing services== Several independent organizations (e.g., Timer Digest and Hulbert Financial Digest) have tracked some market timers' performance for over thirty years. These organizations have found that purported market timers in many cases do no better than chance, or even worse. A 2004 study suggested that the best predictor of a fund's consistent outperformance of the market was low expenses and low turnover, not pursuit of a value or contrarian strategy. === Bull Bear Spread === The Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment Yardeni Research, Inc.

His parents were Count Christian Louis Casimir of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Ludwigsburg and his first wife Countess Amalie Ludowika Finck von Finckenstein. ==Military career== Enrolled as a sergeant in the Semyonovsky Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army at the age of 12 in 1781, Wittgenstein began actual military service as a Wachtmeister in the Life Guard Horse Regiment in 1789. In 1793 he gained promotion to Major in the Ukrainian light cavalry regiment. He fought with the unit in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794. Promoted to the rank of colonel in 1798, and to major general in 1799, in 1800 he took command of the Mariupolski Hussars Regiment. In 1805 he fought at Austerlitz, in 1806 against the Turks, and in 1807 against Napoleon at Friedland and against the Swedes in Finland. In the war of 1812 he commanded the right wing of the Russian Army in the First and Second battle of Polotsk. This fighting decided the fate of Saint Petersburg and earned Wittgenstein the title of \\"Saviour of Saint-Petersburg\\". Peter Khristianovich Napoleon.org Emperor Alexander I of Russia awarded him the Order of St. George. He tried to combine with Pavel Chichagov at the Battle of Berezina (November 1812), and later combined with the Prussian army corps under Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg. In the campaign of 1813 in January he took over the command of the Russian army after Kutuzov's death in April 1813, and commanded the Russian army at L√ºtzen and Bautzen. But after the defeats of the Spring campaign, he laid down this command and led an army corps during the Battle of Dresden (August 1813) and the Battle of Leipzig (October 1813). In the campaign of 1814 he led the 6th Corps under Schwarzenberg, and was severely wounded at Bar-sur-Aube (27 February 1814).http://www.napoleonsims.com/people/people.htm In 1823 he was promoted Field Marshal, and in 1828 he was appointed to command the Russian army in the war against Turkey. But ill-health soon obliged him to retire. In 1834 King Frederick William III of Prussia granted him the title of F√ºrst (Prince) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. ==Family== On 27 June 1798 he married Countess Antonia C√§cilie Snarska and had in this marriage 11 children.

The word was coined by Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam, in 1974. Interest in preon models peaked in the 1980s but has slowed, as the Standard Model of particle physics continues to describe the physics, mostly successfully, and no direct experimental evidence for lepton and quark compositeness has been found. In the hadronic sector, some effects are considered anomalies within the Standard Model. For example, the proton spin puzzle, the EMC effect, the distributions of electric charges inside the nucleons, as found by Hofstadter in 1956, and the ad hoc CKM matrix elements. When the term \\"preon\\" was coined, it was primarily to explain the two families of spin-¬Ω fermions: quarks and leptons. More recent preon models also account for spin-1 bosons, and are still called \\"preons\\". Each of the preon models postulates a set of fewer fundamental particles than those of the Standard Model, together with the rules governing how those fundamental particles combine and interact. Based on these rules, the preon models try to explain the Standard Model, often predicting small discrepancies with this model and generating new particles and certain phenomena, which do not belong to the Standard Model. ==Goals of preon models== Preon research is motivated by the desire to: *Reduce the large number of particles, many that differ only in charge, to a smaller number of more fundamental particles. For example, the electron and positron are identical except for charge, and preon research is motivated by explaining that electrons and positrons are composed of similar preons with the relevant difference accounting for charge. The hope is to reproduce the reductionist strategy that has worked for the periodic table of elements. *Explain the three generations of fermions. *Calculate parameters that are currently unexplained by the Standard Model, such as particle masses, electric charges, and color charges, and reduce the number of experimental input parameters required by the Standard Model. *Provide reasons for the very large differences in energy-masses observed in supposedly fundamental particles, from the electron neutrino to the top quark. *Provide alternative explanations for the electro-weak symmetry breaking without invoking a Higgs field, which in turn possibly needs a supersymmetry to correct the theoretical problems involved with the Higgs field. Supersymmetry itself has theoretical problems. *Account for neutrino oscillation and mass. *Make new nontrivial predictions, such as cold dark matter candidates. *Explain why there exists only the observed variety of particle species, and give a model with reasons for producing only these observed particles (since the prediction of non- observed particles is a problem with many current models, such as supersymmetry). ==Background== Before the Standard Model was developed in the 1970s (the key elements of the Standard Model known as quarks were proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964), physicists observed hundreds of different kinds of particles in particle accelerators. These were organized into relationships on their physical properties in a largely ad-hoc system of hierarchies, not entirely unlike the way taxonomy grouped animals based on their physical features. Not surprisingly, the huge number of particles was referred to as the \\"particle zoo\\". The Standard Model, which is now the prevailing model of particle physics, dramatically simplified this picture by showing that most of the observed particles were mesons, which are combinations of two quarks, or baryons which are combinations of three quarks, plus a handful of other particles. The particles being seen in the ever-more- powerful accelerators were, according to the theory, typically nothing more than combinations of these quarks. ===Comparisons of quarks, leptons, and bosons=== Within the Standard Model, there are several classes of particles. One of these, the quarks, has six types, of which there are three varieties in each (dubbed \\"colors\\", red, green, and blue, giving rise to quantum chromodynamics). Additionally, there are six different types of what are known as leptons. Of these six leptons, there are three charged particles: the electron, muon, and tau. The neutrinos comprise the other three leptons, and for each neutrino there is a corresponding member from the other set of three leptons. In the Standard Model, there are also bosons, including the photons; W+, W‚àí, and Z bosons; gluons and the Higgs boson; and an open space left for the graviton. Almost all of these particles come in \\"left-handed\\" and \\"right- handed\\" versions (see chirality). The quarks, leptons, and W boson all have antiparticles with opposite electric charge. ===Unresolved problems with the Standard Model=== The Standard Model also has a number of problems which have not been entirely solved. In particular, no successful theory of gravitation based on a particle theory has yet been proposed. Although the Model assumes the existence of a graviton, all attempts to produce a consistent theory based on them have failed. Kalman asserts that, according to the concept of atomism, fundamental building blocks of nature are indivisible bits of matter that are ungenerated and indestructible. Quarks are not truly indestructible, since some can decay into other quarks. Thus, on fundamental grounds, quarks are not themselves fundamental building blocks but must be composed of other, fundamental quantities‚Äîpreons. Although the mass of each successive particle follows certain patterns, predictions of the rest mass of most particles cannot be made precisely, except for the masses of almost all baryons which have been recently described very well by the model of de Souza. The Standard Model also has problems predicting the large scale structure of the universe. For instance, the SM generally predicts equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe. A number of attempts have been made to \\"fix\\" this through a variety of mechanisms, but to date none have won widespread support. Likewise, basic adaptations of the Model suggest the presence of proton decay, which has not yet been observed. ===Motivation for preon models=== Several models have been proposed in an attempt to provide a more fundamental explanation of the results in experimental and theoretical particle physics, using names such as \\"parton\\" or \\"preon\\" for the hypothetical basic particle constituents. Preon theory is motivated by a desire to replicate in particle physics the achievements of the periodic table in Chemistry, which reduced 94 naturally occurring elements to combinations of just three building-blocks (proton, neutron, electron). Likewise, the Standard Model later organized the \\"particle zoo\\" of hadrons by reducing several dozen particles to combinations at a more fundamental level of (at first) just three quarks, consequently reducing the huge number of arbitrary constants in mid-twentieth-century particle physics prior to the Standard Model and quantum chromodynamics. However, the particular preon model discussed below has attracted comparatively little interest among the particle physics community to date, in part because no evidence has been obtained so far in collider experiments to show that the fermions of the Standard Model are composite. ===Attempts=== A number of physicists have attempted to develop a theory of \\"pre-quarks\\" (from which the name preon derives) in an effort to justify theoretically the many parts of the Standard Model that are known only through experimental data. Other names which have been used for these proposed fundamental particles (or particles intermediate between the most fundamental particles and those observed in the Standard Model) include prequarks, subquarks, maons, alphons, quinks, rishons, tweedles, helons, haplons, Y-particles, and primons. Preon is the leading name in the physics community. Efforts to develop a substructure date at least as far back as 1974 with a paper by Pati and Salam in Physical Review. Erratum: Other attempts include a 1977 paper by Terazawa, Chikashige and Akama, similar, but independent, 1979 papers by Ne'eman, Harari, and Shupe, a 1981 paper by Fritzsch and Mandelbaum, and a 1992 book by D'Souza and Kalman. None of these have gained wide acceptance in the physics world. However, in a recent work de Souza has shown that his model describes well all weak decays of hadrons according to selection rules dictated by a quantum number derived from his compositeness model. In his model leptons are elementary particles and each quark is composed of two primons, and thus, all quarks are described by four primons. Therefore, there is no need for the Standard Model Higgs boson and each quark mass is derived from the interaction between each pair of primons by means of three Higgs-like bosons. In his 1989 Nobel Prize acceptance lecture, Hans Dehmelt described a most fundamental elementary particle, with definable properties, which he called the cosmon, as the likely end result of a long but finite chain of increasingly more elementary particles. See also references therein. ===Composite Higgs=== Many preon models either do not account for the Higgs boson or rule it out, and propose that electro-weak symmetry is broken not by a scalar Higgs field but by composite preons. For example, Fredriksson preon theory does not need the Higgs boson, and explains the electro-weak breaking as the rearrangement of preons, rather than a Higgs-mediated field. In fact, the Fredriksson preon model and the de Souza model predict that the Standard Model Higgs boson does not exist. ==Rishon model== The rishon model (RM) is the earliest effort to develop a preon model to explain the phenomenon appearing in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It was first developed by Haim Harari and Michael A. Shupe (independently of each other), and later expanded by Harari and his then-student Nathan Seiberg. The model has two kinds of fundamental particles called rishons (which means \\"primary\\" in Hebrew). They are T (\\"Third\\" since it has an electric charge of ‚Öì e, or Tohu which means \\"unformed\\") and V (\\"Vanishes\\", since it is electrically neutral, or Vohu which means \\"void\\"). All leptons and all flavours of quarks are three-rishon ordered triplets. These groups of three rishons have spin-¬Ω. The Rishon model illustrates some of the typical efforts in the field. Many of the preon models theorize that the apparent imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe is in fact illusory, with large quantities of preon-level antimatter confined within more complex structures. ==Criticisms== ===The mass paradox=== One preon model started as an internal paper at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) around 1994. The paper was written after an unexpected and inexplicable excess of jets with energies above 200 GeV were detected in the 1992‚Äì1993 running period. However, scattering experiments have shown that quarks and leptons are \\"pointlike\\" down to distance scales of less than 10‚àí18 m (or of a proton diameter). The momentum uncertainty of a preon (of whatever mass) confined to a box of this size is about 200 GeV/c, 50,000 times larger than the rest mass of an up-quark and 400,000 times larger than the rest mass of an electron. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that \\\\operatorname{\\\\Delta} x \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{\\\\Delta} p \\\\ge \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\hbar and thus anything confined to a box smaller than \\\\operatorname{\\\\Delta} x would have a momentum uncertainty proportionally greater. Thus, the preon model proposed particles smaller than the elementary particles they make up, since the momentum uncertainty \\\\operatorname{\\\\Delta} p should be greater than the particles themselves. So the preon model represents a mass paradox: How could quarks or electrons be made of smaller particles that would have many orders of magnitude greater mass-energies arising from their enormous momenta? This paradox is resolved by postulating a large binding force between preons cancelling their mass-energies. ===Conflicts with observed physics=== Preon models propose additional unobserved forces or dynamics to account for the observed properties of elementary particles, which may have implications in conflict with observation. For example, now that the LHC's observation of a Higgs boson is confirmed, the observation contradicts the predictions of many preon models that did not include it. Preon theories require quarks and leptons to have a finite size. It is possible that the Large Hadron Collider will observe this after it is upgraded to higher energies. ==In popular culture== * In the 1948 reprint/edit of his 1930 novel Skylark Three, E. E. Smith postulated a series of 'subelectrons of the first and second type' with the latter being fundamental particles that were associated with the gravitation force. While this may not have been an element of the original novel (the scientific basis of some of the other novels in the series was revised extensively due to the additional eighteen years of scientific development), even the edited publication may be the first, or one of the first, mentions of the possibility that electrons are not fundamental particles. * In the novelized version of the 1982 motion picture Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, written by Vonda McIntyre, two of Dr. Carol Marcus' Genesis project team, Vance Madison and Delwyn March, have studied sub-elementary particles they've named \\"boojums\\" and \\"snarks\\", in a field they jokingly call \\"kindergarten physics\\" because it is lower than \\"elementary\\" (analogy to school levels). * James P. Hogan's 1982 novel Voyage from Yesteryear discussed preons (called tweedles), the physics of which became central to the plot. ==See also== * Technicolor (physics) * Preon star * Preon-degenerate matter * Rishon model ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Hypothetical elementary particles ","title":"Preon"},{"id":"1430550","text":"Takahama can refer to: ==Places== * Takahama, Aichi, a city in Aichi Prefecture, Japan * Takahama, Fukui, a town in Fukui Prefecture, Japan ==People== * Aiko Takahama, women's professional shogi player * Kyoshi Takahama (1874 ‚Äì 1959), a Japanese writer * Takahama Tatsur≈ç (b. 1976), former fighting name Japanese sumo wrestler now known as Hamanishiki Tatsur≈ç ","title":"Takahama"},{"id":"1430557","text":"T≈çkai (Êù±Êµ∑, literally East Sea) in Japanese may refer to: * T≈çkai region, a subregion of Ch≈´bu * T≈çkai, Ibaraki, a village, also known as \\"Tokaimura\\" (Tokai-village) * T≈çkai, Aichi, a city * T≈çkai University, a private university in Tokyo * T≈çkai Nuclear Power Plant, Ibaraki * 2478 Tokai, a main belt asteroid * T≈çkai (train), a train service between Tokyo Station and Shizuoka Station * T≈çkai Gakki or Tokai Guitars, a Japanese guitar company * Ky≈´sh≈´ Q1W T≈çkai, an anti-submarine bomber of Imperial Navy * Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings, a Japanese financial services company * T≈çkai earthquakes, major earthquakes occurring regularly with an interval of 100 to 150 years * Tokaimura nuclear accident, a fatal criticality accident in T≈çkai, Ibaraki on 30 September 1999 Tokai may refer to: * Tokai, Cape Town, a large residential suburb of Cape Town, South Africa * Tokai (cartoon character), of Bangladesh, a creation of Rafiqun Nabi * , a Japanese butane lighter manufacturer == See also == * T≈çkaid≈ç (disambiguation) * Tokaj (disambiguation) * Tokay (disambiguation) * Êù±Êµ∑ (disambiguation), the East Asian script for \\"East Sea\\" ** Donghae (disambiguation), Korean romanization ** Donghai (disambiguation), Pinyin romanization ** Tunghai (disambiguation), Wade‚ÄìGiles romanization ","title":"Tokai"},{"id":"1430567","text":"Birgit Finnil√§ (born 20 January 1931) is a Swedish contralto and opera singer.

Rupnik served as the President of the Provincial Government of the Nazi-occupied Province of Ljubljana from November 1943 to early May 1945. Between September 1944 and early May 1945, he also served as chief inspector of the Slovene Home Guard (), a collaborationist militia, although he did not have any military command until the last month of the war.Boris Mlakar, Slovensko domobranstvo (Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, 2003) == Early career == Rupnik was born in Lokve near Gorizia, a village in what was then the Austrian county of Gorizia and Gradisca (now part of Nova Gorica, southwestern Slovenia). A career soldier, from 1895 to 1899 he studied at the infantry military academy in Trieste and graduated as a junior second lieutenant. His schooling continued in Vienna from 1905 to 1907. After World War I, he joined the Royal Yugoslav Army in May 1919 with the rank of active staff major. He thereafter climbed the ranks, becoming a lieutenant-colonel (1923), colonel (1927), brigadier general (1933) and major general (1937). When the Wehrmacht invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941, Rupnik was Chief of Staff of 1st Army Group. == The Rupnik Line == After the Third Reich and the Kingdom of Italy had formed the Axis alliance, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia decided to construct a line of fortresses along the borders to defend itself against possible attacks from the north and the west. The constructions was mostly carried out on the border with Italy in the Drava Banovina. The line was initially staffed by 15,000, but the number increased to 40,000 by 1941.Rupnik Line pictures from military photos on webshots As Rupnik was in charge of their completion, the 'Rupnik Line' became the common name for these fortifications. The defences were built on the French Maginot Line and Czechoslovak models, adapted to local conditions. After the invasion of Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941, few of them were ready and the German Wehrmacht campaign quickly rendered the line obsolete. == Collaboration == After the quick defeat of the Royal Yugoslav Army, Rupnik was released from German military prison and moved to the Italian-occupied southern Slovenia (known as Province of Ljubljana) on April 17, 1941. On June 7, 1942, he accepted the position of President of the Provincial Council of Ljubljana, thus replacing Juro Adle≈°iƒç as mayor under Italian occupation. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, Ljubljana was occupied by the Germans. Friedrich Rainer, Nazi Gauleiter of Carinthia, nominated Rupnik as president of the new provincial government, after a consultation with bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman who agreed with Rainer's intention to put Rupnik in charge of the provisional government. Bishop Ro≈æman praised Rupnik highly, stating he was \\"the most capable man for this administrative position\\". Leon Rupnik, Bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman and SS- General Erwin R√∂sener.

Friedrich Rainer also proposed the creation of the Home Guard, which functioned under the command of SS Lieutenant-General, Erwin R√∂sener, who in turn reported directly to SS Chief, Heinrich Himmler. Together with Anton Kokalj, Ernest Peterlin and Janko Kregar, Rupnik was also one of the founders of the Slovene Home Guard, an auxiliary military unit of the SS, formed as a voluntary militia to fight the partisan resistance movement. The militia was organized mostly by members of Slovene anti-Communist politicians gathered around the underground organization Slovenian Covenant () in agreement with the German occupation forces.Boris Mlakar, Slovensko domobranstvo (Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, 2003) Soon after the formation of the militia on September 23, 1943, Rupnik nominated himself its commander-in-chief. In his first order to the Home Guard on September 30, Rupnik proclaimed, \\"whoever is not directly tied to cooperation with the German Army or the police is an armed bandit, and must be attacked and destroyed without delay\\", urging his men to handover captured partisans to the closest German army or police garrison. He was dismissed by Rainer on November 4, 1943. In September 1944, he was nominated chief inspector of the Slovene Home Guard, a function with virtually no competence. In his function of president of the provincial administration, Rupnik organized a large-scale bureaucracy which tried to cover all spheres of civilian life, from local administration, to social security and cultural policies. For this purpose, he relied on two groups of aides: on one side, mostly apolitical civil servants and cultural functionaries active already in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (such as Stanko Majcen and Narte Velikonja); on the other side, he involved several highly ideological and fervently pro-Nazi young individuals, such as Ljenko Urbanƒçiƒç and son-in-law Stanko Kociper.Bojan Gode≈°a, Kdor ni z nami, je proti nam (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, 1995) Rupnik succeeded in keeping almost all Slovene cultural and educational institutions functioning under Nazi occupation, and in 1944 he even managed to rename the \\"Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana\\" to Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Throughout his presidency, Rupnik maintained complete loyalty to the German Nazi occupation authorities. In 1944, while Rupnik served as president of the Ljubljana provincial administration, the Slovene Home Guard Police arrested the remaining Jews, who until then had managed to hide in the city, and turned them over to the Nazi authorities, who sent them to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. He organized several \\"anti- Communist rallies\\", in which he delivered violent speeches against the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, the Western Allies and the \\"World Jewish Conspiracy\\". He maintained friendly contacts with the SS general Erwin R√∂sener,Three photos of Rupnik, SS General Erwin R√∂sener and Gregorij Ro≈æman.

Date and place unknown. who was later convicted of war crimes. As Chief Inspector of the Slovenian Home Guard, Rupnik led the Home Guards in two oaths of allegiance - the first on Hitler‚Äôs birthday on April 20, 1944, then on the 12th anniversary of the Nazis coming to power, on January 30, 1945. In the oaths the Home Guards swore to fight together with the SS and German police under the leadership of the F√ºhrer against the Communist guerillas and their allies. Rupnik disagreed with all attempts by members of the Slovenian Covenant and some military leaders of the Slovene Home Guard to rise against the Nazis, nor did he intervene when several of his former collaborators were arrested by the Nazis and sent to Dachau concentration camp. === Anti-Semitism === Known for his antisemitic and openly pro-Nazi views already prior to the war,Tamara Griesser Peƒçar, Razdvojeni narod. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 2007. Rupnik was a notorious anti-Semite, who wrote anti-Semitic tracts and made antisemitic speeches. Some notable examples include: In a lecture he gave in Ljubljana in 1944, entitled 'Bolshevism: a tool of international Judaism' and subtitled 'Jewish endeavours towards global supremacy', Rupnik said the following: > The Jews straight dogmatic hatred of all who are not Jewish is finally > challenged everywhere by a revolt by the home nation that sooner or later > removes all parasites from their country or limits by law their economic, > religious and political activity. (A transcript of the entire lecture is > available.) In a lecture at Polhov Gradec, on June 5, 1944 Rupnik stated: > With solid trust in the righteousness of the leader of Europe, of the German > nation, we must calmly and with all fanaticism lead the battle against > Jewish global supremacy serving Stalin‚Äôs and Tito‚Äôs bandits and their > assistants, Anglo-American gangsters. At the ceremony where the Home Guard swore oaths of allegiance, January 30, 1945 Rupnik said: > If the German soldier and you, my bold Domobranci, allowed these Jewish > mercenaries to flourish, they would yet kill all decent thinkers, believers > in the nation and homeland of true Slovenian birth together with their > children ‚Äì or we will make cannon fodder or slaves of them, steal their > property, homes, villages, devastate the national body and suppress the Jew. > These are the nations of Europe, our broader homeland, in whose centre the > largest, German nation has taken upon itself the struggle against the Jewish > corruption of the world. == Arrest, trial, and execution == On May 5, 1945, Leon Rupnik fled to Austria with a small group of 20 collaborators. He was arrested by the British on July 23 and returned to Yugoslavia in January 1946. He was put on trial alongside R√∂sener and others, and was sentenced to death for treason on August 30, 1946. He was executed by firing squad on September 4, 1946 at Ljubljana's ≈Ωale cemetery, and was buried the same day in an unmarked grave.More on his execution in: In January 2020 the Supreme Court of Slovenia annulled the court judgement of 1946 for not meeting the necessary legal standards in force at the time of trial. In response, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a global human rights organization researching the Holocaust and hate, issued a condemnation of the annulment, stating that Rupnik \\"played a major role in the arrest and deportation of Jews from Ljubljana in 1943 and 1944\\". They further noted \\"This shameful decision constitutes a shocking distortion of the history of the Holocaust and a horrific insult to Rupnik's many victims and their families. We kindly request that you promptly convey our protest to the pertinent Slovenian authorities so that the proper measures can be taken to undo the enormous damage wrought by this unjust decision of the Slovenian Supreme Court\\". Because some had understood the court's decision to constitute political rehabilitation, statements were issued that this was in fact not the case. == Other == His son, Vuk Rupnik, was an active officer of the Slovene Home Guard and commander of one of the most belligerent units in the militia. His son-in-law, Stanko Kociper, later emigrated to Argentina and wrote a book in which he tried to vindicate Rupnik's role in the war. == References == == External links == * * Category:1880 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Gorizia and Gradisca people Category:Slovenian generals Category:Mayors of Ljubljana Category:Slovenian anti-communists Category:Slovenian people of World War II Category:Slovenian collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Executed Yugoslav collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Executed Slovenian people Category:Deaths by firearm in Slovenia Category:People from the City Municipality of Nova Gorica Category:Antisemitism in Yugoslavia Category:Burials at ≈Ωale Central Cemetery Category:Yugoslav fascists Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ","title":"Leon Rupnik"},{"id":"1430578","text":"Britt Lundberg (born April 19, 1963) is a politician in the √Öland Islands, an autonomous and unilingually Swedish territory of Finland.√Ölands landskapsregering: Vicelantr√•d Britt Lundberg , accessed 2010-08-17 She served as President of the Nordic Council during the 2017 session.

He came from humble origins, being descended from, as John Charnock put it, a family \\"more distinguished for their integrity than their riches.\\" When he was sixteen years old, his father apprenticed him to the master of a trading vessel from Leith. Having served this apprenticeship, he acted as mate aboard various vessels engaged in the Baltic trade. On the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, he was pressed into service in the Royal Navy. He is recorded serving as a midshipman aboard the in the Mediterranean from 31 October 1673 to 15 October 1674, under the captaincy of Edward Russell. He followed Russell to the in 1676, and participated in his voyage to Newfoundland. Still serving under Russell, he was promoted to second lieutenant aboard the on 16 January 1678, and as first lieutenant aboard the on 26 March 1679. Passed over for promotion, he remained with Russell, becoming first lieutenant of the on 10 August 1680. When Russell fell from favour following his cousin's involvement in the Rye House Plot, Mitchell remained in the service and became first lieutenant of the on 8 May 1682. He served aboard this vessel under the command of vice admiral Arthur Herbert in the Mediterranean, and returned home with him in July 1683. On 5 February 1684, Mitchell was promoted to captain and given his first command: the . He sailed this vessel to the West Indies, where he spent two years convoying slave ships and pursuing Joseph Bannister and other pirates. He was discharged from the Ruby in October 1686 and given no other command. Eventually he made his way to the Netherlands and joined the group of naval defectors collecting around William of Orange. Following the Glorious Revolution, Mitchell was given command of the which served as Herbert's flagship at the battle of Bantry Bay, and also took part in the battle of Beachy Head. In August 1690, Mitchell was one of four candidates put forward to Queen Mary for promotion to admiral, the others being George Churchill, Matthew Aylmer and Francis Wheler. Not being one of the two chosen, he remained on the Elizabeth until given command of Russell's flagship, the , in January 1691. Apart from a four-month sojourn in the winter of 1691, when he was major of the 1st Maritime Regiment, he commanded this ship until January 1693 and led her into the battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. On 8 February 1693 he was promoted to Rear Admiral of the Blue, hoisting his flag aboard the to escort the king across to Holland. He then joined the main fleet under joint admirals Shovell, Delaval and Killigrew, with the as his flagship. He was knighted by William III, apparently informally, about May 1694 before he joined Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford's grand fleet, but was officially dubbed a Knight Bachelor at Kensington, London, on 6 December 1698. He was a Commissioner of the Admiralty from 1699 to 1702 and a Member of the Lord High Admiral's Council 1702 to 1708. He obtained numerous royal honours and appointments, including that of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. Because of his naval knowledge, he became a close professional friend of Czar Peter the Great. David Mitchell's coat of arms are stated by De Neve to be appropriated for his tomb without justification from the Mitchells of Tillygrieg ('he bears arms, but hath no right', citing his humble background). During the Grand Embassy of Tsar Peter the Great in 1697-1699 Mitchell captained the flagship HMS York which brought him to England. During the voyage the Tsar was given instruction on ship handling by Mitchell‚Äîmostly in Dutch since they were both fluent in it. At the Tsar's request Mitchell was assigned as his official escort and translator during the nearly six months Peter was in London. ==References== ==Sources== *archives at RootsWeb.com Category:1650s births Category:1710 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Lords of the Admiralty Category:Scottish admirals Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Scottish politicians Category:Gentlemen Ushers Category:Ushers of the Black Rod Category:Knights Bachelor ","title":"David Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)"},{"id":"1430584","text":"Officer Training School emblem Officer Training School (OTS) is a United States Air Force and United States Space Force commissioning program located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. https://velosteam.com/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/Space-Force-Report.pdf ==Overview== Officer Training School is a part of the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, formerly the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Named for the late Major General Jeanne M. Holm, the Holm Center falls under Air University (AU), which, in turn, falls under the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), an Air Force major command (MAJCOM). In addition to OTS, the Holm Center also has oversight responsibilities for the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) pre-commissioning program on U.S. colleges and universities, the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) citizen development program in U.S. high schools, and the entire Civil Air Patrol, both its senior member program as the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (focused on search and rescue and other emergency services and disaster support), and its aerospace education and citizen development cadet program (similar to the AFJROTC cadet program) via its HQ CAP-USAF activity. The current Commander of the Holm Center (Holm Ctr/CC) is Brigadier General Leslie A. Maher, USAF and the current Commandant of OTS (OTS/CMDT) is Colonel Jayson L. Allen, USAF. During peacetime, OTS is usually the smallest commissioning source in the USAF, producing fewer officers per year than AFROTC and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). However, it possesses the capability to surge when USAF requirements dictate and exceed the combined annual officer production of both USAFA and AFROTC. Given its shorter lead time for officer production (currently 8.5 weeks versus the typically 4-year pre-commissioning process for USAFA and AFROTC cadets), OTS is the commissioning source used to balance out USAF officer manning as deemed necessary by the Air Force. The number of officers commissioned through OTS fluctuates considerably as their numbers are largely influenced by the number of graduating cadets through the USAF Academy and AFROTC, as well as being the first place the Air Force cuts when they have a surplus of cadets through the other two sources. Given this reality, OTS has often surpassed USAFA officer production during wartime periods such as during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s or the Reagan defense buildup of the 1980s. Conversely, OTS can be hard to get into during years of contraction within the national defense establishment in general and the Air Force in particular, such as the mid and late 1970s following the end of the Vietnam War and associated USAF force structure reductions or the post-Cold War era and its associated defense reductions of the early and mid-1990s. During these periods of contractions, OTS produces few officers, making selection for the OTS program particularly difficult and competitive for college graduates, especially those with no prior enlisted service, particularly USAF enlisted service. ==Structure== OTS is divided into three programs: Officer Training School (OTS) (formerly known as Basic Officer Training (BOT) and later, Total Force Officer Training (TFOT)) is the more traditional 8-week pre-commissioning program. Previously a 13-week program later reduced to 10 weeks, the renamed TFOT track transitioned to a 9-week program in 2014 and the legacy system of Officer Trainees (OT) being designated as lower classmen in the early part of the program and upper classmen in the latter part, similar to their USAFA and AFROTC counterparts, was eliminated. This was further reduced to the current 8-week program in 2017 by removing the Total Force Indoctrination Training (TFIT) from the first week of the course in which Military Training Instructors (MTIs) would teach the customs and standards of the Air Force as well as the basics of marching and drill and ceremonies. Officer Trainees were also re-designated as Cadets in 2015, again on par with USAFA and AFROTC and reminiscent of the Aviation Cadet program in operation in USAF and its predecessor incarnations (e.g., USAAS, USAAC, USAAF, etc.) from 1907 until 1965. As of 2019, the class is an 8-week program and students are once again referred to as Officer Trainees. OTS is for 4-year university and college graduates without prior military service (commonly known as non-prior service), as well as Active Component enlisted, Air Force Reserve enlisted, Air National Guard enlisted and former enlisted personnel from any of the five U.S. armed services with college degrees at the baccalaureate level degree or higher who wish to become Air Force officers. OTS serves all Active Component and Reserve Component line officers except judge advocates. Officer Training School-Abbreviated (OTS-A) (formerly known as Commissioned Officer Training (COT)) is a 5-week program primarily focused on terminal-degreed professionals (e.g., medical, lawyers, chaplains, as well as undergraduate degreed nurses) directly accessed into the USAF officer ranks. OTS-A serves all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard non-line officers (except for Reserve and Air National Guard health professionals as noted below) and judge advocates who did not previously serve as line officers in other career fields or who were not commissioned via USAFA or AFROTC. OTS and OTS-A are conducted as parallel training programs. At the beginning of a new class, OTS and OTS-A students live and train together in integrated flights. After 5 weeks, the already-commissioned OTS-A students that have successfully completed the course graduate and move on to either follow-on technical training or their initial assignments. The remaining OTS students complete several other graduation requirements (including field training) over the final 3 weeks of the course before receiving their commissions. Reserve Commissioned Officer Orientation (RCOO) (formerly known as Reserve Commissioned Officer Training (RCOT)) is a 2-week orientation program focused on Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard direct commissioned officers in health-related professions, including physicians and clinical nurses. Interested applicants for OTS typically contact Air Force recruiters specializing in officer (versus enlisted) accessions. Recruiters will screen candidates, provide application details and schedule applicants for the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT). The AFOQT covers numerous test batteries assessing math, verbal, and analytical skills, as well as measuring pilot and navigator/combat systems officer potential for those applicants aspiring to be aeronautically rated officers. AFOQT scores, college GPA, previous enlisted performance evaluations if a current or former enlisted member, and, if applicable, previous pilot skills as either an FAA-certified civilian pilot and/or as a U.S. Army warrant officer / Army Aviator will all figure into the selection process, although the selection process strives to employ a composite or \\"whole person\\" approach. OTS applicants will be given an opportunity to apply for Air Force career fields that correspond with the applicants' expertise and/or desires and will be interviewed by active duty Air Force officers as well as receive a military medical examination for flying or non-flying duty as appropriate. Applicants will then be screened by a centralized, periodic, OTS Selection Board conducted by the Air Force Recruiting Service, a component of the Air Education and Training Command. Applicants will be notified of acceptance or rejection by their recruiter pending release of the board results. If not already on active duty as enlisted personnel in the armed forces, selectees for OTS will subsequently enlist in the Air Force Reserve via the Delayed Enlistment Program and will be assigned an OTS class date. Non-prior service college graduates will enlist in the rank of Airman 1st Class (E-3) while prior service enlisted personnel will be enlisted in their current or highest prior pay grade. Upon arrival at OTS, all personnel will be advanced to pay grade E-5 (unless prior enlisted already holding a higher pay grade), but will hold the rank of Officer Trainee versus USAF Staff Sergeant. OTS is highly competitive, with selection rates varying dependent on the needs of the Air Force. For example, boards conducted circa 2010‚Äì2012 had selection rates in the 20% range due to budgetary reductions / force reductions being imposed on the Air Force at that time. However, by 2017, selection rates had increased to the 65% range or greater, reflecting the increased commissioned officer needs of the service. ==Officer Training Course== Per Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2013, personnel attending Officer Training School's 8-week program must have a baccalaureate level degree or higherAFI 36-2013, Paragraph 1.2.1.4 in either technical or non-technical fields. Technical fields may include any ABET-accredited engineering degree or other fields in high demand by the Air Force. Non-technical degrees are more common, and therefore applying with a degree in such a field is very competitive. Applicants can apply for aeronautically rated or non-rated Line Officer of the Air Force (LAF) positions. Rated positions are flying related -- Pilot, Combat Systems Officer (previously known as Navigator), Remotely- Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Pilot, or Air Battle Manager. Non-rated positions fall into two categories: non-rated operations, such as missiles, intelligence, space, cyber, or weather, and non-rated support, such as aircraft maintenance, missile maintenance, logistics, civil engineer, security forces, or communications. Areas of instruction at OTS include military customs and courtesies, military history, Air Force traditions and culture, leadership, field exercises, drill and ceremonies, small arms training, and combatives. The first few weeks of training are geared toward orienting the cadet with Air Force standards. The focus is on physical training, drill and ceremonies, and academics. Cadets will be expected to work with their fellow flight and squadron members to accomplish specific tasks as required by their Flight Commander and the Cadet Wing. They will also attend multiple classes in an academic environment. Later in the program they will attend field training exercises, projects, small arms training, and building team skills by overcoming challenges in a simulated deployment environment. To graduate, cadets must meet or exceed physical standards, academic standards, and military bearing standards. Military bearing includes the ability to write and verbally brief, lead the flight, and perform duties within the Cadet Wing. Upon graduation, OTS graduates may receive either Regular or Reserve commissions as second lieutenants in the Regular United States Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, or the Air National Guard, as appropriate to their original source of entry and contract. The new second lieutenants will be appointed in either pay grade O-1, or O-1E if they have prior cumulative active service as a warrant officer or as an enlisted servicemember in any branch or component of the U.S. armed forces for at least 4 years and 1 day. If any portion of their prior service was in a reserve component and not served in an active duty status, then inactive duty reserve retirement points may be used to qualify for O-1E. If the combination of creditable active duty days and inactive duty points equals 1,460 (equivalent to exactly 4 years and 1 day of cumulative qualifying active and inactive duty), the pay grade O-1E is assigned, which is a significantly higher starting basic pay level than O-1, and remains higher until promoted to O-4. ==Officer Training School- Abbreviated== OTS-A is a 5-week course for professionals who have received a direct commission. Typically, these officers have degrees, such as MDiv, MD, DO, DPM, OD, DDS, DMD, PharmD, Physician Assistant PA-C PhD, PsyD, BSN or MSN, MSW, or JD, in the case of chaplains, physicians, physician assistant, podiatrists, optometrists, dentists, pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and lawyers, respectively. They often enter at an advanced rank, such as first lieutenant (O-2) and sometimes as captain (O-3) in compensation for their higher levels of education, and in some cases, experience. Officers can be commissioned up to the rank of colonel (O-6) if they possess the level of experience necessary. With the exception of those officers previously commissioned as line officers through USAFA, AFROTC, the 8-week program of OTS, or the Air Force Nurse program of AFROTC, most chaplains, judge advocates general (i.e., lawyers), and medical personnel go through OTS-A. OTS-A is responsible for developing medical, legal, and chaplain personnel into professional officers by instilling character, knowledge, and motivation essential to serve in the United States Air Force. The 23rd Training Squadron (23 TRS) provides a 23-training day Commissioned Officer Training course to instill leadership and officership skills in newly commissioned medical officers, judge advocates, and chaplains. The 23 TRS also conducts a 13-training day Reserve Commissioned Officer Orientation (RCOO) program for hard-to-recruit medical officers in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. ==The History of OTS== The film Wings Up (1943) helped promote the USAAF OCS When the Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program proved insufficient to meet wartime commissioned officer requirements, the United States Army Air Forces established the Officer Candidate School (OCS) on 23 February 1942 at Miami Beach, Florida, (singular) its mission being to train and commission members from the enlisted ranks. OCS moved to the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center (now Lackland AFB), Texas, in 1944 and gained the additional mission of training officers directly from civilian status in September 1951. OTS was organized at Lackland AFB, Texas, in November 1959, with the first OTS class (60-A) composed of 89 officer trainees, including 11 women, who graduated and were commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants on 9 February 1960. The number of OTS graduates has varied over the years, from 323 the first year to a high of 7,894 officers in 1967. With the establishment of OTS, Air Force OCS closed its doors and conducted its last graduation in June 1963. Concurrently, the Air Force also commenced a phaseout of its long-standing Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program at Lackland AFB. Unlike OTS, AvCad was limited to pilot and navigator candidates. In addition, AvCads had to successfully complete either undergraduate pilot training or undergraduate navigator training before they could be commissioned as Second Lieutenants. The last AvCad pilot was commissioned in October 1961 at the former Reese AFB, Texas, and the last AvCad navigator was commissioned in March 1965, at the former James Connally AFB, Texas.Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)http://o2tb.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=50:nav- cadet-program&catid;=35:n-history&Itemid;=18 OTS then became the sole organization for training future Air Force officers at Lackland AFB. On 1 July 1993, Air Training Command (ATC) merged with Air University (AU) to form the new Air Education and Training Command (AETC), with Air University becoming a direct reporting unit (DRU) under AETC. OTS, which was formerly under ATC, and Air Force ROTC, which was formerly under AU, were then realigned under both AETC and AU. Until 22 September 1993, Officer Training School was primarily located on the Medina Annex of Lackland AFB, Texas, with the last OTS class, Class 93-06, graduating from that location on that date. For a short period during the build up of the Air Force to meet the demands of the Vietnam War, as many as three OTS Squadrons were based directly at Lackland AFB. During the spring and summer of 1993, OTS gradually relocated to Maxwell AFB, Alabama, the home of Air University, commencing operations in interim facilities on 25 September 1993. Historically, the USAF Academy had been (and continues to be) headed by a lieutenant general and Air Force ROTC had been headed by a major general or brigadier general, while OTS had been headed by a colonel. In February 1997, in an effort to reduce duplication of effort and streamline administrative and reporting procedures within AU, AFROTC and OTS realigned under a newly created umbrella organization, Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Under this restructuring, OTS and AFROTC were placed under the leadership of individual USAF colonels (AFJROTC and CAP were also placed under individual USAF colonels), while general officer oversight for both OTS and AFROTC, representing three-quarters of Air Force officer production, was placed under one command, the AFOATS commander, a brigadier general. In the late 1990s, a $52 million military construction (MILCON) project commenced to build a new, dedicated OTS campus at Maxwell AFB to replace the interim facilities initially occupied in late 1993. The majority of this MILCON project was completed in 2001 and all projects relating to the Maxwell AFB OTS campus were completed by 2004. AFROTC, which had previously conducted its summer Field Training (FT) program for their cadets between their sophomore and junior academic years at various air force bases around the United States, also consolidated its summer FT program at the OTS facilities at Maxwell AFB circa 2008. As part of another organizational restructuring of AU, AFOATS was later renamed the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, while still retaining oversight of OTS, Air Force ROTC, Air Force Junior ROTC, and the Civil Air Patrol. ==See also== *Officer Candidate School ==References== ==External links== * *OTS Factsheet Officer Training School Category:Military officer training in the United States Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Air Force Officer Training School"},{"id":"1430585","text":"Wikl√∂f in Copenhagen in 2006 Lars-√Öke \\"Lasse\\" Wikl√∂f (September 21, 1944 - August 23, 2008) was a politician in the √Öland Islands, an autonomous and unilingually Swedish territory of Finland. *Minister for finance (2005‚Äì2007) *Member of the lagting (√Öland parliament) (1995‚Äì2004) *Minister for finance (1991‚Äì1995) *Member of the lagting (1988‚Äì1991) *Minister for finance (1984‚Äì1988) *Member of the lagting (1975‚Äì1979, 1 November ‚Äì 31 December 1983) ==Notes== Category:Politicians from the √Öland Islands Category:1944 births Category:2008 deaths ","title":"Lasse Wikl√∂f"},{"id":"1430589","text":"Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna of Russia (8 July 1830 ‚Äì 6 July 1911), born Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg, was the fifth daughter of Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and Duchess Amelia of W√ºrttemberg. She is an ancestor of the British, Greek, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Spanish Royal Families through her elder daughter Olga. ==Early life== Portrait by Joseph Karl Stieler, c. 1850 Alexandra's parents were married on 24 April 1817, at Kirchheim unter Teck. Alexandra had five sisters: Marie, Pauline, Henriette, Elisabeth, and Luise. Alexandra's portrait was painted by the fashionable court artist Joseph Karl Stieler. ==Marriage and issue== In the summer of 1846, she met Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia when he visited Altenburg. He was the second son of Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia, and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, n√©e Princess Charlotte of Prussia. Konstantin stayed for a few days at Alexandra‚Äôs father‚Äôs castle. His visit there had been arranged by Alexandra‚Äôs aunt, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, who had been born Princess Charlotte of W√ºrttemberg. Elena and Alexandra's mother were both descended from Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Elena was married to Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas I. Elena Pavlovna was therefore Konstantin‚Äôs aunt by marriage and Alexandra‚Äôs aunt by birth. Elena was a strong influence over Konstantin, who admired her intellect and progressive views. She had literary interests and was musical, founding the St Petersburg Conservatoire, and the young Konstantin often spent time at Elena's home and salon in St Petersburg. Konstantin was intellectual and liberal, whereas Alexandra was conservative and rather high spirited. Although their temperaments differed, they both shared an interest in music, and enjoyed playing duets at the piano.

Alexandra arrived in Russia on 12 October 1847, and was greeted by much fanfare and popular celebration, with jubilant crowds lining the streets and balconies. It was said that Alexandra looked so much like her fiance's sister, the Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolayevna, who died in childbirth, that her prospective mother-in-law burst into tears at their first meeting.Zeepvat, p.67. In February 1848, Alexandra converted to Russian Orthodoxy, taking the name of Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna, which reflected her father's name Joseph (unlike many princesses she took a patronymic, choosing to reflect her parentage rather than the usual religious or dynastic associations which was also possible because Iosif was a common name in Russia). Alexandra and Konstantin were married in The Winter Palace in St Petersburg, on 11 September 1848. Konstantin received the Marble Palace in St Petersburg as a wedding gift from his parents. Strelna on the Gulf of Finland, which Konstantin inherited when aged four, was the wedded couple's country retreat. The lively Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna took a particular interest in the grounds at Strelna, establishing a free school of gardening, where she taught classes herself. There were also educational toys for the children: a wooden mast and trampoline for gymnastics, and the transplanted cabin of one of Konstantin‚Äôs frigates. A year after their marriage Konstantin inherited the palace of Pavlovsk, situated 19 miles to the south of St Petersburg, from his uncle Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich. The public was admitted to the fine park in its grounds. The Grand-Ducal family supported an impressive concert hall situated at Pavlovsk station, which proved popular with the middle classes, and attracted names such as Johann Strauss II, Franz Liszt, and Hector Berlioz. Alexandra and Konstantin later acquired the palace of Oreanda, located in the Crimea, which had originally been built by Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna and left to her second son for his retirement. Konstantin and Alexandra had 6 children: #Nikolai Konstantinovich (1850‚Äì1918); married 1882, Nadejda Alexandrovna von Dreyer. #Olga Konstantinovna, Queen of the Hellenes (1851‚Äì1926); married 1867, George I of Greece and is a grandmother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. #Vera Konstantinovna (1854‚Äì1912); married 1874, Duke Eugen of W√ºrttemberg. #Constantin Konstantinovich (1858‚Äì1915); married 1884, Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. #Dmitry Konstantinovich (1860‚Äì1919); died unmarried. #Vyacheslav Konstantinovich (1862‚Äì1879); died unmarried. ==Family crisis== (Clockwise) Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna with her five eldest children: Nicholas, Olga, Dimitri, Vera and Constantine Constantinovich In 1867, Alexandra's eldest daughter, Olga, married King George I of Greece. She was only sixteen, and Konstantin was initially reluctant for her to marry so young. In July 1868, Olga's first child was born and was named Konstantin after his grandfather. The beginning of their daughter's family coincided with the start of the breakdown of Alexandra and Konstantin's marriage. Although he was only forty, Konstantin's struggles and travails of the previous decade‚Äî naval and judiciary reforms, the freeing of the serfs‚Äîhad prematurely aged him. As his brother Tsar Alexander II turned away from the reform that had marked his first decade on the throne, Konstantin's influence began to wane and he began to focus more on his personal life. After twenty years of marriage he had drifted away from his wife. Konstantin's heavy workload, and the couple's divergent political views and interests had over the years slowly torn away at their relationship. Alexandra was as conservative as her husband was liberal, and she had learnt to concern herself with her own society and mysticism. Soon, Konstantin turned elsewhere for sexual intimacy.King and Wilson, p.39. At the end of the 1860s, Konstantin embarked on an affair and conceived an illegitimate daughter, Marie Condousso. In the 1880s, Marie was sent to Greece, later serving as lady in waiting to her half sister, Queen Olga. Marie eventually married a Greek banker. Soon after the birth of Marie, Konstantin began a new liaison. Around 1868, Konstantin began to pursue Anna Vasilyevna Kuznetsova, a young dancer from the St Petersburg Conservatoire. She was the illegitimate daughter of ballerina Tatyana Markyanovna Kuznetsova and actor Vasily Andreyevich Karatygin. Anna was twenty years younger than Konstantin and in 1873 she gave birth to their first child. Four more would follow.Zeepvat, p.71. Konstantin bought his mistress a large, comfortable dacha on his estate at Pavlovsk; thereby lodging his second family in close proximity to Alexandra, whom he now referred to as his \\"government‚Äìissue wife\\". By this act Konstantin gave ammunition to his political enemies, with Russian society reacting to the scandal by siding with his suffering wife, Alexandra, who tried to bear his infidelity with dignity. In 1874, fresh scandal erupted when it was discovered that Alexandra and Konstantin's eldest son, Grand Duke Nikolay Konstantinovich, who had lived a dissipated life and had revolutionary ideas, had stolen three valuable diamonds from an icon in Alexandra's private bedroom, aided by his mistress, an American courtesan. Alexandra's twenty-four-year-old son was found guilty, declared insane, and banished for life to Central Asia. Alexandra suffered another bitter blow when in 1879, her youngest son, Vyacheslav, died unexpectedly from a brain haemorrhage. ==Husband's illness and death== Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna with her daughter, Queen Olga of Greece, her female-line great-granddaughter, Princess Maria of Sweden and female-line great-great-grandson, Lennart. Behind Grand Duchess Alexandra there is a portrait of Olga's late daughter and Maria's mother, Alexandra. In June 1889, Alexandra‚Äôs 18-year-old granddaughter, Princess Alexandra of Greece, returned to Russia to marry Grand Duke Paul, who was the younger brother of Tsar Alexander III. Towards the end of the wedding celebrations, Konstantin suffered a stroke. This was followed in August 1889 by a severe stroke, which left him unable to walk or speak. For the remaining three years of his life Konstantin lived with his wife in her favourite palace Pavlovsk, having a wing of the building to himself. He was confined to a bath chair, and Alexandra saw to it that Konstantin was denied contact with his mistress and illegitimate offspring.Zeepvat, p.75. Alexandra‚Äôs grandson, Christopher of Greece, wrote in his memoirs that Konstantin became so frustrated with being under Alexandra‚Äôs control that he one day grabbed her by the hair and beat her with his stick. Seeing as Christopher would have only been four years old at the time of Konstantin‚Äôs death, it is difficult to know the full truth of this story. Despite his illness, Konstantin tried to amuse himself as best he could. His grand-nephew Cyril Vladimirovich remembered skating parties at Pavlovsk, where Konstantin would watch from his sledge, and how he always \\"smelt of cigars\\".Kirill, p.17. Cyril found Alexandra a formidable woman, with her \\"high pitched voice....driving about in an open carriage with a kind of awning over it, which could be opened and closed like an umbrella. I have never seen anything quite the same anywhere else, and think that she was the only person in the world who had such an ingenious cover to her carriage\\".Kirill, p.18. When Konstantin died, in January 1892, Alexandra arranged for his mistress Anna to visit Pavlovsk and pray at Konstantin‚Äôs bedside. == Titles and styles == *8 July 1830 ‚Äì February 1848: Her Highness Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg *February 1848 ‚Äì 6 July 1911: Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna of Russia ==Ancestry== ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny.

The priesthood played a major role in the mythography of James George Frazer in The Golden Bough; his interpretation has exerted a lasting influence. ==Ancient sources== The tale of the rex Nemorensis appears in a number of ancient sources. Ovid gives a poetic account of the priesthood of Nemi in his Fasti, Book 3, 271 (on the month of March), noting that the lake of Nemi was \\"sacred to antique religion\\", and that the priest who dwelt there \\"holds his reign by strong hands and fleet feet, and dies according to the example he set himself.\\"Regna tenent fortes manibus pedibusque fugaces, / et perit exemplo postmodo quisque suo. The Latin name of the priesthood is given by Suetonius: \\"He [Caligula] caused the rex Nemorensis, who had held his priesthood for many years, to be supplanted by a stronger adversary.\\"Nemorensi regi, quod multos iam annos poteretur sacerdotio, validiorem adversarium subornavit, in Life of Caligula, 35. That same passage indicates that by the time of the early Principate, the custom of succession in the office by combat had become subject to outside control. The Greek geographer Strabo also mentions the institution: \\"and in fact a barbaric, and Scythian, element predominates in the sacred usages, for the people set up as priest merely a run-away slave who has slain with his own hand the man previously consecrated to that office; accordingly the priest is always armed with a sword, looking around for the attacks, and ready to defend himself.\\"Strabo, Geographia V, 3, 12. Pausanias gives an etiological myth on the founding of the shrine: Denarius depicting Diana Nemorensis, who was conceived as a triple goddess (diva triformis)Horace, Carmen 3.22.4, where he identifies the diva triformis as Luna, Diana, and Hecate. In Roman mythology, Hippolytus was deified as the god Virbius; Artemis was the Greek name of the goddess identified with the Roman Diana. A possible allusion to the origins of the priesthood at Nemi is contained in Vergil's Aeneid, as Virgil places Hippolytus at the grove of Aricia.Vergil, Aeneid, book VII, 761 et. seq. An alternative story has the worship of Diana at Nemi instituted by Orestes; the flight of the slave represents the flight of Orestes into exile.Servius on the Aeneid, 2.116 and 6.136. ==Ritual murder== Surviving lore concerning the rex Nemorensis indicates that this priest or king held a very uneasy position. Macaulay's quatrain on the institution of the rex Nemorensis states: : Those trees in whose dim shadow The ghastly priest doth reign The priest who slew the slayer, And shall himself be slain. This is, in a nutshell, the surviving legend of the rex Nemorensis: the priesthood of Diana at Nemi was held by a person who obtained that honour by slaying the prior incumbent in a trial by combat, and who could remain at the post only so long as he successfully defended his position against all challengers. However, a successful candidate had first to test his mettle by plucking a golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove. The human sacrifice conducted at Nemi was thought to be highly unusual by the ancients. Suetonius mentions it as an example of the moral failings of Caligula. Strabo calls it Scythian, implying that he found it barbaric. The violent character of this singular institution could barely be justified by reference to its great antiquity and mythological sanctity. The ancient sources also appear to concur that an escaped slave who seeks refuge in this uneasy office is likely to be a desperate man.Fontenrose J, The Ritual Theory of Myth, University of California Press, 1971, p. 38. ==The Golden Bough== Diana in hunting boots, from a 2nd-century Roman mosaic James George Frazer, in his seminal work The Golden Bough, argued that the tale of the priesthood of Nemi was an instance of a worldwide myth of a sacred king who must periodically die as part of a regular fertility rite. In 1990, a radio programme entitled \\"The Priest of Nemi\\" was produced by Michael Bakewell and broadcast on BBC Radio 3. This programme was based on the 1990 book The Making of the Golden Bough by Robert Fraser, which was written to mark the centenary of the first edition of Frazer's book. ==External references== The novel Nemorensis, by Simon Spurrier (set in the universe of the Elite: Dangerous MMORPG), is based on the legend. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Fraser, Robert.

It was a side-valve design with a one piece cast iron block with three main bearings. An unusual feature was that it had two separate cylinder heads that each covered three cylinders. The ignition distributor was mounted on top of the block in the gap between the heads. This engine was also used in GMC's T-10 and T-11 (their two lightest trucks) beginning in 1928. This engine displaced with a bore and stroke of and was rated at at 2400 rpm when it was introduced. The compression ratio was 4.8:1.http://www.Concept Carz.com/vehicle ===200=== In 1929, the \\"split head\\" Pontiac six was increased in displacement to . The horsepower rating increased to @ 3000 rpm. Compression was increased slightly to 4.9:1. The \\"split-head\\" six was discontinued by Pontiac at the end of the 1932 model year. Pontiac offered only eight-cylinder engines during 1933 and 1934. ==Flathead Six== ===208=== In 1935, Pontiac re-introduced their six-cylinder engine, as a straight-6. The 208 was produced in 1935 and 1936. It was a side- valve design with a timing chain, as was popular at the time. This engine featured a conventional one piece cylinder head, and the distributor was moved to the side of the block. The number of main bearings was increased to four. Like the Pontiac Straight-8 engine it also featured full-pressure oiling and insert type precision main and rod bearings. These two latter features greatly increased longevity and durability especially under high speed conditions. ===223 Pontiac/GMC=== The 223 was a side-valve engine, and used a timing chain. The straight-6 was used in Pontiac automobiles (1937‚Äì40) and GMC trucks (1938 only). ===239=== The straight-6 was similar in design to previous sixes.

Sometimes confused with the Buick designed and built aluminum V8 that Pontiac had used in the two years prior, the \\"Pontiac 215\\" was an adaptation of Chevrolet's overhead valve Generation 3 straight-6. Quite different from Pontiac's previous straight-6s, it had a smaller bore than the larger Chevrolet engine and a Chevy bellhousing, but its flywheel/flexplate bolt pattern was Pontiac's. ==Overhead cam== ===230=== OHC inline-6 A single overhead camshaft (SOHC) design was introduced by Pontiac in the 1966 model year as the standard engine in the Tempest. Offered also in 1967, the OHC 6 shared internal dimensions with the overhead valve Chevrolet straight-6 engine it was based on, but had unique cast iron block and head castings. Only the large cam carrier/valve cover was aluminum. It used jackshaft (outside of the block) for oil pump and distributor drive. The jackshaft was driven by the fiberglass reinforced timing belt. It was offered with a single one barrel carburetor, rated at . A W53 version for the Firebird produced . Considered advanced by Detroit engineering standards at the time, the Pontiac OHC 6 followed the Jeep Tornado I6 as the second post-World War II domestic- developed and mass-produced overhead cam automobile engine. The Pontiac's single camshaft was supported by journals within the aluminum valve cover; no separate bearing shells were used. The cam was driven by a noise-reducing fiberglass-reinforced cogged rubber belt instead of the usual metal chain or gears. Valves were opened with finger followers (centered under the cam) that pivoted at one end on stationary hydraulic adjusters. The oil pump, distributor, and fuel pump were driven by an external jackshaft powered by a rubber timing belt nestled within an aluminum housing bolted to the right side of the block. The head had a single port face with both exhaust and intake valves on the left side and valve stems strongly tilted towards the left. This engine was used in the 1966-67 Tempest and Le Mans and 1967 Firebird. An optional high-performance Sprint version featured high-compression pistons, hotter cam, dual valve springs, split/dual exhaust manifold, stronger coil, and the then new Rochester Quadrajet carburetor. rated at . Power was increased to in 1967. Like other Pontiac engines of the era, the OHC 6 was not available in Canada with the exception of the Sprint version of the Firebird.

The Eiksund Tunnel, the world's deepest undersea tunnel, completed in 2008, connects Ulsteinvik by road to the mainland via Norwegian County Road 653. Ulsteinvik is served by one bus company: Nettbuss Midt-Norge. However, the express route that connects Ulsteinvik directly to Oslo is operated under the Nettbuss express brand. Ulsteinvik is from the √òrsta-Volda Airport, Hovden, which has several-daily flights to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Sogndal Airport, Hauk√•sen. It is also served by the √Ölesund airport, away, but with a broader selection of national and international flights. ==See also== *List of towns and cities in Norway ==References== ==External links== *Ulstein Group *Sj√∏borg Theatre *IL H√∏dd - Major local multi-sport club. *Fjord1 - operators of local and regional bus services *Listing of bus routes that operate from or through Ulsteinvik Category:Ulstein Category:Cities and towns in Norway Category:Populated places in M√∏re og Romsdal Category:2000 establishments in Norway ","title":"Ulsteinvik"},{"id":"1430630","text":"Ernst Kozub (January 24, 1924 - December 27, 1971) was a German tenor and opera singer.

The word zabalaza means \\"struggle\\" in isiZulu and isiXhosa. Initially, as ZabFed, it was a federation of pre-existing collectives, mainly in Soweto and Johannesburg. It is now a unitary organisation based on individual applications for membership, describing itself as a \\"federation of individuals\\". Historically the majority of members have been people of colour. Initially the ZACF had sections in both South Africa and Swaziland. The two sections were split in 2007, but the Swazi group faltered in 2008. Currently the ZACF also recruits in Zimbabwe. Members have historically faced repression in both Swaziland and South Africa. The ZACF is rooted in the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) by the Dielo Truda group, but it does not accept the document uncritically. The ZACF is also inspired by the pamphlet Towards a Fresh Revolution, written by the Friends of Durruti, a grouping of Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, or National Confederation of Labour) members, during the Spanish Revolution, as well as by Georges Fontenis' post- war pamphlet Manifesto of Libertarian Communism. More recently it has come under the influence of South American especifismo, a tendency which originated in the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU, or Uruguayan Anarchist Federation).ZACF. 'What is the ZACF?'. Retrieved 4 January 2012. ZACF members are expected to be committed, convinced anarchist communist militants who must be in general agreement with the platformist principles of theoretical and tactical unity, collective responsibility, and federalism. Its activities include study and theoretical development, anarchist agitation and participation in class struggle activism. As a platformist-especifista organisation, the ZACF subscribes to the idea of an \\"active minority\\". This means that the ZACF, unlike certain anarcho-syndicalist organisations, does not seek to build purely anarchist mass movements or unions; nor does it seek to turn existing social movements into anarchist-only movements. Rather, in the tradition of social insertion championed by the Federa√ß√£o Anarquista do Rio de Janeiro (FARJ, or Anarchist Federation of Rio de Janeiro), the ZACF works within existing movements to fight for the \\"leadership of anarchist ideas\\". This entails the implementation of anarchist principles within such movements, along with a revolutionary anarchist programme. This is because the ZACF holds that the strength of trade unions, social movements and other organisations of the working class lies in their ability to unite the greatest number of workers regardless of their political, religious or ideological affiliations. At the same time, the ZACF believes such movements can only undertake a revolutionary transformation of society when they are won to revolutionary anarchist positions. ==History== The ZACF is the most recent in a rather short line of South African anarchist organisations stretching back to the early 1990s, from which it has inherited some members. Following the merger of the International Socialist League (ISL) and Industrial Socialist League into the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) in 1921, and the destruction of the semi-syndicalist Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of Africa (ICU) in the 1930s,Giliomee, H. and Mbenga, B. (2007). New History of South Africa. Cape Town: Tafelberg. pp. 248‚Äì250.Schmidt, M. and van der Walt, L. (2009). Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1). Oakland and Edinburgh: AK Press. pp.164‚Äì170. anarchism (including its syndicalist variant) only began to re- emerge as a movement in South Africa with small anarchist collectives, established primarily in Durban and Johannesburg, in the 1990s. In 1993, the Anarchist Revolutionary Movement (ARM) was established in Johannesburg; its student section included militants from the anti-apartheid movement. In 1995, a larger movement, the Workers' Solidarity Federation (WSF), replaced the ARM. The WSF incorporated a Durban-based collective which published the journal Freedom. It also produced its own journal entitled Workers' Solidarity. The WSF was in the tradition of platformism, as opposed to the far looser ARM, and focused mainly on work within black working class and student struggles. It established links with anarchist individuals and small anarchist collectives in Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia. It also helped to establish a short-lived Zambian WSF. In 1999, for a range of reasons, the WSF dissolved. It was succeeded by two anarchist collectives: the Bikisha Media Collective and Zabalaza Books. These two groups co-produced Zabalaza: A Journal of Southern African Revolutionary Anarchism,\\"Anarchism, revolutionary syndicalism and anti-authoritarian movements in South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland\\".

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, activists in these structures were involved in struggles against privatisation and evictions, and Bikisha was formally affiliated to the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF), with a Bikisha member serving as APF Media Officer. On May Day in 2003, the ZACF was formed; initially as the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Federation. The early ZACF was essentially a regroupment of local anarchist groups, bringing together a number of new anarchist collectives in Gauteng and Durban (including a local chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross), along with the Bikisha Media Collective and Zabalaza Books. In 2007, to strengthen its structures, the ZACF was reconstituted as the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front based on direct individual affiliation in a unitary structure, rather than the looser federal system in place. By this time, the ZACF also had members in Swaziland, and was running a small social centre in Motsoaledi squatter camp in Soweto. Effectively, in its first phase, the ZACF was built through the affiliation of groups, and members came into ZabFed through the groups, each with somewhat different structures, aims and recruitment systems. With the December 2007 restructuring, members joined the ZACF directly, and then the groups. The 2007 restructuring also saw the ZACF became South African only, with a separate Swazi anarchist group set up in 2008 that remained closely allied to, but distinct from, the ZACF. ZACF policy throughout has stressed the need for a non-racial formation, with members of all races, and opposed separate organisations on the lines of race or gender. While committed to promoting syndicalism in the unions, ZACF work was in practice largely focused on the so-called \\"new social movements\\", formed in South Africa in response to the perceived failures of the African National Congress (ANC) government post- apartheid. The ZACF was involved in the campaigns of the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF) and the Landless People's Movement (LPM). It has also been involved in solidarity work with Abahlali baseMjondolo and the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign.CNT.

Following the formation of the Democratic Left Front (DLF) in 2011, the ZACF has become a member organisation. However, it is critical of the mostly middle-class composition of the DLF's leadership, and of the electoral ambitions of some DLF affiliates.\\"The 'Democratic Left': A Small Step Towards United Working Class Struggle\\", Anarkismo.net, 23 February 2011.

The system is the responsibility of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space, part of the United States Space Force (formerly USSPACECOM (United States Space Command)). Space surveillance accomplishes the following: * Predict when and where a decaying space object will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere; * Prevent a returning space object, which to radar looks like a missile, from triggering a false alarm in missile-attack warning sensors of the U.S. and other countries; * Chart the present position of space objects and plot their anticipated orbital paths; * Detect new artificial objects in space; * Correctly map objects travelling in the Earth's orbit; * Produce a running catalog of artificial space objects; * Determine ownership of a re-entering space object; * Inform NASA whether or not objects may interfere with the International Space Station or satellite orbits. The SPACETRACK program represents a worldwide Space Surveillance Network (SSN) of dedicated, collateral, and contributing electro-optical, passive radio frequency (RF) and radar sensors. The SSN is tasked to provide space object cataloging and identification, satellite attack warning, timely notification to U.S. forces of satellite fly-over, space treaty monitoring, and scientific and technical intelligence gathering. The continued increase in satellite and orbital debris populations, as well as the increasing diversity in launch trajectories, non-standard orbits, and geosynchronous altitudes, necessitates continued modernization of the SSN to meet existing and future requirements and ensure their cost-effective supportability. SPACETRACK also developed the systems interfaces necessary for the command and control, targeting, and damage assessment of a potential future U.S. anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) system. There is an Image Information Processing Center and Supercomputing facility at the Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS). The resources and responsibility for the HAVE STARE Radar System development were transferred to SPACETRACK from an intelligence program per Congressional direction in FY93. ==History== ===1957‚Äì1963=== Baker-Nunn satellite tracking camera The first formalized effort by the US government to catalog satellites occurred at Project Space Track, later known as the National Space Surveillance Control Center (NSSCC), located at Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts. The procedures used at the NSSCC were first reported in 1959 and 1960 by Wahl,Wahl, E[berhart] W., Program Development in Orbital Computation at the U.S. National Space Surveillance Control Center. [Proceedings of the Second Symposium (International) on Rockets and Astronautics]. [Tokyo: May 1960.] who was the technical director of the NSSCC. In 1960, under Project Space Track, Fitzpatrick and Findley developed detailed documentation of the procedures used at the NSSCC. Project Space Track began its history of satellite tracking from 1957‚Äì1961. Early Space Track observations of satellites were collected at more than 150 individual sites, including radar stations, Baker‚ÄìNunn cameras, telescopes, radio receivers, and by citizens participating in the Operation Moonwatch program. Individuals at these Moonwatch sites recorded observations of satellites by visual means, but there were numerous observation types and sources, some automated, some only semi-automated. The observations were transferred to the NSSCC by teletype, telephone, mail, and personal messenger. There, a duty analyst reduced the data and determined corrections that should be made to the orbital elements before they were used for further predictions. After this analysis, the corrections were fed into an IBM 709 computer that computed the updated orbital data. The updated orbital data were then used in another phase of the same computer program to yield the geocentric ephemeris. From the geocentric ephemeris, three different products were computed and sent back to the observing stations for their planning of future observing opportunities. ===Missile Warning and Space Surveillance in the Eisenhower Years=== The launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union led to a US government perceived need to better track objects in space using the Space Tracking System. The first US system, Minitrack, was already in existence at the time of the Sputnik launch, but the US quickly discovered that Minitrack could not reliably detect and track satellites. The US Navy designed Minitrack to track the Vanguard satellite, and so long as satellites followed the international agreement on satellite transmitting frequencies, Minitrack could track any satellite. However, the Soviets chose not to use the international satellite frequencies. Thus, a major limitation of this system became visible. Minitrack could not detect or track an uncooperative or passive satellite. Concurrent with Minitrack was the use of the Baker-Nunn satellite tracking cameras. These systems used modified Schmidt telescopes of great resolution to photograph and identify objects in space. The cameras first became operational in 1958 and eventually operated at sites worldwide. At their peak, the Air Force ran five sites, the Royal Canadian Air Force ran two, and the Smithsonian Institution's Astrophysics Observatory operated a further eight sites. The Baker-Nunn system, like Minitrack, provided little real-time data and was additionally limited to night-time, clear weather operations. Beyond the problems in acquiring data on satellites, it became obvious that the US tracking network would soon be overwhelmed by the tremendous number of satellites that followed Sputnik and Vanguard. The amount of satellite tracking data accumulated required creation or expansion of organizations and equipment to sift through and catalog the objects. The need for real-time detection and tracking information to deal with Soviet satellite launches led on 19 December 1958 to ARPA's implementation of Executive Order 50-59 to establish a spacetrack network. This spacetrack network, Project Shepherd, began with the Space Track Filter Center at Bedford, Massachusetts, and an operational space defense network (i.e., a missile warning network). ARDC took up the spacetrack mission in late 1959 and in April 1960 set up the Interim National Space Surveillance Control Center at Hanscom Field, Massachusetts, to coordinate observations and maintain satellite data. At the same time, DOD designated the Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM), formerly Air Defense Command, as the prime user of spacetrack data. ADCOM formulated the first US plans for space surveillance. During the years that intercontinental ballistic missiles were developing as frontline weapon systems, numerous missile detection and warning sensors were being experimented with and fielded as operational sensors and most of these contributed satellite observation data at one time or another. Many have been overlooked by current histories and additional research is merited. Among these were two Trinidad detection and tracking radars; Laredo, Texas; and Moorestown, New Jersey. Additional sensors that performed or contributed to space tracking but are not yet included in this page include mechanical tracking radars on the islands of Kaena Point, Antigua, Ascension Island, Naval Station San Miguel, and Kwajalein Atoll; the three BMEWS sites; the Pave Paws sites; the AN/FSS-7 missile warning radar sites; the Passive electronically scanned array sites; Cavalier, ND; Eglin, FL; Maui Space Surveillance System; Globus II; San Vito dei Normanni Air Station; TOS/CROSS; and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. ===Air Force Space Surveillance System=== The Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), also known as the \\"space fence\\", was a very high frequency radar network located at sites across the southern United States (from California to Georgia) with a centralized data processing site at the Naval Network and Space Operations Command in Dahlgren, Virginia. AFSSS began as the Navy's Space Surveillance (SPASUR) system in 1961 (later renamed NAVSPASUR). It was transferred to the Air Force in 2004 and renamed AFSSS. The \\"fence\\" was operated by the U.S. Air Force (20th Space Control Squadron Detachment 1). The Satellite Detection and Reconnaissance Defense (the former designation of the NSSS) reached initial operating capability in 1961. The role of the \\"fence\\" grew. The system detected space objects from new launches, maneuvers of existing objects, breakups of existing objects, and provided data to users from its catalog of space objects. Orbital parameters of more than 10,000 objects were maintained in this catalog‚Äîwhich has now gained usage by NASA, weather agencies, and friendly foreign agencies. The information is essential to computing the collision avoidance information to de-conflict launch windows with known orbiting space objects. The 21st Space Wing closed the Air Force Space Surveillance System on 1 October 2013 citing resource constraints caused by sequestration. A new S-band Space Fence is under construction at Kwajalein Atoll. ==US Space Catalog== The United States Department of Defense (DoD) has maintained a database of satellite states since the launch of the first Sputnik in 1957, known as the Space Object Catalog, or simply the Space Catalog. These satellite states are regularly updated with observations from the Space Surveillance Network, a globally distributed network of interferometer, radar and optical tracking systems. Two separate catalog databases are maintained under the USSTRATCOM: a primary catalog by the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), and an alternate catalog by the Naval Space Command (NSC). By the year 2001, the number of cataloged objects was nearly 20,000. Different astrodynamics theories are used to maintain these catalogs. The General Perturbations (GP) theory provides a general analytical solution of the satellite equations of motion. The orbital elements and their associated partial derivatives are expressed as series expansions in terms of the initial conditions of these differential equations. The GP theories operated efficiently on the earliest electronic computing machines, and were therefore adopted as the primary theory for Space Catalog orbit determination. Assumptions must be made to simplify these analytical theories, such as truncation of the Earth's gravitational potential to a few zonal harmonic terms. The atmosphere is usually modeled as a static, spherical density field that exponentially decays. Third body influences and resonance effects are partially modeled. Increased accuracy of GP theory usually requires significant development efforts. NASA maintains civilian databases of GP orbital elements, also known as NASA or NORAD two-line elements. The GP element sets are \\"mean\\" element sets that have specific periodic features removed to enhance long-term prediction performance, and require special software to reconstruct the compressed trajectory. ==Shemya and Diyarbakir Radar Sites== AN/FPS-17 and AN/FPS-80 radars were placed at Shemya Island in the Aleutian Islands off the Alaskan coast in the 1960s to track Soviet missile tests and to support the Air Force Spacetrack System. In July 1973, Raytheon won a contract to build a system called \\"Cobra Dane\\" on Shemya. Designated as the AN/FPS-108, Cobra Dane replaced AN/FPS-17 and AN/FPS-80 radars. Becoming operational in 1977, Cobra Dane also had a primary mission of monitoring Soviet tests of missiles launched from southwest Russia aimed at the Siberian Kamchatka peninsula. This large, single-faced, phased-array radar was the most powerful ever built. The FPS-80 was a tracking radar and the FPS-17 was a detection radar for Soviet missiles. Both were part of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). The large detection radar (AN/FPS-17) went into operation in 1960. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar was constructed nearby. These radars were closed in the 1970s. The Pirinclik (near Diyarbakir, Turkey) intelligence collection radar site ultimately consisted of one detection radar (FPS-17) and one mechanical tracking radar (FPS-79). The Pirinclik radars were operated by the 19th Surveillance Squadron. The FPS-17 radar reached IOC on 1 June 1955 and the FPS-79 in 1964. Both radars operated at a UHF (432 MHz) frequency. Although limited by their mechanical technology, Pirinclik's two radars gave the advantage of tracking two objects simultaneously in real time. Its location close to the southern Former Soviet Union made it the only ground sensor capable of tracking actual deorbits of Russian space objects. In addition, the Pirinclik radar was the only 24-hour-per-day eastern hemisphere deep space sensor. Radar operations at Pirinclik were terminated in March 1997. ===AN/FPS-17=== With the Soviet Union apparently making rapid progress in its rocket program, in 1954 the United States began a program to develop a long range surveillance radar. General Electric Heavy Military Electronics Division (HMED) in Syracuse, NY was the prime contractor and Lincoln Laboratory was a subcontractor. This tracking radar, the AN/FPS-17, was conceived, designed, built, and installed for operation in nine months.Progress In Defense and Space, A History of the Aerospace Group of the General Electric Company, Major A.

The first installation, designated AN/FPS-17(XW-1) was at Diyarbakir (Pirinclik), Turkey, to detect Soviet launches. A second system, designated AN/FPS-17(XW-2), was installed at Laredo AFS (about northeast of Laredo AFB) in Texas, to track rockets launched from White Sands, New Mexico, and serve as a radar test bed. A third system, designated AN/FPS-17(XW-3), was installed on Shemya Island, Alaska, to detect Soviet launches. The Diyarbakir FPS-17 became operational in June 1955, the Laredo installation in February 1956, and Shemya in May 1960.Forty Years of Research and Development at Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome Air Development Center, 1992. The first two installations closed without replacements; the Shemya installation was replaced by the Cobra Dane (AN/FPS-108) radar. The FPS-17 antenna featured a fixed parabolic torus section reflector that typically stood high and wide and was illuminated by an array of radar feed horns placed in front of it. The transmitters operated in the VHF band, sending out pulses at frequencies between approximately 180 to 220 MHz.NRL Memorandum Report 1637, \\"Information on Over-the-Horizon Radar\\", Part VI, 13 August 1965. Declassified. The FPS-17 was unique in that, unlike most radar types, each site's version differed from the other sites. Differences included transmitter equipment, reflector size and number, and the number and arrangement of feed horns. Additionally, the FPS-17 was the first operational radar system to employ pulse compression techniques.\\"Radar Development at Lincoln Laboratory: An Overview of the First Fifty Years\\", William P. Delaney and William W. Ward, Vol.12, No. 2, 2000 Lincoln Laboratory Journal, pp147-166. There were two AN/FPS-17 antennas at Diyarbakir, Turkey, one antenna at Laredo, and three at Shemya in the Aleutians. ===AN/FPS-79=== The original FPS-79 antenna at Diyarbakir had a unique feature which enhanced its Spacetrack usefulness. A variable-focus feed horn provided a wide beam for detection and a narrow beamwidth for tracking. That antenna was replaced by a new antenna and pedestal in 1975. Pulse compression was used to improve both the gain and resolution of the dish antenna. Steering was mechanical; the FPS-79 had a range of . The radar site closed in 1997. After circling the Earth in an apparently dormant state for 9 months, on November 13, 1986 the SPOT 1 Ariane third stage violently separated into some 465 detectable fragments - the most severe satellite breakup yet recorded prior to 2007. Although the debris cloud did not pass over the continental United States until more than 8 hours later, personnel in the Space Surveillance Center (SSC) at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado Springs, Colorado reported that the U.S. FPS-79 radar at Pirinclik, Turkey, noticed the debris within minutes of the fragmentation. ===Blue Nine and Blue Fox=== Blue Nine refers to a project which produced the AN/FPS-79 Tracking Radar Set built by General Electric, used with the 466L Electromagnetic Intelligence System (ELINT); US Air Force.

The rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN typically tracks space objects which are 10 centimeters in diameter (baseball size) or larger. The Space Surveillance Network has numerous sensors that provide data. They are separated in three categories: dedicated sensors, collateral sensors and auxiliary sensors. Both the dedicated and collateral sensors are operated by the USSPACECOM, but while the former have a primary objective to acquire SSN data, the latter obtain SSN data as a secondary objective. The auxiliary sensors are not operated by the USSPACECOM and usually perform space surveillance collaterally. Additionally sensors are classified as Near-Earth (NE) tracking - observing satellites, space debris and other objects in lower orbits, or Deep Space (DS) - generally for asteroids and comets. * Dedicated sensors ** Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) sites ** Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) ** MOSS - an Electro-Optical (E-O) surveillance system located at the Moron Air Base, Spain ** GLOBUS II radar ** AN/FPS-85 Space Track Radar ** AN/FPS-133 Air Force Space Surveillance System, also known as the Space Fence and its replacement Space Fence ** Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) / Space Based Visible (SBV) satellites * Collateral sensors ** Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) and Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope, co-located with a GEODSS station in Maui, Hawaii ** Haystack Ultrawideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR), Haystack Auxiliary Radar (HAX) and Millstone Hill Radar ** ALTAIR and ALCOR radars at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, Kwajalein Atoll ** Ascension Range Radar, locate at the Eastern Spacelift Range ** Ground-Based Radar Prototype (GBR-P), located Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, Kwajalein Atoll * Auxiliary sensors ** Solid State Phased Array Radar System (SSPARS) / AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) system of system, deployed at multiple sites ** AN/FPS-108 Cobra Dane ** AN/FPQ-16 Perimeter Acquisition Radar Characterization System (PARCS) ==Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance== GEODSS atop the Haleakala crater Midcourse Space Experiment Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance, or GEODSS, is an optical system that uses telescopes, low-light level TV cameras, and computers. It replaced an older system of six 20 inch (half meter) Baker-Nunn cameras which used photographic film. There are three operational GEODSS sites that report to the 21st Operations Group: *Socorro, New Mexico *AMOS, Maui, Hawaii *Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory . A site at Choe Jong San, South Korea was closed in 1993 due to nearby smog from the town, weather and cost concerns. Originally, the fifth GEODSS was planned to be operated from a site in Portugal, but this was never built. Moron Optical Space Surveillance (MOSS), a transportable 22-inch aperture telescope that contributed to the GEODSS system was operational at Mor√≥n Air Base, Spain from 1997 to 2012. GEODSS tracks objects in deep space, or from about 3,000 mi (4,800 km) out to beyond geosynchronous altitudes. GEODSS requires nighttime and clear weather tracking because of the inherent limitations of an optical system. Each site has three telescopes. The telescopes have a 40-inch (1.02 m) aperture and a two-degree field of view. The telescopes are able to \\"see\\" objects 10,000 times dimmer than the human eye can detect. This sensitivity, and sky background during daytime that masks satellites reflected light, dictates that the system operate at night. As with any ground-based optical system, cloud cover and local weather conditions directly influence its effectiveness. GEODSS system can track objects as small as a basketball more than 20,000 miles (30,000 km) in space or a chair at , and is a vital part of USSPACECOM's Space Surveillance Network. Distant Molniya orbiting satellites are often detected in elliptical orbits that surpass the Moon and back (245,000 miles out). Each GEODSS site tracks approximately 3,000 objects per night out of 9,900 object that are regularly tracked and accounted for. Objects crossing the International Space Station (ISS) orbit within will cause the ISS to adjust their orbit to avoid collision. The oldest object tracked is Object #4 (Vanguard 1) launched in 1958. ==Space Based Visible (SBV) Sensor== The SSN included one spaceborne sensor, the space-based visible (SBV) sensor, carried into orbit aboard the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite launched by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in 1996. It was retired from service on June 2, 2008. The Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) pathfinder satellite now performs the mission previously handled by the MSX SBV. The Canadian military satellite Sapphire, launched in 2013, also contributes data to the SSN. ==Civil services== The USSPACECOM is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris. As the number of space debris and the value of satellites in space grew it has become important to protect civil economic activity and help satellite operators avoid collisions with debris. In 2010, USSTRATCOM was given authority to provide SSA (Space Situational Awareness) services to commercial and foreign actors. As of 2019 the following services are provided: positional data of all tracked objects, conjunction assessment, disposal/end-of-life support and more through the space-track.org website. ==See also== * Air Force Space Surveillance System * Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing observatory * Space Situational Awareness Programme, the European Space Agency's near-Earth object and space debris tracking programme * Krona space object recognition station and Krona-N, Russian telescope- and radar-based space surveillance facilities * Okno and Okno-S, Russian telescope-based space surveillance facilities * Main Space Intelligence Centre, the headquarters of the Russian military's space surveillance network, SKKP * Kessler syndrome * Space debris ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * The Space-Track website * U.S. Strategic Command Space Surveillance * Orbital Debris Quarterly News information on some of the latest events in orbital debris research. * * A GEODSS Sourcebook Category:Military equipment of the United States Category:1957 establishments in the United States Category:Space program of the United States Category:Radar networks ","title":"United States Space Surveillance Network"},{"id":"1430645","text":"BIST may refer to: *Bansal Institute of Science and Technology *Busan Institute of Science and Technology *Built-in self-test *Borsa Istanbul ","title":"BIST"},{"id":"1430646","text":"Florida Highway Patrol traffic stop A traffic stop, commonly called being pulled over, is a temporary detention of a driver of a vehicle by police to investigate a possible crime or minor violation of law. ==United States== A traffic stop is usually considered to be a Terry stop and, as such, is a seizure by police; the standard set by the United States Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio regarding temporary detentions requires only reasonable articulable suspicion that a crime has occurred or is about to occur. Professor LaFave points out that most courts have treated traffic stops like Terry stops, but the U.S. Supreme Court itself has never squarely decided the issue of whether traffic stops require probable cause or the lesser reasonable suspicion standard of Terry. Traffic stops can be initiated at any time during the detention and arrest process, ranging from stops prior to arrest or issuance of a ticket for violation based on probable cause: === Before probable cause === Traffic stops may be executed upon reasonable articulable suspicion that a crime has occurred, which can range from an observation of a possible equipment violation to suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI) based on driving behavior. In some jurisdictions, general roadblock checkpoints are applied for random checks of driver. A primary purpose of the traffic stop at this point is frequently to determine if the police have probable cause for arrest. At this stage, the police are not required to issue a Miranda warning, because a traffic stop prior to formal arrest is not consider to be custodial under Miranda, and will often ask questions intended to elicit the suspect to provide answers that may be used as evidence in the event of an arrest. Non-evidentary testing falls under this stage because implied consent laws in the US generally do not apply to Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) testing (small handheld devices, as opposed to evidential breath test devices). (For some violations, such as refusals by commercial drivers or by drivers under 21 years of age, some US jurisdictions may impose implied consent consequences for a PBT refusal, but these are generally not considered to be a refusals under the general \\"implied consent\\" laws. Participation in \\"field sobriety tests\\" (FSTs or SFSTs) is voluntary in the US.DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test, NOLO Press (\\"As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.\\")Findlaw Can I Refuse to Take Field Sobriety Tests? === Probable cause === Probable cause is the arrest stage in which sufficient evidence is available to sustain a warrant for arrest. Probable cause is a stronger standard of evidence than a reasonable suspicion, but weaker than what is required to secure a criminal conviction. In some cases, notably DUI stops, the \\"sufficient evidence\\" is used for requiring an evidentiary chemical test (e.g., evidential breathalyzer test) by invoking an implied consent request. While state terminology regarding whether evidentiary testing is an \\"arrest\\", such testing is Constitutionally a \\"search incident to arrest\\".Supreme Court says warrantless blood draws in DUI arrests are unconstitutional, ABA Journal ===Procedure=== A stop is usually accomplished through a process known as \\"pulling over\\" the suspect's vehicle. Police vehicles (except those used by undercover personnel) traditionally have sirens, loudspeakers, and lightbars that rotate or flash. These devices are used by the officer to get the attention of the suspect and to signal that they are expected to move over to the shoulder and stop. Failure to comply could result in citation of failure to yield to an emergency vehicle and possibly raise suspicion that the driver is attempting to flee. Similar alerting devices are also typically equipped on other emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances, although police departments often use blue lights to signal drivers to pull over. In all cases, such signals and the laws requiring that other vehicles pull to the shoulder allow the emergency vehicles to pass other traffic safely and efficiently when responding to emergency situations. In the case of a traffic stop, the officer pulls the patrol vehicle behind the subject vehicle as it stops instead of proceeding past as he or she would during other emergency responses. Depending upon the severity of the offense which the officer believes to have occurred, the officer may either arrest the suspect, by taking him or her to jail, or check for any outstanding warrants before issuing a citation also called a notice to appear or summons in some jurisdictions, which is essentially a traffic ticket. In some cases, officers may choose to simply issue a verbal or written warning. Many states have enacted laws requiring freeway traffic approaching the police vehicle to merge over to the left, leaving an entire lane as a buffer zone for the officer. A \\"felony\\" or \\"high-risk\\" traffic stop occurs when police stop a vehicle which they have strong reason to believe contains a driver or passenger suspected of having committed a serious crime, especially of a nature that would lead the police to believe the suspects may be armed (such as an armed robbery, assault with a weapon, or an outstanding felony warrant for the registered owner). In a high risk stop, officers attempt to provide their own safety by issuing instructions to maintain absolute control over every step of the proceedings. They will have additional officers on scene for back-up, often waiting for additional officers to join up before initiating the stop. They will typically have their weapons drawn, and stay back from the suspect vehicle, using their patrol cars for cover. If there is no choice but to make the stop on a busy street, then they will often stop traffic. They will address the driver and any passengers over the PA speaker of the patrol car, typically instructing the driver to turn the engine off, remove the keys from the ignition, and sometimes toss them out the window. They will instruct the occupants, one at a time, to exit the vehicle with empty hands showing, place their hands on top of or behind their heads, walk backwards some distance, and then lie flat on the ground, where they will remain until all occupants have done likewise, at which point officers will move up, apply handcuffs, do a body search and then secure the suspects in the patrol cars. The vehicle is then typically searched for weapons and other evidence in accordance with the arresting department's standard operating procedures (\\"S.O.P.'s\\"). The Supreme Court has held that an officer who stops a vehicle as part of a routine traffic stop has the authority to order the driver to exit the vehicle, as well as to order any passengers to exit the vehicle. ==Federal Government's role in local traffic enforcement== The Federal Government in the United States has long used local traffic enforcement as a tool to further its goals through providing funding and training. Historically, this goal has been drug interdiction, but this has been expanded to include the War on Terror. Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in cooperation with two agencies in the United States Department of Justice (the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the National Institute of Justice) actively promote a program called Data-Driven Approaches to Crime and Traffic Safety (DDACTS) which provides training to local police forces to combine traffic enforcement with fighting crime. In the past, such approaches have been accused of promoting racial profiling. ==Controversy in the United States== In the United States, traffic stops have been criticized for their use in police dragnets to check compliance with laws such as those requiring the use of seat belts or those prohibiting driving while impaired. Some people have objected that the tactic violates the United States Constitution; the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, part of the Bill of Rights, contains a provision against unreasonable search and seizure. However, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a motor vehicle is subject to a diminished expectation of privacy as compared to a home. Reasons include the fact that motor vehicles are typically driven on public streets, that said vehicles are generally subject to public licensing and registration requirements, and that said vehicles are generally held out to public view in a way different than that of traditional dwellings. *In Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the police stopping vehicles for no reason other than to check the drivers' licenses and registrations was unconstitutional. *In New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer has made a lawful arrest of a driver, he may search the passenger area of the vehicle without obtaining a warrant. Recent Court decisions have limited the scope of the search even further. *In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of sobriety checkpoints is constitutional. Under the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, states have the right to reasonably regulate the safety, health, and welfare of their citizens. *In Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405 (2005), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a dog sniff, conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess, does not violate the Fourth Amendment. *In Arizona v. Gant, (2008), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an officer must demonstrate a threat to their safety or a need to preserve evidence related to the crime of arrest in order to search a vehicle pursuant to an arrest, distinguishing New York v. Belton. *In Rodriguez v. United States (2015), a case originating in federal court, the Supreme Court declared that the protraction of a traffic stop with the intent to use a sniffer dog to search for evidence for which no reasonable suspicion exists is violative of the Fourth Amendment. ==See also== * Consent search * Firing at a vehicle * Carjacking * Motor vehicle theft * Street racing * Car chase * Traffic ticket * Police * Sheriff * Traffic police * Highway patrol * State police * Traffic warden * Fourth Amendment * Motor vehicle exception * Rodriguez v.

The term derives from a fishing technique of dragging a fishing net across the sea bottom, or through a promising area of open water. While a dragnet can refer to any kind of focused police presence, the traditional definition involves defining an area (such as a building or a city block) and/or category (such as those of a specific ethnic group within an area) and conducting at least a brief investigation of each person within. Thus, if a criminal is traced to a specific location, everyone in that location might be searched for incriminating evidence. Since the 1950s, such \\"dragnets\\" have generally been held to be unconstitutional as unreasonable search and seizure actions. While traditional \\"stop and frisk\\" dragnets have largely fallen into disuse, New York's strategy for controlling serious crime by stopping many of those loitering in areas that such loitering is thought to be associated with lesser crimes has been called a dragnet. Similarly, controversy remains over other activities held to be dragnets as well. An active area of legal controversy, for example, is that of warrantless wiretaps. If all cell phones are monitored by machine for certain words or phrases thought to be associated with terrorism, and the results are used to cue focused investigations, the American Civil Liberties Union argues that to constitute a kind of dragnet. There was a large, highly publicized dragnet in Boston after the 2013 marathon race bombing.

The engine was sold in different displacements depending on the model of car and the year and was constructed upon two distinct (possibly more) block castings.

The Royal Institution has a long history of public lectures and demonstrations given by prominent experts in the field. In the 19th century, the popularity of the public lectures given by Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution was so great that the volume of carriage traffic in Albemarle Street caused it to become the first one-way street in London.

It is currently practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ, primarily as a means of readmittance into the respective church. ==Latter Day Saint movement== In late 1839, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (by an 1838 revelation)Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989). The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) 1:302‚Äì03.H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160. was relocated to Nauvoo, Illinois. Many who were already baptized members of the church, were rebaptised either to show a renewal of their commitment to the movement or as part of a healing ordinance. ==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints == The LDS Church does not recognize baptisms performed by any other denomination. All converts to the LDS Church must be baptized under the direction of local church leaders. In this sense, the LDS Church practices rebaptism. In addition, while scripture makes it clear that baptism is necessary for salvation, early church leaders noticed that there is no scriptural prohibition against being baptized more than once. Members would often be rebaptized before serving missions or when marrying, to show determination to follow the gospel during their mission or marriage. After the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in 1844, rebaptism became a more important ordinance in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as led by Brigham Young. Young led his group to the Great Basin in what is now Utah, and most of his followers were rebaptised soon after arriving as a sign that they would rededicate their lives to Christ. During the \\"Mormon Reformation\\" of 1856‚Äì57, rebaptism became an extremely important ordinance, signifying that the church member confessed their sins and would live a life of a Latter-day Saint. Church members were rebaptized prior to new covenants and ordinances, such as ordination to a new office of the priesthood, receiving temple ordinances, getting married, or entering plural marriage. Current church policy prohibits rebaptism for these purposes. Rebaptism of somebody already known to have been baptized according to LDS doctrine is practiced only when a previously excommunicated member rejoins the church. In such cases, the wording of the ordinance is identical to that of the first baptismal ordinance. == Community of Christ == Among the Latter Day Saints who remained in the Midwest, rebaptism generally has been practiced only when an excommunicate rejoins the church. When Joseph Smith III and his mother Emma Hale Smith Bidamon joined with the \\"New Organization\\" of the church in 1860, their original baptisms were considered sufficient.

Mainstay members are Dave Haley on drums and his brother Joe Haley on guitar. Their lead vocalist, Jason Peppiatt, joined in 2004. In 2008 they signed to Nuclear Blast. As of February 2019, the band have released seven studio albums. They have undertaken Australian national tours supporting international acts, Incantation, Decapitated, Origin and Misery Index. Psycroptic have also toured Europe with Nile and with Deicide. In February 2019, the band started a co-headlining tour alongside Aversions Crown and support bands Within Destruction, Hadal Maw and Hollow World across Europe. They will also headline an upcoming 2019 tour in the United States in support of their most recent album As the Kingdom Drowns. ==History== Psycroptic were formed in Hobart in early 1999 by brothers Dave (drums) and Joe (guitar) Haley. Both were members of Disseminate, which had recorded a demo in 1998 before disbanding. The Haleys were joined by Cameron Grant on bass and (ex- Magoria) and Matthew Chalk on vocals (ex-Hemlock), who soon after became a drummer with established local death metal act M.S.I. The band's name, Psycroptic, was randomly devised by Chalk's friend and has no particular meaning. With assistance from the Tasmanian Council of the Arts, the band recorded The Isle of Disenchantment in October 2000, initially as a demo, but they issued it as a studio album. Shortly after it was released in January 2001 the band was invited to play shows in Melbourne. In late 2001 they featured at the annual Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra for the first time, later appearing in 2003 and 2005. The band recorded its second album The Scepter of the Ancients in 2003 for release through United States label Unique Leader. They played their first full Australian tour in support of American death metal band Incantation. The Haley brothers also joined Sydney-based industrial death metal band The Amenta during this period and recorded the album Ocassus with that group. Dave Haley also recorded an EP called Atom and Time with Ruins, a Hobart black metal band formed by Alex Pope in 2000. He has been a member of this band since; Joe Haley has been the touring guitarist for Ruins since they undertook a national tour with Satyricon in 2006. 2004 was a breakthrough year for the band as they played a second Australian tour, this time with Deeds of Flesh and then headed to Europe for a wide-ranging tour with Swedish bands Dismember and Anata. However, Chalk was reluctant to tour so his friend Jason Peppiatt (ex-Born Headless) was recruited to sing vocals. On returning to Australia, Psycroptic played two legs of the Metal for the Brain in Canberra and Brisbane, and a final show in their hometown of Hobart. Following this, disharmony within the band saw Chalk leave Psycroptic, and Peppiatt replace him permanently. Since his departure from Psycroptic, Chalk has continued to play drums with M.S.I. as well as a doom band called Space Raven and act in the vocal role in a number of other groups that includes Mephistopheles, playing bass in Born Headless and several other projects including the brief vocal position with Swedish band Spawn of Possession in 2009. Psycroptic undertook a handful of Australian dates with Hate Eternal before working on their third album, Symbols of Failure (January 2006), their first for Neurotic. The release was followed by another European excursion with Nile and another Australian tour, this time with Cannibal Corpse. Work began on the follow-up to Symbols of Failure in early 2007 before some European shows with Deicide. Joe Haley collapsed after one show and suffered a seizure. He later recovered but the last few dates for the tour were cancelled. On 10 June Psycroptic featured at the Come Together Music Festival in Sydney. The Haley brothers seem to have since put their membership with The Amenta aside to concentrate on Psycroptic; however Dave Haley joined Blood Duster in September 2007. In May 2008 Psycroptic played their first shows in New Zealand alongside Ruins. The following month it was announced that Psycroptic had been signed to Nuclear Blast Records. Shortly after, the band released their fourth studio album, entitled Ob(Servant) in October 2008. The live DVD Initiation was filmed in Melbourne and released in 2010. The band toured Australia with Decapitated, Origin and Misery Index in March 2010. They issued their fifth album, The Inherited Repression in February 2012. In November 2012, Psycroptic guitarist Joe Haley released a guitar tablature book for the album The Inherited Repression. Joe followed this up a year later with the release of a guitar tablature book for the album \\"Ob(Servant)\\" in October 2013. In November 2014, Psycroptic announced via Facebook that they had signed to Prosthetic Records. The subsequent self-titled album was released in March 2015. They also launched a charity outreach linked to purchasing their new single, \\"Echoes to Come\\", with the proceeds distributed to saving Tasmanian devils from extinction. ==Current members== * Jason Peppiatt ‚Äì vocals (2005‚Äìpresent) * Joe Haley ‚Äì guitar (1999‚Äìpresent) * Todd Stern ‚Äì bass guitar (2015‚Äìpresent) * Dave Haley ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äìpresent) ===Former members=== * Matthew \\"Chalky\\" Chalk ‚Äì vocals (1999‚Äì2005) * Cameron Grant ‚Äì bass guitar (1999‚Äì2015) ===Live members=== * Zdenƒõk \\"GTboy\\" ≈†imeƒçek ‚Äì vocals (live 2010 North American tour) (Godless Truth) *Samuel Guy ‚Äì bass guitar ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:18 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1999 till:01/01/2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:vox value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1999 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1999 BarData = bar:Matthew text:\\"Matthew Chalk\\" bar:Jason text:\\"Jason Peppiatt\\" bar:Joe text:\\"Joe Haley\\" bar:Cameron text:\\"Cameron Grant\\" bar:Todd text:\\"Todd Stern\\" bar:Dave text:\\"Dave Haley\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4 bar:Matthew from:01/01/1999 till:01/06/2005 color:vox bar:Jason from:01/06/2005 till:end color:vox bar:Joe from:01/01/1999 till:end color:guitar bar:Cameron from:01/01/1999 till:01/06/2015 color:bass bar:Todd from:01/06/2015 till:end color:bass bar:Dave from:01/01/1999 till:end color:drums LineData = at:01/01/2001 color:black layer:back at:01/01/2003 color:black layer:back at:01/01/2006 color:black layer:back at:01/01/2008 color:black layer:back at:01/01/2012 color:black layer:back at:10/03/2015 color:black layer:back at:09/11/2018 color:black layer:back ==Discography== === Albums === === DVDs === === Books === * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:Tasmanian musical groups Category:Australian technical death metal musical groups Category:Musical quartets Category:Nuclear Blast artists Category:1999 establishments in Australia ","title":"Psycroptic"},{"id":"1430689","text":"The Kamenick√Ω encoding (), named for the brothers Ji≈ô√≠ and Marian Kamenick√Ω, was a code page for personal computers running DOS, very popular in Czechoslovakia (since 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) around 1985‚Äì1995. Another name for this encoding is \`KEYBCS2\`, the name of the Terminate and Stay Resident utility which implemented the matching keyboard driver. It was also named \`KAMENICKY\`. It was based on the code page 437 encoding (with accented characters for Western-European languages) where most of the characters from code points 128 to 173 were replaced by Czech and Slovak characters chosen so that the glyphs of the replacement characters resembled those of the original as closely as possible, e. g. ƒç in the place of √ß. This ensured that text in the Kamenick√Ω encoding was (barely) readable even on older or cheap computers with the original fonts (which were often in videocard ROM, making modification difficult if not impossible). A supplemental feature was that the block graphic and box-drawing characters of code page 437 remained unchanged (IBM's official Central-European code page 852 did not have this property, making programs like Norton Commander look funny with corners and joints of border lines broken by accented letters). The widespread use of the Kamenick√Ω encoding was undermined neither by IBM's code page 852, nor by the Windows 3.1 introducing Microsoft Central Europe code page 1250. Only with Windows 95 and the spreading deployment of Microsoft Office did users begin to use code page 1250, which in turn is now obsoleted by Unicode. Some ambiguity exists in the official code page assignment for the Kamenick√Ω encoding: Some dot matrix printers of the NEC Pinwriter series, namely the P3200/P3300 (P20/P30), P6200/P6300 (P60/P70), P9300 (P90), P7200/P7300 (P62/P72), P22Q/P32Q, P3800/P3900 (P42Q/P52Q), P1200/P1300 (P2Q/P3Q), P2000 (P2X) and P8000 (P72X), supported the installation of optional font EPROMs. The optional ROM #2 \\"East Europe\\" included this encoding, invokable via escape sequence \`ESC R (n)\` with (n) = 23. While named \\"Kamenick√Ω\\" in the documentation, it was originally advertised by NEC as code page 867 (CP867) or \\"Czech\\". (However, it was never registered with IBM under that ID, as IBM registered another unrelated code page Israel: Hebrew, based on CP862, under that ID in 1998.) The Fujitsu DL6400 (Pro) / DL6600 (Pro) printers support the Kamenick√Ω encoding as well. The encoding was also sometimes called code page 895 (CP895), for example with FoxPro, in the WordPerfect text processor and under the Arachne web browser for DOS, but IBM uses this code page number for a different encoding, CM/Group 2: 7-bit Latin SBCS: Japanese (EUC-JP JIS-Roman) or Japan 7-Bit Latin (00895), and the IANA does not recognize the number at all. The DOS code page switching file \`NECPINW.CPI\` for NEC Pinwriters supported the Kamenick√Ω encoding under both, code page 867 and 895 as well. This encoding is known as code page 3844 in Star printers. ==Character set== Each character is shown with its equivalent Unicode code point.

It is the correlation between the variable's values and the best predictions that can be computed linearly from the predictive variables.Introduction to Multiple Regression The coefficient of multiple correlation takes values between .00 and 1.00; a higher value indicates a high predictability of the dependent variable from the independent variables, with a value of 1 indicating that the predictions are exactly correct and a value of 0 indicating that no linear combination of the independent variables is a better predictor than is the fixed mean of the dependent variable.Multiple correlation coefficient The coefficient of multiple correlation is known as the square root of the coefficient of determination, but under the particular assumptions that an intercept is included and that the best possible linear predictors are used, whereas the coefficient of determination is defined for more general cases, including those of nonlinear prediction and those in which the predicted values have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure. ==Definition== The coefficient of multiple correlation, denoted R, is a scalar that is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and the actual values of the dependent variable in a linear regression model that includes an intercept. ==Computation== The square of the coefficient of multiple correlation can be computed using the vector \\\\mathbf{c} = {(r_{x_1 y}, r_{x_2 y},\\\\dots,r_{x_N y})}^\\\\top of correlations r_{x_n y} between the predictor variables x_n (independent variables) and the target variable y (dependent variable), and the correlation matrix R_{xx} of correlations between predictor variables. It is given by ::R^2 = \\\\mathbf{c}^\\\\top R_{xx}^{-1}\\\\, \\\\mathbf{c}, where \\\\mathbf{c}^\\\\top is the transpose of \\\\mathbf{c}, and R_{xx}^{-1} is the inverse of the matrix ::R_{xx} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} r_{x_1 x_1} & r_{x_1 x_2} & \\\\dots & r_{x_1 x_N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{x_2 x_1} & \\\\ddots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{x_N x_1} & \\\\dots & & r_{x_N x_N} \\\\end{array}\\\\right). If all the predictor variables are uncorrelated, the matrix R_{xx} is the identity matrix and R^2 simply equals \\\\mathbf{c}^\\\\top\\\\, \\\\mathbf{c}, the sum of the squared correlations with the dependent variable. If the predictor variables are correlated among themselves, the inverse of the correlation matrix R_{xx} accounts for this. The squared coefficient of multiple correlation can also be computed as the fraction of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables, which in turn is 1 minus the unexplained fraction. The unexplained fraction can be computed as the sum of squared residuals--that is, the sum of the squares of the prediction errors--divided by the sum of the squared deviations of the values of the dependent variable from its expected value. ==Properties== With more than two variables being related to each other, the value of the coefficient of multiple correlation depends on the choice of dependent variable: a regression of y on x and z will in general have a different R than will a regression of z on x and y. For example, suppose that in a particular sample the variable z is uncorrelated with both x and y, while x and y are linearly related to each other. Then a regression of z on y and x will yield an R of zero, while a regression of y on x and z will yield a strictly positive R. This follows since the correlation of y with its best predictor based on x and z is in all cases at least as large as the correlation of y with its best predictor based on x alone, and in this case with z providing no explanatory power it will be exactly as large. ==References== ==Further reading== * Allison, Paul D.

It consists of ten quarters (Stadtteile): Funicular View from Luisenhof {  valign=\\"top\\"  *Loschwitz *Wachwitz *B√ºhlau *Wei√üer Hirsch *Rochwitz  valign=\\"top\\"  *Hosterwitz *Pillnitz *Niederpoyritz *Oberpoyritz *S√∂brigen } Loschwitz is a villa quarter located at the slopes north of the Elbe river. At the top of the hillside is the quarter of Wei√üer Hirsch, named after a former inn erected in 1685 by the Saxon kapellmeister Christoph Bernhard, where in 1888 the naturopathic physician Heinrich Lahmann opened a sanatorium. The quarters of Wachwitz and Pillnitz are adjacent in the east and the Rosengarten park in the west. Loschwitz is connected with the borough of Blasewitz south of the Elbe by the Blue Wonder (Blaues Wunder) bridge. Furthermore, the borough encompasses large parts of the Dresden Heath, the city's forest. The old village of Loschwitz, a wine-growing area since the 11th century, was first mentioned in a 1227 deed. About 1660 Elector John George II of Saxony had several vineyards laid out at the hillside, that soon became a fashionable recreational and residential area for the Dresden nobility and wealthy bourgeois like the composer Heinrich Sch√ºtz or the goldsmith Johann Melchior Dinglinger. The author Christian Gottfried K√∂rner had a cottage within the vineyards, where his guest Friedrich Schiller wrote the Ode to Joy in 1785. About 1800 James Ogilvy, 7th Earl of Findlater acquired large estates, where from 1850 the Elbschl√∂sser (Elbe Castles) were erected: Albrechtsberg Palace and Villa Stockhausen (Lingnerschloss) of Prince Albert of Prussia as well as Eckberg Castle, finished in 1861. The church is of especial architectural and historical interest, as is the churchyard, for the many burials of notable people. It was full by about 1800 and was replaced by Loschwitz Cemetery. A popular place is the restaurant Luisenhof, built in 1895 and named after Crown Princess Luise of Saxony. The \\"Dresden balcony\\" offers a panoramic view of the city and the Elbe valley. Nearby is the Standseilbahn Dresden funicular railway as well as the Schwebebahn Dresden, the oldest suspension railway of the world, which both are still in use. Nobility and rich citizens of Dresden used to live in Loschwitz such as Theodor K√∂rner, Carl Maria von Weber and Gerhard von K√ºgelgen. A famous inhabitant of Wei√üer Hirsch was the inventor Manfred von Ardenne with his institute for scientific research. One of his neighbours was the retired officer Friedrich Paulus, commander in the Battle of Stalingrad, who died here in 1957. Also a number of famous people stayed in Loschwitz for a short time: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Ernst Moritz Arndt, Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Leopold Auer and Anton Graff. Around the 1920-1930's Loschwitz used to be the most expensive living area of all Europe. This is evidenced in the surviving funicular railway, originally placed as an aid purely to residents in ascending the steep slopes of the river valley, and only recently having acquired novelty as a minor tourist attraction. Recently restored and operated by the local public transportation agency. ==External links== * Dresdner-Stadtteile.de (About 100 Dresden city quarters, a private website in German) ==See also== * Elbhangfest Category:Boroughs and quarters of Dresden ","title":"Loschwitz"},{"id":"1430722","text":"The first name Konstantin () is a derivation from the Latin name Constantinus (Constantine) in some European languages, such as Russian and German.

Many local areas use emergency population warnings to advise of prison escapes, abducted children, emergency telephone number outages, and other events. ==Requirements== In order to develop an effective emergency warning system, certain things are required: * an agreement as to what constitutes an emergency in the area served by the system. This differs from region to region depending on the local climate, geology, and the like. * an agreement as to who can initiate an alert. In some countries all warnings are transmitted by a single command center, while in others (such as the United States) a host of local, regional, and national agencies are authorized to initiate warnings. * a system or systems by which the information can be quickly transmitted to the population. * an education program to teach the general public how to recognize an alert or what to do if a warning is broadcast. ==United Nations program== Early warning system is the term that the International Early Warning Programme coordinated by the United Nations uses for all systems that are used to send emergency population warnings. The United Nations Development Programme uses the Send Word Now Emergency Notification System to alert its worldwide staff when an urgent situation arises. ==Methods by country== ===Australia=== The Standard Emergency Warning Signal was originally adopted by the Bureau of Meteorology in the 1970s for tropical cyclone warnings. It became a standard national emergency warning signal in 1995. It can be broadcast on radio, television, automated telephone calls and in some places by public address systems in the event of bushfire, flood, cyclone, tsunami, earthquake or terrorist attack. ===Canada=== On June 11, 2009, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved a proposal by Pelmorex, owners of The Weather Network and M√©t√©oM√©dia, to receive must-carry status for the channels, in exchange for developing a \\"national aggregator and distributor\\" of localized emergency alert messages compliant with the Common Alerting Protocol. The alert system, known as Alert Ready, built on a backend known as the National Alert Aggregation and Dissemination system (NAAD), was first established in 2010, and further expanded as a result of consultation with government officials, broadcasters, and the CRTC. In August 2014, the CRTC ruled that all television stations, radio stations, and broadcast distribution undertakings had to begin mandatory carriage of local alerts relayed through NAAD by March 31, 2015. The province of Alberta had its own system called the Emergency Public Warning System (EPWS). The EPWS was put into place after a major tornado swept through the city of Edmonton in 1987, killing 27 and causing millions of dollars in damage. Unlike the American EAS, however, broadcast of the EPWS was not mandatory on radio and television stations. It was broadcast on the CKUA Radio Network and was televised on CTV Two Alberta and other participating stations. EPWS warnings could be initiated by municipal police and fire departments, the provincial government, county authorities, tribal government agencies, Environment Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. CKUA developed and maintained the EPWS until January 2010, when it lost a bid to modernize the system to an outside vendor (the contract had provided 15% of the station's overall budget). In June 2011, an updated version of the system known as Alberta Emergency Alert was introduced, which emphasized multi-platform availability of alerts and advisories on digital platforms, such as online and through a mobile app. Participation in AEA is now considered mandatory under the CRTC's national public alerting mandate. ===France=== Alert signal in France End of alert signal in France In France, the population warning is made via air raid siren. This network is called the \\"R√©seau national d'alerte\\" (RNA). The system is inherited from the air-raid siren network (d√©fense passive) developed before World War II. It consists of about 4,500 electronic or electromechanical sirens placed all over France. In some cases, the warning signal may be played by a mobile system installed on the fire department's vehicles. The warning signal is described by d√©cret (by law) of March 23, 2007. It consists in a modulated sound going up and down (up to 380 Hz) during the first minute, and repeated three times. The end of alert is a continuous signal lasting 30 seconds. The system is tested every month, the first Wednesday at 11.45 in the north, 12.00 in the center, and at 12.15 in the south; for tests, the modulated signal is played only once. When the warning signal sounds, people are expected to remain at home or the building they are in and listen to further instructions on radio via France Info, France Inter, or local stations. Instructions may also be announced by police or fire department vehicles. ===Japan=== The J-Alert system launched in 2007 aims to allow government officials to address the population directly via loudspeakers. It aims to cover earthquake, tsunami, volcano, and military emergencies. The Earthquake Early Warning system is operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency. It is capable of delivering warnings a few seconds before S-waves can propagate to distant locations. Warnings are broadcast by radio and television stations, and compatible equipment can automatically turn on when receiving a message. EEW capability is also required for all domestic cell phones sold after 2007. JMA also issues advisories regarding tropical cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean. ===South America=== Many countries in South America have a mechanism called \\"cadena nacional\\" (). It enables the leader of the country to address the people simultaneously on all TV channels and radio stations, interrupting normal programming. In some countries, such as Argentina and Venezuela, the broadcast of these messages is obligatory. Many of these systems were created by past military governments, and political use of the mechanism is common. ===United States=== The bulk of emergency warnings in the United States are sent through the Emergency Alert System, implemented in 1997. The EAS can be activated by national, state, regional, or local authorities, including police, fire, weather, and other governmental authorities. EAS is often activated when an unpredicted emergency such as a tornado, earthquake, or release of toxic gas happens. The vast majority of EAS alerts are generated by the National Weather Service. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) program of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency is an attempt to integrate multiple public warning technologies into a coordinated nationwide \\"system of systems\\" using the Common Alerting Protocol. Systems targeted for inclusion in IPAWS include the Emergency Alert System, the Commercial Mobile Alert System using cellular telephones and other wireless devices and the NOAA Weather Radio network. Many states use existing air raid sirens to warn of tornadoes and flash floods. People living near certain nuclear facilities such as the Hanford Site in Washington have special radios in their home that are set to broadcast a warning signal in the event of a radiological emergency. Some emergencies (AMBER Alerts, for instance) are also sent out via e-mail, cellphone text message, and highway signs. Many U.S. institutions of higher education now use multiple warning technologies on their campuses, including outdoor and indoor sirens, public address systems, email and cell phone text messaging, and digital displays. Prior to the adoption of the Emergency Alert System, the US used CONELRAD from 1951-1963 and the Emergency Broadcast System from 1963-1997. ==See also== * Alert Ready (Canada) * Emergency Alert System (United States) * Standard Emergency Warning Signal (Australia) * NL-Alert (Netherlands) * Emergency Mobile Alert (New Zealand) * Wartime Broadcasting Service (United Kingdom) * Warning system (list of types) == References == ==External links == * ALERT FM- - Commercially available FM radio-based emergency notification system Category:Disaster preparedness Category:Civil defense ","title":"Emergency population warning"},{"id":"1430752","text":"300x300pxOldsmobile produced a straight-6 automobile engine from 1923‚Äì1950.

It is bounded by Forest Hills to the east, Ridgewood to the west, Woodhaven to the south, and Middle Village to the north. Glendale was built on a swampy area previously called Fresh Pond. The neighborhood was later developed into an industrial area, though it is now a more residential neighborhood. Glendale's land area is long on its east-west axis and narrow on its north-south axis. The area is surrounded mainly by cemeteries, although the neighborhood also contains several large parks, including part of Forest Park. Glendale is located in Queens Community District 5 and its ZIP Code is 11385. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 104th Precinct. Politically, Glendale is represented by the New York City Council's 30th District.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. == Boundaries == Glendale is bordered to the north by a section of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) in the western portion (Lower and Middle Glendale), and by Cooper and Metropolitan Avenues in the eastern portion (Upper Glendale). To the east, the border is the Rockaway Beach Branch of the LIRR, as well as Woodhaven Boulevard. Forest Park, along with the Jackie Robinson Parkway and a number of contiguous cemeteries, creates the southern and western borders; the borough line with Brooklyn runs through the cemeteries on the western part of the southern border. Glendale's borders are completed from the southwest (from Cooper and Wyckoff Avenues) by the Bay Ridge Branch of the LIRR and Fresh Pond Road from Myrtle Avenue to the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line right-of-way. ==History== Harry Houdini's grave The land comprising present-day Glendale was originally named Fresh Pond, a swampy area that was part of a area collectively called Newtown. The town of Newtown had been chartered by the Dutch West India Company in 1642. In turn, Fresh Pond was originally named for two freshwater ponds that, in the early 1900s, were filled in. ===19th century=== In 1847, New York State's Rural Cemetery Act ended the creation of any new cemeteries in Manhattan. Cemetery owners were encouraged to build in Brooklyn and Queens. Glendale quickly became almost encircled by cemeteries being located in what is called the \\"Cemetery Belt\\". In 1860, developer George C. Schott was given a large amount of land in Fresh Pond as repayment for a debt. Schott renamed Fresh Pond after his native Glendale, Ohio. Nine years later, John C. Schooley, a real estate agent, bought a substantial amount of property and also called it Glendale. Schooley laid out streets and divided his property into 469 lots, measuring , which he then sold off for $300 each. In 1869, a railroad stop at 73rd Street (then named Wyckoff Avenue) was opened by the South Side Railroad, which was sold in 1874 to the North Side Railroad, which then was merged into the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) in 1876, becoming part of the Montauk Branch. In 1927, the station burned down and was never replaced. The area became a thriving German farming community in the 19th century. Between the 1880s and World War I, Glendale also had many sources of entertainment. It had a bowling alley at Myrtle Avenue and 73rd Street; Cooney Herman‚Äôs Saloon; Liberty Park; Louis Hellen‚Äôs Saloon and picnic grove at Cooper Avenue and 73rd Street; and a trolley along Union Turnpike that ran to Schutzen Park. Development began along Myrtle Avenue, Glendale's main thoroughfare, as many family-run stores began opening and steam powered trolleys were introduced on \\"The Avenue\\" in 1891. ===20th century=== After World War I, Glendale's economic base shifted from farming to textiles and breweries. The largest employer was the Atlas Terminal, a vast industrial park, consisting of 16 factories. Because of the skilled work force living in the area and the many small machine shops located here, Glendale played a big part in the war effort during World War II and, especially in the Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic bombs. During World War II, most of the aircraft and military equipment made on Long Island was shipped by rail through this area. Meanwhile, new housing was being developed in the area as well; by 1937, the neighborhood's sole extant farm was being developed as housing. Between 1933 and 1936, the Interborough (now Jackie Robinson) Parkway, designed by New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses, was built through Glendale, displacing hundreds of bodies buried in the Cypress Hills Cemetery. The parkway, strongly opposed by residents of neighborhoods surrounding Forest Park, displaced Riebling‚Äôs Greater New York Park and Casino, and necessitated the redesign of the Forest Park Golf Course. Originally, Ridgewood and Glendale shared ZIP Code 11227 with Bushwick. Following the 1977 blackout, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick. Residents voted on a proposal to create a new ZIP Code, and a majority of votes were cast in favor of the proposal. The communities were given the ZIP Code 11385 in 1980. By the 1980s, Glendale was known as one of the quieter neighborhoods in New York City. Despite disrepair and crime being prevalent in other sections of the city, The New York Times reported in 1986 that \\"the graffiti, litter and potholes familiar to most New Yorkers are all but unknown in Glendale's three square miles.\\" The area was mostly middle-class with well-maintained housing stock, and had one of the lowest crime rates in New York City, but lacked a major community hub. In 1998, service to the Glendale LIRR station was discontinued. The station suffered from low ridership and inability to operate with the C3 bi-level coaches, which can stop only at stations with high level platforms. This station had only two riders daily at the time of its closure. ===21st century=== At the beginning of the 21st century, some of Glendale's industrial buildings were redeveloped. Atlas Terminal was demolished in 2004 and replaced by a shopping center called The Shops at Atlas Park, which opened in April 2006. In other parts of Glendale, companies such as Trader Joe's and Chili's took over former industrial buildings In 2012, all passenger service on the Lower Montauk Branch was discontinued. However, freight trains still operate, although in recent years, controversy over trains transporting radioactive waste through the community has arisen. All goods shipped by rail with a destination on Long Island (Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau and Suffolk counties), must come through the Fresh Pond/Fremont Yards, located in Glendale, which is the crossroads of the LIRR Montauk Branch, the Bay Ridge Branch (which serves the docks and float barges in Sunset Park, Brooklyn), the Bushwick Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad, which connects them all to the rest of the country by traveling north to Selkirk, New York, and across the Hudson River to New Jersey and west. The biggest product currently shipped from here is municipal waste and construction and demolition debris. == Demographics == Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Glendale was 32,496.Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 61.4% (19,793) White, 1.2% (384) African American, 0.2% (67) Native American, 3.1% (1,004) Asian, 0.0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (78) from other races, and 0.9% (310) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.4% (10,855) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community Board 5, which comprises Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale, had 166,924 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about equal to the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 31% between 25‚Äì44, and 26% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $71,234. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 46% in Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. == Land use == The Shops at Atlas Park Glendale, a part of Queens Community Board 5, is a working to middle class neighborhood surrounded by Forest Hills, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, Middle Village, and Kew Gardens.Media:Queens neighborhoods map.png The neighborhood is somewhat suburban in feel although it still is served by the subway and buses. Its-tree lined streets contain many different architectural styles. Compared to most other Queens neighborhoods, Glendale is long and narrow since it is essentially sandwiched by cemeteries and Forest Park. As a result, it is considered to have three areas: from east to west, they are Upper Glendale, Middle Glendale, and Lower Glendale. Each area has its own unique attributes. The easternmost portion near the Shops at Atlas Park is known as Upper Glendale and in general has more expensive homes and slightly higher income levels than the rest of Glendale. Upper Glendale has detached and semi-attached single- and two-family houses of above-average size, semi- detached wood frame houses and a number of brick townhomes with often meticulously maintained grassy front yards. Many of these were built after the 1920s. The middle portion of Glendale that straddles Myrtle Avenue is the primary business district and has a mix of semi-detached, wood frame, single- family houses as well as a number of multi-family dwellings and townhomes. The housing stock here often dates back to the late 1800s/early 1900s and as a result, a significant number of them are made of yellow Kreischer brick much like similar, landmarked buildings in neighboring Ridgewood. The western or \\"lower\\" part of Glendale has three national historic districts and includes the neighborhoods of Evergreen (near and around Evergreen Park) and Liberty Park, which is bordered by Cypress Hills Street, Cooper Avenue, 61st Street and cemeteries to the south. Like most of Glendale, Evergreen is relatively flat. It has mostly late 1800s/early 1900s semi-detached, multi-family, wood frame houses and a significant number of townhomes made of yellow Kreischer brick again similar to landmarked buildings in neighboring Ridgewood. In contrast, Liberty Park, developed in the 1920s, is built on the north slope of a hill and is dominated by detached single-family, wood-frame houses with private driveways and backyards. ===Architecture=== In the lower portion of Glendale, three national historic districts were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. These are the 75th Avenue-61st Street Historic District, Central Avenue Historic District and Cooper Avenue Row Historic District. Each of these districts contains significant numbers of early 20th century buildings made with the distinctive yellow Kreischer brick. ===Cemetery Belt=== Within Glendale's Cemetery Belt, there are numerous cemeteries that surround Glendale. The New York Times wrote in 1986 that \\"there are more tombstones in Glendale [...] than living residents,\\" with 40,000 graves at the time In 2011, the Times described the cemeteries as \\"a natural fence\\" that helped retain Glendale's middle-class reputation. The cemeteries include Cypress Hills, Lutheran All Faiths, Salem Fields, Mount Lebanon, Mount Carmel, New Mount Carmel, Beth El (New Union Field), Mount Neboh, and Union Field. Some of these cemeteries are the resting places of many famous people, including Jackie Robinson, Mae West, and Harry Houdini, at whose tomb devotees gather each year on Halloween to see if he can pull off the ultimate escape trick and return from the grave. Cypress Hills Cemetery is the site of the New York City Police \\"Arlington\\" and also contains the graves of Confederate soldiers who died in local prisons and hospitals. It also was one of the earliest military cemeteries and its most unusual resident is a circus elephant. ==Police and crime== 104th Precinct Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are patrolled by the 104th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 64-02 Catalpa Avenue. The 104th Precinct ranked 21st safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. However, the precinct covers a large diamond-shaped area, and Maspeth and Middle Village are generally seen as safer than Ridgewood. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 19 per 100,000 people, Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth's rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 235 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole. The 104th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 87.4% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 17 rapes, 140 robberies, 168 felony assaults, 214 burglaries, 531 grand larcenies, and 123 grand larcenies auto in 2018. == Fire safety == Glendale contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 286/Ladder Co. 135, at 66-44 Myrtle Avenue. In 1896, Glendale's first fire department, the Ivanhoe Park Hose Company, a volunteer fire company, was established. It was funded by Henry Meyer, a wealthy businessman, who owned a cigar factory, a lucrative holding of stocks, and a sizable amount of land, part of which would become the neighborhood of Liberty Park. The fire department's uniforms, a hose cart and the hose were subsidized by Meyer. He also undertook several construction projects, such as building pumping stations, to ensure water would be available anywhere along the major streets (i.e., Myrtle Avenue and Cypress Hills Street). Later that year, the first company was expanded with a hook and ladder and renamed Ivanhoe Fire Hook and Ladder Company and two months later became Company 10 in the Newtown Fire Department. ==Health== , preterm births and births to teenage mothers are less common in Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth than in other places citywide. In Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, there were 70 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 17.6 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth have a low population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 13%, slightly higher than the citywide rate of 12%. The concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth is , more than the city average. Twenty percent of Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth residents are smokers, which is higher than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, 19% of residents are obese, 7% are diabetic, and 20% have high blood pressure‚Äîcompared to the citywide averages of 22%, 8%, and 23% respectively. In addition, 19% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%. Ninety-two percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is higher than the city's average of 87%. In 2018, 78% of residents described their health as \\"good,\\" \\"very good,\\" or \\"excellent,\\" equal to the city's average of 78%. For every supermarket in Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, there are 5 bodegas. The nearest major hospital is Elmhurst Hospital Center in Elmhurst. ==Post office and ZIP Code== Glendale is covered by ZIP Code 11385. The United States Post Office operates the Glendale Station at 69-36 Myrtle Avenue. === ZIP Code changes === Since at least 1898, when the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens were created as part of the City of Greater New York, Glendale and Ridgewood's postal mail had been routed through the main Brooklyn post office in Williamsburg, rather than the main post office in Flushing, because they are located closer to Williamsburg. When ZIP Codes were assigned in 1963, the neighborhoods were assigned Brooklyn ZIP Codes with the 112 prefix, along with all areas whose mail was routed through a Brooklyn post office. This gave Glendale and Ridgewood a Brooklyn mailing address despite actually being located in Queens. The neighborhoods' ZIP Code of 11227 was shared with Bushwick, Brooklyn, as well as with Wyckoff Heights on the border of the two boroughs. After the 1977 New York City blackout, newspapers around the country published UPI and Associated Press photos of Bushwick residents with stolen items and a police officer beating a suspected looter, and Bushwick became known for riots and looting.Examples: \\"Policeman Discourages a Looting Suspect in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn\\" (photo).

Florida Today (Cocoa, Florida). July 15, 1977. ‚Äì via newspapers.com \\"His Share of Booty\\" (photo). Associated Press. Muncie Evening Press (Muncie, Indiana). July 15, 1977. ‚Äì via newspapers.com Afterward, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick.Lee, Jennifer 8. (November 2, 2007). \\"Is Ridgewood the New East Bushwick?\\". The New York Times. Retrieved August 21, 2009. . Following complaints from residents, Postmaster General William Bolger proposed that the ZIP Codes would be changed if United States Representative Geraldine Ferraro could produce evidence that 70% of residents supported it. After Ferraro's office distributed ballots to residents, 93 percent of the returned ballots voted for the change. The change to ZIP Code 11385 was made effective January 13, 1980. In 2007, there was a movement by Glendale residents to obtain their own ZIP Code since sharing a zip code with Ridgewood has caused many problems due to auto-fill features programmed into most computer databases. As a result, most Glendale residents receive mail addressed \\"Ridgewood\\" and have difficulties when arranging deliveries or hiring plumbers, electricians or contractors. The incorrect, misleading Ridgewood address causes many of them to go to the wrong location, since numbered roads in Queens are often broken into separate segments by barriers like railroad tracks, highways and cemeteries. In 2012, the quest to obtain a unique ZIP Code for Glendale was again brought to the forefront by Congressman Bob Turner and Assemblyman Mike Miller; the unused 11384 was suggested. This request was again denied by the Postal Service, although a compromise was offered under which the USPS modified its software to include \\"Glendale\\" as a preferred community name for the identified area. , this software modification by the USPS has not yet been updated in the City Map web site at NYC.gov, the city's official website, which still displays Queens community names based solely on names associated with ZIP Codes. As a result, addresses several miles away from Ridgewood, such as 80-00 Cooper Avenue (The Shops at Atlas Park at 80th Street), 72-25 Woodhaven Boulevard (a Trader Joe's, Staples, and Michael's location at Metropolitan Avenue) and 75-11 Woodhaven Boulevard (a Home Depot location behind 72-25 Woodhaven Boulevard) are listed by City Map as being in Ridgewood despite being located in Glendale, in Rego Park, or in Forest Hills. == Parks == Myrtle Avenue was greatly enjoyed for its parks, often frequented by picnickers. With the steam trolley running along the Avenue, several investors bought a total of of land in the eastern end of Glendale and opened a number of parks and beer gardens. In the 1890s, on the north side of Myrtle Avenue from what is now 83rd Street to Woodhaven Boulevard, Schmidt's Woods, Glendale Schuetzen Park, Greater New York Park and Casino, and Tivoli Park‚Äîall picnic parks‚Äîopened. On the south side of Myrtle Avenue from 88th Place to Woodhaven Boulevard were El Dorado Park, Emerald Park and Florida Park. These parks drew large crowds, not only from Glendale but from Eastern Brooklyn, where there were no proper parks at the time. One of the sections of Glendale, now known as \\"Liberty Park\\", is located on the site of a former beer garden of the same name. Another section of Glendale, adjacent to the LIRR Fresh Pond/Fremont Yards, was named after the Ivanhoe Park beer garden at that location. \\"Doddies\\", located at Cooper Avenue and 74th Street, was the last of the beer gardens, surviving into the late 1960s with an outdoor picnic area and the first neighborhood bar to have a television in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Redeemer Lutheran School occupies the site of \\"Hoffman Hall\\", a beer garden and dance hall. In the mid-1920s, the parks closed because they were unable to financially weather Prohibition. From August 9, 1895 until 1898, one hundred and twenty-four parcels were bought for the new Forest Park, which is composed of many of these former picnic parks. Since Brooklyn and Queens were incorporated into New York City by the time all of the park's land was procured, the park's name was shortened from the original moniker of \\"Brooklyn Forest Park\\". A bandstand built in Forest Park in 1898 preceded a bandshell built in 1920; for almost a century, George Seuffert Sr.‚Äîand later, his son, Dr. George F. Seuffert‚Äîplayed free concerts at the bandshell every weekend until the latter died in 1995. The bandshell is now for public use. Forest Park also has a public golf course, as well as horse riding trails (stables are located nearby, off the park grounds). Forest Park Drive, which runs throughout the park, is closed to vehicles from Woodhaven Boulevard to Metropolitan Avenue, making it a popular spot for skaters. Dry Harbor Playground, at Myrtle Avenue and 80th Street, opened in 1934. It has swings, seesaws, a wavy slide, a flagpole, and a school gym. It was created when Edward Bourcier gave away of his land as part of Forest Park. The playground also consists of an attached one-story house. In 1940‚Äì1, the property of PS 67, as well as an adjoining lot, became the location of the Glendale Playground at Central Avenue and 70th Street. The playground opened in 1942. In 1949, a former Minor League Baseball field at 65th Place named Farmers‚Äô Oval after the Glendale Farmers Base Ball Club team, which had played at the field for half a century prior, was the site of a groundbreaking for a new park. In 1967, the park was officially renamed the Joseph F. Mafera Park, memorializing the late Queens Borough president. At Mafera Park, roller hockey can be played on the rink there. On the easternmost edge of Glendale, on the site between the train tracks of the Rockaway Beach and Montauk Branches of the LIRR where an old ice house once stood, is Seither Stadium, the home field of the Ridgewood, Glendale, Middle Village and Maspeth Little League. South of the Liberty Park section of Glendale (and separated by cemeteries as well as the Jackie Robinson Parkway) is Ridgewood Reservoir, a naturalistic part of Highland Park. The New York City government renovated it in 2013 by adding new period lighting and fences. == Education == Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth generally have a lower rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 33% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 16% have less than a high school education and 50% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 39% of Queens residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth students excelling in math rose from 36% in 2000 to 67% in 2011, and reading achievement rose from 42% to 49% during the same time period. Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is less than the rest of New York City. In Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth, 14% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, lower than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 82% of high school students in Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth graduate on time, more than the citywide average of 75%. ===Schools=== Glendale is home to seven schools: P.S. 68 Elementary, P.S. 91 Elementary, P.S. 113 Elementary, I.S. 119 The Glendale Intermediate School, St. John's Lutheran Elementary, Sacred Heart Elementary and Redeemer Lutheran Elementary. ===Library=== The Queens Public Library's Glendale branch is located at 78-60 73rd Place. It also has an annex at The Shops at Atlas Park. ==Transportation== The following New York City Subway stations serve Glendale: * () * () * Forest Park, which is partly in Glendale, is served near its southern edge by 75th Street‚ÄìElderts Lane (), 85th Street‚ÄìForest Parkway (), and Woodhaven Boulevard () The following MTA Regional Bus Operations bus routes serve Glendale: * : to DeKalb Avenue () or Gateway Center via 61st and 62nd Streets, Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street * : to Woodhaven Boulevard (Elmhurst) () or Howard Beach via Woodhaven Boulevard * : to East Elmhurst via Metropolitan Avenue, Woodhaven Boulevard, and Union Turnpike * : to 82nd Street‚ÄìJackson Heights () via 80th Street * : to Court Square () via Forest Avenue and Fresh Pond Road * : to LaGuardia Marine Air Terminal via 80th Street * : to Woodhaven Boulevard (Elmhurst) () or Arverne via Woodhaven Boulevard * : to ()/Woodside LIRR or () via Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway * : to Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Bus Terminal or Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer () via Metropolitan Avenue * : to Myrtle‚ÄìWyckoff Avenues () or 121st Street () via Myrtle Avenue The Long Island Rail Road had a station at Edsall Avenue and 73rd Street, which opened in 1868 and served the Montauk Branch.

He was dedicated to social justice issues and joined several charitable organizations, including Catholic Action and the St Vincent de Paul Society,https://frassatiusa.org/frassati-biography to better aid the poor and less fortunate living in his hometown of Turin; he put his own pious beliefs into practice to cater to their needs and was best known for his devotion and amiable character. Frassati was an avid mountaineer who often climbed with his friends; he was an able swimmer and athlete best known for engaging in such social activities with a range of like-minded friends. His charitable outreach towards others knew no bounds for he identified with and aided the poor and ill from his childhood. His social status granted him greater freedom in aiding others who needed it most. His cause for canonization opened in 1932 after the Turin poor made several pleas for such a cause to open. However, Pope Pius XII suspended the cause in 1941 due to a range of allegations later proven to be false which allowed for the cause to resume. Pope John Paul II beatified Frassati in mid-1990 and dubbed him the \\"Man of the Eight Beatitudes\\". ==Life== Pier Giorgio Frassati was born on 6 April 1901 ‚Äì Holy Saturday ‚Äì to Alfredo Frassati (28 September 1868 ‚Äì 21 May 1961; an agnostic who owned the noted liberal newspaper La Stampa) and Ad√©la√Øde Ametis (17 February 1877 ‚Äì 18 June 1949) who was a noted painter. His only sibling ‚Äì a sister ‚Äì was Luciana Gawronska (18 August 1902 ‚Äì 7 October 2007). His father was also active in national politics and he served in the Italian Senate before later becoming the Italian ambassador to the German nation. His parents married on 5 September 1898. His artist mother had works exhibited at an event in Venice that saw King Victor Emmanuel III purchase some of her works. His paternal grandparents were Pietro Frassati and Giuseppina Coda Canati. Frassati's inclinations to help others had manifested in his childhood. There was one occasion as a child where he answered the door to find a mother begging with her son who was shoeless. His response was to take off his own shoes and give them to the child. In 1909 his father refused to help a man who came to their door because he was drunk. The sobbing Frassati told his mother of this and she instructed him to find the man and bring him to the home for something to eat. He made his First Communion on 19 June 1911 and his first confession was heard at the church of Corpus Christi on 20 June 1910; he received his Confirmation in his parish church on 10 June 1915. Frassati was known as the \\"Terror\\" due to his fondness for practical jokes though they were in good taste. He was an average student in school, though Frassati was known among his peers for his intelligence and more so for his devotion. He failed his exams in 1913 so was sent for private studies at a school run by the Jesuits. Frassati was dedicated to works of social action that would unite people together in fellowship as a means of combating inequalities. He was an ardent opponent of fascism and did not support the regime of Benito Mussolini. There was an instance in Rome where he was arrested while protesting alongside the Young Catholic Workers Congress. He was involved with student groups as well as the Apostolato di preghiera and Catholic Action (joined in 1919) to which he dedicated himself. Frassati also became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic on 28 May 1922 to imitate the example of Dominic of Osma, in which he assumed the religious name of \\"Girolamo\\" in honor of Girolamo Savonarola. He was also devoted to the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and Catherine of Siena. The teachings of Paul the Apostle also inspired him and that saint is mentioned in a range of Frassati's letters. He often said: \\"Charity is not enough; we need social reform\\". He helped establish a newspaper entitled Momento whose principles were based on Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum. He joined the Saint Vincent de Paul group in 1918 and spent much of his time helping the poor and less fortunate. In 1918 he began his studies in engineering so he could become a mining engineer since he wanted to do this in order \\"to serve Christ better among the miners\\". Upon his graduation his father offered him either a car or a sizable fund though he chose the latter so he could give it to the poor rather than use it for himself. He also provided a bed for a tuberculosis sufferer on one occasion as well as supporting the three children of an ill widow and finding a place for an evicted woman. During the course of his studies he found himself attracted to a girl due to her candor and goodness which impressed him. He never dated her since he was apprehensive of whether or not his parents would approve of her. This prompted him to renounce such an undertaking for a relationship as he confided to his sister. His talents seemed to be limitless for he was an avid mountaineer and athlete who could swim well and could even recite Dante passages with relative ease. Frassati was a member of the Club Alpino Italiano and climbed mountains such as the Grand Tournalin and Monte Viso. He also frequented theatres and museums with friends whenever he had the chance. But, he only saw films at the cinema after learning of that film's moral qualities, since he disliked those things of a vulgar and impure nature. He did learn how to dance, though never liked it so much as he often noted. He also knew German as well as French. On 30 June 1925 he was boating with two friends on the Po River but complained of sharp pains in his back muscles. He returned home with a severe headache and had a fever on 1 July; that very day his maternal grandmother died. On 2 July a doctor was summoned and asked the prone Frassati to get up from lying down. Frassati could not move and said: \\"I can't!\\" Soon a diagnosis was made that he had poliomyelitis which exacerbated his fatigue. This fatigue prompted him to ask for a morphine shot so he could sleep easier though the doctor and his mother believed it to be imprudent to which Frassati relented. He gave his final instructions to his sister as his condition worsened and it became apparent that he would soon die. His condition grew to the breaking point at 3:00 am on 4 July in which a priest was summoned to give him the Last Rites. He was near death at 4:00 pm with his mother holding him in her arms. His final words were: \\"May I breathe forth my soul in peace with you\\". Frassati died on 4 July 1925 due to poliomyelitis at 7:00 pm. His parents expected Turin's elite and political figures to come to offer their condolences and attend the funeral and expected to find many of his friends there as well. All were surprised to find the streets lined with thousands of mourners as the cortege passed out of the reverence felt for him among the people he had helped. He was buried in the Frassati plot at the Pollone Cimitero. His remains were later transferred to the Turin Cathedral in 1981 and were found to be incorrupt upon inspection. ==Beatification== Frassati's resting place in the Turin Cathedral The poor of Turin began to petition the Archbishop of Turin to begin the cause for Frassati's canonization. The cause commenced on 2 July 1932 for a thorough examination of Frassati's life in an informative process that later concluded on 23 October 1935 after collecting a range of documentation and witness testimonies (Cardinal Maurilio Fossati oversaw this process in his role as archbishop). Frassati's writings were also collected for examination ensure no doctrinal breaches were present since that would impede the cause to a significant degree; theologians cleared them on 21 December 1938. A grave setback to the cause came in 1941 after Pope Pius XII suspended the cause upon the airing of allegations questioning Frassati's morals and claiming that Frassati went to the mountains in mixed and questionable company. His sister - sometime after this - went to Rome to discuss this with Vatican officials to rehabilitate her brother's good name rather than to resume the cause. The allegations were proven to be false and Vatican officials declared that the cause would resume. The formal introduction of the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 12 June 1978 and he became titled as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was later held following this and it concluded later in 1981. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a decree of validation on 12 June 1987 for the previous processes and received the Positio dossier from the postulation later in 1987. Theologians approved its contents on 14 July 1987 as did the members of the C.C.S. later on 28 September 1987. Frassati was proclaimed to be Venerable on 23 October 1987 after Pope John Paul II authorized a decree confirming that Frassati had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. A single miracle - often a healing medicine and science cannot explain - was needed for his beatification. The miracle investigated was the cure of Domenico Sellan (1893 - c. 1968) in late 1933 who suffered from grave tuberculosis. A priest visited him on 28 December 1933 to bring him a relic and picture of Frassati for his intercession. Sellan was healed of the disease and lived for over three more decades in perfect health. The closure of the miracle's investigation allowed for the C.C.S. to validate the process in a 20 February 1989 decree prior to the approval of medical experts on 26 April 1989. Theologians also confirmed the healing was a miracle on 30 June 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 3 October 1989. John Paul II granted final approval to the miracle on 21 December 1989 which also confirmed that Frassati would soon be beatified. John Paul II beatified Frassati in Saint Peter's Square on 20 May 1990. The current postulator for this cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre. ==Posthumous recognition== Frassati is the eponym and patron of the Frassati Catholic Academy in Wauconda which is a middle school founded in the Archdiocese of Chicago in 2010 and also the Frassati Catholic High School which opened in August 2013 in Houston. Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati Catholic School was opened as part of the Toronto Catholic District School Board on 3 September 2013 in the Scarborough area of Toronto in Canada. Frassati Catholic Academy opened in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul, in the 2014-15 school year for pre-school to 8th grade students.https://frassati-wbl.org/ The Bishop McGuinness High School in Oklahoma awards the \\"Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati Award\\" to its students who have performed a high level of service to others. Frassati Australia - based in Brisbane - venerates Pier Giorgio Frassati as their patron and as a role model for adolescent men. Frassati Australia engages them in the Catholic faith and encourages them to encounter Christ through living an authentic Catholic life in brotherhood and through charitable outreach. At the present time there are at least three Frassati Houses in Brisbane and around twelve men in these houses. Christendom College in Front Royal Virginia, a catholic liberal arts college, hosts the Frassati Invitational rugby tournament annually, starting in 2016. ===Papal recognition=== Pope John Paul II hailed Frassati - both in 1989 and in 1990 - as the \\"Man of the Eight Beatitudes\\". In 1989 John Paul II visited his tomb and paid honor to him calling him the \\"Man of the Eight Beatitudes\\". Pope Benedict XVI called upon adolescents in 2010 to follow the example of Frassati to \\"... discover that it is worth to commit oneself for God ... to respond to His call in the fundamental decisions\\" throughout one's life. Pope Francis venerated Frassati's remains in November 2015 while visiting Turin. ===World Youth Day=== Frassati's remains have been moved from their resting place in Turin twice, for two occasions of World Youth Day, with one being in Sydney in 2008, and the other in Krak√≥w in 2016. ==See also== *Luciana Frassati Gawronska ‚Äì Pier Giorgio's sister ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Saint Kateri Parish * Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati * Santi e Beati * piergiorgiofrassati.org * Pier Giorgio Frassati's official website * Frassati Catholic High School * Find a Grave * EWTN Category:1901 births Category:1925 deaths Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Burials at Turin Cathedral Category:Deaths from polio Category:Dominican beatified people Category:Dominican tertiaries Category:Lay Dominicans Category:Italian anti- fascists Category:Italian activists Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian mountain climbers Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from Turin Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II Category:Venerated Dominicans Category:Anti-capitalists ","title":"Pier Giorgio Frassati"},{"id":"1430765","text":"The Chevrolet Inline-4 engine was one of Chevrolet's first automobile engines, designed by Arthur Mason and introduced in 1913.

Others from that period included the Clavia Nord Lead (1995), Korg Prophecy (1995), Access Virus (1997) and Yamaha AN1x (1997). VA synths had the goal of recreating the sound, functionality and user interface of classic analog synthesizers. The JP-8000 was viewed at the time as the modern digital incarnation of the classic Roland Jupiter-8, from 1981. The programming interface, synthesis options and general tone is very similar to Roland's Jupiter-6 as well. The JP-8000 sought to digitally reproduce the warm analog tonalities and sheer power of its analog predecessors. Although it lacked somewhat in analog warmth due to its early digital architecture, it added many new features, such as RPS (Realtime Phrase Sequencing), which allowed short sequenced phrases to be assigned to keys, and such as motion control. It also featured the unique Supersaw oscillators and analog-style controllers such as an arpeggiator and an assignable touch response ribbon control. The JP-8000 had several features that differed from other analog modeling synthesizers of the time. Most notably, Roland's unique oscillator types (\\"Feedback\\" and \\"Supersaw\\") and the use of sliders instead of rotary encoders (knobs) to edit patch parameters. The Supersaw in particular was the reason why the JP-8000 was particularly successful as a main keyboard (along with the Virus) in the dance music market, especially for trance music. Just like what the Roland TB-303 had done for acid house and acid techno, the JP-8000's Supersaw leads became characteristic of a certain type of trance music that can be roughly called \\"Anthem Trance\\", where a melodic, powerful lead based on a Supersaw patch provided the hook and melody throughout the song. The sound processor is 16 bit. Roland JP-8080 In 1998, Roland released a 6U, 19\\" rack version of JP-8000 called the JP-8080. The JP-8080 combined the analog modeling sound engine of the JP-8000 with additional features such as an internal vocoder. The JP-8080 also had three times the number of patches and performances, an additional Noise waveform on Osc 2 and a distortion effect. Due to these changes all JP-8000 patches are compatible with the JP-8080 but not all JP-8080 patches are compatible with the JP-8000. In popular usage however the two synthesizers are usually thought of as identical in regard to sound architecture (often referred to collectively as JP-80x0). The JP-8080 is prominent on the Darude single Sandstorm. The song is named for the pad patch loaded on boot up of JP-8080. ==Supersaw== The supersaw is a waveform created by Roland for their JP-8000 and JP-8080 line of analog modeling synthesizers. It emulates the sound of multiple detuned sawtooth oscillators. The waveform is described as a free-run oscillator whose shape resembles 7 sawtooth oscillators detuned against each other over a period of time. A simple arpeggiated \\"Super Saw\\" waveform pattern from the JP-8000, demonstrating its typical usage in trance music. Since production of the JP-8000 ceased, several companies have incorporated \\"supersaw-like\\" oscillator algorithms into their hardware and software synthesizers. SUPERWAVE P8 is an example of a software synthesizer inspired by the architecture of the JP-8000, with its multiple sawtooth oscillators. Another is the Supersaw Plus, which has a JP-8000-style interface and a variation on the supersaw waveform that provides 2, 4, 6 or 10 oscillators. In 2005, Access Music released the TI-line of synthesizers, which feature an oscillator type called Hypersaw that is similar to Roland's supersaw oscillator. Roland also continues to produce other synthesizers, such as the SH-201, the SH-01, the Roland V-Synth, and the Roland V-Synth XT that have the supersaw oscillator type. The supersaw gained popularity in electronic dance music, especially with its use in hardcore, trance and Future Bass music. == References == === Notes === ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Roland JP-8000 at Vintagesynth.com * Roland JP-8000 JP8000 user comments at Dancetech.com * Roland JP8000 Sound On Sound preview (February 1997) (archive.org) * Roland JP8000 Sound On Sound review by Paul Ward (March 1997) (archive.org) * Sweetwater.com - New Roland Products (Spring 1997) (archive.org) JP-8000 Category:Virtual analog synthesizers Category:Polyphonic synthesizers Category:Digital synthesizers ","title":"Roland JP-8000"},{"id":"1430783","text":"BGI may refer to: * Bainbridge Graduate Institute, an MBA program based in Washington State * BGI Group, a genome sequencing company in China * Barclays Global Investors, an asset management business * Grantley Adams International Airport, an airport in Barbados (IATA airport code) * Borland Graphics Interface, a graphics library included with many Borland compiler products in the 1990s * Basic Ground Instructor, a certificate from Federal Aviation Administration ","title":"BGI"},{"id":"1430790","text":"Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation (OMAR) is the chief organisation in the awareness and removal of mines in Afghanistan.

It produces single, lemon- coloured inflorescences. Like most hawkweed species, it is highly variable and is a member of a species complex of several dozens of subspecies and hundreds of varieties and forms. It is an allelopathic plant. == Description == It is a hispid (hairy) perennial plant, with a basal rosette of leaves. The whole plant, with the exception of the flower parts, is covered in glandular hairs, usually whitish, sometimes reddish on the stem. The rosette leaves are entire, acute to blunt, and range from long and broad. Their underside is tomentose (covered with hair). The flowering stem (scape) is generally between tall, and sprouts from the centre of the basal rosette. The flowerheads are borne singly on the scape and are a pale lemon-yellow colour, with the outermost ligules having a reddish underside. It flowers from May until August and the flowers are visited by various groups of insects, especially flies. The plant favours dry, sunny areas. It grows well on sandy and similarly less fertile ground types. It produces stolons which generate a new rosette at their extremity, each rosette has the possibility of developing into a new clone forming dense mats in open space. It also propagates by seeds. == Ecology == It is a known allelopathic plant, whose roots secrete several substances inhibiting root growth, including its own. It can be controlled through rotation with clover and grasses where possible. Recent research claims that Pilosella officinarum exhibits an atavism by the reemergence of sexual reproduction.Science News, vol. 171, p. 302 == Similar species == Shetland mouse-ear hawkweed (Pilosella flagellaris subsp. bicapitata) is similar, but has two flowers per leaf stalk. It is found in the Shetland Islands only, on rocky coastal grassland. It flowers from May to August. == Cultivation and uses == Mouse-ear hawkweed has become a common introduced invasive species in North America (where it is found in southern Canada and both north-east and north-west United States), and New Zealand. It is a level C noxious weed in the United States (with higher levels in the states of Washington and Oregon), and a weed in Quebec. It does not have special designations in other locations of Canada. It is known to be strongly invasive in New Zealand's tussock fields, where there are no native species of hawkweed, and biological control measures are being undertaken to control it and other similar species. In Victoria and NSW, Australia, Hawkweed Sp. are declared as State Prohibited Weeds and are controlled under The Bio Security Act 2015. Currently there are several eradication programs operating (often employing volunteers) to locate, prevent the spread of and eradicate any Pilosella (Hieracium) sp. plants. Joseph Pitton de Tournefort mentions that blades covered in this plant's juices were believed to cut through stone as easily as through wood.Hieracium pilosella in the online Flore Laurentienne === Medicinal uses === The mouse-ear hawkweed contains umbelliferone, a compound similar to coumarin and a known antibiotic against brucellosis, as well as a frequent active compound in sunscreen lotions.

It is composed of former Catch 22 members Tomas Kalnoky and Jamie Egan, in addition to Nick Afflitto, Marcy Ciuffreda, Matt Dannenberg, Rachel Goldstein, Layton Hayes, John Paul Jones, Achilles Kalnoky, Paul Lowndes, Chris Paszik, Mark Rendeiro, Dan Ross, Pete Sibilia, Shane Thomson, and Natalia Ushak. ==Career== They self-released their first recording, an EP entitled A Call to Arms, in late 2001. Among its five songs was a new arrangement of the Catch 22 song ‚ÄúDear Sergio‚Äù, originally written by Tomas Kalnoky, which included a new verse and a minor renaming to ‚ÄúHey Sergio:‚Äù. They quickly sold out of their self- produced album, deciding to then offer it on their homepage for free. The EP has since been re-released in CD-DA format. Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution can be considered only a smaller side project, as it has taken a back seat to Tomas Kalnoky‚Äôs main focus, Streetlight Manifesto. A few of BOTAR‚Äôs members belong to Streetlight Manifesto. As of late 2003, BOTAR has been placed on hiatus while Streetlight Manifesto tours, but there are plans for future recordings. Both bands are members of The RISC Group. They have two LPs that have been in the works since 2001: 99 Songs of Revolution and an as yet untitled album. 99 Songs is to be a wide-ranging 8-record collection of covers, with only two of the records done by BOTAR (two others will be produced by Streetlight Manifesto and four will be performed by two Streetlight Manifesto-related projects, with two for each group). The untitled album is planned to be original material. Tomas said, in an October 8, 2006 interview, that 30 songs are written and expected to be released by BOTAR. That interview with TopWelt! can be found here On March 1, the revamped website went online with a link to the original EP on iTunes and a site called Pentimento Music Company. This new site is set up in the same style as the RISC Group‚Äôs current site, in that it is a logo over a minimalistic background. According to an update on March 16, the next album would hopefully be released around the time of or after Streetlight Manifesto‚Äôs next release, which was released on November 13, 2007. However, the update also states, ‚ÄúBut we're dealing with you-know-who here so expect it sometime before the end of our current decade.‚Äù The update also contained a recruitment statement for musicians of certain instruments who live in the Los Angeles area. To form a West Coast Division, the band wants skilled musicians for recording and hopefully touring. Also in the update was information about Pentimento Music Company, stating that it is a small label that will be releasing the group‚Äôs future albums and that its website is soon to be running. The update also stated that both BOTAR and Streetlight Manifesto have recruited people to start helping with updates to the websites. > \\"The 99 Songs of Revolution Project will consist of 8 full length records. > Two from SM, two from BOTAR, and two each from two other SM related groups. > Yes, this is indeed the record that Victory mistakenly posted as coming out > in Oct of 08.

Example of yarn bombing in Montreal, 2009, by fiber artist Olek. Fiber art refers to fine art whose material consists of natural or synthetic fiber and other components, such as fabric or yarn. It focuses on the materials and on the manual labour on the part of the artist as part of the works' significance, and prioritizes aesthetic value over utility. ==History== The term fiber art came into use by curators and arts historians to describe the work of the artist-craftsman following World War II. Those years saw a sharp increase in the design and production of \\"art fabric.\\" In the 1950s, as the contributions of craft artists became more recognized‚Äînot just in fiber but in clay and other media‚Äîan increasing number of weavers began binding fibers into nonfunctional forms as works of art. The 1960s and 70s brought an international revolution in fiber art. Beyond weaving, fiber structures were created through knotting, twining, plaiting, coiling, pleating, lashing, and interlacing. Artists in the United States and Europe explored the qualities of fabric to develop works that could be hung or free standing, \\"two or three dimensional, flat or volumetric, many stories high or miniature, nonobjective or figurative, and representational or fantasy.\\" In the UK the founding of The 62 Group of Textile Artists coincided with a growth in interest in using textile media in a fine art context. The women's movement of the same era was important in contributing to the rise of fiber art because of the traditional association of women with textiles in the domestic sphere; indeed, many of the most prominent fiber artists are women. Since the 1980s, fiber work has become more and more conceptual, influenced by postmodernist ideas. For fiber artists, in addition to long-standing experimentation with materials and techniques, this brought \\"a new focus on creating work which confronted cultural issues such as: gender feminism; domesticity and the repetitive tasks related to women's work; politics; the social and behavioral sciences; material specific concepts related to fiber's softness, permeability, drapability, and so on.\\" ==Fiber within the context of the textile arts== Modern fiber art takes its context from the textile arts, which have been practiced globally for millennia. Traditionally, fiber is taken from plants or animals, for example cotton from cotton seed pods, linen from flax stems, wool from sheep hair, or silk from the spun cocoons of silkworms. In addition to these traditional materials, synthetic materials such as plastic acrylic are now used. Prior to the development of weaving and related approaches using twisted strands, fabrics were made from single sheets of material, such as animal skins. Felting was an invention that allowed for the creation of a textile from fleece that had been sorted, combed, laid out in thin sheets that were then rolled or agitated with other friction until the tiny barbules on the fiber twisted and connected. This process created a smooth connected textile that could be cut, sewn or used in other ways. Evidence of felting was found in burial vaults in Siberia of the 7th or 8th century B.C. Weaving, however, has been the dominant way to produce clothes. In some cultures, weaving forms demonstrate social status. The more intricate the weaving, the higher the status. Certain symbols and colors also allowed identification of class and position. For example, in the ancient Incan civilization, black and white designs indicated a military status. In order for the fiber that will be used in weaving (whether plant or animal) to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be spun (or twisted) into a strand known as yarn. When the yarn is ready and dyed for use it can be made into cloth in a number of ways. Knitting and crochet are common methods of twisting and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric. The most common use of yarn to make cloth is weaving. In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a loom and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the warp. Then another strand of yarn is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp. This wrapped yarn is called the weft. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process. In Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries woven pieces called \\"tapestries\\" took the place of paintings on walls. The Unicorn in Captivity is part of a series consisting of seven tapestry panels known as The Hunt of the Unicorn by Franco Flemish from this time period. Much of the art at the time in history was used to tell common folktales that also had a religious theme. As Mark Getlein wrote, \\"Tapestry is a special type of weaving in which the weft yarns are manipulated freely to form a pattern or design on the front of the fabric...Often the weft yarns are of several colors and the weaver can use the different-colored yarns almost as flexible as a painter uses pigment on canvas.\\" At the same time period in the Middle East, fiber artists did not make tapestry or wall hanging weavings, but instead created beautifully crafted rugs. The woven rugs did not depict scenes in a story, but instead used symbols and complex designs. An example of this type of art are the giant rugs known as the Ardabil Carpets. Getlein wrote, \\"Like most Islamic carpets, they were created by knotting individual tufts of wool onto a woven ground.\\" Another fiber art technique is quilting in which layers of fabric are sewn together. Although this technique has not been around for as long as weaving, it is a popular form of art in American history. Recently, quilted fiber art wall hangings have become popular with art collectors. This non-traditional form often features bold designs. Quilting as an art form was popularized in the 1970s and 80s. Other fiber art techniques are knitting, rug hooking, felting, braiding or plaiting, macrame, lace making, flocking (texture) and more. There are a wide variety of dye techniques. Sometimes cyanotype and heliographic (sun printing) are used. Fiber artists face the same dilemma of all artists; determining \\"what is art?\\" More so with fiber arts and other media associated with handicraft, because they have long been associated with domestic or utilitarian production. Typically, pieces like pot-holders, which just follow patterns without doing anything more, are not considered works of fiber art. Fiber art works are works of art that communicate some sort of message, emotion or meaning and go beyond just the literal meaning of the materials. Fiber arts face the challenge at times of the message or meaning of the work of art being eclipsed by the study of the materials used and their history, rather than what they contribute to the overall work of art. ==Feminism and fiber art== ===History of textile work=== Sewing has often been considered women's work and not regarded as important enough to declare. Within Western Society, textiles are described usually as 'textiles' or 'fiber'. These two terms most commonly connote ideas identified with domesticity and women's creativity. This version of women's creativity is labor-intensive yet unfairly devalued as women's work, becoming invisible and described as non-productive in a hetero-normative patriarchal society.Jefferies, Janice. \\"Text and textiles: weaving across the borderlines\\". In New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies. Manchester University Press. 1995. Print. Page 164. The Industrial Revolution changed the whole industry. Women started to sew less because it became more affordable to purchase well-made clothing from stores. Fabric retailers found that they needed to convince women to return to their sewing machines, so the companies devised a variety of strategies to revitalize sewing. A theme that many retailers employed was to send out the message that sewing not only saved money and let them explore their personal style, but was also a way to be feminine and show gracefulness. Sewing was portrayed as a way to be a good mother and an attractive and thrifty wife.Gordon, Sarah A. \\"Make It Yourself: Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890‚Äì1930\\". Columbia University Press, New York. 2009. Print. Pg. 80 Dr. Deborah Thom, professor at Cambridge University, helps detail out a time where fiber art took a feminist turn during the Suffrage Movement where women were making embroidered banners for their protests.Dr. Deborah Thom \\"Woman's Hour\\", \\"BBC Radio News\\", Sat 5 November 2011 ===The reclamation of fiber arts=== In the 1970s, needlework was reclaimed by the Feminist Movement. This began the reintroduction of textiles and fiber in 'high art'. Judy Chicago founded the first feminist art program in the United States, and proceeded to coin the name Feminist Art, with many artists working with fiber arts, especially in her project Womanhouse.Viki D. Thompson Wylder and Lucy R. Lippard. Judy Chicago. Watson-Guptill Publications. June 2002. Print. Page 9. Chicago created one of the first pieces of \\"high art\\" that incorporates and celebrates needlework and fabrics within women's history, called The Dinner Party(1979). ===The Subversive Stitch=== In 1984, Rozsika Parker published The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the making of the feminine. Parker has published books on art history and psychotherapy, and uses theories from both fields in her analysis of \\"women's work\\".Mida, Ingrid, \\"Book Review: The Subversive Stitch, Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine\\", Fashion is my Muse, 29 July 2010 Parker examines the belief of women and embroidery as both feminine and natural, and the appearance of natural that is actually socially constructed. Her analysis on feminism is strongly argued that needlework signifies the relationship between women and the domestic sphere. Gendering that concept dates back to the 1500's when other crafts such as embroidery and textile work were made by women. Many people had varying reactions from emotionally moved to deeply disgraced after seeing the exhibitions 'The Subversive Stitch', of which incorporated two shows called 'Embroidery in Women's Lives 1300‚Äì1900' and 'Women in Textiles Today' in July 1989, as recorded in Pennina Barnett's article \\"Afterthoughts on curating 'The Subversive Stitch' \\". The critical response from women and feminist's reviews and articles were similar. These two shows were based on Parker's book. Barnett describes that most historical studies of embroidery concentrate on questions of style and technique, where these exhibitions track the idea of femininity that was forced upon women through embroidery from medieval times, when it was considered a high art form practiced by both men and women, to its current denotation as a 'feminine craft'. But perhaps this exhibition, with both historical and modern shows side by side provoke new ideas into the more historical objects. Adding names and dates to the creation of the objects thrusts them into the art world once again. The context in which these women worked, varying greatly because of class, race, and gender, juxtaposed with contemporary work beside names, dates, and even poetry created a language and a new critical way of looking into this medium. As Ann Newdigate states in her essay \\"Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West\\", there was a shift in textiles after The Subversive Stitch was published. ===Craftivism within fiber arts=== Craftivism is the continuation of craft for political purposes by women. It's largely linked to third-wave feminism and also other Feminist movements such as the music movement Riot Grrrl. The term craftivism was coined by Betsy Greer in 2003, and runs Craftivist Collective, however it is technically not a new term. Germaine Greer, who advocates for the connection of women, nature, and craft, argued that women's craft should be in the home because it is a living art, not in a gallery or museum because galleries and museums are representative of dead male culture. Greer supports the use of textiles in different settings, of which craftivism almost always employs. Most recently, craftism and the fiber arts have served as an important channel for the expressive of social protest, an example of which is the women's marches after the election of Donald Trump in 2018 and the pussyhat phenomenon. ===Fiber arts today=== In texts such as Hoopla: The Art of Unexpected Embroidery, written by Leanne Prain, she interviews fiber artists from all around the world working with different styles and materials about their contemporary practices within contemporary art and commercial design. The book is a documentation of interviews with many different fiber artists from around the world. All of the interviews are tailored to each different artist, however one question that Leanne Prain keeps asking is \\"Do you believe that your gender or social class has any bearing on your attraction to and involvement with needlework?\\". Many artists in the book do identify as feminists.Prain, Leanne. Hoopla: The art of Unexpected Embroidery. Arsenal Pulp Press. Vancouver, 1976. Print. However, not all fiber artists are feminists, even with its histories. In a review written by Karen Rosenberg about \\"Pricked: Extreme Embroidery\\" at the Museum of Arts and Design (January‚ÄìApril 2008), she states that it sounded like curators wanted to avoid the word 'craft' and describe these works by addressing process and materiality, of which sound \\"less dated\\". Rosenberg states that the most powerful argument against needlework as craft is the employment of threads as paint and painting or at least addressing painterly gesture. Rosenberg states that all of the artists exhibiting are attempting to blur the distinction between the decorative arts and the fine arts. However, Karen Rosenberg also critiques that the works were situated too close to each other, referring to the display as looking like a booth at a craft fair, so the success of leaving those associations behind has not been accomplished yet.Rosenberg, Karen, \\"Needling More Than the Feminist Consciousness\\", The New York Times, 28 December 2007 In the Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine, Kate Walker is quoted saying that she has The overall tone of the textile and fiber arts today sounds usually similar to feminist theory and strategy when Ann Newdigate states: In 2013, Canadian artist, Colleen Heslin won national recognition for her piece Almost Young and Wild and Free which was praised for its \\"fresh approach to a traditional medium\\" using textiles and craftwork to produce a colourful, abstract canvas of dyed materials. == List of fiber artists == * El Anatsui * Ian Berry * Alighiero Boetti * Bisa Butler * Nick Cave * Tracey Emin * Sheila Hicks * Alice Kettle * Mascha Mioni * Grayson Perry * Erin M.

The Royal School of Needlework in England is the only school dedicated solely to fiber arts. Infrastructure supporting the recognition and development of fiber arts has increased over the 20th century. Fiber arts study groups have proven to be particularly important in this regard. Two groups of note include: # the Textiles Study Group located in the U.K. was established in 1973. It began with a focus on embroidery and expanded to a wider focus on the fiber arts, particularly the delivery of education. Membership is highly selective, requiring close scrutiny of each applicants work. It maintains a core group of about 25 teachers. # the Textile Study Group of New York broadly supports appreciation of fiber arts and fiber artists. Established in 1977, there are monthly meetings during the academic year in the New York City area. This group's mission has a broad interest in serving to inspire artists and aficionados and to support networks that will build fiber arts opportunities. Members associated with both groups have made significant contributions to the field as artists, teachers, and authors. ==See also== * Textile design * Mathematics and fiber arts * String art * Wearable art *Mixed media ==References== ==External links== * Fiber Art: Following the Thread, exhibition from the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution * Fiber Art Network: Community organization for artists, collectors, enthusiasts, and leaders in the fiber art and textiles community. * Women to Watch 2012, Suendrini.com honored with the Manly E.

Medieval illumination from Chr√©tien de Troyes's romance, Yvain, le Chevalier au Lion As a literary genre of high culture, heroic romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a chivalric knight- errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest. It developed further from the epics as time went on; in particular, \\"the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the chanson de geste and other kinds of epic, in which masculine military heroism predominates.\\" Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric, or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c. 1600 they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in his novel Don Quixote. Still, the modern image of \\"medieval\\" is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word medieval evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes. Originally, romance literature was written in Old French, Anglo-Norman, Occitan, and Proven√ßal, and later in Portuguese, Castilian, English, Italian (Sicilian poetry), and German. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love, such as faithfulness in adversity. ==Form== Unlike the later form of the novel and like the chansons de geste, the genre of romance dealt with traditional themes. These were distinguished from earlier epics by heavy use of marvelous events, the elements of love, and the frequent use of a web of interwoven stories, rather than a simple plot unfolding about a main character. The earliest forms were invariably in verse, but the 15th century saw many in prose, often retelling the old, rhymed versions. The romantic form pursued the wish-fulfillment dream where the heroes and heroines were considered representations of the ideals of the age while the villains embodied the threat to their ascendancy. There is also a persistent archetype, which involved a hero's quest. This quest or journey served as the structure that held the narrative together. With regards to the structure, scholars recognize the similarity of the romance to folk tales. Vladimir Propp identified a basic form for this genre and it involved an order that began with initial situation, then followed by departure, complication, first move, second move, and resolution. This structure is also applicable to romance narratives. ===Cycles=== rightthumbHolger Danske, or Ogier the Dane, from the Matter of France Overwhelmingly, these were linked in some way, perhaps only in an opening frame story, with three thematic cycles of tales: these were assembled in imagination at a late date as the \\"Matter of Rome\\" (actually centered on the life and deeds of Alexander the Great conflated with the Trojan War), the \\"Matter of France\\" (Charlemagne and Roland, his principal paladin) and the \\"Matter of Britain\\" (the lives and deeds of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, within which was incorporated the quest for the Holy Grail); medieval authors explicitly described these as comprising all romances. In reality, a number of \\"non-cyclical\\" romances were written without any such connection; these include such romances as King Horn, Robert the Devil, Ipomadon,Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001. Ipomadon.

Indeed, some tales are found so often that scholars group them together as the \\"Constance cycle\\" or the \\"Crescentia cycle\\"‚Äîreferring not to a continuity of character and setting, but to the recognizable plot. ==Sources== Many influences are clear in the forms of chivalric romance. ===Medieval epic=== The medieval romance developed out of the medieval epic, in particular the Matter of France developing out of such tales as the Chanson de Geste, with intermediate forms where the feudal bonds of loyalty had giants, or a magical horn, added to the plot. The epics of Charlemagne, unlike such ones as Beowulf, already had feudalism rather than the tribal loyalties; this was to continue in romances. ===Contemporary society=== The romance form is distinguished from the earlier epics of the Middle Ages by the changes of the 12th century, which introduced courtly and chivalrous themes into the works. This occurred regardless of congruity to the source material; Alexander the Great featured as a fully feudal king. Chivalry was treated as continuous from Roman times. This extended even to such details as clothing; when in the Seven Sages of Rome, the son of an (unnamed) emperor of Rome wears the clothing of a sober Italian citizen, and when his stepmother attempts to seduce him, her clothing is described in medieval terminology. When Priam sends Paris to Greece in a 14th-century work, Priam is dressed in the mold of Charlemagne, and Paris is dressed demurely, but in Greece, he adopts the flashier style, with multicolored clothing and fashionable shoes, cut in lattice-work‚Äîsigns of a seducer in the era. Historical figures reappeared, reworked, in romance. The entire Matter of France derived from known figures, and suffered somewhat because their descendants had an interest in the tales that were told of their ancestors, unlike the Matter of Britain. Richard Coeur de Lion reappeared in romance, endowed with a fairy mother who arrived in a ship with silk sails and departed when forced to behold the sacrament, bare-handed combat with a lion, magical rings, and prophetic dreams. Hereward the Wake's early life appeared in chronicles as the embellished, romantic adventures of an exile, complete with rescuing princesses and wrestling with bears. Fulk Fitzwarin, an outlaw in King John's day, has his historical background a minor thread in the episodic stream of romantic adventures. ===Folklore and folktales=== The earliest medieval romances dealt heavily with themes from folklore, which diminished over time, though remaining a presence. Many early tales had the knight, such as Sir Launfal, meet with fairy ladies, and Huon of Bordeaux is aided by King Oberon, but these fairy characters were transformed, more and more often, into wizards and enchantresses. Morgan le Fay never loses her name, but in Le Morte d'Arthur, she studies magic rather than being inherently magical. Similarly, knights lose magical abilities. Still, fairies never completely vanished from the tradition. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late tale, but the Green Knight himself is an otherworldly being. Early persecuted heroines were often driven from their husbands' homes by the persecutions of their mothers-in-law, whose motives are seldom delineated, and whose accusations are of the heroines' having borne monstrous children, committed infanticide, or practiced witchcraft ‚Äî all of which appear in such fairy tales as The Girl Without Hands and many others. As time progressed, a new persecutor appeared: a courtier who was rejected by the woman or whose ambition requires her removal, and who accuses her of adultery or high treason, motifs not duplicated in fairy tales. While he never eliminates the mother-in-law, many romances such as Valentine and Orson have later variants that change from the mother-in-law to the courtier, whereas a more recent version never goes back. In Italy there is the story called Il Bel Gherardino. It is the most ancient prototype of an Italian singing fairy tale by an anonymous Tuscan author. It tells the story of a young Italian knight, depleted for its \\"magnanimitas\\", who gets the love of a fairy. When he loses this love because he does not comply with his conditions, Gherardino reconquers his lady after a series of labours, including the prison where he is rescued by another woman and a tournament where he wins. Other examples of Italian (Tuscan) poetry tales are Antonio Pucci's literature: Gismirante, Il Brutto di Bretagna or Brito di Bretagna (\\"The ugly knight of Britain\\") and Madonna Lionessa (\\"Lioness Lady\\"). Another work of a second anonymous Italian author that is worth mentioning is Istoria di Tre Giovani Disperati e di Tre Fate (\\"Story of three desperate boys and three fairies\\"). ===Classical origins=== Some romances, such as Apollonius of Tyre, show classical pagan origins. Tales of the Matter of Rome in particular may be derived from such works as the Alexander Romance. Ovid was used as a source for tales of Jason and Medea, which were cast in romance in a more fairy-tale like form, probably closer to the older forms than Ovid's rhetoric. It also drew upon the traditions of magic that were attributed to such figures as Virgil. ===Religious practices=== The Arthurian cycle also contains many magical elements, some of which appear to be Celtic in origin, but which are chiefly drawn from Christian ritual and story. ===Courtly love=== The new courtly love was not one of the original elements of the genre, but quickly became very important when introduced. It was introduced to the romance by Chretien de Troyes, combining it with the Matter of Britain, new to French poets. In Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart (unlike his earlier Erec and Enide), the behavior of Lancelot conforms to the courtly love ideal; it also, though still full of adventure, devotes an unprecedented amount of time to dealing with the psychological aspects of the love. By the end of the 14th century, counter to the earliest formulations, many French and English romances combined courtly love, with love sickness and devotion on the man's part, with the couple's subsequent marriage; this featured in Sir Degrevant, Sir Torrent of Portyngale, Sir Eglamour, and William of Palerne. Ipomadon even explicitly describes the married couple as lovers, and the plot of Sir Otuel was altered, to allow him to marry Belyssant. Similarly, Iberian romances of the 14th century praised monogamy and marriage in such tales as Tirant lo Blanc and Amadis of Gaul. ==Early forms== A knight rescues a lady from a dragon. Many medieval romances recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, heroic knight, often of super-human ability, who, abiding chivalry's strict codes of honor and demeanor, goes on a quest, and fights and defeats monsters and giants, thereby winning favor with a lady. The Matter of France, most popular early, did not lend itself to the subject of courtly love, but rather dealt with heroic adventure: in The Song of Roland, Roland, though betrothed to Oliver's sister, does not think of her during the course of events. The themes of love were, however, to soon appear, particularly in the Matter of Britain, leading to even the French regarding King Arthur's court as the exemplar of true and noble love, so much so that even the earliest writers about courtly love would claim it had reached its true excellence there, and love was not what it was in King Arthur's day. A perennial theme was the rescue of a lady from the imperiling monster, a theme that would remain throughout the romances of the medieval era. Originally, this literature was written in Old French, Anglo-Norman and Occitan, later, in Spanish, English and German ‚Äì amongst the important Spanish texts were Cantar de Mio Cid and Book of the Knight Zifar; notable later English works being King Horn (a translation of the Anglo-Norman (AN) Romance of Horn of Mestre Thomas), and Havelok the Dane (a translation of the anonymous AN Lai d'Haveloc); around the same time Gottfried von Strassburg's version of the Tristan of Thomas of Britain (a different Thomas to the author of 'Horn') and Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival translated classic French romance narrative into the German tongue. == Forms of the High Middle Ages == During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose, and extensively amplified through cycles of continuation. These were collated in the vast, polymorphous manuscript witnesses comprising what is now known as the Vulgate Cycle, with the romance of La Mort le Roi Artu c. 1230, perhaps its final installment. These texts, together with a wide range of further Arthurian material, such as that found in the anonymous cycle of English Brut Chronicles, comprised the bases of Malory's Morte d'Arthur. Prose literature thus increasingly dominated the expression of romance narrative in the later Middle Ages, at least until the resurgence of verse during the high Renaissance in the oeuvres of Ludovico Ariosto, Torquato Tasso, and Edmund Spenser. In Old Norse, they are the prose riddaras√∂gur or chivalric sagas. The genre began in thirteenth-century Norway with translations of French chansons de geste; it soon expanded to similar indigenous creations. The early fourteenth century saw the emergence of Scandinavian verse romance in Sweden under the patronage of Queen Euphemia of R√ºgen, who commissioned the Eufemiavisorna. ==Late Medieval and Renaissance forms== In late medieval and Renaissance high culture, the important European literary trend was to fantastic fictions in the mode of Romance. Exemplary work, such as the English Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory (c. 1408-1471), the Catalan Tirant lo Blanch, and the Castilian or Portuguese Amadis de Gaula (1508), spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received, producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando furioso and Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata and other 16th-century literary works in the romance genre. The romances were freely drawn upon for royal pageantry. Queen Elizabeth I's Accession Day tilts, for instance, drew freely on the multiplicity of incident from romances for the knights' disguises. Knights even assumed the names of romantic figures, such as the Swan Knight, or the coat-of-arms of such figures as Lancelot or Tristan. From the high Middle Ages, in works of piety, clerical critics often deemed romances to be harmful worldly distractions from more substantive or moral works, and by 1600 many secular readers would agree; in the judgement of many learned readers in the shifting intellectual atmosphere of the 17th century, the romance was trite and childish literature, inspiring only broken-down ageing and provincial persons such as Don Quixote, knight of the culturally isolated province of La Mancha. (Don Quixote [1605, 1615], by Miguel de Cervantes [1547-1616], is a satirical story of an elderly country gentleman, living in La Mancha province, who is so obsessed by chivalric romances that he seeks to emulate their various heroes.) Hudibras also lampoons the faded conventions of chivalrous romance, from an ironic, consciously realistic viewpoint. Some of the magical and exotic atmosphere of Romance informed tragedies for the stage, such as John Dryden's collaborative The Indian Queen (1664) as well as Restoration spectaculars and opera seria, such as Handel's Rinaldo (1711), based on a magical interlude in Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata. In the Renaissance, also, the romance genre was bitterly attacked as barbarous and silly by the humanists, who exalted Greek and Latin classics and classical forms, an attack that was not in that century very effective among the common readers. In England, romances continued; heavily rhetorical, they often had complex plots and high sentiment, such as in Robert Greene's Pandosto (the source for William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale) and Thomas Lodge's Rosalynde (based on the medieval romance Gamelyn and the source for As You Like It), Robert Duke of Normandy (based on Robert the Devil) and A Margarite of America. ==Related forms== The Acritic songs (dealing with Digenis Acritas and his fellow frontiersmen) resemble much the chanson de geste, though they developed simultaneously but separately. These songs dealt with the hardships and adventures of the border guards of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) ‚Äì including their love affairs ‚Äì and where a predominantly oral tradition which survived in the Balkans and Anatolia until modern times. This genre may have intermingled with its Western counterparts during the long occupation of Byzantine territories by French and Italian knights after the 4th crusade. This is suggested by later works in the Greek language which show influences from both traditions. ==Relationship to modern \\"romantic fiction\\"== In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love, such as faithfulness in adversity. From c. 1760 ‚Äì usually cited as 1764 at the publication of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto ‚Äì the connotations of \\"romance\\" moved from fantastic and eerie, somewhat Gothic adventure narratives of novelists like Ann Radcliffe's A Sicilian Romance (1790) or The Romance of the Forest (1791) with erotic content to novels centered on the episodic development of a courtship that ends in marriage. With a female protagonist, during the rise of Romanticism the depiction of the course of such a courtship within contemporary conventions of realism, the female equivalent of the \\"novel of education\\", informs much Romantic fiction. In gothic novels such as Bram Stoker's Dracula, the elements of romantic seduction and desire were mingled with fear and dread. Nathaniel Hawthorne used the term to distinguish his works as romances rather than novels, and literary criticism of the 19th century often accepted the contrast between the romance and the novel, in such works as H. G. Wells's \\"scientific romances\\" in the beginning of science fiction. In 1825, the fantasy genre developed when the Swedish literary work Frithjof's saga, which was based on the Fri√∞√æj√≥fs saga ins fr≈ìkna, became successful in England and Germany. It was translated twenty-two times into English, 20 times into German, and into many other European languages, including modern Icelandic in 1866. Their influence on authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, William Morris and Poul Anderson and on the subsequent modern fantasy genre is considerable. Modern usage of term \\"romance\\" usually refer to the romance novel, which is a subgenre that focuses on the relationship and romantic love between two people; these novels must have an \\"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\\" Despite the popularity of this popular meaning of Romance, other works are still, occasionally, referred to as romances because of their uses of other elements descended from the medieval romance, or from the Romantic movement: larger-than-life heroes and heroines, drama and adventure, marvels that may become fantastic, themes of honor and loyalty, or fairy-tale-like stories and story settings. Shakespeare's later comedies, such as The Tempest or The Winter's Tale are sometimes called his romances. Modern works may differentiate from love-story as romance into different genres, such as planetary romance or Ruritanian romance. Science fiction was, for a time, termed scientific romance, and gaslamp fantasy is sometimes termed gaslight romance. Flannery O'Conner, writing of the use of grotesque in fiction, talked of its use in \\"the modern romance tradition.\\" ==List== Medieval examples: * Romances of Chr√©tien de Troyes *Queste del Saint Graal *Perceforest *The Knight in the Panther's Skin *Valentine and Orson *King Horn *The Squire of Low Degree *Romance of the Rose *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight *Guilhem de la Barra by Arnaut Vidal *Guillaume de Palerme *Le Morte D'Arthur ‚Äì Sir Thomas Malory *Amadis de Gaula ‚Äì Jo√£o Lobeira and Garci Rodr√≠guez de Montalvo *\\"The Knight's Tale\\" and \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\" from Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales *Chevalere Assigne * Sir Eglamour of Artois * Octavian * Ipomadon * Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle * The Knightly Tale of Gologras and Gawain * Tirant lo Blanch ‚Äì Joanot Martorell * Amadas * Sir Cleges * The King of Tars * Sir Isumbras * Erl of Toulouse * Generides * Roswall and Lillian * Hertig Fredrik av Normandie ==References== ==External links== * *The International Courtly Literature Society Category:Literary genres Category:Literary theory * Category:Traditional stories ","title":"Chivalric romance"},{"id":"1430829","text":"CEWC (Council for Education in World Citizenship) Northern Ireland (or CEWC NI for short) is an educational charity based in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

(or Jade Bay;Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Jade Bay ) is a bight or bay on the North Sea coast of Germany. It was formerly known simply as Jade or Jahde. Because of the very low input of freshwater, it is classified as a bay rather than an estuary.G√ºnther Lang, Bundesanstalt f√ºr Wasserbau (Federal Bureau for Water-Bound Constructions): Ein Beitrag zur Tidedynamik der Innenjade und des Jadebusens (A contribution on the tidal dynamics of Innenjade and Jadebusen) (in German) ==Intrusion of the sea== About 180 km¬≤ (70 mi¬≤) in area, the Jade was largely created by storm floods during the 13th and 16th centuries. Since the early 14th century, it has joined eastward to the estuary of the river Weser. For some time, there were three permanent connecting branches and one flood bed between the river and the bight, forming an estuarine delta. The first of these junctions was closed in 1450 by dikes and the last one in 1515. However, about a century passed before most of the area flooded by these connections was regained for pasture and arable land. In the west, the Jade extended far into the Frisian peninsula. From the early 16th century, a number of dikes were built against the storm floods and to gain arable land. The main dike, Ellenser Damm, was built between 1596 and 1615 by the County of Oldenburg before the agreement with the objecting County of East Frisia was finished successfully. ==Decay of the Frisian community== The extension of Jade Bight and its branches fragmented the free Frisian territory of R√ºstringen in Bant in the northwest, most of which has disappeared in the waves, Bovenjadingen ('above the Jade') with the low moraine hills of Friesische Wehde in the southwest, Butjadingen ('outside the Jade') in the northeast, which was an island for almost two centuries, and Stadland ('bank-land'), which became a narrow island along the left bank of the Weser in 1384. The devastation by floods and the losses of land weakened the Frisian community. In the years about 1400, the Free City of Bremen tried to rule Standland and Butjadingen. At the beginning of 16th century, all countries around Jade Bight were conquered by the Counts of Oldenburg. ==Organized construction of dikes== Together with the conquest of the island of Stadland, the Lockfleth, the largest branch of the Weser delta, was interrupted by a dike at Ovelg√∂nne in 1515. In the next years the water course was cut off at more sites. The most important projects prior to 1650 were the Ellenser Damm across the Schwarzes Brack in the west of the bay in 1596 to 1615 and the New Hoben-Dike in the east in 1643. South of this dike, the coast became a mossy bog. The bog was affected by high floods, and dikes built on the bog proved to be very fragile. ==Harbour== Tidal flows make the neck of Jade Bight the deepest natural channel near Germany's North Sea coast. In 1853, the Kingdom of Prussia bought a part of the western shore of the bay from Oldenburg, in order to use the harbour as a Prussian naval base, later called Wilhelmshaven. During World War I, the German High Seas Fleet (Hochseeflotte), the main battle fleet of the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), was based at Wilhelmshaven in the Jade Bight. After World War II, Wilhelmshaven became the main German port for the import of petroleum. ==Nature== The foreshore areas of Jade Bight form a part of the German Wadden Sea National Parks.

His father was executed in 1537 as a chief actor in the Pilgrimage of Grace. ==Career== Brought up with his elder brother Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland (1528‚Äì1572), he took part as a youth in border warfare, and on Queen Mary's accession was appointed governor of Tynemouth Castle. He was returned to the House of Commons in 1554 as Member of Parliament for Morpeth, Northumberland, was knighted in 1557, and became deputy warden of the east and middle marches. Queen Elizabeth continued him in his chief offices. He was temporarily transferred from the governorship of Tynemouth to the captaincy of Norham Castle, but was reappointed in February 1561 to Tynemouth. When war broke out in Scotland in 1560, he was given the command of a body of light horse, to be equipped like the Schwartze Ritter with corselets and two pistols each, and at the head of these troops he distinguished himself before Leith (April 1560). The French commander D'Oyzelle, when defeated, asked permission, in compliment to Percy's valour, to surrender his sword to Percy rather than to the commander-in-chief, Lord Grey. Unlike other members of his family, he had Protestant sympathies, and was directed in 1561 to report on the doctrines adopted by the Scottish congregations. Both John Knox and Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, with whom he corresponded, seem to have been convinced of his sympathy with presbyterianism. He had already (24 June 1559) been commissioned, together with Thomas Young, Archbishop of York, to administer the oath of supremacy to the clergy of the northern province. His position in the north was improved at the end of 1561 by his marriage with Catherine Neville, daughter and co- heiress of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer. He was appointed Sheriff of Northumberland for 1562‚Äì63. During the Rising of the North, in which his elder brother was a chief actor (November‚ÄìDecember 1569), Henry Percy remained loyal to the government, joined the royal forces, and vigorously attacked the rebels. Queen Elizabeth promised him favour and employment in return for his services. When his brother was a prisoner in Scotland, Percy wrote urging him to confess his offences and appeal to the queen's mercy. In 1571 he was elected knight of the shire for Northumberland and, on his brother's execution at York in 1572, he assumed by Queen Elizabeth's permission the title of eighth earl of Northumberland, in accordance with the patents of creation. Mary, Queen of Scots, was in confinement at Tutbury, and he opened communication with her agent John Lesley, the bishop of Ross, at Easter 1571, offering help for her escape. Sir Ralph Sadler suspected his intentions, and on 15 November 1571 Percy was arrested while in London and sent to the Tower of London. On 23 February 1572 he wrote, begging the queen to release him. After eighteen months' detention he was brought to trial on a charge of treason. Thereupon he threw himself on the queen's mercy, was fined five thousand marks, and was directed to confine himself to his house at Petworth. On 12 July 1573 he was permitted to come to London, and was soon afterwards set at liberty. On 8 February 1576 he first took his seat in the House of Lords, and was one of the royal commissioners appointed to prorogue parliament in November. In September 1582 he entertained the French agent, M. de Bex, and looked with a friendly eye on Throckmorton's plot to release Queen Mary. With Lord Henry Howard and Francis Throckmorton he was arrested on suspicion of complicity late in the same year, and for a second time was sent to the Tower. He was, however, only detained a few weeks, and no legal proceedings were taken against him. But he was deprived of the governorship of Tynemouth Castle, though he protested. He was still sanguine of compassing the release of Queen Mary. In September 1583 he invited her agent, Charles Paget, and Paget's brother, Lord Paget, to Petworth, and there he discussed the matter fully. The Duc de Guise was to aid the enterprise with French troops, and Northumberland offered advice respecting their landing. William Shelley, who was present at the interview, was arrested and racked next year, and related what took place. Northumberland's aim, he said, was not only to secure Queen Mary's liberty, but to extort from Elizabeth full toleration for the Roman Catholics. In December 1584 Northumberland was sent to the Tower for a third time. He protested his innocence, and courted inquiry. Six months later, on 21 June 1585, he was found dead in his bed in his cell, having been shot through the heart. A jury was at once summoned, and returned a verdict of suicide. He was buried in the church of St. Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower. Suspicions were voiced. It was stated that the day before the earl died the lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Owen Hopton, was ordered by Sir Christopher Hatton, the vice- chamberlain, to place the prisoner under the care of a new warder named Bailiffe. A report spread that Hatton had contrived Northumberland's death, and some years later Sir Walter Raleigh, in writing to Sir Robert Cecil, referred to Hatton's guilt as proved. Immediately after his death there was published at Cologne a tract, entitled Crudelitatis Calvinianae Exempla duo recentissima ex Anglia, in which the English government was charged both with Northumberland's murder and with the enforcement of the penal statutes passed in the previous year. The tract was reprinted in French, German, English, Italian, and Spanish. To allay the public excitement, a Star Chamber inquiry was ordered, and it was held on 23 June; A True and Summarie Reporte of the proceedings was published, and the verdict of suicide upheld. ==Family== By 25 January 1562, he had married Lady Katherine Neville (1546‚Äì1596), the daughter of John Nevill, 4th Baron Latimer and Lady Lucy Somerset. They had the following children: * Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (1564‚Äì1632), married Lady Dorothy Devereux * Thomas Percy * William Percy, poet and playwright * Sir Charles Percy * Lucy Percy, married Sir John Wotton and then Sir Hugh Owen * Richard Percy * Sir Joscelyne Percy * Anne Percy * Sir Alan Percy (died 1613), married Mary Fitz * Eleanor Percy (1583‚Äì1650), married William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis * Sir George Percy (1580‚Äì1632), married Anne Floyd. Their daughter Anne Percy married John West. His wife Katherine was buried in St Paul's Chapel within Westminster Abbey. ==Ancestry== ==References== Attribution: * Category:1532 births Category:1585 deaths Category:Knights of the Garter 8 Category:16th-century English nobility Category:High Sheriffs of Northumberland Category:16th-century Protestants Category:English Protestants Henry Percy, 08th Earl of Northumberland Category:Deaths by firearm in England Category:Prisoners in the Tower of London Category:English MPs 1554‚Äì1555 Category:English MPs 1571 Category:Burials at St. Peter ad Vincula (London) Category:People from Tyne and Wear ","title":"Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland"},{"id":"1430853","text":"Pandemonium Shadow Show is the second album by Harry Nilsson. ==Background== The album was the first product of Nilsson's three-year, $50,000 recording contract with RCA Victor, and was recorded in their Hollywood studio. Unlike virtually all his earlier records, Show employed the full potential of Nilsson's voice in the recording studio, turning him into what was described as a \\"chorus of ninety-eight voices\\". Nilsson had hoped to use the title Something Wicked This Way Comes, and had asked sci-fi author Ray Bradbury for permission. But approval hadn't come by the release date, so the lesser-known title was chosen (of a circus sideshow appearing in Bradbury's novel) instead. As well as original songs by Nilsson, a number of covers were included on the album, including one by Phil Spector (who had earlier co-written a song with Nilsson), Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\", and two by The Beatles; \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"You Can't Do That\\", the latter in an arrangement that quoted lyrics from 17 other Beatles songs. Three other songs were written by Jesse Lee Kincaid, Botkin and Garfield, and Cliff Hess, Howard Johnson and Milton Ager. The album debuted to little public attention in the US and England, although it was an immediate hit in Canada, where \\"You Can't Do That\\" was a top 10 hit. Beatles publicist Derek Taylor heard \\"1941\\" on his car radio waiting for his wife at the supermarket and, enjoying the track, ordered a case of copies, sending them out to various industry people he believed would be interested, including The Beatles, who later invited Nilsson to London and helped further his career. A cover of \\"1941\\" by Canadian folk/rock artist Tom Northcott charted in both Canada and the US in 1968. Fellow musician and earlier collaborator Chip Douglas introduced Nilsson to The Monkees whom he was producing. Nilsson gave an impromptu audition of his latest songs.

His early work sold better after Nilsson had become better established through hits like \\"Without You\\" and albums like Nilsson Schmilsson.

The selection and amplification steps can be performed multiple times at greater stringency to isolate higher-affinity binders. Phage display is a laboratory technique for the study of protein‚Äìprotein, protein‚Äìpeptide, and protein‚ÄìDNA interactions that uses bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to connect proteins with the genetic information that encodes them. In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest is inserted into a phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to \\"display\\" the protein on its outside while containing the gene for the protein on its inside, resulting in a connection between genotype and phenotype. These displaying phages can then be screened against other proteins, peptides or DNA sequences, in order to detect interaction between the displayed protein and those other molecules. In this way, large libraries of proteins can be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection, which is analogous to natural selection. The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are M13 and fd filamentous phage, though T4, T7, and Œª phage have also been used. ==History== Phage display was first described by George P. Smith in 1985, when he demonstrated the display of peptides on filamentous phage (long, thin viruses that infect bacteria) by fusing the virus's capsid protein to one peptide out of a collection of peptide sequences. This displayed the different peptides on the outer surfaces of the collection of viral clones, where the screening step of the process isolated the peptides with the highest binding affinity. In 1988, Stephen Parmley and George Smith described biopanning for affinity selection and demonstrated that recursive rounds of selection could enrich for clones present at 1 in a billion or less. In 1990, Jamie Scott and George Smith described creation of large random peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage. Phage display technology was further developed and improved by groups at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology with Greg Winter and John McCafferty, The Scripps Research Institute with Richard Lerner and Carlos Barbas and the German Cancer Research Center with Frank Breitling and Stefan D√ºbel for display of proteins such as antibodies for therapeutic protein engineering. Smith and Winter were awarded a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their contribution to developing phage display. A patent by George Pieczenik claiming priority from 1985 also describes the generation of peptide libraries. == Principle == Like the two-hybrid system, phage display is used for the high-throughput screening of protein interactions. In the case of M13 filamentous phage display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is ligated into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major coat protein, respectively. Multiple cloning sites are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible reading frames so that the cDNA fragment is translated in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert DNA hybrid is then inserted (a process known as \\"transduction\\") into E. coli bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue E. coli. If a \\"phagemid\\" vector is used (a simplified display construct vector) phage particles will not be released from the E. coli cells until they are infected with helper phage, which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature virions with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. By immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a microtiter plate well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be eluted, used to produce more phage (by bacterial infection with helper phage) and to produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as 'panning', in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials. Phage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and sequenced to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments. The use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology. Elution can be done combining low-pH elution buffer with sonification, which, in addition to loosening the peptide-target interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface. This ultrasound-based method enables single-step selection of a high-affinity peptide. == Applications == Applications of phage display technology include determination of interaction partners of a protein (which would be used as the immobilised phage \\"bait\\" with a DNA library consisting of all coding sequences of a cell, tissue or organism) so that the function or the mechanism of the function of that protein may be determined.Explanation of \\"Protein interaction mapping\\" from The Wellcome Trust Phage display is also a widely used method for in vitro protein evolution (also called protein engineering). As such, phage display is a useful tool in drug discovery. It is used for finding new ligands (enzyme inhibitors, receptor agonists and antagonists) to target proteins. The technique is also used to determine tumour antigens (for use in diagnosis and therapeutic targeting) and in searching for protein-DNA interactions using specially-constructed DNA libraries with randomised segments. Recently, phage display has also been used in the context of cancer treatments - such as the adoptive cell transfer approach. In these cases, phage display is used to create and select synthetic antibodies that target tumour surface proteins. These are made into synthetic receptors for T-Cells collected from the patient that are used to combat the disease. Competing methods for in vitro protein evolution include yeast display, bacterial display, ribosome display, and mRNA display. === Antibody maturation in vitro === The invention of antibody phage display revolutionised antibody drug discovery. Initial work was done by laboratories at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Greg Winter and John McCafferty), the Scripps Research Institute (Richard Lerner and Carlos F. Barbas) and the German Cancer Research Centre (Frank Breitling and Stefan D√ºbel). In 1991, The Scripps group reported the first display and selection of human antibodies on phage. This initial study described the rapid isolation of human antibody Fab that bound tetanus toxin and the method was then extended to rapidly clone human anti-HIV-1 antibodies for vaccine design and therapy. Phage display of antibody libraries has become a powerful method for both studying the immune response as well as a method to rapidly select and evolve human antibodies for therapy. Antibody phage display was later used by Carlos F. Barbas at The Scripps Research Institute to create synthetic human antibody libraries, a principle first patented in 1990 by Breitling and coworkers (Patent CA 2035384), thereby allowing human antibodies to be created in vitro from synthetic diversity elements. Antibody libraries displaying millions of different antibodies on phage are often used in the pharmaceutical industry to isolate highly specific therapeutic antibody leads, for development into antibody drugs primarily as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapeutics. One of the most successful was adalimumab, discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology as D2E7 and developed and marketed by Abbott Laboratories. Adalimumab, an antibody to TNF alpha, was the world's first fully human antibody, which achieved annual sales exceeding $1bn.Cambridge Antibody: Sales update  Company Announcements  Telegraph == General protocol == Below is the sequence of events that are followed in phage display screening to identify polypeptides that bind with high affinity to desired target protein or DNA sequence: # Target proteins or DNA sequences are immobilized to the wells of a microtiter plate. # Many genetic sequences are expressed in a bacteriophage library in the form of fusions with the bacteriophage coat protein, so that they are displayed on the surface of the viral particle. The protein displayed corresponds to the genetic sequence within the phage. # This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed. # Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away. # Attached phage may be eluted and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture. # Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library in binding proteins. # Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within in the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments. == Selection of the coat protein == === Filamentous phages === ==== pIII ==== pIII is the protein that determines the infectivity of the virion. pIII is composed of three domains (N1, N2 and CT) connected by glycine-rich linkers. The N2 domain binds to the F pilus during virion infection freeing the N1 domain which then interacts with a TolA protein on the surface of the bacterium. Insertions within this protein are usually added in position 249 (within a linker region between CT and N2), position 198 (within the N2 domain) and at the N-terminus (inserted between the N-terminal secretion sequence and the N-terminus of pIII). However, when using the BamHI site located at position 198 one must be careful of the unpaired Cysteine residue (C201) that could cause problems during phage display if one is using a non- truncated version of pIII. An advantage of using pIII rather than pVIII is that pIII allows for monovalent display when using a phagemid (Ff-phage derived plasmid) combined with a helper phage. Moreover, pIII allows for the insertion of larger protein sequences (>100 amino acids) and is more tolerant to it than pVIII. However, using pIII as the fusion partner can lead to a decrease in phage infectivity leading to problems such as selection bias caused by difference in phage growth rate or even worse, the phage's inability to infect its host. Loss of phage infectivity can be avoided by using a phagemid plasmid and a helper phage so that the resultant phage contains both wild type and fusion pIII. cDNA has also been analyzed using pIII via a two complementary leucine zippers system, Direct Interaction Rescue or by adding an 8-10 amino acid linker between the cDNA and pIII at the C-terminus. ==== pVIII ==== pVIII is the main coat protein of Ff phages. Peptides are usually fused to the N-terminus of pVIII. Usually peptides that can be fused to pVIII are 6-8 amino acids long. The size restriction seems to have less to do with structural impediment caused by the added section and more to do with the size exclusion caused by pIV during coat protein export. Since there are around 2700 copies of the protein on a typical phages, it is more likely that the protein of interest will be expressed polyvalently even if a phagemid is used. This makes the use of this protein unfavorable for the discovery of high affinity binding partners. To overcome the size problem of pVIII, artificial coat proteins have been designed. An example is Weiss and Sidhu's inverted artificial coat protein (ACP) which allows the display of large proteins at the C-terminus. The ACP's could display a protein of 20kDa, however, only at low levels (mostly only monovalently). ==== pVI ==== pVI has been widely used for the display of cDNA libraries. The display of cDNA libraries via phage display is an attractive alternative to the yeast-2-hybrid method for the discovery of interacting proteins and peptides due to its high throughput capability. pVI has been used preferentially to pVIII and pIII for the expression of cDNA libraries because one can add the protein of interest to the C-terminus of pVI without greatly affecting pVI's role in phage assembly. This means that the stop codon in the cDNA is no longer an issue. However, phage display of cDNA is always limited by the inability of most prokaryotes in producing post-translational modifications present in eukaryotic cells or by the misfolding of multi-domain proteins. While pVI has been useful for the analysis of cDNA libraries, pIII and pVIII remain the most utilized coat proteins for phage display. ==== pVII and pIX ==== In an experiment in 1995, display of Glutathione S-transferase was attempted on both pVII and pIX and failed. However, phage display of this protein was completed successfully after the addition of a periplasmic signal sequence (pelB or ompA) on the N-terminus. In a recent study, it has been shown that AviTag, FLAG and His could be displayed on pVII without the need of a signal sequence. Then the expression of single chain Fv's (scFv), and single chain T cell receptors (scTCR) were expressed both with and without the signal sequence. PelB (an amino acid signal sequence that targets the protein to the periplasm where a signal peptidase then cleaves off PelB) improved the phage display level when compared to pVII and pIX fusions without the signal sequence. However, this led to the incorporation of more helper phage genomes rather than phagemid genomes. In all cases, phage display levels were lower than using pIII fusion. However, lower display might be more favorable for the selection of binders due to lower display being closer to true monovalent display. In five out of six occasions, pVII and pIX fusions without pelB was more efficient than pIII fusions in affinity selection assays. The paper even goes on to state that pVII and pIX display platforms may outperform pIII in the long run. The use of pVII and pIX instead of pIII might also be an advantage because virion rescue may be undertaken without breaking the virion- antigen bond if the pIII used is wild type. Instead, one could cleave in a section between the bead and the antigen to elute. Since the pIII is intact it does not matter whether the antigen remains bound to the phage. === T7 phages === The issue of using Ff phages for phage display is that they require the protein of interest to be translocated across the bacterial inner membrane before they are assembled into the phage. Some proteins cannot undergo this process and therefore cannot be displayed on the surface of Ff phages. In these cases, T7 phage display is used instead. In T7 phage display, the protein to be displayed is attached to the C-terminus of the gene 10 capsid protein of T7. The disadvantage of using T7 is that the size of the protein that can be expressed on the surface is limited to shorter peptides because large changes to the T7 genome cannot be accommodated like it is in M13 where the phage just makes its coat longer to fit the larger genome within it. However, it can be useful for the production of a large protein library for scFV selection where the scFV is expressed on an M13 phage and the antigens are expressed on the surface of the T7 phage. == Bioinformatics resources and tools == Databases and computational tools for mimotopes have been an important part of phage display study. Databases, programs and web servers have been widely used to exclude target-unrelated peptides, characterize small molecules-protein interactions and map protein-protein interactions. Users can use three dimensional structure of a protein and the peptides selected from phage display experiment to map conformational epitopes. Some of the fast and efficient computational methods are available online. == See also == *Directed evolution *protein‚Äìprotein interactions *PelB leader sequence Competing techniques: *Two-hybrid system *mRNA display *Ribosome display == References == ==Further reading== * * Selection Versus Design in Chemical Engineering * The ETH-2 human antibody phage library * == External links == Category:Molecular biology Category:Bacteriophages Category:Microbiology Category:Protein‚Äìprotein interaction assays ","title":"Phage display"},{"id":"1430859","text":"Ann Mui Oi-fong (Ê¢ÖÊÑõËä≥) (10 December 1959 ‚Äì 16 April 2000) was a singer and actress. ==Background== Born on 10 December 1959 in Hong Kong, she experienced much hardship in her childhood.

Before being debunked by the Christian magazine Cornerstone, he was viewed as an \\"expert\\" on Satanism in the 1980s. ==Early life== Mike Warnke was born in 1946 to parents Alfred \\"Al\\" Warnke and Louise Warnke of Evansville, Indiana. When he was five years old, the Warnke family moved to Manchester, Tennessee, where his father opened a truck stop. In 1955, Warnke's mother was killed in a car accident. In 1958 his father died, leaving Warnke an orphan. After the death of his father, Warnke was taken to live with two of his aunts in Sparta, and from there to his father's half-sister and her husband in San Bernardino, California. In June 1965, he graduated from Rim of the World High School in Lake Arrowhead. That September, Warnke enrolled at San Bernardino Valley College but withdrew after one semester, whereupon by his account, he began his tenure as a Satanist. On June 2, 1966, Warnke enlisted in the United States Navy. After graduating from boot camp on August 22, 1966, his assigned military occupational specialty was as a hospital corpsman. According to the account of his life in The Satan Seller, Warnke converted to Christianity during boot camp. However, high-school acquaintance Charlotte Tweeten has stated she recalls Warnke proclaiming faith in Christ in the year prior to his navy enlistment in 1966. He also wrote that he began dating fellow Rim of the World High School alumna, Sue Studer, during this time period. This has been disproven, however, and Warnke was actually engaged to Lois Eckenrod at this time. In 1967, he completed naval corpsman training, returned to San Diego, and married Studer. Together, they had two children. In 1969, Warnke was deployed to Vietnam for a six-month tour of duty.Cornerstone, issue 98: \\"Records show Warnke was in Vietnam for only six months\\" Having been wounded in battle during those six months, he was awarded the Purple Heart. Warnke's own written accounts differ on the number of times he sustained injuries during his time in Vietnam. In The Satan Seller, Warnke says he was wounded twice, while in his second book, Hitchhiking on Hope Street, he states he was wounded five times. Despite these wounds received during his tour of duty as a hospital corpsman, second class, Warnke's various accounts have him spending much time detained, allegedly killing a man in battle, and surviving being shot several times, including once by an arrow. Warnke says it was the latter wound for which he was awarded the Purple Heart.Hey Doc recording. Word Records Warnke returned to the United States in 1970. While still serving in the navy, Warnke teamed up with San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo and was touted for his \\"Satanist experience\\". Warnke and Cerullo toured the country participating in charismatic revival meetings. Cerullo wanted to write a book about youth occultism, and assigned the writing task to David Balsiger with help from Warnke. In early 1972, Warnke requested and received an early discharge from the navy as a conscientious objector so that he could work full-time in the ministry. Warnke then left Cerullo's ministry to start his own, forbidding Cerullo to use any of his material. It was at this time that Warnke and Balsiger went on to write the book that would make Warnke famous. ==Rise to fame== ===The Satan Seller=== In 1972, Warnke's book The Satan Seller was released. Written by Warnke, with help from Balsiger and Les Jones, the book tells of Warnke being orphaned as a child and his introduction into Satanism. Further detailed is Warnke's participation in sexual orgies, alcoholism, and drug dealing; his rise in the ranks of Satanism to the level of \\"high priest\\"; presiding over Satanic rituals including magical spells, summoning demons, ritual sex including a kidnap and rape; the attempt on his life -- a heroin overdose -- that left him angry and disillusioned; his heroism in Vietnam; and how he found Jesus and came home as an evangelist. The story ends with Warnke living happily in California with wife Sue Studer. In fewer than three months after the release, The Satan Seller had become a religious best-seller. The book launched Warnke into stardom within evangelical Christian communities. He became a popular speaker at Christian meeting places such as Melodyland in Anaheim, California. In 1974, Warnke moved his family to attend Trinity Bible College in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a nine-month preparation for ministry. It was here, while among other charismatic Christians and recent converts preparing for a life of ministry, that Warnke met Carolyn Alberty and the two began an extramarital affair. Warnke also met Elijah Coady, an independent, schismatic bishop of the Syro- Chaldean Church, also known as the Assyrian Church of the East. Coady ordained Warnke as a deacon. Upon graduation, Warnke was again ordained, and he moved with his family to Denver, Colorado. ===Recordings and wives=== In November 1975 at an Indiana coffeehouse, Warnke's talk about his conversion from Satanism to Christianity was incidentally recorded. This recording became his first album, Alive, which was soon widely played on Christian radio. Later that same year, despite interventions from pastors and other acclaimed ministers, Warnke left his wife for Alberty and filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in December 1975 and four months later, Warnke married Alberty. Warnke's popularity earned him the cover of the September 1976 issue of the Christian magazine Harmony. In 1977, he released his second album, Jester In The King's Court. In 1978, he recounted his Vietnam experiences on his third album, Hey, Doc!. Warnke's albums became \\"the most popular Christian comedy albums ever produced\\".As quoted in Cornerstone issue 98: During a tour to Hazard, Kentucky, Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three children, and began courting her while still married to his second wife. His second marriage came to an end when, as Alberty stated in an interview, \\"[Warnke] threw me into a wall and split my head open. He said, 'If you go to a local hospital and tell them what your name is, I'll kill you.'\\" Alberty fled to Florida. By November 1979, their divorce was finalized, and Warnke moved to Hall's farm in Kentucky. On January 2, 1980, Warnke and Hall were married. Warnke and his label, Word Records, feuded over an album which he eventually produced and distributed on his own, A Christian's Perspective on Halloween (1979). Word Records and Warnke reconciled by 1981, resulting in Coming Home (1981), and now including wife Rose, Higher Education (1982) and Growing Up (1983). Under Word's Dayspring label, Warnke then released (solo) Stuff Happens (1985), Good News Tonight (1986), One In A Million (1988), Live ... Totally Weird (1989).The Exhaustive Christian Music Discography: W Warnke also made a VHS home video, Do You Hear Me? (1989). During the 1980s, Warnke's ministry prospered as he and his new wife toured and performed together, raising millions of dollars for their ministry. Contributions to the ministry were over $1 million in 1985, and over $2 million each year from 1987 through 1990. As their popularity waxed, their personal relationship waned. In 1984, Warnke's third wife wrote, \\"Satan provided a woman to fill the gap in Michael's life.\\"As cited by Cornerstone expose: The Warnkes separated in 1989 and later divorced in 1991. Six weeks after the divorce was finalized, Warnke married Rim of the World High School alumna Susan Patton. ===Extravagant claims=== In 1982, Warnke began to exaggerate his achievements. During the 1980s, his claims of academic degrees increased from two Bachelor's degrees to two Master's Degrees to a Doctorate of Philosophy. In The Satan Seller, Warnke says he was wounded twice while in Vietnam. In Hitchhiking on Hope Street, he said he had been wounded five times. He followed up his interest in the Syro- Chaldean tradition and his 1970s ordination as a deacon with a 1983 ordination by independent bishop Richard Morrill, lately of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. This ordination allowed Warnke to call himself bishop. ===National exposure=== On May 16, 1985, Warnke appeared in a prime-time news report about Satanism on ABC's 20/20. In the show's episode titled \\"The Devil Worshippers\\", Warnke was included in a number of segments where he discussed the implements and clothing used in Satanic ceremonies, a scar allegedly indicating where he was repeatedly cut so that his blood could be used in Satanic ceremonies, and what drew him to Satanism. After Warnke's appearance on 20/20, he was frequently cited as an expert on the occult by Christian radio host Bob Larson and the Chick Publications stable of authors. ==Investigation and debunking== In 1991, Cornerstone magazine launched an investigation into Warnke's life and testimony. The previous year, the magazine had debunked Lauren Stratford's story that had been recounted in her book Satan's Underground. Stratford claimed her deep involvement in Satanism led her to partake in a ritual in which her own child was sacrificed. After the expos√© showed Stratford's alleged child had never existed, Cornerstone journalists Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott investigated Warnke and his claims. The Cornerstone investigation spanned from interviews with over 100 of Warnke's personal friends and acquaintances to his ministry's tax receipts. It revealed a number of inaccuracies and evidence of fraud and deceit in Warnke's accounts. During the course of Cornerstone's investigation, pictures of Warnke taken during the time he was alleged to be a Satanist priest were discovered. Rather than showing an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke as a typical \\"square\\" of the mid-1960s. The investigation also revealed Warnke's claims that he and Charles Manson had attended a Satanic ritual to be false; Manson was in federal prison at the time, having no known ties to Satanic churches. The investigation further uncovered that before joining the navy, Warnke had been involved with the college Christian ministry Campus Crusade for Christ. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnke's multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. Regarding one Christian intervention attempt, the Cornerstone article states, \\"[Don] Riling, Mike Johnson, Wes Yoder, and Mike and Carolyn were there. 'You‚Äôd have never guessed that this was a meeting of Christians,' says Riling. 'Mike and Carolyn were swearing the whole time, and they must have gone through a whole pack of cigarettes.'\\" Most critically, the investigation showed how Warnke could not have done the many things he claimed to have taken part in throughout the nine months he claimed to be a Satanist - including his claims to be a drug-addicted dealer or a Satanic high priest. Before publishing, Cornerstone contacted Warnke for an interview, but he and the magazine could not agree to terms for such an interview. Cornerstone revealed its story at the annual Christian Booksellers Association convention in June 1992. ==Aftermath== Warnke sent a response to Cornerstone, published in July, insisting he told the truth, stating: Despite these assertions, Warnke did not provide the name of a single Satanist but used invectives against ex-wife Carolyn. In the ensuing months, he conceded parts of the allegations, telling Christianity Today that there had been only thirteen members of his coven, not 1,500 as originally claimed, and that of those thirteen, the whereabouts of five were unknown to him, while the other eight had since died.Jay Grelen. \\"Christian comedian says he lied about coven\\", Lexington Herald-Leader, November 3, 1992, page B1. Public response was varied but was nevertheless overwhelmingly against Warnke. Initially, Word Records stated that they would stand by their artist. However, further investigations by local Kentucky reporters at the Lexington Herald-Leader revealed that Warnke's ministry had engaged in financial misdeeds and that, \\"Mike, his ex-wife Rose, and her brother Neale [Hall] received a total of $809,680 in salary at a time when the ministry newsletter claimed donations were down and more funds were needed.\\" One week later, Word Records dropped Warnke from its label. Finally, on September 30, 1992, fewer than 100 days after the investigation was made public, Warnke's ministry closed its doors.Jay Grelen. \\"Christian comedian set to close doors of troubled ministry\\", Lexington Herald-Leader (KY), September 30, 1992, page C13. In the spring of 1993, Warnke submitted to the authority of an assembly of ministers \\"acting as elders\\", acknowledging his \\"ungodliness\\", his \\"multiple divorces\\", his \\"failure as husband, father, and friend\\", and of \\"embellishment and exaggeration ... in an attempt ... to entertain\\", and offering to pay back taxes to the federal government. The group recommended specific changes to the ministry, including a salary cap and accountability reports.Tamie Ross. \\"Laughs stopped for Christian comic: Mike Warnke offers fans new outlook after ministry's crash\\", The Daily Oklahoman, September 30, 2000, page 1B Nonetheless, he continued to \\"stand by [his] testimony of former Satanic involvement\\",Warnke's 1993 statement of apology and repentance stating in a 2000 interview with the Daily Oklahoman, \\"Exaggeration did creep into some of my stories, but my testimony is still my testimony.\\"\\"Local notes - Controversial comedian\\", The Modesto Bee (CA), February 2, 2002, page G1: \\"Mike Warnke, a popular 1970s Christian comedian later accused of fabricating claims about his Satanist past, will speak at Pentecostal Church of God Friday through February 10. ...

At the age of twenty, he played rugby for Beckenham RFC during the 1924/5 season alongside a seventeen-year-old James Robertson Justice who would later become an actor. He is best remembered as being the long-suffering stooge for his wife in their popular British cooking programmes which were shown from the 1950s to the 1970s. Wearing a traditional blazer and sporting a monocle above his trademark handlebar moustache, he would remain around the back of Fanny's studio sets awaiting her imperious commands which, when they came, often resulted in him being berated for being too slow. With his wife, he wrote a number of popular cookery books. Johnnie and Fanny also wrote the \\"Bon Viveur\\" restaurant column for The Daily Telegraph newspaper from 1950 to 1955. This was one of Britain's first restaurant columns and led to their first television series in 1955. At first they presented the BBC's Kitchen Magic, but were soon poached by ITV's first cooking programme, which they presented as Fanny & Johnnie. At that time Johnnie and Fanny were not married. Fanny adopted his name for their writing and television work and they eventually married in 1977.GRO Register of Marriages: June 1977 17 1134 Surrey SW ‚Äì John Cradock = Phyllis Chapman The marriage was in fact bigamous as Fanny was still married to her second husband, and she had lied about her age on the marriage certificate.

Church on the fortress. Medieval Medun in the Upper Zeta, Middle Ages Medun () is a settlement located 13 km northeast of the capital Podgorica, Montenegro. The village houses the archaeological site of the ancient fortified city of Medeon. It is situated in the tribal area of Upper Kuƒçi, one of the highland tribes. In the 2003 census, it had 108 inhabitants. ==Geography== As Mariano Bolizza described in 1614, it is situated on a beautiful hill on a cleft in the mountainside, between two other mountains, overlooking a very spacious valley.Elsie, p. 155 ==History== ===Ancient and Roman times=== Medun is an old town and fortress, situated 13 kilometers northeast from Podgorica, Montenegro. It was erected originally as a fortress, later on as a town, between 4th and 3rd centuries BC, by Illyrians living in the area. It was known as Medeon (), Meteon, or Modunense.Wilkes, 1992, p. 133, \\"... fortress has remained in use until modern times. Similarly few traces are now to be seen of Illyrian defenses at Meteon (Medun), Olcinium (Ulcinj) and Rhizon ...\\" Well preserved walls of the fortress were built of big blocks of trimmed stone, placed in a number of rows. With respect to solidity and size of the construction it substantially differs from the construction of other, less significant Illyrian towns. From the cultural-artistic point of view, two lower dig ups in the rock on the road from the lower to the upper town are very interesting. Studies refer to the conclusion that it was the place of performance of rituals related to the cult of snake that represented myth ancestor to the Illyrians. Necropolis is sited north from the upper town. It originates from the Iron Age, but has not been studied. Medeon hosted the Ardiaei king Gentius, his wife Teuta and the rest of his family until they were taken captives by the Roman legions, who effectively ended the independence of Illyria and created the Roman province of Illyricum. Medun was mentioned by Livy (59BC-17AD) as a civitas of the Labeates, an Illyrian tribe which lived around the Lake Skadar, then known as Lacus Labeatis. Roman legions conquered Medun around 167 BC, during the Third Illyrian War. On that occasion the Ardiaei king Gentius and his family were captivated, marking the establishment of Illyricum. Besides the stairways cut into the cliffs on all sides, dating from the Iron Age, from this earlier period is also a portion of the west wall, subsequently built over by a medieval wall. Different parts of the medieval fortification date from different periods. ===Middle Ages=== It was referred to later, in the 7th century, by the Ravenna Geographer, under the name Medion. The medieval fortification had been built on the ruins of the Roman city. Slavs migrated to the area during the Slavic migrations into Europe and the Balkans. ƒçelnik ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá (1326‚Äì1362) held Upper Zeta, including the city, subordinate to King Stefan Deƒçanski (r. 1321‚Äì1331), and Emperors Du≈°an the Mighty (r. 1331‚Äì1355) and Uro≈° the Weak (r. 1355-1371). The Bal≈°iƒá noble family which had taken control of Lower Zeta (lands previously held by Lord ≈Ωarko), went after Head of Upper Zeta ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá in 1362, and killed him, expanding further the Zeta ≈æupa. The family is recognized as Oblastni gospodari (Lords) in charters of Emperor Uro≈° the Weak (r. 1355-1371). The 1444 charter of King Alfonse V documents Medun as the property of Stephen Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. In 1445, Herceg Stjepan ceded the Upper Zeta and the Medun fortress to despot ƒêuraƒë. A duke of despot ƒêuraƒë defended Medun in 1452 from Stefan I Crnojeviƒá who was a duke in the Venetian service. In 1455, despot ƒêuraƒë had to give the fortress to the Turks in their victorious drive through Southeastern Europe. During the rule of Ivan I Crnojeviƒá (r. 1465-1490), a certain Imrahor Aga took refuge in the region, constantly fighting the Crnojeviƒái and attempted to expel their people from Medun. A bloody battle was fought between the two, in which Imrahor and many other leaders were slain, however, the town is taken by the Ottomans. The battle marked the downfall of the Crnojeviƒái and the loss of a state. The region was organized into the Sanjak of Shkodra, and in 1514, the Zeta region was established into the Sanjak of Montenegro, which would be headed by Stanko Crnojeviƒá, the son of Ivan I. Stanko was sent in 1485 to Constantinople as a guarantor of loyalty at the Ottoman court, and he converted to Islam and took the name Skanderbeg, subsequently being put for Sanjak-bey of Montenegro. ===Early modern=== Mariano Bolizza of Kotor, a servant of the Republic of Venice, wrote a report in 1614, initially for describing Sanjak of Shkodra's land routes which could best be utilized by local couriers conveying official correspondence from Venice to Constantinople and back, and to survey the military potential of the territory. He also provided a very detailed overview of towns and villages in Montenegro and northern Albania; their respective chiefs and men in arms, as well as demographics. Kuƒçi, Bratono≈æiƒái and part of Plava were under the soldiers of Medun, the spahee, but the commander was not named; and the highlanders would pay the Ottoman officials a portion of their income.Elsie, p. 152 Medun was described as a little town on a hill, strategically situated, but badly guarded and in ruins, of which fortification was held by the Dizdar Aga and 200 \\"very war-like people\\". It was one of 8 cities of the Sanjak of Shkodra.Elsie, p. 169 ===Modern=== Museum of Marko Miljanov. Tomb of Marko Miljanov on the fortress Meteon. The famous writer, and Kuƒçi tribe leader, Montenegrin duke and hero Marko Miljanov (1833‚Äì1901) lived at the foot of walls of the town and the fortress. He was buried in the acropolis in front of the small church dedicated to Archdeacon Stephen, built in Miljanov's honour the same year of his death. A rebellion in nearby Herzegovina (1875-1878) sparked a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Ottoman forces in Europe. Montenegro and Serbia agreed to declare a war on Turkey on 18 June 1876. Nichola I's cousin had twice routed the Ottomans at Medun. A Montenegrin victory in Danilograd in Zeta, and the capitulation of Medun, concluded the first year of the Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì1878).the cambridge modern history, 1934, p. 387; Miller, 1966, p. 370 In 1877/1878, Nicholas I of Montenegro acquired a seaboard on the Adriatic, and on 13 January 1878 Nicholas I and Ahmed Muhtar Pasha signed a truce, ending the war. Medun has not yet been studied sufficiently. Not only that it is interesting for its distant and rich past, it also represents an object significant for studying of all cultural epochs, from prehistory to the Middle Ages. ==Demographics== Total: 108 inhabitants (2003 census) *Serbs: 74 (68,51%) *Montenegrins: 32 (29,62%) *Yugoslavs: 1 (0,92%) *Unknown: 1 (0,92%) ==Notable people== *Marko Miljanov (1833‚Äì1901), writer, born in the village *Milica Miljanov (born ca. 1860), soldier and WWI heroine ==References== ===Sources=== *Wilkes, J.

Although a Greek prince, like many members of his dynasty he grew up largely abroad, sometimes in exile. As Europe marched into World War II, the infant Michael's family scattered: his mother's father, the Duke of Guise, left his residence of exile in Brussels, the Manoir d'Anjou, for their property at Larache, Morocco in March 1939 where he died on 24 August, the Manoir having become the Belgian headquarters for Germany's invading Wehrmacht.de Montjouvent, Philippe.

Less than six months after her father's death, Fran√ßoise was widowed by the death of Prince Christopher, following an abscess of the lung, in Athens in January. She took Michael to join her mother's household in Larache where her elder sister, Princess Isabelle Murat and her family, had also taken refuge from Europe. Their brother, Henri, Count of Paris, who succeeded his own father as head of the Orleanist monarchist movement, sent for his wife and children to come from their relatives in Brazil, and by the spring of 1941 they too were settled in Spanish Morocco (still being banned from the French sector), near Casablanca, in a small house without electricity that was named Oued Akreech in the town of Rabat. Michael lived his early childhood years on the African continent in the midst of his mother's family. Later, they also spent time in Spain.Be√©che, Arturo. The Gotha, Volume 1. Kensington House Books, California, 2009, pages 81, 235, 237. . By the time Michael's mother died in Paris in early 1953, France had repealed the law of banishment against its former ruling families (24 June 1950) and the Comte de Paris had taken up residence in the capital. When, in August 1953, Monseigneur moved the Comtesse and their children to a new estate, the Manoir du C≈ìur Volant in Louveciennes, Michael joined the couple and their four eldest children in the main building, while the seven younger children and their governesses occupied an annex given the name la maison de Blanche Neige (\\"Snow White's cottage\\"). Henceforth, Michael was given into the care of his uncle and raised with his Orl√©ans cousins. Michael later acknowledged that his uncle had been a poor manager of his ward's assets, but maintained that there was no malfeasance or attempt to conceal losses. He would also comment that, allegations to the contrary notwithstanding, his uncle's notorious relationship with his assistant Monique Friesz in his later years, during which substantial assets were presumed to have been consumed or diverted, did not reflect manipulation on her part so much as the desire of the Comte de Paris for companionship when he chose to isolate himself from the society, culture and luxury to which he had previously been accustomed. He is one of the 3 last surviving great-grandchildren of Christian IX of Denmark (the others are his first cousin Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and his second cousin Christian Castenskiold, son of Princess Dagmar of Denmark). ==Activities== Michael studied political science in Paris. He then re-patriated to Greece for military duty, serving a term in the Hellenic Coast Guard, discharged with the rank of Sub-lieutenant. He inherited from his mother a half-interest in the domain of the Nouvion-en-Thi√©rache, once the seat of the Dukes of Guise, from whom the Bourbon-Orl√©ans inherited the vast property, which included a grand ch√¢teau and a petit ch√¢teau, in Aisne. The Comte de Paris owned the other half of the Nouvion. He and Michael sold the grand ch√¢teau in 1980 to the city of Roubaix, which subsequently became a conference center for environmental studies, while the petit ch√¢teau was sold in 1986 to the local government of Nouvion. ==List of works== Having watched his mother observe a family tradition by igniting what he called a kind of auto-da-f√© in which she burned his late father's papers and memorabilia following the sale of his villa in Rome after the war, Prince Michael grew up to become a biographer and historian. He has written several biographies about members of ruling dynasties, those about contemporaries often including accounts and anecdotes attributed to his royal relatives. He has also written novels about historical royalty, distinguished for meticulous detail.

Marina is a Greek artist and sculptor of international reputation whose work has often been exhibited in Athens, Paris and New York. The marriage was held at the Royal Palace in Athens. This was a non-dynastic marriage, which obtained the legally required authorisation of King Constantine II only after Michael renounced all rights of succession to the Greek throne for himself and his descendants. The couple has two daughters: * Princess Alexandra of Greece (born 15 October 1968), married to Nicolas Mirzayantz on 27 June 1998.

In the temple of Ceres and the so-called Basilica at Paestum the hypotrachelium consists of a concave sinking carved with vertical lines suggestive of leaves, the tops of which project forward. A similar decoration is found in the capital of the columns flanking the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae, but here the hypotrachelium projects forward with a cavetto moulding, and is carved with triple leaves like the buds of a rose.

Image from \\"Maps and survey\\" (1913) by Hinks, Arthur R. A hypsometer is an instrument for measuring height or elevation. Two different principles may be used: trigonometry and atmospheric pressure. ==Scale hypsometer== A simple scale hypsometer allows the height of a building or tree to be measured by sighting across a ruler to the base and top of the object being measured, when the distance from the object to the observer is known. Modern hypsometers use a combination of laser rangefinder and clinometer to measure distances to the top and bottom of objects, and the angle between the lines from the observer to each to calculate height. 300pxAn example of such a scale hypsometer is illustrated here, and can be seen to consist of a sighting tube, a fixed horizontal scale, and an adjustable vertical scale with attached plumb line. The principle of operation of such a scale hypsometer is based on the idea of similar triangles in geometry. First the adjustable vertical scale is set at a suitable height. Then as in step 1 in the illustration, a sighting is taken on the top of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, h', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the height h, from the eye- line of the observer to the top of the object whose height is to be determined. Similarly as in step 2 of the illustration, a sighting is taken on the base of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, d', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the distance from the base of the object to the eye-line of the observer. Finally the distance x from the observer to the object needs to be measured. Looking at the geometry involved in step 1 results in sketch a: two right angled triangles, shown here with the identical small angles in yellow. Next in sketch b we see that the two triangles have identical angles - each has a right angle, the same small angle shown in yellow, and the same larger angle shown in orange. Therefore in sketch c we see that using the principle of similar triangles, given that each triangle has identical angles, the sides will be in proportion: x the distance to the object in proportion to x', the height set on the vertical scale of the hypsometer, and h the height of the object above the observers eye-line in proportion to h', the reading from the horizontal scale of the hypsometer. Given that Tan (small yellow angle) = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side, therefore Tan (small yellow angle) = h / x = h' / x'. Therefore h = h'x / x'. Likewise the geometry involved in step 2 results in sketch d: two right angled triangles. Next in sketch e we see that the two triangles again have identical angles - each has a right angle, the same small angle shown in yellow, and the same larger angle shown in orange. Therefore in sketch f we see that using the principle of similar triangles, given that each triangle has identical angles, the sides will be in proportion: x the distance to the object in proportion to x', the height set on the vertical scale of the hypsometer, and d the depth of the object below the observers eye-line in proportion to d', the reading from the horizontal scale of the hypsometer. Given that Tan (small angle) = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side, therefore Tan (small angle) = d / x = d' / x'. Therefore d = d'x / x'. Thus the overall height of the object is x (d' + h') / x' ==Pressure hypsometer== 100pxA pressure hypsometer as shown in the drawing (right) employs the principle that the boiling point of a liquid is lowered by diminishing the barometric pressure, and that the barometric pressure varies with the height of the point of observation. The instrument consists of a cylindrical vessel in which the liquid, usually water, is boiled, surmounted by a jacketed column, in the outer partitions of which the vapour circulates, while in the central one a thermometer is placed. To deduce the height of the station from the observed boiling point, it is necessary to know the relation existing between the boiling point and pressure, and also between the pressure and height of the atmosphere. ==See also== *List of length, distance, or range measuring devices ==References== * Category:Measuring instruments Category:Length, distance, or range measuring devices Category:Vertical position ","title":"Hypsometer"},{"id":"1430900","text":"The White Night of St. Petersburg is a novelised biography of Grand Duke Nicholas Kostantinovich Romanov set in Russia at the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century.

It is bounded by the Tibet region to the north, and by the Uttarakhand districts of Pithoragarh and Bageshwar to the east, Almora to the south, Pauri Garhwal to the southwest, Rudraprayag to the west, and Uttarkashi to the northwest. The administrative headquarters of the district is Gopeshwar. Chamoli hosts a variety of destinations of pilgrim and tourist interest. Badrinath, Hemkund Sahib, Valley of Flowers and Auli. Chamoli also happened to be a birthplace of \\"Chipko movement\\". Chamoli proved itself \\"the most spectacular in its natural assets; be it scenery, valley aspects, water-edges, floristic varieties, dramatic landform or the climatic cardinalities\\". The district is also inhabited by Bhotiya ethnic group who adhere to Hinduism. ==History== The region covered by the district of Chamoli forms part of the Pauri Garhwal district till 1960. It occupies the northeastern corner of the Garhwal tract and lies in the central or mid-Himalayas in the very heart of the snowy range described in ancient books as Bahirgiri, one of the three divisions of the Himalayan mountains. ;Historical background Chamoli, the district of \\"Garhwal'‚Äô the land of forts. Today's Garhwal was known as kedar-khand in the past. In puranas kedar-khand was said to be abode of God. It seems from the facts vedas puranas, Ramayna and Mahabharat that these Hindu scriptures are scripted in kedar-khand. It is believed that God Ganesha first script of vedas in Vayas gufa situated in the last village Mana only 4 km from Badrinath. According to Rigveda (1017‚Äì19) after Inundation (Jalprlya) Sapt-Rishis saved their lives in the same village Mana. Besides there the roots of vedic literature seems to be originated from Garhwal because the Garhwali language has a lot of words common with Sanskrit. The work place of vedic Rishis are the prominent pilgrim places in Garhwal specially in chamoli like Atrimuni Ashram in Anusuya about 25 km from chamoli town and work place of Kashyap Rishi at Gandhmadan parwat near Badrinath. According to Aadi-Puran, vedvyasa scripted the story of Mahabhrat in Vyas Gufa near Badrinath. Pandukeshwar, a small village situated on the Rishikesh Badrinath high-way from where Badrinath is just 25 km away is regarded as Tapsthali of king Pandu. In Kedar- khand Puran this land is regarded the land of lord Shiva. The authentic script about the history of Garhwal is found only 6th AD onward. Some of the oldest examples of these are the trishul in Gopeshwar, lalitsur in Pandukeshwar. The Narvaman rock script in siroli the chand pur Gari rock script by king Kankpal authenticates the history and culture of Garhwal. Some historians and scientists believe that this land is origin of Arya race. It is believed that about 300 BC, Khasa invaded Garhwal through Kashmir Nepal and Kuman. A conflict grew due to this invasion a conflict took place between these outsiders and natives. The natives for their protection built small forts called Garhi. Later on, Khasa defeated the native totally and captured the forts. Khasa confined Garhwal of hundreds of Garhi in to fifty-two Garhi only. One vashudev general of khasas established his regime on the northern border of garhwal and founded his capital in joshimath then Kartikeypur.Vashudev katyuri was the founder of katyura dynasty in Garhwal and they reign Garhwal over hundreds of years in this period of katyuri regime Aadi Sankaracharya visited garhwal and established Jyotrimath which is one of the four famous Peeths established by Aadi Sankaracharya. In Bharat varsh other these are Dwarika, Puri and Sringeri. He also reinstated idol of lord Badrinath in Badrinath, before this the idol of Badrinath was hidden in Narad-Kund by the fear of Budhas. After this ethicist of vaidic cult started to pilgrim Badrinath. According to Pt. Harikrishna Raturi, king Bhanu pratap was the first ruler of Panwar dynasty in garhwal who founded chanpur-Garhi as his capital. This was is strongest Garh for the fifty-two garhs of garhwal. The devastating earthquake of 8 September 1803 weakened the economic and administrative set-up of Garhwal state. Taking advantage of the situation, Gorkhas attacked Garhwal under the command of Amar Singh Thapa and Hastidal Chanturia. They established there, reign over half of the Garhwal in 1804 up to 1815 this region remain under Gorkha rule. Meanwhile, the king of Panwar dynasty Raja Sudarshan Shah contacted east India Company and sought help. With the help of British he defected Gorkas and merged the eastern part of Alaknanda and Mandakini along with the capital srinagar in British Garhwal from that time this region was known as British Garhwal and the capital of Garhwal was set up at Tehri instead of Srinagar. In the beginning British ruler kept this area under Dehradun and Saharanpur. But later on the British established a new district in this area and named it Pauri. Today's chamoli was a tehsil of the same. On 24 February 1960, tehsil Chamoli was upgraded to a new district. In October 1997 two complete tehsil and two other blocks (partially) of district chamoli were merged into a new formed district Rudraprayag. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census Chamoli district has a population of 391,605,} roughly equal to the nation of Maldives. This gives it a ranking of 559th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was 5.6%. Chamoli has a sex ratio of 1021 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 83.48%. The major first language of the district is Garhwali, which according to the 2011 census was spoken by 90% of the population. 5.1% of the population identified their language as Hindi, while smaller communities include speakers of Bhotia (1.6%), Nepali (1.4%), Kumaoni (1%) and Rongpo {class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" - valign=top ! colspan=4 Chamoli district: mother-tongue of population, according to the 2011 Indian Census. - valign=top !

Chamoli District is surrounded by Uttarkashi in the northwest, Pithoragarh in the southwest, Almora in the southeast, Rudraprayag in the southwest and Tehri Grahwal in the west. The geographical area of the District is around . ===Geology=== The geology of the region shows that the Himalayas are amongst the youngest mountains in the world. During early Mesozoic times the land mass now covered by them was occupied by the great Tethys sea. The probable date of the commencement of the elevation of the Himalayas is about the close of the Mesozoic era, but the unravelling of the story of their structure has only just begun, and in many cases no dating of the rocks is yet possible, though they include ancient and relatively recent crystalline intrusive, rocks and sediments allied to the peninsular part of India. The section of the range in the district is deeply cut into by the headwaters of the Allaknanda river, this trunk stream seeming to have reached a latter stage of development than its tributaries. This much, however, is known that there has been intense metamorphism. In some parts uplift has been considerable since the mid- Pleistocene epoch, in others there are great stretches of high but subdued topography and elsewhere there are the deepest gorges. The direction of folding in these mountain masses is generally North to South. The geological feature of the district form two major divisions which lies North and south of an imaginary line extending east-southeast between the villages of Hilang in Joshimath and Loharkhet in the adjoining District of Pithoragarh. The Northern division, which is occupied by higher ranges and snow-covered peaks consist entirely of medium to high grade metamorphic rocks and is intruded by later volcanic rocks. The division to the South, occupied by ranges of lower altitude, consists essentially of sedimentary and low grade metamorphic rock also intruded by later volcanic rocks. Geologically very little is known of the first division which consists of rocks such as quartzites, marbles and various types of micaceous schists and gneisses which a few sporadic occurrences of garnet, graphite, iron, kyanite, mica and vein quartz. The division to the south of the imaginary line is better known geologically and consists of rocks such as gneisses, limestone, phyllites, quartzite, sericite- biotite schists and slates. ===Minerals=== The minerals that are found in the district are the following: Asbestos ‚Äì This is of the amosite variety and can be used for the production of asbestos, cement bricks, laboratory asbestos sheet and paper, but is not considered to be of economic importance. Magnestic ‚Äì This is of an average quality is crystalline in nature, and is found associated with crystalline dolomites and sometimes with soapstone. The Magnesium carbonate found here is also of average quality and its mineralisation has also been reported to occur in the district. Soapstone (or steatite) ‚Äì This white saponaceous stone resembling pipe clay is obtained in as lenticular body and is associated with mineral pyrites, which adds a colour to it, and in places with magnesite. it can be mined for use as filler in soap and in the cosmetic industries. In the past various utensils were made of it which, when polished, had the appearance of marble. Copper ‚Äì The copper mines in the district are extensive and of reputed during the period of Hindus and The Gorkhas rules. All the rich mines have since being exhausted and at present they do not offer a fair field for the employment of capital. Iron ‚Äì Small and sporadic occurrence of iron are known to occur in several parts of district but are of hardly any economic important. Iron ore, rich in haematite, and magnetic ore, with haematite and siderite, also occur in the district. Graphite ‚Äì In the past this mineral, also known as plumbago, found mostly in patti Lohba, was used as a dye but no large deposits have been noticed for a long time. Gold ‚Äì Although no gold mines has been discovered in the district, the sands of Alaknanda and the Pinddar are said to be auriferous to a limited extent. Gypsum ‚Äì This mineral is found on the bank of some river and was used in the past for the manufacture of saucers and bowls. when ground to a fine powder it is known as Plaster of Paris and can be used for a number of purposes. Lead ‚Äì Deposits of this metal were fairly numerous in the past but it is found in somewhat inaccessible places and has long since ceased to be worked. Slate ‚Äì This dense, fine grained metamorphic rock, which is produced from a fine clay, can be split into thin, smooth plates and is quarried throughout the district. It is suitable for roofing purposes, the thin dark blue slates being somewhat inferior in quality. Limestone ‚Äì By burning this mineral, lime is procured which can be used as mortar. There are two distinct ranges of limestone hills in the district, the first, north of the Alaknanda in Nagpur, the second, running from Lohba patti to the Pinddar and again to the Alaknanda in patti Bacchansyun in district Garhwal. Reserves of dolomite exists in the district and tufaceous deposits are also found near several Nullahs. Building stone ‚Äì Stone which can be used for building purposes is available in most parts of the district. Sandstone is found in abundance in the lower hills. Gneiss and chlorite schists which are available throughout the district are frequently used for building purposes. Sulphur ‚Äì This yellow mineral, also known as brimstone is found in the district as green sulphate of iron and is obtainable from iron pyrites and copper mines, its presence being characterised by a small as of rotten eggs. Sulphur springs also occur in many parts in the district. Bitumen ‚Äì The brownish white natural sulphate of alumina known as Shilajit is found in rocks at a fairly high altitude and occur in small lumps which generally have an admixture of red sand and micaceous stone embedded in them. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine and during the season when there is an influx of pilgrims, it fetches good income to those who deal in it. Some other minerals found in the district are antimony, arsenic, lignite or brown marble, mica and silver. Physiographically the district, which lies in a region of tectonic or folded and overthrust mountain chains, has strata are structurally marked by complex folds, reverse faults, overthrusts and nappes of great dimensions, all these as well as frequent earthquake of varying intensity give region to believe that the region is still unstable. Although any movement or tremor of the Earth's crust in the district is not produced by volcanic activity, the Chaukhamba peak a pair to be the crater of an extinct volcano. ===Climate=== As the elevation of the district ranges from 800 m to 8,000 m above sea level the climate of the district vary largely depending on the altitude. The winter season is from about mid November to March. As most of the region is situated on the southern slopes of the outer Himalayas, monsoon currents can enter through the valley, the rainfall being heaviest in the monsoon from June to September. Rainfall ‚Äì Most of the rainfall occur during the period June to September when 70 to 80 percent of the annual precipitation is accounted for in the southern half of the district and 55 to 65 percent in the northern half. The effectiveness of the rains is, among others, related to low temperature which means less evapotranspiration and forest or vegetation cover. However, the effectiveness is neither uniform nor even positive in areas where either the vegetational cover is poor and/or has steep slopes or the soils have been so denuded that their moisture absorption capacity has become marginal. Rain gauging stations put up at seven locations by Meteorological department of Govt. of India, represent the settled land mass of Chamoli district. Temperature ‚Äì The details of temperature recorded at the meteorological observatories in the district show that the highest temperature was 34 ¬∞C and lowest 0 ¬∞C. January is the coldest month after which the temperature begin to rise till June or July. temperature vary with elevation. During the winter cold waves in the wake of western disturbances may cause temperature to fall appreciably. Snow accumulation in valleys is considerable. Humidity ‚Äì The relative humidity is high during monsoon season, generally exceeding 70% on the average. The driest part of the year is the pre monsoon period when the humidity may drop to 35% during the afternoon. During the winter months humidity increases toward the afternoon at certain high stations. Cloudiness ‚Äì Skies are heavily clouded during the monsoon months and for short spells when the region is affected by the passage of western disturbances. During the rest of the year the skies are generally clear to lightly clouded. Winds ‚Äì Owing to the nature of terrain local affect are pronounced and when the general prevailing winds not too strong to mask these effect, there is a tendency for diurnal reversal of winds, the flow being anabatic during the day and katabatic at night, the latter being of considerable force. ===River system=== Chamoli district is crisscrossed by several important rivers and their tributaries. Alaknanda, traversing a distance of 229 km. before it confluence with Bhagirathi at Devprayag and constituting the Ganges, is the major river. The Alaknanda originates at a height of 3641 meters below Balakun peak 16 km. upstream from Badrinath form the two glaciers of Bhagirath Kharak and Satopanth. The two glaciers rise from the eastern slopes of Chaukhamba (7140 meters) peak, Badrinath peak and its satellite peaks. These peaks separates the Gangotri group of glaciers in the west. The major portion of the Alaknanda basin falls in Chamoli district. From its source up to Hallang (58 km), the valley is treated as upper Alaknanda valley. The remaining part of the area is known as lower Alanknanda valley. While moving from its source, the river flows in a narrow deep gorge between the mountain slopes of Alkapuri, from which it drives its name. All along its course, it drains its tributaries: #Saraswati joins the Alaknanda 9 km downstream from Mana. #Khir Ganga joins it below the Badrinath shrine and Bhyundar Ganga originated from Tipra glacier and Hemkund Sahib joins Alaknanda River at Govindghat after merging with River Pushpawati at Ghangaria. #Dhauliganga meets at Vishnuprayag above Joshimath. The river Dhauliganga rises from the Nitti Pass at about 5070 meters. Its valley lies between the Kamet groups of peaks in the west and Nandadevi group in the east. The Dhauli takes a northern course at Malari. Between Malari and Tapovan, it is almost a narrow gorge with perpendicular cliffs on either side. several thousand meters high. the Dhauliganga in its turn is fed by GirthiGanga at Kurkuti and Rishiganga 500 metres below Reni. #Downstream small tributaries ‚Äì Helang, Garud, Patal and Birahiganga join the Alaknanda between Joshimath and Chamoli. #Nandakini, which rises from Semudra Glaciers drainage the western slopes of Trishul mountains, joins it at Nandprayag. #Southeast, river Pindar joins the Alaknanda at Karnprayag. The Pindar river is fed by the Milam and Pindar glacier from the Nandadevi group of glacier. The Pindar river, before joining Alaknanda, is fed by Kaliganga and Bheriganga. The rivers of Chamoli district, generally flow with great force in steep and narrow channels often resulting in excessive erosion and collapse of the banks. ===Assembly Constituencies=== #Badrinath #Tharali (SC) #Karnprayag ==Economy== In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Chamoli one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the three districts in Uttaranchal currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). ==Culture, fair and festival== ===Housing=== The houses in the district have not been built according to any town planning scheme but have been put up haphazardly in clusters on level ground at places where water springs are accessible or on the bank of the river in the valley. The houses are built of stones and are generally double-storeyed, a few having three to five storeys, the very low rooms on the ground floor, which are usually 1.8 metres high, being used for housing the cattle. Each house has in front of it a courtyard called a Chauk. A mud or stone staircase or a wooden ladder leads to the upper storey, the roof being of wood. The height of the upper storey is generally 2.1 metres and the roof is usually a sloping structures of timber covered with Patals (quartzite slabs), the well off use corrugated galvanised iron sheets. Generally the upper storey has a veranda in front of the upper rooms. The houses in the higher regions are two to three storeys with balconies all round and paved courtyard in front where people do their threshing, weaving, spinning and other house hold works. A few houses have five or six storeys, the topmost being used as the kitchen. At times the cattle sheds are made at some distance from the villages. The houses are built in rows of half a dozen or so and strikingly picturesque in their fort like appearance. ===Food=== The staple grains consumed by the people of the district are wheat, rice, maze, mandua and jhanjora, the last three being coarse grains generally eaten by the poorer sections. The pulses consumed are urad, gahat, bhatt, soontha, tur, lopia and masor. The Hindus of the district mostly vegetarian by habit and preference and although the Muslims, Christians and Sikhs are generally non-vegetarian, those not able to afford eating meat daily due to want of fund or local unavailability often resulting to a vegetarian diet. ===Jewellery=== Bichhuwas (toe-rings of silver) are worn by married women whose husband are alive. Keels (small studs) worn on the left nostril, nose ring (Naths) and ear rings made of gold and hansulis (ornament worn round the neck), chandanhar (necklaces) and necklaces consisting of coloured beads or rupees or of the teeth and claws of the Panther are generally worn by women and girls. Silver amulets set with turquoise are also worn round the neck and arms. Married women wear anklets made of copper or silver. Churis (Bangles) of gold, silver or of coloured glass are usually worn by women and girls. Bhotiya women wear this type of jewellery and articles made of ivory are also worn at times. Men usually wear rings and some wear gold chain round their neck. ===Dress=== The dress of the people of the district is simple, economical and well suited for the hill environment. The usual dress for men is a Kurta (long lose shirt) or shirt, Pyjama (tight from the knee down), Sadri (jacket), a cap and a knee-length coat, the last named being worn in winter. Those better off are increasingly taking to trousers and buttoned up coats. Women often wear the Sari and full sleeved shirt or Angra (a sort of jacket) in place of a shirt, the well to do wearing woolen jacket in winter. In the rural areas most of the women still wear the long full shirt, tight fitting long sleeved jacket and an Orhni (long scarf for covering the head and shoulders). Female students often wear the Salwar (very full pyjama narrow at the ankle), Kamiz (knee length shirt) and Dupatta ( long scarf for the head and shoulders). The Bhotiyas who lives at high altitudes generally wear woolen clothes. The usual wear for the men are pyjamas, shirt, coat and cap. The women wear grey coloured Angras, a Ghagra (long full shirt), phantu (coloured scarf) and a woolen shawl which is worn so as to make a pocket on each side. Both men and women wear a long piece of cotton cloth as a tight Kamarband (a sort of belt). ===Recreation=== Living in the mountains mostly in places that are not easily accessible, the people of the district have been able to preserve their culture, folklore, folksongs and folk dances, the last, a distinctive feature of the district, being seasonal, traditional and religious, some of the better known being described below. The Thadiya dance, which is accompanied by song, is performed on Basant Panchami, the festival celebrating the advent of Spring, the Mela, another dance, is perform on Deepawali and the Pandava during the winter after the harvesting of the crop and depicts the principal events of the Mahabharata. Other folk dances are Jeetu Bhagdawal and Jagar or Ghariyali. These dances enact mythological stories, the participants, both men and women, put on their traditional colourful dress and dance to the tune of drums and Ransinghas. Another dance performed during the fairs and accompanied by song is the Chanchari, in which both men and women participate. Folk songs are usually traditional and are sung particularly by the women, who work very hard in the fields from morning till night in all kind of weather. During the month Chaitra the women of the village gather at a central place and sing traditional song which generally relate deeds of heroism, love and the hard life which they have to lead in the hills. In the district, fairs, festivals, religious and social gatherings are the main occasions for recreation and amusement. On special occasions people arrange Swangs (open air dramatic performances) particularly depicting scenes or legends connected with Shiva and Parvati. ===Fairs And festivals=== Festivals play an important role in the life of people in the district, as elsewhere, and are spread over the entire year, the most important being briefly described below. Ram Navami falls on the ninth day of the bright half of Chaitra to celebrate the birthday of Rama. The followers of Rama in the district observe fast throughout the day and the Ramayana is read and recited and people gather to listen to the recitations. Nag Panchmi is celebrated in the district on the fifth day of the bright half of Sravana to appease the Nagas or serpent gods. Figures of snakes are drawn in flour in wooden boards and are worshipped by the family by offering milk, flowers and rice. Raksha- Bandhan is traditionally associated with the Brahmanas and falls on the last day of Sravana. On this occasion a sister ties a Rakshasutra (thread of protection)‚Äîcommonly known as Rakhi‚Äîround the right wrist of her brother in token of the protection she expects to receive from him. Fairs are held on this occasion at Kedarnath, Karnaprayag and Nandprayag. Janmastami ‚Äì the festival celebrating the birth of Krishna, falls on the eighth day of the dark half of Bhadra. As in other parts of the state, devotees in the district fast the whole day, breaking their fast only at mid-night when worshipers throng the temples and foregather to have a Jhanki (glimpse) of the shrines and cradles specially installed, decorated and illuminated in homes and other places to commemorate the deity's birth. A special feature of this festival is the singing of devotional songs in praise of Krishna in shrines and homes. The Chhati (sixth-day ceremony after birth) is also celebrated by the devout. The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm at Nagnath, Badrinath and Kedarnath. Dushera ‚Äì falls on the tenth day of the bright half of Asvina and commemorates the victory of Rama over Ravana, the preceding nine days being celebrated as Navaratri dedicated to the worship of the goddess Durga. Ramlila celebrations are held at different places in the district particularly at Kalimath. Dipavali ‚Äì the festival of lights, is celebrated in the district, as elsewhere, on the last day of the dark half of Kartika when the houses are illuminated and the goddess Lakshmi is worshipped. Festivities start two days earlier, with Dhanteras, when metal utensils are purchased as a token of the desired prosperity, followed by Naraka Chaturdashi when a few small earthen lamps are lit as a preliminary to the main day of festival. For traders and businessmen Dipavali marks the end of the fiscal year and they pray for prosperity in the new year. On this occasion the people of the district perform mela nritya, a type of folk dance, a distinctive feature of the district. Makar Sankranti ‚Äì a bathing festival which falls either on 13 or 14 January when people take bath in the Alaknanda and big fairs (Uttaraini) are held at Karnprayag and Nandprayag. Sivaratri ‚Äì falls on the 14th day of the dark half of Phalgun and is observed in the honour of Siva. People fast throughout the day and a vigil is kept at night when the deity is worshipped. The Siva temples are specially decorated and illuminated and large numbers of devotees offer water and flowers to the symbols and images of Siva and sing devotional songs in his praise. Big fairs are held on this occasion at most of the Siva temples of the district particularly at Dewal, Bairaskund, Gopeshwar, and Nagnath. Holi ‚Äì the spring festival, is celebrated on the full moon day of Phalgun. People start singing Phaags (Songs of Phalgun) during the nights, long before the festival. A flag or banner is installed at a central place in the village on the 11th day of bright of Phalgun and is burnt on the 15th day which is known as Chharoli when ash mark is put on the foreheads of friends and relatives. The following day is marked by common rejoicing when, till about noon, people throw coloured water and coloured powder on each other and in evening visit relatives and friends. Many fairs are held in the district, the important ones being mentioned below. On the 13th day of April every year the big fair known as Bishwat Sankranti is held in the district. This fair is also mentioned in the Pandukeshwar inscription of Lalitashuradeva issued in the 22nd regnal year. It is also held at Ming (14 April), Aser (15 April), Hans Koti (16 April), and Kulsari and Adbadri (17 April). Another important fair of the district is the Gaucher Mela held at Gaucher in Karnprayag in the month of November every year and is attended by number of persons. Others fairs of importance are the Nautha at Adbadri, Naumi at Hariyali, Nanda Devi at Bedni, Dattatreya Pooranmasi at Ansuya temple, Nagnath at Dewar Walla. Nanda Devi Raj Jat ‚Äì Nanda Raj Jat, the big pilgrimage of Nandadevi, is unique to Chamoli. It is very old traditional pilgrimage from the time of shalipal in the ninth century. There are no historical records but it is gathered from the local folklores and folksongs (jagori) that Shahipal who had his capital at Chandpur Garhi, buried a tantric instrument at Nauti nearby, and installed his patron-goddess Nandadevi (Raj Rajeshwari) there. The Royal priest, Nautiyal, of Nauti was made responsible for regular worship of the goddess. King Shahipal started a tradition that a big pilgrimage (Nanda Raj Jat) would bw organised every twelfth year to escort Nandadevi to her in-law's place, near Nanda Ghungti peak. When the capital was shifted by Ajay Pal, Kunwar (the younger brother of the king), who gad settled at Kansuwa nearby, was authorised to organise Raj Jat on behalf of King. Traditionally the Kunwar comes to Nauti to seek the blessing of the Devi to organise the Jat. A four horned ram takes birth in Kasuwa area thereafter. A time schedule is drawn up for the Jat so as to reach Homkund on the Nandastami day in August/September, and Kulsari on the preceding new moon for special worship. Accordingly, the Kunwar reaches Nauti with the four horned ram and ringal-umbrella. The Raj Jat starts on the long round-trek of about 280 km. with 19 halts on the way, taking about 19 days. Bhumiyal, Ufrai and Archana Devis are worshipped prior to the departure. The golden image of Nandadevi is carried in a silver palanquin and thousands of devotees follow in a long procession. Great festivities and religious observances mark the Jat wherever they halt or pass through. The procession swells as it advances with various groups joining from far and near with their idols and umbrellas. Special mention may be made of those coming from kurud from Ghat, Lata near Tapovan and Almora in Kumaon. Some 300 idols and decorated umbrellas assembles at Wan, en route Homkund. Mass participation and religious devotion are unmatched, for the Jat involves a long and arduous journey over treacherous terrains rising to an altitude of 5,335 m at Jiura Gali Dhar from a near 900 m at Nauti, walking barefoot over snow and moraines and passing through deep forests. At Shail Samundra the pilgrims see three lights and a streak of smoke just before dawn as a divine beckon. Surprisingly the four horned ram, loaded with the offerings for the goddess, guides the procession of devotees from the Nauti till it reaches Homkund, near the base of Nanda Ghungti, resting every night near the Nauti umbrella of the goddess. At Homkund it manifests human emotions and tears are seen in its eyes before it leaves everyone behind to get lost towards the mountains, laden with the offering of the devotees for the goddess Nandadevi. There is a unique custom of keeping everyone's house unlocked in Wan village for the use of the yatris on the Jat day, according to the divine instruction of the goddess Nandadevi, and it is followed religiously. The last NandaDevi Raj Jat was held during August/September 2000. Smaller Raj Jats are organised annually from Kurud village near Ghat, covering a smaller circuit in August‚ÄìSeptember. ==See also== *1999 Chamoli earthquake ==ReferencesChamoli District Map Category:Districts of Uttarakhand ","title":"Chamoli district"},{"id":"1430917","text":"Wong shadow or Shadow Music was a genre of Thai pop music in the early 1960s.

The duo are known for their work on Hindi film soundtracks, with many evergreen songs being composed by them. Some of their best-known works are Don, Bairaag, Saraswatichandra, Qurbani, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Laawaris (film), Tridev, Safar, etc. They won the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for Kora Kagaz.They also won National Award for best music for the film Saraswati chandra.Awards ==Career== Kalyanji and Anandji were children of a Kutchi businessman who migrated from Kundrodi village in Kutch to 'Bombay' (now Mumbai) to start a grocery and provision store. Their younger brother and his wife are the husband and wife duo Babla & Kanchan. The brothers began to learn music from a music teacher, who taught them in lieu of paying his bills to their father. One of their great-grandparents was a folk musician of some eminence. They spent most of their formative years in the Mumbai locality of Girgaum amidst Marathi and Gujarati environs and among some eminent musical talent that resided in the vicinity. Kalyanji started his career as a musician, with a new electronic instrument called the clavioline. which was used for the famous \\"Nagin Been,\\" used in the film Nagin (1954) which had the music of Hemant Kumar.Carlo Nardi (July 2011). \\"The Cultural Economy of Sound: Reinventing Technology in Indian Popular Cinema\\". Journal on the Art of Record Production, Issue 5 , . Kalyanji then, with his brother Anandji, started an orchestral group called Kalyanji Virji and Party which organised musical shows in Mumbai and outside. This was the first attempt made for holding live musical shows in India. Kalyanji Anandji's arrival in the Bombay film industry as music composers was a turning point. When big music directors like S.D. Burman, Hemant Kumar, Madan Mohan, Naushad , Shankar Jaikishan and O.P Nayyar were ruling the Hindi film music world ‚Äì and it was a golden period of film music ‚Äì it was very tough to make a place amongst them. They still managed to attain success amongst the competition. The Bharat Bhushan‚Äì Nirupa Roy hit Samrat Chandragupta (1959) was his first film as Kalyanji Virji Shah. Songs like \\"Chahe Paas Ho\\" (Lata‚ÄìRafi) that are remembered to this day were what made the movie a commercial success. This was followed by his composing music scores for more films like Post Box 999 before Anandji who was assisting him, joined him officially to form the Kalyanji Anandji duo in Satta Bazaar and Madari (1959). Chhalia (1960) was their earliest major hit. In 1965, two decisive scores, Himalay Ki God Mein and Jab Jab Phool Khile, established them as composers to reckon with. Both Kalyanji and Anandji worked as music composers for over 250 films, 17 of which were golden jubilees and 39 silver. They organised many charitable concerts for NGOs and several charitable institutions in India and abroad with some of the biggest names in Bollywood, like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Rekha and Sridevi. Manhar Udhas, Kumar Sanu, Anuradha Paudwal, Alka Yagnik, Sadhana Sargam, Sapna Mukherjee, Udit Narayan, Sunidhi Chauhan, now very popular names, were nurtured as singers and got their first breaks from Kalyanji Anandji. Laxmikant Pyarelal worked as music assistants to Kalyanji Anandji before composing Music independently for Hindi films. They helped introduce or gave career defining breaks to lyricists like Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Gulshan Bawra, Anjaan, Verma Malik and M G Hashmat. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, their work was introduced to a young Western audience by three albums. Bombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars and Sitars was a mix album put together by US DJ Dan The Automator; Bollywood Funk was an Outcaste compilation album put together by Sutrasonic DJs Harv and Sunni; while The Beginners Guide To Bollywood was compiled by John Lewis from Time Out magazine. All three of these records concentrated on Kalyanji Anandji tracks from 1970s films that featured funk breakbeats, wah-wah guitars and Motown- style orchestrations. In 2005, The Black Eyed Peas's \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\\" used music pieces from two of their songs: \\"Ae Naujawan\\" from the 1972 film Apradh and \\"Yeh Mera Dil\\" from the 1978 film Don, which won the American hip-hop group a Grammy Award. On 24 August 2000, Kalyanji breathed his last. The composers composed some popular songs rendered by Kishore Kumar such as \\"Jeevan se bhari teri aankhe\\", \\"Zindagi ka safar hai ye kaisa Safar\\", \\"Pal Pal dilke paas\\", \\"Neele Neele Ambar Par\\". Their composition called \\"Pal bharke liye\\" was used in an episode of The Simpsons. Remixed version of the song \\"Apni Toh Jaise Taise,\\" originally from the 1981 film Laawaris was used in 2010 Bollywood film Housefull. The Calcutta High Court restrained producer Sajid Nadiadwala from the cinematic use of the song. They used playback of Mohammad Rafi for Dilip Kumar in \\"Bairaag \\" and Kishore Kumar for Shammi Kapur in \\"Vidhata \\".BairaagVidhaata ==Trivia== # \\"Neele Neele Ambar Par\\", sung by Kishore Kumar was a copy of the original song \\"Ilaya Nila\\" song composed by Ilaiyaraaja ==Collaboration with singers== ; Mohd Rafi The duo composed many songs for Mohd Rafi. At their initial stage as music director, Mohd Rafi was their first choice of singer. They made numerous popular song with him. Film Jab Jab Phool Khile rise them to fame and there was no looking back after that. All songs of Jab Jab Phool Khile was huge hit. Beside Jab Jab Phool Khile, there many popular song with Mohd Rafi from film like Qurbani (Kya Dekhte Ho), Bluff Master (Govinda Ala Re Ala), Raaz ( Akele Hain Chehle Aao), Sacha Jhutha (Yuhi Tum Mujhse Baat Karti Hoo), Maryada (Tum Bhi Aja Ke), Haat Ki Safai (Vadaa Karle Sajna), Gopi (Sukh Ki Hai Saab Sathie), Qatilon Ka Qatil ( Yeh To Allah Ko Khabar & Oh Mere Chorni), Geet (Aja Tujh Ko Pukare Mere Geet) & Bairaag (Sare Shaher Mein App Sa) to named a few of the popular song. In film Muqaddar Ka Sikandar where most song was playbacked by Kishore Kumar, they used Mohd Rafi to sing Kishore Kumar Rote Hua Ate Saab some lines on the sad version of the song.

Lata's influence on their music in the initial years can be gauged from the fact that in their first musical score Samrat Chandragupt (1958),Lataji was the only female playback singer, having sung 8 out of 8 numbers in the movie. However, since 1979 they started using Lata mangeshkar's voice very sparingly, even though they kept on offering songs to other senior singers like Asha Bhosle and Kishore Kumar.

Guanabanas\\") are a Puerto Rican reggaeton duo from Villas de Lo√≠za, northeast Puerto Rico. Their names are Georgie and Joelito. == Career == Starting in the world of hip-hop in the late 1980s when they were only engaged breakdancing. In the early 1990s (1992) they had the opportunity to record what was the sequel to the explosion of Puerto Rican hip-hop, as it was the second production of \\"the Noise.\\" On this tape, they had the opportunity to record about ten minutes, a song that the audience welcomed well by the strong content that was talking about blunts, whores, a ton of bad words (that at that time no one heard of), about \\"Guillaera\\", \\"Bellakeo\\", \\"Perreo\\", things that were not common at that time was very extroverted and full of controversy. For the next years a tragedy, the murder of a close friend called Misael, is what motivates them to write a very deep song and had the opportunity to record it in \\"The Noise 3\\" and is nothing more than the song \\"Amigo\\" that was a hit and gave an incredible fame to \\"Las Guanabanas\\", because their lyrics were very mature for that time and for them that they were Teenagers. People who have follow them through their entire careers have truly seen what this singers have gone through and have seen their evolution in the world of Caribbean Hip-Hop, Rap and Reggaeton. In 1998 they released their first production \\"Back To Reality\\" in the hands of Dj Nelson and Flow Music. Then in 1999, they released the sequel \\"Back to Reality 2\\". In 2002, they launched their third production \\"G-3: Guillaera,\\" although it did not have the same impact as their previous productions for their explicit dirty content, this production was of greater international projection that together with previous songs of the Duo to this date are still played on the radio and are considered classic hits of Reggaeton. They are one of the pioneers in the genre of Reggaeton. They have hits with the most brutal DJs of this genre and to this date, they have worked with many DJs, artists, and producers in the Puerto Rican Hip-Hop & Reggaeton Scene, like Dj Playero, Luny Tunes, Noriega, Baby Rasta & Gringo, Tempo, Daddy Yankee, Arcangel, J Alvarez, √ëego & Dalmata, Lui-G 21 Plus, H√©ctor & Tito, Don Chezina, Don Omar (Dominican), Master Joe & O.G. Black, Benyo, Cheka, Zion & Lennox, Yaga & Mackie, Notty Play, Jutha &Small; (Colombians), and many more. Las Guan√°banas were the first to bring reggaeton to London and to have fans not only in the Americas and the Caribbean, but also in Germany Italy and Russia. \\"Pa'lante pa'siempre\\" \\"going forward for ever\\" - Las Guanabanas are not only the pioneers of reggaeton, but also leaders in this genre. Their hits include \\"Maldita P**a\\", \\"Pa' Mis Mujeres Del Mundo\\", \\"Busco Una Mujer\\", \\"Mi Gatita & Yo\\", \\"Vamos Pa La Disco\\", \\"Vente Vamos A Bellakear\\", \\"Guayandote\\", \\"Me Matas\\", \\"Ponte Al Dia\\", \\"Este Pasto\\", \\"UnderGround\\", \\"Llama A los Bomberos\\", \\"Sexo Na' Mas\\", \\"Soltera\\", \\"Como Se Lo Ago Yo\\", \\"Seductora\\", \\"Date Guille\\", \\"Ando Ratata\\" == Personal lives == In the very early stages in an interview with Georgie and Joelito, they were asked about the name of the duo. Joking around, Georgie said Guanabanas Podridas (\\"Rotten Guanabanas\\"). Because of the content of their lyrics and ever since, it got stuck with them, they were then locally known as Las Guanabanas Podridas. Growing up together in Villas De Lo√≠za, Canovanas, P.R. and inseparable in the early trajectory of Las Guanabanas for unknown reasons in 2005 Joelito decides to spend time with his family and get away from the stage, cameras and social media, although there's a lot of rumors about the Duo's relationship they are still good friends and participated together on April 2, 2016 at a show in Puerto Rico what it was the reengagement of all the artist that participated in the albums of \\"The Noise\\", in where the videos online are titled \\"The Noise El Reencuentro\\". ==Discography== Studio √°lbums * 1998: Back To Reality * 1999: Back To Reality 2 * 2002: Guillaera Compilation √°lbums * 2000: Collection * 2004: Collection 2 ==References== ==External links== *Instagram: @Guanabanas @GuanabanasUpdated * @GuanabanasClothing @BanaguanaPR * Twitter: @Guanabanas * YouTube: Guanabanas TV Category:Puerto Rican reggaeton artists Category:Reggaeton duos Category:Musical groups established in 1992 ","title":"Las Guan√°banas"},{"id":"1430934","text":"The Second Battle of Athenry ( ) took place at Athenry () in Ireland on 10 August 1316 during the Bruce campaign in Ireland. ==Overview== The collective number of both armies are unknown, and can only be estimated.

It occurs when the first key word of the idea refers to something that happens temporally later than the second key word. The goal is to call attention to the more important idea by placing it first. The standard example comes from the Aeneid of Virgil: \\"Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus\\" (\\"Let us die, and charge into the thick of the fight\\"; ii. 353). An example of hysteron proteron encountered in everyday life is the common reference to putting on one's \\"shoes and socks\\", rather than \\"socks and shoes\\". By this deliberate reversal, hysteron proteron draws attention to the important point, so giving it primacy. Hysteron proteron is a form of hyperbaton, which describes general rearrangements of the sentence. It can also be defined as a figure of speech consisting of the reversal of a natural or rational order (as in \\"then came the thunder and the lightning\\"). ==Example from the Quran== An example from the Quran that demonstrates hysteron proteron, verse (aya) number 89‚Äì90 from Sura Number 21 from the Quran says that God granted Zechariah's prayer for a son, even though Zechariah was very old and his wife was sterile: \\"We granted his prayer and gave him John, and we made his wife fertile for him.\\" Quran (89‚Äì90, 21) The sequence, one feels, should have been: We granted his prayer; we made his wife fertile for him; and [having done so] we gave him John. The reversal of the expected sequence (hysteron proteron) in the verse suggests immediacy: Zechariah's prayer was granted without any delay at all, so much so that the detail itself, \\"We made his wife fertile for him,\\" was not allowed to intervene between the prayer and its acceptance.Literature and the Quran, Encyclopaedia Of The Quran ==See also== * Begging the question, a subtype of which is sometimes called \\"hysteron proteron\\" as well * Cart before the horse * George Hysteron-Proteron * Hysteron Proteron Club ==References== Category:Rhetorical techniques Category:Figures of speech Category:Narratology Category:Word order ","title":"Hysteron proteron"},{"id":"1430945","text":"James Wolcott (born December 10, 1952) is an American journalist, known for his critique of contemporary media.

After attending Etheridge Secondary Modern School he studied Metallurgy at Wednesbury Technical College. Powell then worked as a metallurgist in a small foundry before turning professional as a drummer. He was athletic and a keen amateur boxer, although an easy going personality, and apparently had his nose broken three times. It was he who was sent around with the hat money collection amongst early audiences. Powell became a member of The Vendors, a band that guitarist Dave Hill later joined. The Vendors became the N'Betweens and bass guitarist / keyboard player / violinist / guitarist Jim Lea got in at an audition. Powell then spotted Noddy Holder playing with Steve Brett & The Mavericks and he and Hill got Holder to join the N'Betweens. They regrouped as Ambrose Slade, changed the name to Slade and the success began. It always amused them that they played their first rehearsal on 1 April. ==Song writing== He co-wrote a number of Slade's earlier songs, mainly with Lea. Many of them can be found on the 1970 Slade album Play it Loud. He also co-wrote one of Slade's Top 10 hits \\"Look Wot You Dun\\" with Holder and Lea in 1972, and made the breathing noises in the background of the song. ==Drum choice== Powell started drumming on a borrowed Olympic kit as a youngster. He moved up to a deep blue Hayman set for his work with Slade until the early 1970s. From there he changed to Ludwig, but in the mid-2000s he switched to Pearl as the original Ludwig firm had changed ownership. Currently he states he likes a four-piece kit with a shallow snare drum. == Accident == At 1 am on 4 July 1973, when Slade were popular in Europe and number one in the UK Singles Chart with \\"Skweeze Me Pleeze Me\\", Powell was badly injured in a serious car crash at Compton Road West, Wolverhampton, in which his 20-year- old fianc√©e Angela Morris was killed. The car hit a hedge, road sign and then smashed into a wall. Powell fractured his skull, smashed several teeth, broke both of his ankles and five of his ribs. Surgeons had to drill into his skull to ease the internal pressure and he was unconscious for six days but he came round and eventually pulled through, finding the best therapy to be work. Powell left hospital on 30 JulyDaily Mirror - 31 July 1973 and by mid-August was back recording with the group. When the Top 5 hit \\"My Friend Stan\\" was recorded, Powell was walking with the aid of a stick and had to be lifted onto his drum-kit. The accident left Powell with no senses of taste and smell, and he still has severe problems with his short-term memory, whilst his long-term memory has remained unaffected. ==Post-Slade career== When Slade split up in February 1992, Powell owned and operated an antique import/export company before he reconvened the band as Slade II later that year with Dave Hill. He remained active with various line-ups. In 1994, the band released the album Keep on Rockin'. The name of the band was shortened back to Slade in 1997. In 2000, Powell had a small cameo role in the BBC TV version of Lorna Doone. Powell has been married twice and for a number of years he lived in Bexhill- on-Sea, East Sussex, England. In 2004, he moved to Silkeborg, Denmark where he now lives with his Danish wife Hanna. In December 2005, Powell appeared in the Channel 4 TV documentary Bring Back...The Christmas Number One. A long-time fan of Ringo Starr, Powell contributed the foreword to the 2016 book Ringo Starr And The Beatles Beat by Alex Cain and Terry McCusker. As the drummer with Colonel Bagshot, McCusker toured with Slade in the 1970s and the two have remained firm friends. Powell is now one-third of the group Quatro Scott Powell (QSP) alongside Suzi Quatro and Sweet guitarist Andy Scott. Don has played at two of Scott's 'Concert At The Kings' events at All Cannings in Wiltshire, and in 2017 he contributed towards a BBC Radio Wiltshire documentary of the life of former Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt. In late 2019, Powell's side project, Don Powell's Occasional Flames featuring Les Glover - lead vocals and guitars and Paul Cookson lyrics and poetry, released their first album and single which charted on several download sites, the highest position being 23 on Amazon chart. In February 2020, Powell announced that he had been fired by email by Dave Hill and would be forming Don Powell's Slade to perform Slade songs. ==Biography== Powell collaborated with Lise Lyng Falkenberg on his biography since 2006, in part using the notebooks and diaries he kept due to his problems with short term memory following his 1973 accident. The biography, titled Look Wot I Dun - My Life in Slade was released via the publisher Music Sales Ltd on 14 October 2013. It looks in detail at Slade's long career and Powell's life, which included booze-ups with Ozzy Osbourne. Additionally in 2013, Powell created his own website, and in early 2014 he published his diary entries for 1977 and 1978. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:English rock drummers Category:People from Bilston Category:English songwriters Category:Musicians from the West Midlands (county) Category:Glam rock musicians Category:Slade members Category:English autobiographers ","title":"Don Powell"},{"id":"1430958","text":"Met-Mex Pe√±oles is a large metallurgical and chemical company located in Torre√≥n, Coahuila Mexico.

She is best known for her work with wavelets in image compression. Daubechies is recognized for her study of the mathematical methods that enhance image-compression technology. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is also a 1992 MacArthur Fellow. The name Daubechies is widely associated with the orthogonal Daubechies wavelet and the biorthogonal CDF wavelet. A wavelet from this family of wavelets is now used in the JPEG 2000 standard. Her research involves the use of automatic methods from both mathematics, technology and biology to extract information from samples like bones and teeth. She also developed sophisticated image processing techniques used to help establish the authenticity and age of some of the world's most famous works of art including paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt. ==Early life and education== Daubechies was born in Houthalen, Belgium, as the daughter of Marcel Daubechies (a civil mining engineer) and Simonne Duran (then a homemaker, later a criminologist).Diamant voor Simonne en Marcel in nieuwsblad.be She remembers that when she was a little girl and could not sleep, she did not count numbers, as you would expect from a child, but started to multiply numbers by two from memory. Thus, as a child, she already familiarized herself with the properties of exponential growth. Her parents found out that mathematical conceptions, like cone and tetrahedron, were familiar to her before she reached the age of 6. She excelled at the primary school, moved up a class after only 3 months. After completing the Lyceum in HasseltDaubechies herself, quoted in Flanders Today #15, October 2014, available here. Retrieved 19 August 2017. she entered the Vrije Universiteit Brussel at 17. Daubechies completed her undergraduate studies in physics at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 1975. During the next few years, she visited the CNRS Center for Theoretical Physics in Marseille several times, where she collaborated with Alex Grossmann; this work was the basis for her doctorate in quantum mechanics. She obtained her PhD in theoretical physics in 1980 at Free University in Brussels. ==Career== Daubechies continued her research career at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel until 1987, rising through the ranks to positions roughly equivalent with research assistant-professor in 1981 and research associate-professor 1985, funded by a fellowship from the NFWO (Nationaal Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). Daubechies spent most of 1986 as a guest-researcher at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. At Courant she made her best-known discovery: based on quadrature mirror filter-technology she constructed compactly supported continuous wavelets that would require only a finite amount of processing, in this way enabling wavelet theory to enter the realm of digital signal processing. In July 1987, Daubechies joined the Murray Hill AT&T; Bell Laboratories' New Jersey facility. In 1988 she published the result of her research on orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets in Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics.I.

From 1991-1994 Daubechies taught as a professor at Rutgers University in their Mathematics Department. In 1994, Daubechies moved to Princeton University, where she was active within the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics. In 2004 she was named William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor and became the first female full professor of mathematics at Princeton. In January 2011 Daubechies moved to Duke University to serve as the James B. Duke Professor in the department of mathematics and electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. In 2016, she and Heekyoung Hahn founded Duke Summer Workshop in Mathematics (SWIM) for female rising high school seniors. Daubechies is on the board of directors of Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE), a program that helps women entering graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. She was the first woman to be president of the International Mathematical Union (2011‚Äì2014). ==Awards and honors== Daubechies received the Louis Empain Prize for Physics in 1984, awarded once every five years to a Belgian scientist on the basis of work done before the age of 29. Between 1992 and 1997 she was a fellow of the MacArthur Foundation and in 1993 was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994 she received the American Mathematical Society Steele Prize for Exposition for her book Ten Lectures on Wavelets and was invited to give a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich. In 1997 she was awarded the AMS Ruth Lyttle Satter prize. In 1998, she was elected to the United States National Academy of SciencesPersonal entry, United States National Academy of Sciences and won the Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society She became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. She became a member of the Academia Europaea in 2015. In 2000, Daubechies became the first woman to receive the National Academy of Sciences Award in Mathematics, presented every 4 years for excellence in published mathematical research. The award honored her \\"for fundamental discoveries on wavelets and wavelet expansions and for her role in making wavelets methods a practical basic tool of applied mathematics\\". She was awarded the Basic Research Award, German Eduard Rhein Foundation and the NAS Award in Mathematics. In January 2005, Daubechies became the third woman since 1924 to give the Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecture sponsored by the American Mathematical Society. Her talk was on \\"The Interplay Between Analysis and Algorithm\\". Daubechies was the 2006 Emmy Noether Lecturer at the San Antonio Joint Mathematics Meetings. In September 2006, the Pioneer Prize from the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics was awarded jointly to Daubechies and Heinz Engl. In 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In 2011, Daubechies was the SIAM John von Neumann Lecturer, and was awarded the IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal, the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research from the American Mathematical Society, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering from the Franklin Institute. In 2012, King Albert II of Belgium granted Daubechies the title of Baroness. She also won the 2012 Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, Northwestern University, and the 2012 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Basic Sciences category (jointly with David Mumford). In 2015, Daubechies gave the Gauss Lecture of the German Mathematical Society. The Simons Foundation, a private foundation based in New York City that funds research in mathematics and the basic sciences, gave Daubechies the Math + X Investigator award, which provides money to professors at American and Canadian universities to encourage new partnerships between mathematicians and researchers other fields of science. She was the one to suggest Simons that the foundation should fund not new research but better mechanisms for interpreting existing data. In 2018, Daubechies won the William Benter Prize in Applied Mathematics from City University of Hong Kong (CityU). She is the first female recipient of the award. Prize officials cited Professor Daubechies' pioneering work in wavelet theory and her \\"exceptional contributions to a wide spectrum of scientific and mathematical subjects...her work in enabling the mobile smartphone revolution is truly symbolic of the era.\\" In 2018, Daubechies was awarded the Fudan- Zhongzhi Science Award ($440,000) for her work on wavelets. She is part of the 2019 class of fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics. Daubechies was named the North American Laureate of 2019 L'Or√©al-UNESCO International Award For Women in Science. Since 1998, the award annually recognizes five outstanding women in chemistry, physics, materials science, mathematics, and computer science worldwide; Daubechies was chosen (for North America) along with Najat Aoun Saliba (Africa and Arab States), Maki Kawai (Asia Pacific), Karen Hallberg (Latin America), and Claire Voisin (Europe). In 2020, Daubechies received the Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research. ==Personal life== In 1985, Daubechies met mathematician Robert Calderbank, then on a 3-month exchange visit from AT&T; Bell Laboratories, New Jersey to the Brussels-based mathematics division of Philips Research; they married in 1987.

He was a pioneer in the building of canals and tramways. ==Life== Born at Alfreton in Derbyshire, he began his career assisting his father Joseph Outram, who described himself as an \\"agriculturalist\\", but was also a land agent, an enclosure commissioner arbitrating in the many disputes which arose from the enclosures acts, an advisor on land management, a surveyor for new mines and served as a turnpike trustee. In 1792 his neighbour George Morewood died and left his estates to Ellen Morewood. She was mining under Outram land. Over the next nine years the Outrams engaged in a legal battle with her. Land had been sold to them by the Morewoods but Ellen believed that she still had the rights to the coal and ironstone beneath them. James and Benjamin Outram disagreed and they appealed and in 1803 the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, Lord Ellenborough agreed with them. In 1803 he had a son, James Outram, who became a general in the Indian Army and was later knighted. He died of a \\"brain fever\\" (stroke) while visiting London in 1805. After his death, and some considerable litigation, in 1807 Benjamin Outram and Company was renamed the Butterley Company. The grave of Margaret Outram, St Johns, Edinburgh After his death, his wife Margaret (1778‚Äì1863), daughter of James Anderson, wrote that Outram \\"was hasty in his temper, feeling his own superiority over others. Accustomed to command, he had little toleration for stupidity and slowness, and none for meanness or littleness of any kind.\\" In spite of his prowess, Outram's wife and family were for a while reduced to near poverty after his death until his liabilities could be settled through the courts. She died in Edinburgh and is buried in St John's churchyard in one of the lower terraces. ==Career== ===Early career=== Joseph Outram was a promoter of the Cromford Canal, and when William Jessop was approached to design and build it he found an able assistant in 24-year-old Benjamin. Construction of the canal, particularly Butterley Tunnel, revealed substantial mineral deposits. The neighbouring Butterley Hall and its estate came on the market at this time and Francis Beresford, solicitor to the canal company, bought the freehold of the hall and its estate. He leased it on a moiety to Outram until the latter had acquired enough capital for a fifty percent holding. ===Established canal and railway engineer=== A replica of a \\"Little Eaton Tramway\\" wagon This was the beginning of the ironworks, 'Benjamin Outram & Company' which began trading in 1790. The following year William Jessop and John Wright, a Nottingham banker, also became partners. Starting with a nominal capital of ¬£6000, Outram was the only partner active in the management of the company, assisted by his younger brother, Joseph. Over time the business expanded to include a limestone quarry, limekilns, collieries and ironstone pits. Outram became a leading advocate in the construction of tramways using L-section rails, which along with the wagons were manufactured at his Butterley Ironworks. His first tramway was a line slightly over in length, built to carry limestone from quarries at Crich to Bullbridge Wharf on the Cromford Canal, for use by his works. In 1792 he became engineer for the Nottingham Canal and in 1793 the Derby Canal, working in the meantime on the Nutbrook Canal. One of his major works was the long single-span Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal, which opened in February 1796 and was one of the first cast-iron aqueducts. It was cast by Benjamin Outram & Company and predated Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, Thomas Telford's longer aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal at Longdon-on-Tern by one month. It proved troublesome and needed substantial remedial work in 1802, 1812 and 1930, eventually being demolished in 1971. The Little Eaton Gangway An important extension to the Derby Canal was the Little Eaton Gangway, a feeder for the Derby Canal built on the pattern of that at Crich. Such tramways became an important part of his later canals. A common misconception is that the word \\"tramway\\" comes from Outram's surname but the word actually derives from the Low German word \\"traam\\" meaning \\"a beam\\" (of a wheelbarrow). Outram always referred to tramways as railways. Outram was the consulting engineer for the construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, which included the pioneering Standedge Canal Tunnel. In 1794 he was the engineer for the Peak Forest Canal, which included the Marple Aqueduct. The climb from Bugsworth was negotiated by the Peak Forest Tramway. Stodhart Tunnel on this tramway is believed to be the first railway tunnel in Derbyshire. In 1796 he reported on the extra funds needed to complete construction of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. In 1798, he was retained to complete the final section of the Ashton Canal which included the Store Street Aqueduct, among the first to solve the problem of skew arches. Outram also built railways for the Ashby- de-la-Zouch Canal such as the Ticknall Tramway and was asked to advise on railways for the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. He predicted within a few years of their introduction that railways would become the principal mode of transport. In 1799 he wrote, while building the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal railway at four foot two inch gauge, \\"it appears that many hogsheads and packages require carriages . . . wider than those at Derby and Crich\\" and \\"it seems desirable that all extensive railways should be of the same width and that width should be sufficient to suit all the purposes of trade\\". His sudden death, leaving no will, led to considerable confusion in resolving the company's affairs, and it was not until 1815 that the company's affairs and liabilities with his wife and family were settled. ==See also== *Canal *Narrowboat *National Tramway Museum *Little Eaton Gangway *Peak Forest Tramway * Ticknall ==References== ==External links== * Biography of Benjamin Outram at David Kitching's Home Page Category:1764 births Category:1805 deaths Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:English canal engineers Category:British railway civil engineers Category:British railway pioneers Category:People from Alfreton Category:British surveyors Category:English businesspeople ","title":"Benjamin Outram"},{"id":"1430996","text":"' is the provisional designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring. It is not clear whether it is only a transient clump of dust, or if there is a solid moonlet at its core. It was first seen by scientists in images taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004 and announced on November 8 that year. It appears to be the best tracked object in this region with at least five probable sightings in the period to late 2005. In comparison, two objects in the F ring's vicinity ( and ) that were first seen several months earlier have not been recovered with any confidence. Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to or whether it is just a transient dust clump that will dissipate on a timescale of years or months. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15, 2004 (soon after 's discovery) failed to recover the object, while it has been seen again later. The lighting conditions in 's part of the orbit were different during these two observations, however, with the discovery being made when the region was strongly backlit by the sun. A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that 's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April 2005. It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the tenuous material surrounding the F ring may have been a consequence of this. The dusty halo seen in images is sizeable, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. The solid object, if any, would be no greater than 3‚Äì5 km in diameter based on brightness. Additional evidence came in 2008, as it appears that S/2004 S 6 or a body like it is required to explain the dynamics of the F Ring.\\"The determination of the structure of Saturn's F ring by nearby moonlets\\" Carl D.

He worked most of his life in France and Germany. ==Biography== Kostolany was born in Budapest, a Hungarian Roman Catholic of Jewish descent. He originally studied Philosophy and History of Art in Budapest but his father forced him to abandon his studies and sent him to Paris in 1924, to work as a Stockbroker. There he began his career as a speculator and arbitrageur. He was able to make a profit during the decline in market prices which began at the end of 1929, having been bearish at the time. When the Germans occupied France in 1940, he fled to New York. From 1941 to 1950, he was the general director and president of the G. Ballai and Co Financing Company. From 1950 he lived mainly in Paris, with an office in Munich and a vacation home on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. After World War II, he invested heavily in the reconstruction of Germany, The subsequent economic boom helped him build up his fortune. In return, Kostolany spent most of his later life writing columns and holding seminars about the stock market in Germany, where he became famous as a stock market expert. His fame was founded in the vast amount of practical experience he had accumulated during his 70-year career, in different trades, in many markets around the world. He died in Paris at the age of 93. ==His beliefs== Kostolany, spurred by his successful investment in Germany after World War II, held a deep respect for ‚Äúthe inherent qualities and capabilities of the German people‚Äù, which, according to him, would consequently lead Germany to a new economic boom (see Wirtschaftswunder), after the German economy absorbed the shock of reunification. Kostolany was a critic of the gold standard, the monetary system that fixes exchange rates to the price of gold, since he believed that whenever it was used, it suppressed economic growth and led to cyclical crises. Consequently, he was a very vocal critic of the monetary policy of the Bundesbank during the 1980s and 1990s. ==Published works== Kostolany published a lot of books in various languages, including 13 books that sold more than 3 million copies in total. He was for many years the author of a column in the monthly Capital, a stock market related magazine in Germany (he wrote a total of 414 articles).

Martin House Complex, also known as the Darwin Martin House National Historic Landmark, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built between 1903 and 1905. Located at 125 Jewett Parkway in Buffalo, New York, it is considered to be one of the most important projects from Wright's Prairie School era, and ranks along with The Guggenheim in New York City and Fallingwater in Pennsylvania among his greatest works. Wright scholar Robert McCarter said of it: > It can be argued that the Martin House Complex ... is the most important > house design of the first half of Wright's career, matched only by > Fallingwater over 30 years later. ==History== The Martin House Complex was occupied by businessman Darwin D. Martin, his wife and family; and his sister Delta and her husband George F. Barton. Martin and his brother, William E. Martin, were co-owners of the E-Z Stove Polish Company based in Chicago.Edgar Tafel, Years with Frank Lloyd Wright: Apprentice to Genius, p.83, Courier Dover Publications; 1985 In 1902 William commissioned Wright to build him a home in Oak Park, the resultant William E. Martin House built in 1903. Upon viewing his brother's home, Darwin Martin was significantly impressed to visit Wright's Studio, and persuaded Wright to view his property in Buffalo, where he planned to build two houses. In 1904, Martin was instrumental in selecting Wright as the architect for the Larkin Administration Building, in downtown Buffalo, which was Wright's first major commercial project. Martin was the secretary of the Larkin Soap Company and consequently Wright designed houses for other Larkin employees William R. Heath and Walter V. Davidson. Wright also designed the E-Z Stove Polish Company's Factory built in 1905. Wright designed the complex as an integrated composition of connecting buildings, consisting of the primary building, the Martin House, a long pergola connecting with a conservatory, a carriage house- stable, and a smaller residence, the Barton House, built for George F. Barton and his wife Delta, Martin's sister. The complex also includes a gardener's cottage, the last building completed. Martin, disappointed with the small size of the conservatory, had a 60 ft (18m) long greenhouse constructed between the gardener's cottage and the carriage house, to supply flowers and plants for the buildings and grounds. This greenhouse was not designed by Wright, and Martin ignored Wright's offer \\"to put a little architecture on it\\". Over the next twenty years a long-term friendship grew between Wright and Martin, to the extent that the Martins provided financial assistanceRobert M. Craig, Bernard Maybeck at Principia College, p.478, Gibbs Smith; 2004 and other supportJack Quinan, Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House, p.216, Princeton Architectural Press; 2004Caroline Knight, Frank Lloyd Wright, p. 124, Parragon; 2004. to Wright as his career unfolded. Some twenty years later, in 1926, Wright designed the second major complex for the Martin family, Graycliff, a summer estate overlooking Lake Erie in nearby Derby, NY. The Blue-Sky Mausoleum Wright designed for the Martins in 1928, but never built, was finally installed at Buffalo's Forest Lawn Cemetery in 2004. ==Design== A Home in a Prairie Town ‚Äì Ladies Home Journal, Feb 1901 The complex exemplifies Wright's Prairie School ideal and is comparable with other notable works from this period in his career, such as the Robie House in Chicago and the Dana- Thomas House in Springfield, Illinois. Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his \\"opus\\", and calling the complex \\"A well-nigh perfect composition\\". Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century. In 1900 Edward Bok of the Curtis Publishing Company, bent on improving American homes, invited architects to publish designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, the plans of which readers could purchase for five dollars.Brendan Gill, Many Masks, p.147-149, Da Capo Press; 1998 Subsequently, the Wright design \\"A Home in a Prairie Town\\" was published in February 1901 and first introduced the term \\"Prairie Home\\". The Martin House, designed in 1903, bears a striking resemblance to that design. The facades are almost identical, except for the front entrance, and the Martin House repeats most of the Journal House ground floor. An awkward failure was no direct connection from the kitchen to the dining room. The Journal House had a serving pantry, but Wright was forced to give this up to accommodate the pergola. Of particular significance are the fifteen distinctive patterns of 394 art glass windows that Wright designed for the entire complex, some of which contain over 750 individual pieces of jewel-like iridescent glass, that act as \\"light screens\\" to visually connect exterior views with the spaces within. More patterns of art glass were designed for the Martin House than for any other of Wright's Prairie Houses. Walter Burley Griffin landscaped the grounds, which were created as integral to the architectural design. A semi-circular garden which contained a wide variety of plant species, chosen for their blossoming cycles to ensure blooms throughout the growing season, surrounded the Martin House veranda. The garden included two sculptures by Wright collaborator Richard Bock.Carla Lind, Frank Lloyd Wright's Furnishings. Consulted on August 14, 2007. ==Complex== === The Complex === The Complex is located within the Parkside East Historic District of Buffalo, which was laid out by the American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in 1876. Darwin Martin purchased the land in 1902. Construction began in 1903, and completed with Wright signing off on the project in 1907. The original complete Martin House Complex was 29080 ft2 (2700m2). === The Martin House === Built between 1902 and 1905, the Martin House is distinguished from Wright's other prairie style houses by its unusually large size and open plan.Reyner Banham & Francis R. Kowsky, Buffalo Architecture, p.195-197, Buffalo Architectural Guidebook Corporation; 1981William A. Storrer, The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, p.99-100, University of Chicago Press; 2002 On the ground floor an entry hall bisects the house. To the right, behind a large double sided hearth, is a central living room. The room is flanked by a dining room and library which together create a long continuous space. The other axis, centered on the hearth, continues the living room out to a large covered veranda. To the left of the entry hall, is a reception room similar in size to the living room, the kitchen, and several smaller rooms. A separate mass provides for a reception room hearth, and one to the level above. The wing completes with a porte- coch√®re balancing the veranda. Above the entry hall, stairs wrap a small covered light well opening to the second floor. This floor provides eight bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a sewing room. The entry hall continues on axis to the pergola and conservatory beyond. Martin had imposed no budget and Wright is believed to have spent close to $300,000.Brendan Gill, Many Masks, p.172, Da Capo Press; 1998 By comparison Martin's brother's house cost about $5000,Brendan Gill, Many Masks, p.141, Da Capo Press; 1998 and the Ladies' Home Journal house design an estimated price of $7000. The Martin House is located at the south end of the complex,Complex Model at www.buffaloah.com at 125 Jewett Parkway, Buffalo. === The Barton House === Construction on the Barton House began first in 1903 and not only was it the first building of the complex to be completed but also the first of Wright's in Buffalo. The principal living spaces are concentrated in the center two story portion of the house where the reception, living and dining areas open into each other. The two main bedrooms are on the second story, at either end of a narrow hall. On the ground floor the kitchen is at the north end, while a scaled veranda extends from the reception hall to the south. The Barton House is on the east side of the complex, at 118 Summit Avenue, Buffalo. === The carriage house === Originally the carriage house served as a stable with horse stalls, a hay loft, and storage for a carriage, but soon became a garage with a service area for a car, and an upstairs apartment for a chauffeur.The Carriage House at buffaloah.com The carriage house also contained the boilers for the complex's heating system. Built between 1903 and 1905, the original structure was demolished in 1962, and rebuilt during the restoration between 2004 and 2007. The carriage house is at the north end of the complex, directly north of the Martin House porte-cochere, to the west of the conservatory. === The gardener's cottage === Built in 1909 of wood and stuccoThe gardener's cottage at buffaloah.com the gardener's cottage is so modest in size that a boxy configuration appears to have been inevitable, contrary to Wright's ideal of opening up the confining \\"box\\" of traditional American houses. Nevertheless, Wright managed to create an illusion of the pier and cantilever principle that characterized the Martin House by placing tall rectangular panels at each corner of the building. The gardener was Reuben Polder, who had to provide fresh flowers daily for every room in the Martin House, a task which he completed until Darwin Martin died in 1935. The gardener's cottage is on the west side of the complex, at 285 Woodward Avenue, Buffalo. === The conservatory === Built for plant growing the conservatory features a glass- and-metal roof supported by brick piers.Jack Quinan, Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House, p.13, Princeton Architectural Press; 2004 A plaster cast of the Winged Victory of Samothrace stands at the entrance and creates a vista through the pergola. The original conservatory was demolished in 1962, and rebuilt between 2004 and 2007 as part of the restoration. The conservatory is at the north end of the complex between the carriage house and the Barton House. === The pergola === The pergola runs from the entrance hall of the Martin House to the entrance of the conservatory, and is about 100 ft (30m) long.landmarksociety.org The original pergola was demolished in 1962, and was rebuilt between 2004 and 2007. The Pergola is at the center of the complex, running north‚Äìsouth between the Martin House and the conservatory. ==Gallery of drawings== File:D. D.

Martin House OG.pngSecond floor == Decline == Following the loss of the family fortune, due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, and subsequently Darwin Martin's death in 1935, the family abandoned the house in 1937. Martin's son, D.R. Martin, had attempted to donate the house to the city or the university to be used as a library but his offer was rejected.Edgar Tafel, Years with Frank Lloyd Wright: Apprentice to Genius, p.92-93, Courier Dover Publications; 1985 By 1937 the complex had already begun to deteriorate, the walls at the front of the house were crumbling, and the conservatory hadn't been used for several years due to a leak in the heating system.Edgar Tafel, Years with Frank Lloyd Wright: Apprentice to Genius, p.88, Courier Dover Publications; 1985 Over the next two decades, the vacant house was considerably vandalized and deteriorated further. In 1946 the city took control over the property in a tax foreclosure sale. Purchased in 1951 by the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, with plans to turn the complex into a summer retreat for their priests, it remained empty. Coincidentally 1951 was also the year Graycliff was sold to the Piarists, a Catholic teaching order. The complex was purchased privately in 1955 by architect Sebastian Tauriello, thus saving the house from demolition. It was converted into three apartments, the grounds sub-divided, with the carriage house, conservatory, and pergola in ruins at the time of the private purchase, demolished, and a pair of apartment buildings constructed in the 1960s. In 1967 the complex was purchased by the University at Buffalo, for use as the university president's residence. The university continued the sub-division with the Barton House sold in 1967 and the gardener's cottage soon after. The university attempted restoration of the Martin House, although this consisted mainly of slight modernizations, several pieces of original furniture were located. The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and became a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and == Restoration == The Martin House Restoration Corporation (MHRC), founded in 1992,The Martin House Restoration Corporation. Retrieved February 10, 2013 is a non-profit organization with a mandate to restore the complex to its 1907 condition and to open it as a public house museum. The Barton House was purchased on behalf of the MHRC in 1994 and the title to the Martin House was transferred from the University at Buffalo to the MHRC in 2002. The restoration began with the Buffalo firm Hamilton Houston Lownie Architects (HHL) being commissioned to restore the roof of the Martin House. The Gardener's Cottage was purchased in 2006, and the demolished carriage house, conservatory, and pergola were reconstructed and completed in 2007. The $50 Million restoration project was completed in June 2017. This is the first time that a demolished Wright structure has been rebuilt in the United States. One of Richard Bock's sculptures, Spring, now located in the Bock Museum at Greenville College, was copied in 2008. Currently the MHRC operate guided public tours and present educational programs for volunteers and the general public. In 2008, the Gardener's Cottage was finally included on the tours of the complex. The Eleanor & Wilson Greatbatch Pavilion Visitor Center, designed by Toshiko Mori, opened March 12, 2009. In June 2017, the unveiling of the Wisteria Mosaic Fireplace, a 360-degree work of art consisting of tens of thousands of individual glass tiles, marks the completion of the $50 million project. ==Gallery of photographs== 1965 File:D.

Eerie Von's preferred bass is the Fender Jazz Bass. ==Early life== Eerie Von was raised in Lodi, New Jersey. As a child he gained an interest in drawing and art. He grew up listening mostly to Elvis Presley and 50s rock and roll music. Eerie Von began playing the drums and taking lessons at 8 years old. He attended Lodi High School with future Misfits guitarist Doyle, who introduced Eerie Von to the punk rock music of the Misfits. It was in high school that he assumed \\"Eerie\\" as his nickname. ==Rosemary's Babies and Misfits== Eerie Von became interested in photography in 1978. He would later strike a friendship with Glenn Danzig and the Misfits, becoming the band's photographer in 1981. Eerie Von was the drummer for the hardcore punk band Rosemary's Babies from 1980 to 1983, recording drums on the Blood Lust EP and the Talking to the Dead compilation album. Eerie Von was once asked to join the Misfits as a drummer, but declined, choosing to remain with Rosemary's Babies. Although never an official Misfits member, in 1986 Eerie Von performed bass and drums on several tracks which eventually appeared on the band's Collection II compilation album in 1995. Eerie Von's close association with the Misfits led to him providing the liner notes to the Misfits box set in 1996. ==Samhain and Danzig== After the Misfits broke up, Eerie Von and Glenn Danzig discussed forming a new band and began rehearsing together. This would lead to Eerie Von becoming the original drummer for Danzig's band Samhain, before quickly switching to bass guitar after being shown how to play the songs by Glenn Danzig. He remained with Samhain from 1983 to 1987, recording on the albums Initium, November- Coming-Fire and Final Descent, and also the Unholy Passion EP. Samhain then changed their name to Danzig, who he played bass with from 1987 to July 1995, appearing on the albums Danzig, Lucifuge, How the Gods Kill and 4, and also the Thrall: Demonsweatlive EP. ==Solo career== Eerie Von currently works as a solo performer. He released the instrumental album Uneasy Listening in 1996. He followed this with two gothic rock albums, 1999s The Blood and the Body and 2004s Bad Dream No.13. In 2006, he released the punk rock album That's All There Is. The dark country-style album Kinda Country followed in 2009. Eerie Von also formed the short-lived blues rock band, Bighouse, along with former Danzig soundman Rick Dittamo. Eerie Von has had much underground success with his \\"Fiend Art\\", which showcases his disturbing themes on canvas. Misery Obscura, a book compiling photographs taken by Eerie Von throughout his career, was released in 2009. In January 2010, Eerie Von performed an acoustic set at Generation Records in New York City with Lyle Preslar and Mike D'Antonio in support of Misery Obscura. Eerie Von was the co-host for Under the Gun with Candy Gunn, a weekly radio show broadcast on Radio Free Nashville, from its inception in 2012 until July 2013. Eerie Von is currently planning to release a new book and documentary, both titled Misery Perfectum, and he is working on a sixth solo album. ==Discography== ===Rosemary's Babies=== * 1983 ‚Äì Blood Lust EP * 2004 ‚Äì Talking to the Dead ===Misfits=== * 1995 ‚Äì Collection II (Some songs either featured overdubs by, or were entirely recorded by, Glenn Danzig and Eerie Von) * 1996 ‚Äì Misfits Box Set ===Samhain=== * 1984 ‚Äì Initium * 1985 ‚Äì Unholy Passion EP * 1986 ‚Äì November- Coming-Fire * 1990 ‚Äì Final Descent * 2000 ‚Äì Samhain Box Set * 2002 ‚Äì Samhain Live '85‚Äì'86 ===Danzig=== * 1988 ‚Äì Danzig * 1990 ‚Äì Danzig II: Lucifuge * 1992 ‚Äì Danzig III: How the Gods Kill * 1993 ‚Äì Thrall: Demonsweatlive * 1994 ‚Äì Danzig 4 * 2001 ‚Äì Live on the Black Hand Side * 2007 ‚Äì The Lost Tracks of Danzig ===Solo=== * 1996 ‚Äì Uneasy Listening (with Mike Morance) * 1999 ‚Äì The Blood and the Body * 2004 ‚Äì Bad Dream No.13 * 2006 ‚Äì That's All There Is (as SpiderCider) * 2009 ‚Äì Kinda Country ===Others=== * 1998 ‚Äì The Black Bible by Various Artists (Contributed the track \\"Cinerarium Waltz\\") * 2000 ‚Äì The Darkest Millennium (A Gothic, Industrial, and Synth Pop Collection) by Various Artists (Contributed the track \\"An Investment in Hate\\") * 2000 ‚Äì Darken My Fire: A Gothic Tribute To The Doors by Various Artists (Contributed the track \\"The Spy\\") * 2001 ‚Äì Darker Shade of Goth by Various Artists (Contributed disc one) * 2005 ‚Äì Pledge Your Allegiance...To Satan! by Various Artists (Contributed the track \\"The Bone Drone\\") ==References== ==External links== *Eerie Von's official website *Eerie Von's Fiend Art *Ghastly Records Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:American punk rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:Horror punk musicians Category:Danzig (band) members Category:People from Lodi, New Jersey Category:American people of German descent Category:Guitarists from New Jersey Category:American male guitarists Category:Samhain (band) members Category:20th-century American guitarists ","title":"Eerie Von"},{"id":"1431050","text":"Ankeny may refer to: *Ankeny, Iowa *Ankeny, Washington *Ankeny National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon *Ankeny Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Clinton County, Iowa *Ankeny v.

Artifacts from earlier periods such as the Mesolithic, and other civilizations from Asia and elsewhere may also be covered by the term. The phenomenon of giving a high value to ancient artifacts is found in other cultures, notably China, where Chinese ritual bronzes, three to two thousand years old, have been avidly collected and imitated for centuries, and the Pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica, where in particular the artifacts of the earliest Olmec civilization are found reburied in significant sites of later cultures up to the Spanish Conquest. A person who studies antiquities, as opposed to just collecting them, is often called an antiquarian. ==Definition== The definition of the term is not always precise, and institutional definitions such as museum \\"Departments of Antiquities\\" often cover later periods, but in normal usage Gothic objects, for example, would not now be described as antiquities, though in 1700 they might well have been, as the cut-off date for antiquities has tended to retreat since the word was first found in English in 1513. Non-artistic artifacts are now less likely to be called antiquities than in earlier periods. Francis Bacon wrote in 1605: \\"Antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time\\". The art trade reflects modern usage of the term; Christie's \\"Department of Antiquities\\" covers objects \\"from the dawn of civilization to the Dark Ages, ranging from Western Europe to the Caspian Sea, embracing the cultures of Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Near East.\\" Bonhams use a similar definition: \\"...4000 B.C to the 12th Century A.D. Geographically they originate from Egypt, the Near East and Europe ...\\" Official cut-off dates are often later, being unconcerned with precise divisions of art history, and using the term for all historical periods they wish to protect: in Jordan it is 1750, in Hong Kong 1800, and so on. The term is no longer much used in formal academic discussion, because of this imprecision. However, a recent attempt to standardise this and other terms has been carried out. Most, but not all, antiquities have been recovered by archaeology. There is little or no overlap with antiques, which covers objects, not generally discovered as a result of archaeology, at most about three hundred years old, and usually far less. ==History== The sense of antiquitates, the idea that a civilization could be recovered by a systematic exploration of its relics and material culture, in the sense used by Varro and reflected in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews was lost during the Middle Ages, when ancient objects were collected with other appeals, the rarity or strangeness of their materials or simply because they were thought to be endowed with magical or miraculous powers.Roberto Weiss, 1969. The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity, p. 2ff. Precious cameos and other antique carved gems might be preserved when incorporated into crowns and diadems and liturgical objects,The \\"Cup of the Ptolemies\\" was set in Carolingian precious mounting and preserved in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. consular ivory diptychs by being used as gospel covers. Roman columns could be re-erected in churches.Robert Weiss notes (1969:8) that Ionic columns from the Baths of Caracalla were used in Innocent II's rebuilding of Santa Maria in Trastevere, 1139 sarcophagi could receive new occupants and cinerary urns could function as holy water stoups. Sculptural representations of the human form, feared and reviled as \\"idols\\" could be rehabilitated by reidentifying their subjects: the equestrian bronze Marcus Aurelius of the Campidoglio was respected as a representation of the Christian emperor Constantine, and in Pavia the Regisole acquired a civic role that preserved it. In Rome the Roman bronze Spinario was admired for itself by the guidebook writer Magister Gregorius. The classicism of the Carolingian renaissance was in part inspired by appreciation of Late Antique manuscripts: the Utrecht Psalter attempts to recreate such a Late Antique original, both in its handwriting and its illustrations.Noted in this context by Roberto Weiss 1969:4. Many museums hold these artifacts and keep them safe so that we have access to the knowledge they hold about the past. On September 2 the National Museum of Brazil was engulfed in flames. This event caused many artifacts to be lost forever. ==Illegal trading== The Euphronios krater has been returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum The export of antiquities is now heavily controlled by law in almost all countries and by the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, but a large and increasing trade in Illicit antiquities continues. The Euphronios krater is an apparent example that has come to light. Another example is the ambiguous legal case concerning the Getty Museum's \\"Bronze Statue of a Victorious Youth\\". The field has been further complicated by the trade in Archaeological forgeries, such as the Etruscan terracotta warriors, the Persian Princess, and the Getty kouros. ==See also== *Ancient art ==References== Category:Ancient art Category:Visual arts genres Category:Archaeological artifacts Category:Art and cultural repatriation ","title":"Antiquities"},{"id":"1431065","text":"Lorenzo is a 2004 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation about a cat, Lorenzo, who is \\"dismayed to discover that his tail has developed a personality of its own.\\" The short was directed by Mike Gabriel and produced by Baker Bloodworth. It premiered at the Florida Film Festival on March 6, 2004, and later appeared as a feature before the film Raising Helen; however, it did not appear on the DVD release of the film. It is based on an original idea by Joe Grant, who started working on the film in 1949, but it was eventually shelved. It was later found along with Destino. The short was intended to be one of the segments for the proposed but never completed Fantasia 2006. It was included on the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection Blu-ray/DVD set released on August 18, 2015. ==Plot== A cat named Lorenzo lounges on a cushion. A black cat passes by, and Lorenzo can't help but express his glee that the stray is missing his tail. Lorenzo flaunts his own luxurious backside accessory, and goads the cat with expansive displays of tailery. As Lorenzo laughs the black cat casts a hex, bringing Lorenzo's tail to energetic life. Lorenzo is little more than perturbed until the tail's incessant motion begins to take its toll. The pampered cat grows both exhausted and desperate, as it becomes apparent that even the most extreme measures (such as high voltage electrocution, drowning, and being run over by a train) will not quiet his tail. At junctures the black cat appears and offers Lorenzo a knife, his intentions clear. Lorenzo resists him just as strongly as he does his tail's advances. Lorenzo is however, finally driven to capitulate and severs his own glorious tail. ==Production== Lorenzo is based on an original idea by Disney artist and writer, Joe Grant. He came up with the idea after he saw his cat dive into the middle of a fight between his two poodles. He wondered, what if that cat lost its tail? Grant began developing Lorenzo in 1949. It was written, designed and directed by Mike Gabriel, in collaboration with Grant. Don Hahn suggested Gabriel to use tango music as an inspiration when conceptualizing the film. In search for a tango music, he went to a Virgin Megastore, where he spent $346 of his own money buying 40 tango CDs. The first song he listened to‚Äî\\"Bordoneo y 900\\", performed by Juan Jos√© Mosalini and his Big Tango Orchestra‚Äîsecured his attention and became the song he chose for the production. For the final film's score, the creators hired Mosalini and Big Tango Orchestra, who recorded in France a new version of \\"Bordoneo y 900.\\" Baker Bloodworth produced the film, along with Roy E. Disney and Don Hahn who served as executive producers. Gabriel hand painted all of the short's backgrounds with Tempera paint on a black construction paper. A painterly renderer called Sable, created by Daniel Teece, was used to create 3D brush strokes on the backgrounds. Traditional animation and clean-up were done at the Paris-based division of Walt Disney Feature Animation, while all painting, digital work, and post-production were performed at the Burbank studio. The short was developed as a potential segment for Fantasia 2006, the third installment following Fantasia and Fantasia 2000. After several years of funding and staff cutbacks at Walt Disney Feature Animation, the project was shelved by November 2003. In addition to Lorenzo, two other potential shorts that could be included in Fantasia 2006 were also completed before the projects cancellation ‚Äì Destino and One by One ‚Äì and were subsequently released as individual short films. ==Awards== Lorenzo was nominated for the Academy Award for Short Film (Animated) at the 77th Academy Awards in 2005. The short won the 2005 Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2004. == References == ==External links== *Lorenzo at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts *Lorenzo Director Mike Gabriel talks about the production design of his film Lorenzo * Category:2004 films Category:2004 animated films Category:2000s American animated films Category:Disney animated short films, 2000s Category:American films Category:American animated short films Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners Category:Films without speech Category:Films directed by Mike Gabriel ","title":"Lorenzo (film)"},{"id":"1431077","text":"Bainbridge Township may refer to the following places in the United States: * Bainbridge Township, Schuyler County, Illinois * Bainbridge Township, Dubois County, Indiana * Bainbridge Township, Berrien County, Michigan * Bainbridge Township, Geauga County, Ohio Category:Township name disambiguation pages ","title":"Bainbridge Township"},{"id":"1431093","text":"Hill 60 may refer to: * Battle of Hill 60 (disambiguation), a name shared by two battles of World War I: ** Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front) (April 17-April 22, 1915), fought south of Ypres in Belgium ** Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli) (August 21-August 29, 1915), the last major assault of the Battle of Gallipoli * Hill 60 (Ypres), geographical feature and World War I battle site near Ypres, Belgium * Hill 60 in Roundhay Park, Leeds, named in honour of those who had died in the WWI battles around Ypres * Illowra Battery otherwise known as Hill 60, is a World War II fortification in Port Kembla, New South Wales, Australia * \\"Hill 60\\" (The Unit), an episode of the television series The Unit Category:Battle honours of the British Army ","title":"Hill 60"},{"id":"1431111","text":"Bookmarking (also \\"gene bookmarking\\" or \\"mitotic bookmarking\\") refers to a potential mechanism of transmission of gene expression programs through cell division. During mitosis, gene transcription is silenced and most transcription factors are removed from chromatin. The term bookmarking compares transcription to reading from a book. The pause in transcription during mitosis is like closing the book. \\"Molecular bookmarks\\" are the factors that allow transcription to resume in an orderly fashion in newborn cells following mitosis (when the book is re-opened). Bookmarks fulfill the following criteria: * at some point prior to the onset of mitosis, the promoters of genes that exist in a transcription-competent state become \\"marked\\" in some way, * this \\"mark\\" persists both during and after mitosis, and * the marking transmits gene expression memory by preventing the mitotic compaction of DNA at this locus, or by facilitating reassembly of transcription complexes on the promoter, or both. ==Bookmarking as selective maintenance of an open chromatin state== The term bookmarking was originally coined to describe the non-compaction of some gene promoters during mitosis. More recently genome accessibility during interphase and mitosis has been directly compared on a genome-wide scale. While gene promoters tend to be better preserved than distal regulatory elements, substantial variation exists at individual sites. ==Bookmarking by DNA methylation, histone post- translation modification, and histone variants== Some patterns of histone modification and the presence of some histone variants on DNA remain unchanged during mitosis and have the potential to act as bookmarks. Patterns of DNA methylation are generally unchanged and also have the potential to function as bookmarks. ==Bookmarking by transcription factors== Notable transcription factors implicated in mitotic bookmarking include: *BRD4 *GATA1 *HSP70 *TFIID *ESRRB ==References== Category:Epigenetics ","title":"Bookmarking (genetic)"},{"id":"1431113","text":"GMC shares engines with other General Motors divisions.

The company went into liquidation in 1963, and the ship was taken over by Brown Brothers. They sold The Second Snark to Clyde Marine Motoring in 1969. She is listed as a National Historic Ship. Having been laid up for over two years at Fairlie Harbour, she was restored to her 'as-built' 1938 condition and her passenger certificate renewed in 2011. ==Layout== The Second Snark is a small vessel, with a passenger capacity of 48. She retains many original features including teak decks, varnished woodwork and polished brass. There is one heated room with seating and a single toilet facility below deck. ==Service== William Denny used The Second Snark in their Dumbarton shipyard as a tug and tender. From 1960 to 1963 she also provided summer cruises on the Firth of Forth, returning to the Clyde in winter. Initially, Brown Brothers continued Forth cruises, while concentrating on research work for ship stabilisers. When the research project was completed in 1969, they sold The Second Snark to Clyde Marine Motoring. From 1969, The Second Snark was based at Victoria Harbour or Princes Pier, Greenock, providing cruises on the Firth of Clyde under the Clyde Marine Cruises section of Clyde Marine Services Ltd. She provided cruises from Greenock and Helensburgh to Blairmore (for Benmore Botanic Garden) and into Loch Long. She has provided trips to Lochranza (Arran) via Rothesay and the Kyles of Bute and to Largs and Millport. She occasionally served on the Gourock - Kilcreggan - Helensburgh ferry service, substituting for the 1936 (then ). The Second Snark passing Bowling, West Dunbartonshire, in 2013. From August 2011, Clyde Marine Services operated The Second Snark as a ferry between Govan and Yorkhill Quay where Glasgow's new Riverside Museum (the new transport museum) and the Tall Ship () are located. On Monday 11 July 2011, she made an appearance in James Watt Dock in Greenock as part of the Greenock Tall Ships Race event. In 2012, she performed a charter to Loch Riddon with . She tendered to the paddle steamer, ferrying passengers ashore at Ormidale in a recreation of the same sailing 40 years earlier. The Second Snark awaiting restoration at the James Watt Dock in Greenock In summer 2018 it was reported that the venerable vessel had been sold by Clyde Marine Services to a billionaire businessman who intended to utilise her as a tender to his racing yachts in France as well as the United States and she was moved to Plymouth for a refit. However, late in 2019 she was acquired by a preservation group with substantial funding from former owner Hamish Munro and returned to Fairlie on the Firth of Clyde. In 2020 the vessel was moved to the James Watt Dock in Greenock and the premises of Dales Marine who will carry out restoration work in phases once funds have been raised and design work completed. ==Gallery== File:MV Second Snark 2004a.jpgThe Second Snark heads off to Kilcreggan ==See also== *List of ships built by William Denny and Brothers ==Footnotes== ==External links == *Clyde Marine Services *Caledonian MacBrayne - Old Vessels Category:Tugboats of the United Kingdom Category:Ferries of Scotland Category:1938 ships Category:Tourist attractions in Inverclyde Category:Ships and vessels on the National Register of Historic Vessels ","title":"MV The Second Snark"},{"id":"1431116","text":"GMC Truck produced a unique 60 degree V6 engine family from 1959 through 1974, in gasoline and Diesel versions. V8 and V12 derivatives of the basic design were also produced. Examples of this engine family were found in pickup trucks, Suburbans, heavier trucks and motor coaches. V6 engines were produced in 305, 351, 401 and 478 cubic-inch (5.0, 5.8, 6.6, and 7.8 respectively liter) displacements, with considerable parts commonality. During the latter years of production, versions with enlarged crankshaft journals were manufactured as well. GMC produced a 60¬∞ V8 with a single cam shaft using the same general layout (bore and stroke) as the 478 V6. The 637 V8 was the largest displacement production gasoline V8 ever made for highway trucks. The largest engine derived from the series was a \\"Twin Six\\" V12, which had a unique block and crankshaft, but shared many exterior parts with the 351. Diesel versions of the 351, 478 and 637, advertised as the ToroFlow, were also manufactured. These engines had no relationship to the well-known Detroit Diesel two-stroke engines produced by General Motors during the same time period. All versions of the GMC V6 used a six-throw crankshaft, which when combined with the 60 degree included cylinder angle, produced a smooth running engine without any need for a balance shaft. Spark plugs were located on the inboard side of the cylinder heads and were accessed from the top of the engine. This position allowed for shorter spark plug wires and kept the spark plugs away from the hot exhaust manifolds, something which was emphasized in sales literature. It was also perceived as easier to access them for maintenance. These GMC V6 engines were noted for durability, ease of maintenance and strong low RPM torque. In 1974, GMC discontinued the V6 engine; all gas-engine models were powered by Chevrolet straight-six and V8 engines while diesel engines were dropped from medium duty models and would not return until 1976. ==305== The 305 had a bore and stroke. The 305 was GMC's standard pickup truck and Suburban engine from 1960 to 1974, and was one of the first V6 engines produced by an American company. The 305A was equipped with a single barrel carburetor and produced gross at 3600 rpm and gross at 1600 rpm (measured without air cleaner or accessories in an ideal environment). GMC also made a B, C, D and E version of the 305, with the E version producing gross at 3600 rpm and gross torque at 1600 rpm. The 305A was standard in 1000-3500 series trucks in 1960-1961 and was dropped in 1962. The 305B and 305C (a 305B with a different manifold and carburetor) were used in 4000 series trucks; the 305B was dropped in 1962 while the 305C continued to 1974. The 305D was an option in the 1000-3500 series in 1961 and became standard in 1962, replacing the 305A. The 305E replaced the 305D in the 1000-3500 series trucks in 1963 and was used until 1966. ==351== The 351 was introduced in 1966 it had a bore and stroke. The 351 was available as an E series (351E) and Magnum series (351M). The Magnum featured a larger 2 barrel carburetor and an open port intake, bigger intake and exhaust ports, larger diameter valves, and larger exhaust manifolds. The 351E shared the same parts as the 305 with the exception of a larger bore. In 1973, the 351 was replaced by the 379. The 351 was used in the 5000 series trucks (it was optional in the 4000 series) and the 351E was used in the 1000-3500 series trucks from 1966. ==379== The 379 had a bore and stroke. The 379 was a 351 with a 478 crankshaft. Net power was at 3600 RPM and torque at 1600. ==401== gmc truck parts & illustration manual 1955-1964,1965-7 The engine was further enlarged for the 401. It has a bore and stroke, and was produced from 1960 through 1972. The 401 engine produced gross at 3200 rpm and gross torque at 1400 rpm while the Magnum version produced gross at 4000 RPM and gross torque at 1600 RPM. This engine was used in the 5500 and 6000 series as well as the H-5000; it was an option in the W-5000 and SP-5000. ==432== In 1973 & 1974 there was also a version with enlarged crankshaft journals ( bore and stroke). The 432 was a 401 with a 478 crankshaft. It produced net at 3200 RPM and net torque at 2000 RPM. The 432 was a Magnum engine though it was never designated as such. ==478== The 478 was one of the largest V6 engines ever built. Gross output was at 3700 rpm and at 1400 rpm. Bore and stroke was . It was introduced in 1962 for the 6500 series trucks. ==702== The V12 \\"Twin Six\\" was offered in 1960 for the 7000 series trucks, and as a special order option in Canada. It was mistaken as two V6 engines welded together, but it is its own separate engine design based on a single casting. It used four separate exhaust manifolds, two separate carburetors and intake manifolds, two separate distributor caps driven by a single distributor drive, and other parts from the 351 V6. 56 major parts are interchangeable between the Twin-Six and the other GMC V6 engines to provide greater parts availability and standardization. It produced net SAE horsepower. Torque was . The 702 was in production until 1966, when it was replaced by the 637 V8. ==See also== * GMC straight-6 engine * GMC V8 engine * List of GM engines * 1960-1966 GMC Truck Club ==References== V6 Category:V6 engines ","title":"GMC V6 engine"},{"id":"1431125","text":"Arminghall is a small village in the English county of Norfolk, around southeast of Norwich in the parish of Caistor St Edmund and Bixley, until April 2019 it was in Bixley parish.

Syfer Technology, an electronic components manufacturer, is based at Old Stoke Road, close to the River Tas. ==Arminghall Henge== In 1929 a prehistoric timber circle and henge monument site was discovered 1¬Ω miles (2¬Ω km) northwest of Arminghall village by Gilbert Insall VC who had been taking air photos of the area in search of new archaeological sites. Whilst flying at around 2,000 feet (600 m) he noticed cropmarks of a circular enclosure made of two concentric rings with a horseshoe of eight pit- like markings within it. The entire site was around 75 m in diameter. The site was visited a week later by O.G.S. Crawford, who pronounced it to be the Norwich Woodhenge but it was not until 1935 that it was first excavated, by Grahame Clark. His work established that two circular rings were ditches, the outer one 1.5 m deep and the inner one 2.3 m deep, with indications of a bank that once stood between them. The pits in the middle were postholes for timbers that would have been almost 1 m in diameter. The site dates to the Neolithic, with a radiocarbon date of 3650-2650 Cal BC (4440¬±150) from charcoal from a post-pit.

He is best known for the countergambit that bears his name and for authoring the first chess book written in Romanian. == Life == He was born in Bucharest, Romania to a wealthy family. His forefathers, however, sprang from Hamburg, Germany and settled in Zhitomir, Ukraine in the 19th century, but later moved to Romania.Chess Archaeology at www.chessarch.com After completing his studies in Vienna, he went back to Romania, where he ran the Frothier Printing House in Bucharest. Soon he became associated with Dr. Bethel Henry Baron von Stroussberg, working as a translator for the influential railroad tycoon who was nicknamed \\"The King of Railways\\". Stroussberg's financial bankruptcy in 1875 led to Albin's exile in Vienna once again, together with his wife and three children. He died at age 72 in a Vienna sanatorium. == Chess career == Albin came to chess relatively late: according to The Oxford Companion to Chess he learnt the game in his 20s and did not play in international events until his 40s. His best result came at New York 1893, where he finished second behind Emanuel Lasker (who scored a perfect 13/13), ahead of Jackson Showalter, Harry Nelson Pillsbury and others. He played in the very strong tournaments at Hastings 1895 (scoring 8¬Ω/21) and Nuremberg 1896 (scoring 7/18). His tournament results on the whole were spotty, though he won individual games against several notable players, including world champion Wilhelm Steinitz at New York 1894 and Nuremberg 1896. He authored the first chess book in Romanian, Amicul≈≠ Joculu de Scachu Teoreticu ≈üi Practicu (published in Bucharest in 1872). == Death == As Michael Lorenz has noted in Chess Note 11752 (March 8, 2020), Albin died on 22 March 1920, and not on 1 February 1920 as previously believed.\\"Chess Note 11752\\" at www.chesshistory.com == Legacy == Albin is the eponym of several chess opening variations, notably the Albin Countergambit in the Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5) and the Albin Attack (also known as the Alekhine‚ÄìChatard Attack) in the French Defence (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e5 Nfd7 6.h4). == References == Bibliography * *Urcan, Olimpiu G.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons, first introduced in 1945. Depicted as a French striped skunk, Pep√© is constantly in search of love. However, his offensive skunk odor and his aggressive pursuit of romance typically cause other characters to run from him. ==Premise== Pep√© Le Pew storylines typically involve Pep√© in pursuit of a female black cat, whom Pep√© mistakes for a skunk (\\"la belle femme skunk fatale\\"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted down her back, usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a fence with wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to get away from him because of his putrid odor, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pep√© hops after her at a leisurely pace. ===Settings=== The setting is always a mise-en-sc√®ne echoing with fractured French. They include Paris in the springtime, the Sahara, the Matterhorn, or the little village of N'est-ce Pas in the French Alps. The exotic locales, such as Algiers, are drawn from the story of the 1937 film P√©p√© le Moko. Settings associated in popular culture with romance, such as the Champs- √âlys√©es or the Eiffel Tower, are sometimes present. ===Narcissism=== Pep√© describes Penelope as lucky to be the object of his affections and uses a romantic paradigm to explain his failures to seduce her. For example, he describes a hammer blow to his head as a form of flirtation rather than rejection. Accordingly, he shows no sign of narcissistic injury or loss of confidence, no matter how many times he is rebuffed. ===Reversals=== In a role-reversal, the Academy Award-winning 1949 short For Scent-imental Reasons ended with an accidentally painted blue (and now terrified) Pep√© being pursued by a madly smitten Penelope (who has been dunked in dirty water, leaving her with a ratty appearance and a developing head cold, completely clogging up her nose). It turns out that Pep√©'s new color is just right for her (plus the fact that the blue paint now covers his putrid scent). Penelope locks him up inside a perfume shop, hiding the key down her chest, and proceeds to chase the now- imprisoned and effectively odorless Pep√©. In another short, Little Beau Pep√©, Pep√©, attempting to find the most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and colognes upon himself. This resulted in something close to a love potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pep√© in an explosion of hearts. Pep√© is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women (\\"But Madame!\\"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even he could imagine. And yet again, in Really Scent, Pep√© removes his odor by locking himself in a deodorant plant so Penelope (known in this short as \\"Fabrette\\"; a black cat with an unfortunate marking) would like him (this is also the only episode that Pep√© is acutely aware of his own odor, having checked the word \\"pew\\" in the dictionary). However, Penelope (who in this picture is actually trying to have a relationship with Pep√© because all the male cats of New Orleans take her to be a skunk and run like blazes, but is appalled by his odor) had decided to make her own odor match her appearance and had locked herself in a Limburger cheese factory. Now more forceful and demanding, Penelope quickly corners the terrified Pep√©, who, after smelling her new stench, wants nothing more than to escape the amorous female cat. Unfortunately, now she will not take \\"no\\" for an answer and proceeds to chase Pep√© off into the distance, with no intention of letting him escape. Although Pep√© usually mistakes Penelope for a female skunk, in Past Perfumance, he realizes that she is a cat when her stripe washes off. Undeterred, he proceeds to cover his white stripe with black paint, taking the appearance of a cat before resuming the chase. To emphasize Pep√©'s cheerful dominance of the situation, Penelope is always mute (or more precisely, makes only natural cat sounds, albeit with a stereotypical \\"le\\" before each one) in these stories; only the self-deluded Pep√© speaks (several non-recurring human characters are given minimal dialogue, often nothing more than a repulsed \\"Le pew!\\"). ===Variations=== Sometimes this formula is varied. In his initial cartoon, Odor-able Kitty, Pep√© (who was revealed to be an French-American skunk named Henri in this short) unwittingly pursues a male cat who has deliberately disguised himself as a skunk (complete with the scent of Limburger cheese) in order to scare off a bunch of characters who have mistreated him. Scent- imental Over You has Pep√© pursuing a female dog who has donned a skunk pelt (mistaking it for a fur coat). In the end, she removes her pelt, revealing that she is a dog. Pep√© then \\"reveals\\" himself as another dog and the two embrace. However, he then reveals to the audience that he is still a skunk. In Wild Over You, Pep√© attempts to seduce a wildcat that has escaped a zoo (during what is called \\"Le grande tour du Zoo\\" at a 1900 exhibition) and painted herself to look like a skunk to escape her keepers. This cartoon is notable for not only diverging from the Pep√©/female-black-cat dynamic, but also rather cheekily showing that Pep√© likes to be beaten up, considering the wildcat thrashes him numerous times. Really Scent is also a subversion with Penelope (here called \\"Fabrette\\") attracted to him from the beginning, removing the need for Pep√© to chase her as she goes to him. But Pep√©'s scent still causes a problem for her as they try to build a relationship. ==Production== Chuck Jones, Pep√©'s creator, wrote that Pep√© was based (loosely) on the personality of his Termite Terrace colleague, writer Tedd Pierce, a self-styled \\"ladies' man\\" who reportedly always assumed that his infatuations were reciprocated. Pep√©'s voice, provided by Mel Blanc, was based on Charles Boyer's P√©p√© le Moko from Algiers (1938), a remake of the 1937 French film P√©p√© le Moko. Eddie Selzer, animation producer‚Äîand Jones' bitterest foe‚Äîat Warners then once profanely commented that no one would laugh at those cartoons. However, this did not keep Selzer from accepting an award for one of Pep√©'s pictures several years later. There have been theories that Pep√© was based on Maurice Chevalier. However, in the short film, Chuck Jones: Memories of Childhood, Jones says Pep√© was actually based on himself, but that he was very shy with girls, and Pep√©, obviously, was not. A prototype Pep√© appears in 1947's Bugs Bunny Rides Again, but sounds similar to Porky Pig. In the shorts, a kind of pseudo-French or Franglais is spoken and written primarily by adding \\"le\\" to English words (example: \\"le skunk de pew\\"), or by more creative mangling of French expressions with English ones, such as \\"Sacr√© Maroon!\\", \\"My sweet peanut of brittle\\", \\"Come to me, my little melon-baby collie!\\" or \\"Ah, my little darling, it is love at first sight, is it not, no?\\", and \\"It is love at sight first!\\" The writer responsible for these malapropisms was Michael Maltese. Some dialogue from the Oscar-winning 1949 short For Scent-imental Reasons: :Pep√©: (sings) Affaire d'amour ? Affaire de c≈ìur ? Je ne sais quoi‚Ä¶ je vive en espoir. (Sniffs) Mmmm m mm‚Ä¶ un smella vous finez‚Ä¶ (Hums) :Gendarme: Le kittee quel terrible odeur !! :Proprietor: Allez Gendarme !! Allez !! Retournez-moi !! This instonce!! Oh, pauvre moi, I am ze bankrupt‚Ä¶ (Sobs) :Cat/Penelope: Le mew? Le purrrrrrr. :Proprietor: A-a-ahhh. Le pussy ferocious! Remove zot skunk! Zot cat-pole from ze premises!! Avec !! :Cat/Penelope: (Smells skunk) Sniff, sniff, sniff-sniff, sniff-sniff. :Pep√©: Quel est ? *notices cat* Ahh‚Ä¶ le belle femme skunk fatale‚Ä¶ *clicks tongue twice* Blanc's voice for the character closely resembles the one he used for \\"Professor Le Blanc\\", the harried violin instructor on The Jack Benny Program. Pep√© Le Pew's cartoons were dubbed in French; in the French version (P√©p√© le putois), Pep√© speaks with a heavy Italian accent. His voice is a parody of Yves Montand. ===Cameo appearances=== Chuck Jones first introduced the character (originally named Stinky) in the 1945 short Odor-able Kitty (see \\"Variations\\"), in which he was revealed to be a married American skunk named Henry who had been faking his French accent. For the remaining cartoons Jones directed, Pep√© retained his accent, nationality, and purported bachelor status throughout, and the object of his pursuit was nearly always female. A possible second cameo appearance is at the end of Fair and Worm-er (Chuck Jones, 1946). This skunk does not speak, but looks identical (or is a close relation) and shares the same mode of travel and a slight variation of Pep√©'s hopping music. His function here is to chase a string of characters who had all been chasing each other (√† la \\"There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly\\"). A skunk often identified as Pep√© appears in the Art Davis-directed cartoon Odor of the Day (1948); in this entry, the theme of romantic pursuit is missing as the skunk (in a non-speaking role, save for a shared \\"Gesundheit!\\" at the finish) vies with a male dog for lodging accommodations on a cold winter day. This is one of the two cartoons where the character, if this is indeed Pep√©, uses his scent-spray as a deliberate weapon: shot from his tail as if it were a machine gun. The other one is Touch√© and Go, where he frees himself from the jaws of a shark by releasing his odor into the shark's mouth. Pep√© makes a more obvious cameo in Dog Pounded (1954), where he is attracted to Sylvester after the latter tried to get around a pack of guard dogs, in his latest attempt to capture and eat Tweety, by painting a white stripe down his back (in Pep√©'s only appearance in a Freleng short). ===Later appearances=== Pep√© appeared with several other Looney Tunes characters in Filmation's made for 1972 TV special Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies. In the King Arthur film Daffy Duck's studio was producing in the story, Pep√© played assistant to Mordred (played by Yosemite Sam). Pep√© was going to have a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but was later dropped for unknown reasons. Pep√© made several cameo appearances on the 1990 series Tiny Toon Adventures as a professor at Acme Looniversity and the mentor to the female skunk character Fifi La Fume. He appeared briefly in \\"The Looney Beginning\\" and had a more extended cameo in \\"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Adventures Christmas Special\\". The segment \\"Out of Odor\\" from the episode \\"Viewer Mail Day\\" saw character Elmyra disguise herself as Pep√© in an attempt to lure Fifi into a trap, only to have Fifi begin aggressively wooing her. Pep√© also made cameo appearances in the Histeria! episode \\"When America Was Young\\" and in the Goodfeathers segment, \\"We're No Pigeons\\", on Animaniacs. In the 1995 animated short Carrotblanca, a parody/homage of the classic film Casablanca, both Pep√© and Penelope appear: Pep√© (voiced by Greg Burson) as Captain Renault and Penelope (voiced by Tress MacNeille) as \\"Kitty Ketty\\" (modeled after Ingrid Bergman's performance as Ilsa). Unlike the character's other appearances in cartoons, Penelope (as Kitty) has extensive speaking parts in Carrotblanca. In The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, in the episode, \\"Platinum Wheel of Fortune\\", when Sylvester gets a white stripe on his back, a skunk immediately falls in love with him. This is not Pep√©, but a similar character identified as \\"Pitu Le Pew\\" (voiced by Jeff Bennett). However, he does say, \\"What can I say, Pep√© Le Pew is my third cousin. It runs in the family.\\" Pep√© would later appear in the episode \\"Is Paris Stinking\\" (once again voiced by Greg Burson), where he pursues Sylvester who is unintentionally dressed in drag. Pep√© would appear once more in Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, falling in love with both Sylvester and Penelope (Sylvester had gotten a white stripe on his back from Penelope as they fought over Tweety), actually showing a preference for Sylvester. Pep√© was, at one point, integral to the storyline for the movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action (voiced by Bruce Lanoil). Originally, once Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, DJ, and Kate arrived in Paris, Pep√© was to give them a mission briefing inside a gift shop. Perhaps because of the group receiving their equipment in Area 52, Pep√©'s scene was cut, and in the final film, he plays only a bit part, dressed like a police officer, who tries to help DJ (played by Brendan Fraser) after Kate (played by Jenna Elfman) is kidnapped. However, some unused animation of him and Penelope appears during the end credits, thus giving viewers a rare glimpse at his cut scene, and his cut scene appears in the movie's print adaptations. Pep√© also appears in Space Jam (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), where his voice has curiously been changed into an approximation of Maurice Chevalier, as opposed to more traditional vocalization. In Loonatics Unleashed, a human based on Pep√© Le Pew called Pierre Le Pew (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) has appeared as one of the villains of the second season of the show. Additionally, Pep√© and Penelope Pussycat appear as cameos in a display of Otto the Odd in the episode \\"The Hunter\\". In the episode \\"The World is My Circus\\", Lexi Bunny complains that \\"this Pep√© Le Pew look is definitely not me\\" after being mutated into a skunk-like creature. A 2009 Valentine's Day-themed AT&T; commercial brings Pep√© (voiced by Jeff Bennett) and Penelope's relationship up to date, depicting Penelope not as repulsed by Pep√©, but madly in love with him. The commercial begins with Penelope deliberately painting a white stripe on her own back; when her cell phone rings and displays Pep√©'s picture, Penelope's lovestruck beating heart bulges beneath her chest in a classic cartoon image. A baby version of Pep√© Le Pew appeared in Baby Looney Tunes. In the episode \\"New Cat in Town,\\" everyone thought that he was a cat. Sylvester was the only one who knew the truth. When Daffy was playing with a laptop, Sylvester removed the battery because he was afraid that everybody would avoid him. We also see a grown-up version of him on the laptop. In another episode, titled \\"Stop and Smell Up the Flowers\\", Pep√© Le Pew is shown to be good friends with a baby Gossamer and seemed slightly older than his previous appearance. Pep√© Le Pew has appeared in The Looney Tunes Show episode \\"Members Only\\" voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois in Season One and by Jeff Bergman in Season Two. He was present at the arranged marriage of Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. Of course, Lola eventually fell in love with Pep√© Le Pew. He also made a short cameo appearance with Penelope Pussycat in the Merrie Melodies segment \\"Cock of the Walk\\" sung by Foghorn Leghorn. He appeared in his own music video \\"Skunk Funk\\" in the 16th episode \\"That's My Baby\\". He also appeared again in another Merrie Melodies segment \\"You Like/I Like\\" sung by Mac and Tosh. His first appearance in the second season was in the second episode entitled \\"You've Got Hate Mail\\", reading a hate-filled email accidentally sent by Daffy Duck. He also had a short appearance in the Christmas special \\"A Christmas Carol\\" where he takes part in the song \\"Christmas Rules.\\" In \\"Gribbler's Quest,\\" Pep√© Le Pew is shown to be in the same group therapy with Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian, and Yosemite Sam. Pep√© Le Pew made a cameo in a MetLife commercial in 2012 titled \\"Everyone\\". He is seen standing in the forest, then sees his love interest Penelope Pussycat riding on the back of Battle Cat with He-Man, and immediately hops after her. Pep√© Le Pew has appeared in Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run voiced by Jeff Bergman. In this film, he is the head of a major perfumery who Lola wants to create a signature scent for. Pep√© Le Pew has appeared in New Looney Tunes (formerly called Wabbit). This version is depicted as a James Bond-like secret agent. Pep√© Le Pew appeared in the video games, Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 3, Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal, The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage and Bugs Bunny: Crazy Castle 4. ==Feature film== In October 2010, it was reported that Mike Myers would voice Pep√© Le Pew in a feature-length live action film based on the character, although no information about this project has surfaced since. In July 2016, it was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con that Max Landis was penning a Pep√© Le Pew feature film for Warner Bros. ==In popular culture== Pep√© Le Pew was referenced in the song Beeswax by popular American rock band Nirvana. ==Voice actors== * Mel Blanc (1945‚Äì1985) * Gilbert Mack (Golden Records records, Bugs Bunny Songfest) * Greg Burson (Tiny Toon Adventures, Carrotblanca, The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, Looney Tunes: Stranger Than Fiction) * Keith Scott (Spectacular Light and Sound Show Illuminanza, The Looney Tunes Radio Show, Looney Rock)\\"Keith Scott-\\"The One-Man Crowd\\"\\".

First published on 3 January 1749, Berlingske is Denmark's oldest continually operating newspaper, and among the oldest newspapers in the world. ==History and profile== Berlingske was founded by Denmark's Royal Book Printer Ernst Henrich Berling and originally titled Kj√∏benhavnske Danske Post-Tidender, then the Berlingskes Politiske og Avertissements Tidende. The paper was supported by the Conservative Party. Until 1903 it had the official right to publish news about the government. In 1936, the newspaper's title was shortened to Berlingske Tidende. The historic first cover page of Berlingske (1749) Mendel Levin Nathanson twice served as the editor-in-chief of the paper: between 1838 and 1858 and between 1866 and 1868. The publisher is Det Berlingske Officin. The paper has a conservative stance and has no political affiliation. The paper is also one of the \\"big three\\" broadsheet-quality newspapers in Denmark along with Jyllands-Posten and Politiken. Traditionally itself a broadsheet, Berlingske has been published in the tabloid/compact format since 28 August 2006. Berlingske has won many awards. It is the only newspaper in the world to have won the World Press Photo Award 3 times. It also won the most prestigious journalistic award in Denmark, the Cavling prize, in 2009. In addition, it was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of national newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2012. Following a long period of ownership by the Berling family, the whole Berlingske-group was acquired in 1982 by a group of investors from the Danish corporate establishment including Danske Bank and A.P. M√∏ller M√¶rsk. This takeover saved the group from an impending bankruptcy caused by a long strike period as well as dwindling circulation and advertising revenues. In 2000, Det Berlingske Officin was acquired by the Norwegian industrial conglomerate Orkla Group; the Danish organization was integrated within a multinational Orkla Media group. In 2006 Orkla Media was sold to the British Mecom Group. Ketupa Media Profiles: Stock values rise: ‚Ç¨209m in 2000; ‚Ç¨900m in 2006 Ketupa In January 2011, the newspaper's title was abbreviated to Berlingske following a large-scale redesign of the newspaper's web and digital presence. In February 2015, Berlingske was acquired by the family-owned Belgian media company De Persgroep together with the rest of Mecom Group. ==Circulation== In 1910 Berlingske Tidende had a circulation of 8,500 copies. During the last six months of 1957 the paper had a circulation of 157,932 copies on weekdays. It was the second best-selling newspaper in Denmark with a circulation of 149,000 copies in 2002. The circulation of the paper was 142,000 copies in 2003, making it again the second best-selling Danish newspaper. In 2004 the paper had a circulation of 129,000 copies. The circulation of Berlingske was 103,685 copies in 2008 and 103,221 copies in 2009. It was 101,121 copies in 2010 and fell to 96,897 copies in 2011.

Their first V8 engine design was made from 1956 through 1967. The second design debuted in 1966 and was made through 1991. Chrysler kept the last design in production until 1991 for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer. == American Motors Corporation \\"Rambler V8\\" (1956‚Äì1967) == This was AMC's first V8 engine designed and manufactured from 1956 to 1967. American Motors' president, George W. Mason, negotiated a verbal agreement with Packard that the two companies would supply parts for each other when practical. This was a prelude to a possible merger of the two companies at a later date, but that never occurred. With the industry-wide acceptance of V8 engine designs after World War II, AMC started buying Packard V8s in 1954 for the 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet. These were supplied with Packard \\"Ultramatic\\" automatic transmissions - exclusively. Packard sent AMC some parts bids, but these were rejected as too expensive. George W. Romney, AMC's new leader, decided against further relationships with Packard shortly after entering the position of CEO in October 1954 after Mason's sudden death. Romney ordered development of an in-house V8 as soon as possible. The program was under the direction of Meade F. Moore, Vice-President of Automotive Research and Engineering, along with teams in AMC's Kenosha and Detroit Engineering Departments. They were able to get the all new V8 into production in less than 18 months. The new V8 engines, available in different displacements were of the same basic design. All these engines share common external dimensions, light weight - about - forged crankshaft and rods, as well as most other parts. The stroke for all Gen-1 V8s is . Engine displacement was a factor of the bore: the has a bore, , and the a bore. The bore size on the 327 is cast on the top of the block near the back of the right bank cylinder head and is denoted by a '4'. The 250 and 287 engines do not have the bore size cast into the block. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two lifter galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two rocker arm shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the valvetrain. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. === 250 === 1960 Rebel V8 emblem American Motors' first V8 in-house engine, the 250, was used in AMC automobiles from 1956 through 1961. It was a modern OHV/pushrod engine design and made its debut in the Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet \\"Specials\\" of 1956. These cars had the top-of-the-line model trim, but were built on the shorter wheelbase (Statesman and Wasp) models (hence the \\"Special\\" name). The 250 uses solid lifters and came in two- and four-barrel carburetor varieties (4V only in Nash/Hudson \\"Specials\\"). The 250 V8 was optional in the 1957 Rambler. All 1958-60 V8 Ramblers were called \\"Rebels\\" and designated as a different series. It is easy to confuse the 1957 Rambler V8 and the 1958-'60 Rebel line with the special 1957 Rambler Rebel, a limited edition muscle car (see 327 below). In 1961, The Rambler Six was renamed the \\"Rambler Classic\\" to avoid model confusion in the Rambler line-up. A V8 engine then became an option in the Classic instead of a separate model. === 287 === Engine bay with AMC 287 V8 In mid-model year 1963, AMC introduced a V8. When the 250 was dropped in 1961, there was no V8 option for Rambler models other than the top of the line Ambassador, which was only available with the 327. Dealers complained, so the 287 was introduced as an option for the \\"mid-size\\" Rambler. Like the 327, it uses hydraulic valve lifters. Only two-barrel models were produced, there were no four-barrel options from the factory for the 287 as this was the economy model V8. The 287 engine was produced through the 1966 model year. ===327=== The AMC 327 V8 debuted in the 1957 Rambler Rebel, an early \\"muscle car\\" Engine bay of a 1963 AMC Ambassador with a 327 V8 four-barrel The AMC 327 is similar to the 287, but displaces due to the bore increase to . Unlike the 250, the 327 was produced with hydraulic valve lifters. Contrary to some myths, the AMC V8 was not built by Chevrolet, whose own 327 V8 later became better known. The AMC 327 was introduced five years before the Chevrolet 327 engine was manufactured. The AMC 327 engine debuted in a special edition Rambler Rebel, of which 1,500 were made. They were an early American muscle car. All Rebels had silver paint with a gold-anodized \\"spear\\" on each side. The 327 was not available in any other Rambler models in 1957 other than the special edition Rebel. The Rebel's engine differs from the 327s installed in the 1957 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models in that it uses mechanical valve lifters and a higher compression ratio. Since both engines were rated at , it is probable that the Rebel's was underrated. The Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet \\"Special\\" models were dropped after 1957, replaced by the 1958 Rambler Rebel with the 250 V8. The Rebel was a Rambler with a V-8 (and necessary mods such as stronger front springs and rear axle). The Rebel name was added to differentiate the standard six-cylinder Rambler from the V-8 model. The big Nash and Hudson cars were also dropped after 1957, replaced by the 1958 \\"Ambassador by Rambler\\" ‚Äî a stretched Rebel with the 327 V8 instead of the 250. The 327 was exclusive to the Ambassador line and could not be ordered in a Rebel (or later Classic) through 1964. For 1965 and 1966 the 287 and 327 were both available in the Classic and Ambassador. The 327 was sold to Kaiser- Jeep from 1965 to 1967 for use in the Jeep Wagoneer SUV and Gladiator pick-up truck. Jeep named it the \\"Vigilante\\" V8. Two barrel carburation was standard on these Jeep models, but a four barrel high-compression version was available in the high optioned Super Wagoneer from 1966 to 1968. Kaiser-Jeep switched to the Buick 350 in 1967 after AMC discontinued the 327. The Buick V8 engine option continued through 1971 after which Jeeps returned to AMC V8 engines, American Motors having purchased Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. There were low- and high-compression versions of the 327 starting in 1960. Prior to 1960 all 327s were high compression. All low compression models used a two-barrel carburetor and all high-compression models received a four-barrel carb. Low-compression is 8.7:1, high 9.7:1, effected by a difference in pistons. The 327 was also offered as a marine engine as the \\"Fireball\\" by Gray Marine Motor Company. === Electronic fuel injection === The AMC 327 was to be the first commercial electronic fuel injected (EFI) \\"Electrojector\\" production engine. Press reports about the Bendix-developed system in December 1956 were followed in March 1957 by an AMC price bulletin offering the EFI option on the Rambler Rebel for US$395, but due to supplier difficulties, fuel-injected Rebels were only available after 15 June. Teething problems with the Electrojector unit meant that only a few engineering and press cars were built, estimated to be no more than six units. At least two pre-production Rebels with EFI, however, are known to have been built. One was sent to Daytona Beach, Florida for \\"Speed Week\\" (the forerunner of today's Daytona 500). It was the second fastest car on the beach, bested only by a 1957 Chevrolet Corvette with mechanical fuel injection, and only by a couple tenths of a second. The EFI 327 was rated at and the regular four-barrel carbureted model at . The EFI system in the Rebel was a far more-advanced setup than the mechanical types then appearing on the market and the engines ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures. All the EFI cars were reportedly converted to four-barrel carbs before being sold; none are known to have existed outside the engineering department at AMC. The main problem was that early electronics were not fast enough for \\"on the fly\\" engine controls. This setup was utilised by Chrysler for the 1958 model year on its Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth, and DeSoto carlines. It too failed, having the same problems. Bendix licensed patents based on their 1950s design (patent dated 1960) to Bosch, who perfected it as the basis for their D-Jetronic, et seq. injections system, first used in 1967. === Marine application === The 250 and 327 were also offered as a marine engine known as the \\"Fireball\\" by Gray Marine Motor Company starting in 1958. Gray started offering the 250 in 1959. The 250 was offered in 135, 160, 170, 175, 178 and 185 horsepower versions. The 327 was made in 188, 215, 220, 225 and 238 horsepower levels. Gray used the 250 through 1966. The 327 was used as a 220 hp model in 1967, the last year an AMC V-8 was used. == Gen-2 AMC short-deck V8 (1966‚Äì1970) == Engine bay of a 1967 AMC Marlin with a 4-barrel 343 Typhoon V8 Engine bay of a 1969 AMC AMX with a bare V8 block The new-generation AMC V8 was first introduced in 1966. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gen-2\\" AMC V8. The first version was the completely new Typhoon V8 introduced in a special mid-1966 model year \\"Rogue\\" hardtop. Available in two-barrel carburetor version or producing with a four-barrel carburetor and high compression, the new engines utilized \\"thin- wall\\" casting technology and weighed only . All three engine sizes - , , and - share the same basic block design‚Äîthe different displacements are achieved through various bore and stroke combinations. All blocks share the same external measurements and thus can be swapped easily. Bore center measurement was kept the same as the Gen-1 V8 at so that boring equipment could be reused. Other than that, this engine is vastly different from the Gen-1 model. The Gen-1 engine is physically the size of a big-block Ford or GM engine, and is sometimes called a \\"big-block\\". The Gen-2 is closer to the physical size of U.S. made small-block V8s except for the bore centers, which are the same as some big-block engines. The only parts shared between the 1966-67 Rambler V8 and 1966-91 AMV8 are the lower cam timing sprocket and the timing chain. The AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else although it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but the balance of the engine design is unique. The Gen-2 AMC V8 was first introduced at in 1966. It was used exclusively in the Rambler American model the first year. The came out in 1967 and the AMX arrived in mid-1968. These engine blocks were unchanged through the 1969 model year. The head used during this time was the so-called \\"rectangle port\\", named after its exhaust port shape. The 290 heads use smaller valves, intake and exhaust, in order to prevent problems with the small bore. The 343 and the AMX 390 use the same larger valve heads, intake and exhaust. ===Indy 209=== From 1976 to 1979, Jerry Grant \\"drove the most powerful car ever to appear in Indy car racing\\" - a turbocharged two-valve, AMC Gen-2 block V8 engine producing in his Eagle 74 chassis. The car was fast on the straightways, but the engine's weight made corners more difficult to handle. The engine utilized a bore and a flat plane stroke crankshaft. ===290=== The base produces with a two-barrel or four- barrel carburetor, respectively. It was built from the mid-1966 model year through the 1969 model year. It has a bore and stroke of . Only 623 cars were built in 1966 with the 290 engine. These engines were available in special Rambler American two-door Rogue models. The newly powered Rogue was available with either a three-speed automatic or a floor mounted four-speed manual transmission, and made the car \\"suitable for the Stoplight Grand Prix.\\" === 343 === The has a bore and stroke of . The basic 343/2V produced and was built from 1967 through 1969. Output for the optional four-barrel carburetor version is and produces of torque (gross). This version has a 10.2:1 compression ratio. === AMX 390 === The AMX 390 engine in a 1968 AMX In addition to the largest bore and stroke, the AMX motor also received heavier main bearing support webbing and a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods. Forged cranks and rods were used for their known strength‚Äîthere was inadequate time for testing cast parts for durability without delaying AMC's introduction schedule. Once forging dies were made it was not cost effective to test cast parts due to the relatively low number of engines produced. The use of these stronger components was also continued with the production of 401 engines. This is an advantage of these AMC engines when used in heavy-duty and high- performance applications because they have no problems with their rods breaking; unlike other domestic automakers' large displacement small block engines. The Gen-2 AMX 390 produces and was built in 1968 and 1969. Bore and the stroke is . Maximum factory recommended overbore is only , although they are commonly bored . In 1970, AMC changed the head to the \\"dog-leg\\" exhaust port design. == Gen-3 AMC tall-deck (1970‚Äì1991) == Javelin with a Ram Air 390 V8 In 1970, all three blocks grew in deck height and gained a new head design. These changes made this the third generation of AMC V8, hence it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gen-3\\" AMC V8. The stroke and deck height on the 290 and 343 were increased by on both engines, becoming the and , respectively. The 1970 AMX 390 remained at the same displacement by using a special rod and piston for this year only. It is believed that AMC kept the 390 this last year due to the reputation it had garnered in the two seater AMX, which was discontinued after 1970. In 1971 the 390 was also stroked by to become the 401 engine. The other change in 1970 was the switch to the \\"dog- leg\\" heads. These heads flow 20% better on the exhaust side than the 1966-1969 rectangular port heads and are thus the best for performance. There are two reasons for the flow increase: (1) the area of the port is larger, due to the dog leg and (2) the shape of the port floor was changed from a concave to a convex curve. The concave floor tended to bend the exhaust flow upwards which caused turbulence when the flow was forced to go down into the exhaust manifolds. By switching to a convex floor the curvature of the flow starts in the head and proceeds much more smoothly into the exhaust manifold resulting in less turbulence and better flow. The center two intake bolts on each head were relocated to prevent accidental mix-ups of Gen-2 and Gen-3 intakes. The intakes can be interchanged by slotting the bolt holes, but the added deck height of the GEN-3 engine means that sealing and port match will be compromised. Gen-3 intakes can be machined to fit Gen-2 engines by surface grinding the intake flanges and slotting the center holes. There is a persistent myth about 1970-mid 1971 319 and 291 AMC heads. These heads have the dog-leg exhaust ports and 50-52 cc combustion chambers. They are commonly identified by the first three (319) or last three (291 for the 360-401 heads; 304 used a different casting) digits of the casting number. There was a U.S. auto industry-wide shift to lower compression ratios in mid 1971, so AMC increased combustion chamber size to 58-59 cc. The first three digits of the casting number on the large chamber heads are 321, 322, or 323 depending on year. The only difference between small and large chamber Gen-3 heads is the combustion chamber size. The advertised power drop from 1971 to 1972 ('71 304/210 hp and '72 304/150 hp, for example) is not due to any engine change, but to in the way the automobile industry adopted SAE power rating method. The 1971 and 1972 engines produce the same power. The 1971 and earlier versions were rated using \\"gross\\" horsepower, which is with the engines operating with no accessories or drive belts, air filters, nor any exhaust system restrictions. The change to the more realistic \\"net\\" horsepower ratings for 1972 and later required the engine to be driving all stock factory accessories and to use the factory air filter system and a simulated factory exhaust. Power is measured at the flywheel for both systems. For example, even with the modifications to more reduce emissions and increase efficiency, AMC's engine was among the strongest factory-spec engines available in an American car in 1971, with more horsepower than Pontiac's standard and Chevrolet's that powered the Corvette. === 304 === 1970 emblem The 304 has a displacement of which produced (gross rating) in 1970-71 and was built starting in 1970. Later models produced less power from the factory, going down yearly. 1972-75 models were rated at (net rating from 1972 onwards). It was rated at in 1978, and in 1979, the last year it was installed in passenger cars, and in 1980‚Äì81, the last years it was used in Jeep vehicles. The International Harvester Corporation SV \\"Comanche\\" V8 engines are sometimes mistaken for the AMC 304, however the IHC V8 engine family has no relation to the AMC V8 and was in fact first produced in 1959,11 years prior to the AMC designed 304. The similarity in displacement is purely a coincidence. === 360 === The AMC 360 V8 was standard in the 1974 Bricklin SV-1 sports car The AMC 360 has a displacement of . The 2-barrel produced to in 1970 to early 1971 while the 4-barrel produced to , to from mid-1971 to 1975, to in 1976, in 1977, and from 1978 to 1991. This engine was used in the 1970 AMX as the base engine and also in the 1970 Rebel, 1971-1978 Matador, Jeep J-series trucks 1970‚Äì1987, Wagoneer (SJ) models from 1972 to 1984, Cherokee (SJ) from 1974 to 1983, as well as in the full-sized Grand Wagoneer from 1984 to 1991 - becoming the last carbureted engine used in an American-built vehicle. The 360 V8 was also installed in the Bricklin SV-1 sports car for 1974 model year. The 360 was the last AMC V8 to be manufactured. It continued to be produced after Chrysler bought American Motors in 1987 as the standard engine in the Jeep Grand Wagoneer through 1991, with the only modification being the \\"360\\" casting replaced with \\"5.9L\\" on the side of the block.Sessler, p. 228. === 390 === The AMC V8 produced and of torque in all except the Rebel Machine. This muscle car engine was rated at and of torque due to a different intake. Production only lasted one year (1970) before it was stroked to become the . Like the Gen-2, the maximum factory recommended overbore is only , though they are commonly bored . === 401 === 1974 AMC 401 The produced gross in 1971 and net from 1972 to 1975. In 1976 it was rated at . Like the 390, the 401's crankshaft and connecting rods are forged steel. Like the 390, factory recommended overbore is only , but commonly bored by . It was last produced in 1979. The 401 was available in the Javelin, Matador, and Ambassador car lines and in Jeeps from its introduction in 1971 through 1974. In 1975 and 1976, emission controls, insurance rates, and high gasoline prices meant the 401 was available on the large Matador model, and then only for police department orders. Buyers of full-sized Jeeps (Wagoneer, Cherokee, J-10 and J-20) could order a 401 until 1979. This engine was also supplied to International Harvester for use as an optional engine in International's Light Line pickup trucks and Travelalls from late 1973 through 1974 where it was designated 'V-400' to differentiate it from IHC's own V/LV series 401. === \\"Service replacement\\" blocks === There was also a \\"Service Replacement\\" block made as a modified GEN-3 design. This is a 401 casting (same casting number) without the displacement cast into the side and with a 360 bore and thicker deck. In theory this single block could be built as any 343-401 GEN-2 or GEN-3 engine. A dealer could stock one or two blocks to use for warranty replacement. The main bearing web area was thicker in the 390, 401 and SR blocks, thick enough that two additional bearing cap bolt holes could be drilled and tapped for an aftermarket four bolt main cap, providing a stronger bottom end. AMC never built a factory four bolt main block, they sold aftermarket four bolt main caps through their Group 19 performance parts program. The SR block also sold as a heavy duty racing block. It appeared in 1970 in time for the 1971 Trans-Am racing season, and was used in the factory Trans-Am backed cars prepared by TRACO for Penske Racing, with Mark Donohue the primary driver. Since it was a standard factory part it did not have to be homologated under T/A rules, and was not used in the 2501 \\"Mark Donohue\\" Javelins built to homologate the \\"duck tail\\" spoiler. Those received standard 360 or 390 engines, buyers choice. == AMC V8 engine summary == 1968-1969 emblem Hornet SC stripe 1973 Ram Air 401 engine { class= + AMC V8 hp, torque, compression and bore-stroke by year Note: Prior to 1972 figures are rated using SAE gross.

It started out as an important railway station and customs post between Natal and Transvaal in 1891 until the Union of South Africa came into being in 1910, and customs tariffs were abolished. It is named after Sir Charles Mitchell, governor of Natal. In 1927 the town was the site of one of South Africa's first mass- shooting instances when local farmer Stephanus Swart shot and killed 8 people. It became a dormitory suburb of Volksrust, just across the border in the Transvaal, and many black people bought freehold land in the town. During the 1960s, however, the apartheid policy of the government led to most of the black inhabitants being forcibly removed to Madadeni, near Newcastle, and Charlestown became a ghost town. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Newcastle Local Municipality ","title":"Charlestown, KwaZulu-Natal"},{"id":"1431165","text":"Chas & Dave (often billed as Chas 'n' Dave) were a British pop rock duo, formed in London by Chas Hodges and Dave Peacock. They were most notable as creators and performers of a musical style labelled rockney (a portmanteau of rock and cockney), which mixes \\"pub singalong, music-hall humour, boogie- woogie piano and pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll\\". For a time, Rockney was also the name of their record label, their major breakthrough being \\"Gertcha\\" in 1979, which peaked at No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and was the first of eight Top 40 hit singles the duo played on. They had their biggest success in the early 1980s with \\"Rabbit\\" and \\"Ain't No Pleasing You\\". They also had nine charting albums. In October 2013 they released That's What Happens, their first studio album in 18 years. ==History== ===Formation=== Charles Nicholas \\"Chas\\" Hodges and David Victor \\"Dave\\" Peacock met in 1963, but the duo only started writing songs together in 1972. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hodges and Peacock were in various groups. Hodges was with The Outlaws and then Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers in the 1960s, while Dave Peacock was with a group called the Rolling Stones (formed before the more famous one), and The Tumbleweeds, and worked with Mick Greenwood and Jerry Donahue. Hodges and Peacock were both part of Black Claw with Harvey Hinsley and Mick Burt, three of them (Hodges, Peacock and Burt) would later be in Chas & Dave. They recorded with Albert Lee, and released an EP called Country Pie. After Black Claw, Hodges joined Heads Hands & Feet in 1970. Both Hodges and Peacock had worked as session musicians and in backing bands for a wide range of artists; Hodges as part of The Outlaws had worked with Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent, Bill Haley, and also supported the Beatles as the Rebel Rousers. The hook of the song on which Hodges and Peacock played guitar and bass in 1975, Labi Siffre's \\"I Got The...\\", was later sampled on Eminem's \\"My Name Is\\". Hodges toured America when he was with Heads Hands & Feet, and it was during the tour that he had the idea of performing in his natural accent as he thought it \\"not quite real\\" performing in an American accent to an American audience. After Heads Hands & Feet broke up, in November 1972, Hodges spoke to Peacock about forming a band together where they can sing in their own accent and about things they knew. This would be the beginning of Chas & Dave. They had initially considered a few names, including Chubby. The name Chas & Dave came about when they were doing sessions together, and a producer often referred to them as one and said, \\"Here comes Chas and Dave\\", and later suggested: \\"Why don't you just call yourselves Chas and Dave?\\" They also recorded as Oily Rags (cockney rhyming slang for cigarettes - \\"fags\\"), and released a self-titled album with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace in 1974, as well as an album with Oliver Nelson. The album Oily Rags was released by Signature Records owned by Bob Thiele, whose wife Teresa Brewer recorded the first ever song written by Hodges and Peacock together, \\"Better Get Your Shoes On\\". The duo recorded their first album as Chas & Dave in 1974, and this album, One Fing'*'Anuvver, was released in 1975 under the Retreat Records label. Burt joined the duo in 1976 as a drummer, and although they were in fact a trio since, the duo of Hodges and Peacock remained the main focus of the band. They were signed by EMI in 1977, and the album Rockney was recorded that year and released in 1978. A song from the album, \\"Strummin'\\", was their first song to reach the chart. In early 1979, a song from their first album \\"Woortcha!\\" was used for a television commercial for Courage Bitter, and this song was then re-recorded and released as a single, retitled \\"Gertcha\\", which reached No. 20 on the singles chart. They opened for Led Zeppelin at the 1979 Knebworth Festival. ===1980s=== Chas & Dave first signed a management deal in 1978 with Bob England, who with business partner Natasha England then formed the 'Rockney' label with the duo in 1980, part of the England's Towerbell Records company. The first single released under this label, \\"Rabbit\\" became their first top 10 hit single. The word \\"rabbit\\" comes from the Cockney rhyming slang rabbit and pork meaning talk. The song is about a relationship between a man and a woman, in which the man expresses his love for his girlfriend, but complains that she will not stop talking or, rabbiting. It was also used in a television commercial for Courage Bitter. On Christmas Day 1981 they appeared on The Two Ronnies Christmas Special. The duo were both fans of the football club Tottenham Hotspur, and they began their musical association with the club in 1981 when they recorded the FA Cup final single for Tottenham Hotspur with Ossie's Dream\\"/\\"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\\". They also recorded \\"Tottenham, Tottenham\\" in 1982, and Tottenham Hotspur were victorious in both of these finals. They recorded two further singles with Tottenham - the 1987 FA Cup Final song \\"Hot Shot Tottenham!\\" and in 1991 when the team also won the FA Cup, \\"When the Year Ends in One\\". They also recorded \\"The Victory Song (We're Off To Wembley 'Cos We Beat The Arsenal)\\" in 1991. In 1982, they had their biggest success on the chart with \\"Ain't No Pleasing You\\", which reached number two on the UK chart and also charted in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. This song departed from their usual style and was a slower-paced break-up ballad, with strings added to the usual piano, drum and bass sound. The official video featured the orchestra backing the band. They were given a Christmas TV special on LWT that year, Chas and Dave's Christmas Knees-up. After the Christmas special, they were offered their own television series, Chas and Dave's Knees-up, broadcast in 1983. In 1985, Chas & Dave recorded the theme song to the BBC sitcom In Sickness and in Health. Chas & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \\"Ain't No Pleasing You\\". However, their song \\"Margate\\" was used in a feature-length episode of the series entitled \\"The Jolly Boys' Outing\\" in 1989. They also created the theme tune and incidental music for the children television show Bangers and Mash, and recorded the title theme for Crackerjack! used in the 1980s. \\"Snooker Loopy\\", a comic song about snooker, was released as a single in May 1986 and entered the UK Singles Chart, reaching number six. ===Later years=== In 2003, Chas & Dave appeared on the 2003 Jools' Annual Hootenanny, which led to renewed interest in the band. In 2003-4, they supported The Libertines whose singer Pete Doherty said they were a big influence when he was young. They played the Glastonbury Festival in 2005 where they played to a crowd of 18,000 on the acoustic stage, and Hodges would later described it as their best gig. They played again at the festival in 2007. In 2005 EMI released a CD of their first two studio albums and made a new set of recordings at Abbey Road. On 6 October 2008, their autobiography, Chas & Dave ‚Äì All About Us, written by Hodges, was published in the UK. It is reported that it took him a quarter of a century to write. It was announced in September 2009 that the pair would no longer be working together as Peacock planned to retire from the band following the death of his wife Sue.Chas & Dave split up  News. Nme.Com (22 September 2009). Retrieved on 7 May 2012. However, In June 2010, it was announced that Chas & Dave would reunite for one final tour in 2011. Burt retired from the band with Chas's son, Nicholas Charles \\"Nik\\" Hodges taking over on drums. They also played their \\"Christmas Jamboree\\" at the IndigO2 on 23 and 24 December 2011 and 8 December 2012. In October 2012, they were subject of the BBC Four documentary Chas & Dave: Last Orders. It was announced on 4 October 2012 that they would be the sixth act announced to play Rebellion Festival, as part of their last tour. Their subsequent \\"Back By Demand\\" tour of the UK occurred between February and May 2013. In October 2013, they released That's What Happens, their first studio album in 18 years. In July 2014, Hodges appeared in the first episode of Graham Fellows' BBC Radio 4 comedy series John Shuttleworth's Lounge Music. On 7 August 2014 they played at the annual Cropredy Festival near Banbury. On 19 October the official website announced the death of Mick Burt, their original drummer, the previous day. On 9 May 2015, they performed at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember in Horse Guards Parade, London. They also performed on the main stage at the Sunshine Festival in Upton-Upon-Severn on 30 August 2015. In December they took their traditional Christmas show to the Hammersmith Apollo. In 2016 the band played in the week 7 episode of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing performing their song \\"Rabbit\\". ==Musical style== The songs for which Chas & Dave are most known are partly comic, and Chas & Dave are strongly identified with London's blue collar and working class pub sing- song culture. Their musical style is called rockney combining \\"rock\\" and \\"cockney\\", a word Hodges coined in 1976. The style, performed in a London accent, is a fusion of London Music hall and rock and roll. The rockney style was intentional from the beginning when Hodges and Peacock got together as a duo in 1972, as they felt an alternative to the way British bands copied American accents was needed. Hodges had toured America with Heads Hands & Feet and was performing in an American accent. He said: He then contacted Peacock about the possibility of forming a band performing songs in their natural voice. According to Hodges, \\"One Fing 'n' Anuvver\\", the title track of their first album as Chas & Dave, was their first Rockney song. He first developed the style by speaking the lyrics out loud in his natural spoken accent and phrasing after he had written them. The melody was then added to the words so that his natural voice comes out when singing instead of an imitation American accent. ==Chas' death and band legacy== On 22 September 2018, Hodges died from pneumonia following treatment for cancer, aged 74. Chas & Dave's work influenced The Libertines, who played their songs at rehearsals. ==Chas and Dave's Knees Up== In 1983, Chas & Dave presented their own variety show, made by LWT and broadcast on ITV, which was set in an East End pub. * Episode 1: 21 May 1983, Appearing: Eric Burdon, Linda Lewis and Jeff Stevenson * Episode 2: 4 June 1983, Appearing: Lulu, Rocky Sharpe and the Replays, Natasha England, Bobby Knutt and Roy Jay * Episode 3: 11 June 1983, Appearing: Mike Berry, The Flying Pickets and Dave Ismay * Episode 4: 18 June 1983, Appearing: Paul Shane, Captain Sensible and Berni Flint * Episode 5: 25 June 1983, Appearing: Clarence \\"Frogman\\" Henry, Rose-Marie and Jimmy Jones * Episode 6: 2 July 1983, Appearing: Lonnie Donegan, Diz and The Doormen and Gary Wilmot * Xmas Knees Up (1982).

It was produced from 1952 through 1965 in both overhead valve (OHV) and flathead (L-head) side-valve versions. Sometimes referred to as the 196 engine, this engine was originally designed by Nash and introduced in the 1941 Nash Ambassador 600 model. It featured only four main bearings, unlike the 7-main-bearing 234 flathead engine it replaced. It was a flathead design displacing . It was later enlarged to , and finally to . It was redesigned as an OHV engine in 1956. The flathead version was discontinued for 1956‚Äì1957, but reemerged in 1958 as the economy engine for the \\"new\\" Rambler American. When the engine was changed to an OHV configuration the water pump was moved from the left side of the engine (driven by a shaft extending from the back of the generator) to the front above the timing chain. When the flathead model was reintroduced it also received the new water pump. Equipped with such high quality parts as forged crankshafts and connecting rods, these engines earned a reputation for remarkable durability. The flathead, however, was prone to the typical flathead problem of overheating under sustained heavy load. This was from the hot exhaust traveling through the cylinder block to the exhaust manifold. American Motors introduced a die-cast aluminum block version of the OHV engine in 1961. It was produced through 1964. This engine used cast-iron cylinder liners and a cast-iron head. The cylinder heads for the two types of block (aluminum and cast iron) are of similar design, but are not interchangeable. The cylinder head for the aluminum block is roughly 1/8\\" wider than that for the cast iron block and uses a slightly different head bolt pattern.1950‚Äì1965 Nash/AMC Technical Service Manuals A 1964 Rambler American with a 195.6 OHV engine The 196 OHV requires more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The head bolts must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly. Factory service manuals recommend that head bolt torque be checked every and to re-torque them every . With modern head gaskets this service interval can be extended to re-torque the bolts every , or every other year. The cause of the headbolts loosening over time is believed to be thermal expansion and contraction of the head due to the rather heavy design. The head expands and contracts by as much as in height during normal operation, this loosens the bolts over time and eventually will cause the seal between head and block to fail. This maintenance is also imperative to prevent the engine from overheating (the first sign of a blown head gasket) and warping or cracking the head. The cast-iron liners in the aluminum block version can also shift if the head bolts are not properly torqued and the engine is allowed to overheat. Good replacement heads and aluminum blocks for these engines are now difficult to find. ==The modern era I-6== Engine bay of a 1968 Rambler American The company designed an entirely new six-cylinder with a short stroke and seven main bearing crankshaft for 1964. This design was produced in various forms through 2006. The \\"Torque Command\\" inline six was AMC's first modern six- cylinder engine. To commemorate the engine's May 1964 introduction, 2,520 \\"Typhoon\\" cars were made on the Rambler Classic hardtop body. Each featured the 8.5:1 compression ratio engine, Solar Yellow body paint, a Classic Black roof, and a distinctive \\"Typhoon\\" script in place of the usual \\"Classic\\" name. All other AMC options (except engine options) were available. The new engine replaced the Nash OHV I6 in the Classic and Ambassador for the 1965 model year (this was also the first use of a six in the Ambassador since 1956). In 1966, a version finally replaced the aging OHV and L-head engines. Road tests by Consumer Reports described the new powerplant as \\"a very smooth and quiet engine, which should give good performance.\\" Both the 199 and 232 featured a bore, and either a or stroke. The 199 was discontinued in 1970; the 232 was offered alongside the (made by using a stroke crankshaft and slightly taller block) during the 1970s, but was discontinued in 1979. Increasingly stringent emission control regulations continued to decrease the engine's power output, making the smaller version inadequate as increasingly stringent safety regulations also made vehicles heavier. ===199=== The 199 was produced from 1965 to 1970. Applications: *Rambler Classic (1965‚Äì66, fleet cars only) *Rambler American/AMC Rambler (1965‚Äì69) *AMC Hornet (1970) *AMC Gremlin (1970) *VAM Rambler American (mid 1965‚Äì1969) U.S. equivalent - AMC Rambler American and AMC Rambler sedans. *VAM Camioneta Rambler American (mid 1965‚Äì1967) U.S. equivalent - AMC Rambler American wagon. ===232=== Standard 232 in a 1966 Rambler Classic AMI Rambler Gremlin Engine bay of a 1975 AMC Hornet with a 232 The 232 was produced from 1964 to 1979. The 232 was the base six-cylinder engine on many models through 1979, and even towards the end of its usage was considered reasonably modern in design. After its midyear 1964 introduction in the \\"Typhoon\\" two-door hardtop as part of the mid-sized Rambler Classic line, the 232 engine was adapted to fit into the smaller 1965 Rambler American by using a special short water pump, an adaptive piece also used in the 1971‚Äì1975 Jeep CJ-5. Air conditioning was available only with the older 196 engine in the American, because there wasn't space for it with the longer 232. Through the 1970 model year, the 232 shared a deck height with the engines. Starting in 1971, AMC raised the deck height to produce the 258, and the 232 adopted the 199's longer connecting rods and shared deck height with the 258. Bore and stroke remained the same. In 1972, the bell housing bolt pattern changed to match the larger version used on the V8 engines. Changes for the 1976 model year included fuel economy improvements that also reduced emissions and reduced warmup time. This was accomplished by reshaped carburetor air passages that pushed the fuel efficiency of a 232-equipped AMC Gremlin to as tested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, compared to in 1975. *Rambler Classic (1964‚Äì1966) *Rambler American/AMC Rambler (1964‚Äì1969) *Rambler/AMC Marlin (1965‚Äì1967) *Rambler/AMC Ambassador (1965‚Äì1970) *Rambler/AMC Rebel (1967‚Äì70) *AMC Javelin (1968‚Äì74) *AMC Hornet (1970‚Äì77) *AMC Gremlin (1970‚Äì78) *AMC Matador (1971‚Äì74) *AMC Pacer (1975‚Äì79) *AMC Concord (1978‚Äì79) *AMC Spirit (1979) *Jeep CJ (1972‚Äì79) *Jeep Cherokee (1974‚Äì79) *Jeep Wagoneer (1965‚Äì1971) *Jeep J-Series (1965‚Äì1970) *Jeep Commando (1972‚Äì1973) (1976 in Spain) *International Harvester Scout (1969‚Äì1971) *International Harvester Light Line pickups/Travelall (1968‚Äì71) *VAM Rambler American Hardtop (1965) U.S. equivalent AMC Rambler American 440H hardtop *VAM Rambler American Rally (1969‚Äì1971) U.S. equivalent 1969 AMC Rambler Rogue sedan instead of hardtop and 1970‚Äì1971 Hornet X *VAM Rambler American (1968‚Äì1972) U.S. equivalent AMC Rambler American sedans and AMC Hornet sedans *VAM Camioneta Rambler American (1968‚Äì1972) U.S. equivalent AMC Rambler American wagon and AMC Hornet Sportabout *VAM Rambler Classic 660 (1965) U.S. equivalent AMC Rambler Classic *VAM Rambler Classic 770 (1966‚Äì1969) U.S. equivalent 1966 AMC Rambler Classic sedans plus AMC Rebel four door sedan *VAM Rambler Classic SST (1967‚Äì1969) U.S. equivalent AMC Rebel hardtop *VAM Javelin (1968‚Äì1969) U.S. equivalent AMC Javelin *VAM Gremlin (1974‚Äì1976) U.S. equivalent AMC Gremlin ===252=== The engine was produced by AMC's Mexican subsidiary Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) beginning in 1969 and was dropped after 1972, replaced with AMC's 258 for the 1973 model year onward.

This was similar to a 258 in stroke, cast with a larger bore, larger than the 258, giving . All VAM 282s from 1971 through 1978 were still advertised with an output measured using the gross rating system that was last used under AMC in 1971.

The total weight of the new engine was , only one pound more than the 258 six despite its heavier components and parts. For example, the cast aluminum valve cover featured 15 bolts, the industry's most, to achieve a positive seal. The new engine, which was introduced in 1986 for the 1987 model year, was a further evolution of AMC's 258 six. It had a bore and a stroke giving it a displacement of . Connecting rod length was 6.125\\" - similar to the discontinued 199 which was phased out in 1970. The 4.0 is one of AMC's best-known engines. It was one of four AMC engines kept in production when Chrysler bought AMC in 1987. Chrysler engineers continued to refine the engine to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness. The last in the line of the AMC inline sixes, the 4.0 is regarded as one of the best Chrysler 4x4 off-road engines. A Motor Trend long-term test of a 1997 Cherokee XJ noted \\"this long-lived OHV powerplant has a reputation for getting people where they need to go\\" as well as \\"much love expressed by owners for the torquey 4.0-liter/190-horsepower inline six.\\" The engine is known for longevity, and can sometimes go more than without rebuilding. Also, the vibration dampener (harmonic balancer) usually gives out after 300,000 miles where it is common for the rubber insulation to deteriorate where a service replacement is warranted. Described \\"as reliable as a block of wood\\" by Popular Mechanics and ranked first among \\"the ten best car engines they stopped making in the past 20 years,\\" the 4.0 L should run 200,000 miles before a rebuild is even expected and it is also able to \\"suffer running conditions that'd kill most motors.\\" When introduced, the block-mounted oil filter check valve was eliminated on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally fitted with a metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter can be used in place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity). The first 4.0 engines in 1987 had a Renix (Renault/Bendix) engine management system considered quite advanced for their time. A knock sensor allowed the ECU to control spark advance in response to fuel octane and engine load. Unfortunately, there are few scan tools capable of interfacing with the system to pull diagnostics codes. RENIX systems also have no permanent memory for diagnostics codes thus making the diagnosis of intermittent problems more difficult. The 1987 RENIX 4.0 made and . In 1988, the 4.0 received higher flowing fuel injectors, raising output to and ‚Äîmore power than some configurations of the Ford 302, Chevrolet 305, and Chrysler 318 V8 engines, and more than any of the Japanese 6-cylinder truck engines, but with comparable or superior fuel economy. In 1991, a Chrysler multi-port fuel injection system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. Camshaft timing was also changed. The net result was an engine that made and . Badging on most Jeeps equipped with this engine read \\"4.0 Litre HIGH OUTPUT.\\" The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated the need for an EGR valve and knock sensor, but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the Mopar MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code. Small changes were made to the cylinder head for the 1995 model year. In 1996, the engine block was redesigned for greater strength. The new block had more webbing and a stud girdle for added rigidity of the crankshaft main bearings. Engines installed in 1999 Grand Cherokees carried the \\"PowerTech\\" name that had been used intermittently in prior years and on other Chrysler truck and SUV engines. The name was subsequently passed on to 4.0s in the other Jeep models that used the engine, the Cherokee and Wrangler. The cylinder head was again changed for the 2000 model year to a more emissions-friendly design. This head was designated as \\"0331\\" in the casting number. Early 0331 heads are prone to cracking, causing coolant to contaminate the oil, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure. The head cracks in the center between #3 and #4 cylinders. The crack is usually discernible with the valve cover removed as a \\"milky\\" tan line. This condition is usually discovered before catastrophic engine failure, but can lead there if not corrected in a timely manner. The casting was fixed in mid to late 2001, but the same casting number was retained. The \\"fixed\\" heads have \\"TUPY\\" cast in the center where the cracks used to occur. Also new for the 2000 model year, was the distributorless, coil on plug ignition system. Option code: ERH.

This engine was used in the following vehicles: *1987‚Äì2001 Jeep Cherokee *1993‚Äì2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee *1987‚Äì1990 Jeep Wagoneer *1987‚Äì1992 Jeep Comanche *1991‚Äì2006 Jeep Wrangler ===Connecting rod lengths=== 1964‚Äì1970: * - * - * - 1971‚Äì2006: * - * - * - * - *The displacement differs between 1990-1995 and 1996‚Äì2006 4.0L engines by . Both had a bore of , while the stroke decreased slightly from on the earlier engine to on 1996 and later engines. The displacement of both engines still rounds to v. . The small stroke change was accomplished by moving the piston pin and changing the crankshaft stroke, rods are the same. The deck height of the AMC six cylinder block was increased by (half the rod length difference) in 1971 to allow for the longer stroke required for the 258. Only two deck heights. Tall deck is .

Deck height changed slightly over the years 1977‚Äì1982 service manuals state , the 1993 Jeep factory manual states . Deck heights may have changed to accommodate slightly different compression ratios over the years. The 1971 and older blocks use a \\"small\\" bell housing bolt pattern that is exclusive to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell housing bolt pattern was changed to match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the \\"small\\" pattern, the only year 258 to do so. ==See also== *AMC straight-4 engine *AMC V8 engine *AMC Engines *AMC and Jeep transmissions *List of Chrysler engines ==References== ==External links== *Allpar's 4.0 page *AMC Rambler Club‚ÄîClub for 1958 - 1969 AMCs *American Motors Owners‚ÄîClub for 1958 - 1987 AMCs Category:AMC engines Category:Chrysler engines Category:Inline-six engines Category:Jeep engines Category:Products introduced in 1952 Category:Products introduced in 1964 ","title":"AMC straight-6 engine"},{"id":"1431167","text":"Major General Sir Evelyn John Webb-Carter (born 30 January 1946) is a retired senior British Army officer.

Maatjesharing eaten \\"the Dutch way\\" Soused herring is raw herring soaked in a mild preserving liquid. It can be raw herring in a mild vinegar pickle or Dutch brined herring. As well as vinegar, the marinade might contain cider, wine or tea, sugar, herbs (usually bay leaf), spices (usually mace), and chopped onion. The word 'soused' can also describe a marinated herring that has been cooked. The herring is usually baked in the (vinegar) marinade (but can be fried and then soaked in the marinade). It is served cold. This is usual in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The soused herring (maatjesharing or just maatjes in Dutch, or Matjes/matjes in German and Swedish respectively) is an especially mild salt herring, which is made from young immature herrings. The herrings are ripened for a couple of days in oak barrels in a salty solution, or brine. The pancreatic enzymes which support the ripening make this version of salt herring especially mild and soft. Raw herring pickled in vinegar are called rollmops. As of 2015, within the EU, Dutch made Hollandse Nieuwe, Holl√§ndischer Matjes and Hollandse maatjesharing have TSG CertificationEU TSG Certification Database Entry (Accessed November 2015) and German produced Gl√ºckst√§dter Matjes, produced in Schleswig-Holstein has PGI certification.EU PGI Certification Database entry (Accessed Nov/2015) As a pickled herring it can form one course of the traditional twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper in Poland. ==History== This process of preparing herring (known as \\"gibbing\\") was developed in the Middle Ages by the Dutch. Herrings are caught between the end of May and the beginning of July in the North Sea near Denmark or Norway, before the breeding season starts. This is because herrings at this time are unusually rich in oils (over 15%) and their roe and milt have not started to develop. The brine used for Dutch soused herring has a much lower salt content and is much milder in taste than the German Loggermatjes. To protect against infection by nematodes of the genus Anisakis, European Union regulations state that fish should be frozen at ‚àí20 ¬∞C for at least 24 hours. In the modern day, soused herrings can therefore be produced throughout the year. ==Preparation== Through a cut in the throat, the gills and part of the gullet are removed from the herring, eliminating any bitter taste. The liver and pancreas are left in the fish during the salt-curing process because they release enzymes essential for flavor. The herrings are then placed in the brine for approximately 5 days, traditionally in oak casks. They require no further preparation after fillet and skin removal and can be eaten as a snack with finely sliced raw onion and pickles. As skin removal requires experience, fillets or double fillets should be attempted first. The soused herrings are silvery outside and pink inside when fresh, and should not be bought if they appear grey and oily. Whereas salt herrings have a salt content of 20% and must be soaked in water before consumption, soused herrings do not need soaking. ==Serving== In the Netherlands soused herring is most often served as a snack, most frequently plain, or with cut onions. Whole herring is often eaten by lifting the herring by its tail and eating it upwards holding it over the mouth. Soused herring dishes in Northern Germany are traditionally served with potatoes boiled in their skins, French beans, finely sliced fried bacon and onions. It is also common in Germany to eat soused herring with sliced raw onions in a bread roll, in a dish called Matjesbr√∂tchen. In some regions (e. g. Holstein), it is served on dark bread with a cowberry and cream sauce. Soused herring can also be served with cream or yogurt sauces containing onions and gherkins, or in salads. In Sweden matjessill is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, sour cream, chopped chives, crisp bread and snaps. Boiled eggs are popular together with this dish that is most traditionally served on Midsummer's Eve - Finland has a similar custom but silli is not associated with crisp bread. Nowadays most Swedes and Finns eat herring which comes in cans and are sliced and with added sugar. The Swedish matjessill is most often more strongly spiced than other varieties. ==See also== * Pickled herring * Fischbr√∂tchen * Gwamegi, Korean Dried Herring * Schmaltz herring ==References== Category:Herring dishes Category:Snack foods Category:Dutch cuisine Category:German cuisine Category:Swedish cuisine ","title":"Soused herring"},{"id":"1431179","text":"Campus police or university police in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom are often sworn police or peace officers employed by a college or university to protect that private property of the campus and surrounding areas and the people who live, work, and visit it. ==Canada== Campus police in Canada are sworn in as peace officers ‚Äì giving them full police powers on their respective campuses to enforce the Criminal Code, as well as local bylaws. Peace officers in Canada do not typically carry firearms like their police counterparts, so campus officers only carry a baton, pepper spray, handcuffs and a radio. Protective vests, similar to those of police, are worn. Notable examples of campus peace officer services include the University of Toronto Campus Police, UBC Campus Security and the University of Alberta Protective Services. In Ontario, the term of 'campus police' is prohibited under Bill 68 of the Community Safety and Policing Act, 2019. If anyone other than a police service, including a peace officer service, wishes to address themselves as 'police', they must seek exemption from the province. ==United States== In the 2004-05 school year, 87% of college campuses had sworn officers with the power to arrest, and 90% of these departments were armed. 92% of campus police departments are responsible for handling their own dispatching, which means that they are completely self-sufficient agencies. They do not rely on the city police around them to take on their responsibilities. Some secondary public school districts maintain their own police, such as the Los Angeles School Police Department, the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Police Department and the New York City Police Department School Safety Division. == United Kingdom == With the exception of the University of Cambridge, universities in the United Kingdom do not have police forces. The Universities Act 1825 gives both the universities of Oxford and Cambridge the ability to appoint police constables. Both universities formerly maintained police forces, although Oxford disbanded the Oxford University Police in 2003, with responsibility for university policing transferred to Thames Valley Police. However, Cambridge retains the Cambridge University Constabulary, with officers still holding full police powers. ==See also== * Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies * Safety escort service ==References== ==External links== *International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators Category:University and college police forces ","title":"Campus police"},{"id":"1431180","text":"Ronald Isley (; born May 21, 1941) is an American recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and occasional actor. Isley is best known as the lead singer and founding member of the family music group The Isley Brothers. ==Early life== Born in 1941 to Sallye Bernice (n√©e Bell) and O'Kelly Isley Sr, Isley was the third of six brothers (O'Kelly Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley, Ronald, Vernon Isley, Ernie Isley, Marvin Isley). Ronald, like many of his siblings, began his career in the church. Isley began singing at the age of two, winning a $25 war bond for singing at a spiritual contest at the Union Baptist Church. By the age of seven, Isley was singing on-stage at venues such as the Regal Theater in Chicago, alongside Dinah Washington and a few other notables. ==Career== By his early teens, Isley was singing regularly with his brothers in church tours and also first appeared on TV on Ted Mack's Amateur Hour. In 1957, 16-year-old Isley and his two elder brothers O'Kelly and Rudy then 19 and 18 moved to New York to pursue a music career. While in New York, Isley and his brother began recording doo-wop for local labels before landing a major deal with RCA Records in 1959, where the trio wrote and released their debut single \\"Shout\\". By the summer of 1959, the Isley family had moved from Cincinnati to a home in Englewood, New Jersey.Wilner, Paul. \\"Isley Brothers: A Family Affair\\", The New York Times, March 13, 1977. Accessed September 18, 2011. \\"WHEN Sallye Isley moved her brood of children from Cincinnati to Englewood in the summer of 1959, she was participating in a show-business phenomenon.... While their older brothers toured America, the younger Isley boys enrolled successively in Englewood Junior High and Dwight Morrow High School.... Right now, the brothers reside near enough to each other to keep in close touch. Ronald lives in Teaneck, Kelly Jr. in Alpine, Rudolph in Haworth and Ernie in Englewood.\\" For much of the Isley Brothers' duration, Isley would remain the group's consistent member of the group as well as the lead vocalist for most of the group's tenure with sporadic lead shares with his older brothers. In 1969, Isley reformed T-Neck Records with his brothers in a need to produce themselves without the control of record labels, forming the label shortly after ending a brief tenure with Motown. In 1973, the group's style and sound drastically changed following the release of the 3 + 3 album where brothers Ernie Isley and Marvin Isley and in-law Chris Jasper permanently enter the brothers' lineup, writing the music and lyrics to the group's new sound. The younger brothers had been providing instrumental help for the brothers since the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, Isley was living in Teaneck, New Jersey. After Kelly Isley's death in 1986 and Rudy Isley's exit to fulfill a dream of ministry in 1989, Ronald has carried on with the Isley Brothers name either as a solo artist or with accompanying help from the group's younger brothers, much more prominently, Ernie Isley. In 1990, Isley scored a top-ten duet with Rod Stewart with a cover of his brothers' hit \\"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\\", and in 2003 Ronald recorded a solo album, Here I Am: Bacharach Meets Isley, with Burt Bacharach. In addition, Ron Isley became a sought-after hook singer for R. Kelly, Warren G, 2Pac and UGK. Isley released his first solo album Mr. I on November 30, 2010. The album includes the first single \\"No More\\". It debuted at number 50 on the Billboard 200, selling 22,243 copies. It was his first solo album to crack that chart. In 2010, Isley received a \\"Legend Award\\" at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2013, Ronald released his second solo album This Song Is For You sign labels eOne. Ronald received a nominees Independent R&B;/Soul Artist Performance, at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2014, Ronald made a cameo appearance in the music video for the Kendrick Lamar song \\"i\\". ==Personal life== Isley and Winbush in 1996 Isley married Margret Tinsley in 1960 and in 1969 their daughter Tia Isley was born. In 1993, he married singer Angela Winbush in Los Angeles, California. They quietly divorced in early 2002. Isley suffered a mild stroke in London in 2004, which halted an Isley Brothers tour. In September 2005, he married background singer Kandy Johnson of the duo JS/Johnson Sisters.Their son, Ronald Isley, Jr. was born in December 2007. In 2007, it was reported Isley had kidney problems. Isley still resides in St. Louis. ===Tax evasion=== In 2006, Isley was convicted of tax evasion charges and sentenced to three years and one month in prison. Isley's sentence was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.See United States v. Isley, 2008 Tax Notes Today (Tax Analysts) 29-13, No. 06-50509 (9th Cir. 2008).\\"Court Upholds Isley's Tax Evasion Sentence\\", February 12, 2008, Billboard.com, at .

He was awarded his PhD in 1959 from Cambridge for research on population genetics in the house mouse and Primula vulgaris (primrose) supervised by Ronald Fisher. ==Career and research== In 1961 Bodmer joined Joshua Lederberg's laboratory in the Genetics Department of Stanford University as a postdoctoral researcher, continuing his work on population genetics. In 1962 Walter Bodmer was appointed to the faculty at Stanford. He left Stanford University in 1970 to become the first Professor of Genetics at the University of Oxford .Conversation with Walter Bodmer, San Francisco, 4 Dec.2010 Bodmer developed models for population genetics and worked on the human leukocyte antigen system and the use of somatic cell hybrids for human linkage studies. In 1985 he chaired a Royal Society committee which wrote The Bodmer Report; this has been credited with starting the movement for the public understanding of science. Bodmer was one of the first to suggest the idea of the Human Genome Project. In 1987 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. He was the director of research (1979‚Äì1991) and then Director General (1991‚Äì1996) of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. He was also Chancellor of the University of Salford, England (1995‚Äì2005; succeeded by Sir Martin Harris) and Principal of Hertford College, Oxford (1996‚Äì2005; succeeded by Dr. John Landers). In 2005, Bodmer was appointed to lead a ¬£2.3 million project (roughly 4.5 million USD) by the Wellcome Trust at the University of Oxford to examine the genetic makeup of the United Kingdom ‚Äì the People of the British Isles project. He was joined by Oxford Professor Peter Donnelly (a population genetics and statistics expert) and the Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow Lon Cardon. Bodmer said, \\"Our aim is to characterise the genetic make-up of the British population and relate this to the historical and archaeological evidence.\\" The researchers presented some of their findings to the public via the Channel 4 television series \\"Faces of Britain\\". On 14 April 2007, Channel 4 in Britain aired a program that highlighted the study's then-current findings. The project took DNA samples from hundreds of volunteers throughout Britain, seeking tell-tale fragments of DNA that would reveal the biological traces of successive waves of colonisers ‚Äì Celts, Saxons, Vikings, etc. ‚Äì in various parts of Britain. The findings showed that the Viking invasion of Britain was predominantly from Danish Vikings while the Orkney Islands were settled by Norwegian Vikings. He is currently Head of the Cancer and Immunogenetics Laboratory in the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford. Research interests of the laboratory include the fundamental genetics and biology of colorectal cancer. ===Honours and awards=== Bodmer has won numerous awards including: *1974: Fellow of the Royal Society *1980: William Allan Award *1986: Knight Bachelor *1987: Ellison- Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. *1988: Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath. *1992: Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) *1994: Michael Faraday Prize *2013: Royal Medal from the Royal Society * 1984: delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on The Message of the Genes. * Honorary member, British Society for Immunology His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: ==Personal life== Bodmer's father was Jewish so the family were obliged to leave Nazi Germany; in 1938 they settled in Manchester, England.

This song was the first from a Russian act or USSR act to ever enter the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 3 in the UK and Sergei Pimenov, Alexander Polyakov and band's manager Yury Marychev were awarded with Silver Disc award certificated by British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and indicated sales of over 200,000 copies in the UK alone. \\"ResuRection\\" was based on the original melody written by Eduard Artemyev from the 1979 Russian (Soviet) movie Siberiade and contained, in some remix versions, vocal samples of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The Artemyev melody was later played in the opening ceremony for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, with a small girl holding a red balloon. \\"Reload\\" was based on the melody \\"Zodiak\\" from an album \\"Disco Alliance\\" by Latvian electronic rock band Zodiaks. In early 2004 the duo released a remix of Minimalistix's 2003 hit Magic Fly. The group finally broke up in 2011 after rejoining for a small concert tour in Russia in 2010.

The company who owns that Web site will then receive the Web callback request and a call center agent will call the person who made the request back on the number they entered. In some implementations, the Web callback service provider will place outgoing calls to the owner of the web site, and the user, then connect the calls together. An alternative approach is for the web site owner to receive a SMS text message, so they can initiate the call to the web site user.

Caborn- Welborn developed around 1400 and seems to have disappeared around 1700. The Caborn-Welborn culture was the last Native American occupation of southern Indiana before European contact. It remains unclear which historic-era native group, if any, are their descendants. ==Location== The Caborn-Welborn culture is a cluster of more than 80 sites located mostly on ridges along the Wabash and Ohio rivers from Geneva, Kentucky to the mouth of the Saline River. Most are concentrated near the confluence of the Ohio and Wabash rivers. The sites range in size from to for the larger villages. Most sites are located on the higher flood plain ridges, usually situated near sloughs and swamps. The Ohio River floodplain of this region has an extensive system of natural levees which parallel the river, with sloughs and swampy areas in between the levees. ===Sites=== * Ashworth Archaeological Site (12 Po 7) ‚Äì Located in Posey County, Indiana and placed on the National Historic Register in 1985. * Bone Bank Site ‚Äì The site was a large village on the Wabash River in Posey County. It was nicknamed \\"Bone Bank\\" for the large number of remains of graves washed out of the site in the 19th century. It was established early in the Caborn- Welborn phase, about 1400. * Hovey Lake-Klein Archeological Site (12 Po 10) ‚Äì The site is located on the west bank of a backwater lake near the Ohio River. It was established about 1400. * Murphy Archaeological Site (12 Po 1) ‚Äì Located in Posey County, Indiana and placed on the National Historic Register in 1975. Also known as the Sullivan Farm Site and the Mouth-of-the-Wabash Site. * Slack Farm Site ‚Äì A large village near the mouth of the Wabash River in Union County, Kentucky. * Welborn Village Archeological Site (12 Po 19), also known as the Murphy's Landing Site ‚Äì Located in Posey County. ===Timeline=== An internal temporal subdivision for the Caborn-Welborn culture, based on ceramic decorative attributes and the presence of European trade goods. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Subdivisions ! scope=\\"col\\"  Dates ! scope=\\"col\\"  Markers and sites - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Late Caborn-Welborn  1600‚Äì1700  Protohistoric period.

Sites include Slack Farm, Murphy, Welborn, Mann, Hovey Lake and Gough - } ==Material culture== ===Pottery=== Pottery making Pottery made by the Caborn-Welborn women was built up from strips of clay, and then smoothed out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area, where the potters wheel was unknown. Common vessel shapes include jars, bowls, pans, plates and funnels. Most jars tend to have rims with rounded necks and strap handles. The majority of the pottery found at Caborn-Welborn sites are of the kinds known as Mississippian Plain and Bell Plain, which are varieties very common to most Mississippian cultures throughout the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It was buff colored, contains large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and is not as smooth and polished as other varieties. Certain unique kinds of pottery and decorations define the Caborn-Welborn people as distinct from other cultures. Caborn-Welborn Decorated, Kimmswick Fabric Impressed, and Kimmswick Plain are varieties which are present in greater frequencies in Caborn-Welborn sites, and are hallmarks of the culture. Effigy jars, both of humans and animals, are also common in Caborn-Welborn sites. Some have a human or animal head and sometimes a tail attached to the rim, others are shaped into the forms of heads, with attached clay lugs to represent limbs. Caborn-Welborn Decorated, the most commonly found decorated ceramic style, is characterized by incised or punctated lines on the shoulders of the jar forms. Other less common varieties found are indicative of continuity from preceding Lower Ohio Valley cultures and contact with the wider Mississippian world, especially the Central Mississippi valley and the Oneota culture. These types include Old Town Red, O'Byam Incised/Engraved, Manly Punctate, Angel/Kincaid Negative Painted, Beckwith Incised, Barton Incised, Ranch Incised-Like, Parkin Punctate, Campbell Punctate, Walls Engraved, and Vernon Paul Applique. ===Agriculture and food=== Maize was the main foodstuff grown by the Caborn-Welborn people The people of Caborn-Welborn were intensely involved in maize agriculture, as well as other food crops originating in the Americas, such as beans, squash, sunflowers and gourds. The addition of beans to their diet came after the demise of the Angel Phase peoples thought to have preceded the Caborn-Welborn. It would have been a valuable source of protein to add to their maize-rich diet. Maize lacks the amino acids lysine and tryptophan, which the body needs to make proteins and niacin, but beans contain both; therefore together the two foods combine to make complete proteins and a balanced diet. They collected local wild foodstuffs, including a variety of nuts such as hickory, black walnut, pecans, and acorns, as well as fleshy fruits and berries such as persimmon, pawpaw and plums. The hunting of whitetail deer, bison, squirrel, rabbit, turkey, opossum and beaver added vital protein to their diet. But, unlike other Mississippian peoples in the central Mississippi Valley, they did not eat quantities of fish and waterfowl as part of their diet. ==European trade goods== Glass trade beads of the type used by the Spanish By the final phase of Caborn-Welborn culture, European trade items began to be included among grave goods. These included copper and brass tubes, glass beads, and bracelets. This is not indicative of direct European contact, however. The items could have made their way to the Caborn-Welborn area by the native traders along the routes which had brought exotic materials such as marine shells and native copper from other regions to the area for centuries. But with the traders contracted and carried European diseases such as smallpox and measles, which generally penetrated the American continents far in advance of European-manned expeditions. With little or no immunity to the new European diseases, many Native cultures died or were severely disrupted before the Europeans made direct physical contact with them. The Caborn-Welborn culture is one such group. ==See also== * Angel Mounds * List of Mississippian sites ==References== Category:Native American history of Indiana Category:Archaeological cultures of North America Category:Archaeological sites in Indiana Category:Late Mississippian culture Category:15th-century establishments in North America Category:17th-century disestablishments in North America ","title":"Caborn-Welborn culture"},{"id":"1431263","text":"Benny Green (born Bernard Green; 9 December 1927, Leeds, Yorkshire ‚Äì 22 June 1998) was a British jazz saxophonist who was also known for his radio shows and books. == Early life == His parents were David and Fanny Green. David was a tailor and saxophonist. They met while David was playing with a band in Leeds. They married in London in 1926 and initially lived with David's father, an immigrant Russian-Jewish tailor, at 1 Greenwell Street, London. Benny Green was born in Leeds because his mother wanted to be near her own family for the birth, but they soon returned to London, to a basement flat in Cleveland Street. Here he became a musician, writer and broadcaster. He was educated at Clipstone Street Junior Mixed School and St Marylebone Grammar School. == Career == As a saxophonist, he worked in the bands of Ralph Sharon (1952), Ronnie Scott (1952), Stan Kenton (February 1956) and Dizzy Reece (1957). In 1955 he began writing a weekly column for the New Musical Express. In 1958, he appeared in the UK pop charts as a member of Lord Rockingham's XI, the house band on ITV's rock 'n' roll show Oh Boy! The novelty jazz/rock release \\"Hoots Mon\\", complete with spoken interjections in a broad mock-Scots accent, reached number 1 for three weeks in November and December. Benny later joked that wearing dark glasses whilst playing (to counteract the strong studio lights) generated a fan letter addressed to \\"the blind sax-player\\". His BBC Radio 2 Sunday afternoon record show ran for many years until his death. He had a huge knowledge of music he liked, by classic \\"Great American Songbook\\" composers like Kern and Cole Porter and jazz, and would introduce most records with details about the artist(s). He also chaired a radio comedy panel game broadcast regularly on Radio 2 and the BBC World Service for 20 years; Jazz Score. Many jazz artists appeared on this show, stopping the contest to tell their own anecdotes about their career and other jazz musicians. He first worked for the BBC in 1955 and worked regularly for it from then on. In the 1960s, he often appeared with, among others, Alan Brien, Dee Wells and Robert Pitman, on Three After Six, Associated Rediffusion's early evening television discussion programme on current affairs.\\"Amazing Depths\\". The Spectator. London. 14 January 1966. Retrieved 25 June 2016. His film Girls Wanted - Istanbul, for Granada TV, was nominated for the1970 BAFTA awards. In the 1980s, he contributed occasionally to Stop The Week, Robert Robinson's Saturday discussion programme on Radio 4. Green also wrote and/or narrated many radio documentaries about stage and film musical stars and Hollywood, his other main interest apart from jazz and sport. He also wrote for magazines, including as film critic for Punch between 1972 and 1979, and regularly for newspapers; for 19 years he was jazz critic at The Observer. He was a big fan of writer P. G. Wodehouse, about whom he wrote a literary biography (1981). Away from jazz he is notable for publishing the Wisden Anthologies, a summary of the famous cricketing annual, between 1979 and 1983. The four volumes covered the highlights from Wisden Cricketers' Almanack from its inception in 1864 until 1982 and stand as a major milestone in cricketing literature. Benny Green married Antoinette Kanal in 1962, and had three sons and one daughter. One son, Dominic Green, is a guitarist who has published a book about his father; Benny Green Words and Music (2003). Another, Leo Green, has followed in his father's footsteps as a highly regarded saxophonist and, more recently, Radio 2 broadcaster. Green died at the age of 70 of cancer in the Royal Marsden Hospital in Brompton, London. ==Bibliography== Works by Benny Green include: *The Reluctant Art: The Growth of Jazz (1963) *Blame It on My Youth (1967) *Jazz Decade: London (1969) *Fifty-Eight Minutes to London (1969) *Girls Wanted - Istanbul (1969) *Drums in My Ears (1973) *Swingtime in Tottenham (1976) *I've Lost My Little Willie!: A Celebration of Comic Postcards (1976) *The Cricket Addict's Archive (1977) (edited) *Shaw's Champions: The Noble Art from Cashel Byron to Gene Tunney (1978) *Wisden Anthology 1864‚Äì1900 (1979) (edited) *Fred Astaire (1980) *Wisden Anthology 1900‚Äì1940 (1980) (edited) *P.

It is the fourth novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum and the first to be written by Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis. ==Plot summary== :For a more detailed background of the main character, see Jason Bourne. With the climactic events of The Bourne Ultimatum behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long and, when a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne Persona awakens in him yet again. Bourne's first objective is to get to his longtime friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unbeknownst (as yet) to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web‚Äîone which he cannot escape as easily as his professorial fa√ßade. Finding Alex dead along with Doctor Morris Panov, Bourne realizes the trap as soon as he hears the police arriving. With his car outside and his fingerprints in the house, he immediately understands that he has been framed. So, with only Conklin's cell phone and a torn page from a notebook to go on, Jason Bourne sets off to find out who's trying to kill him and who killed his friends. After warning Marie and his two children, Jamie and Alyssa, to proceed immediately towards their safe house, he slips through the CIA cordon and makes his way to an independent agent who was talking to Alex Conklin when he was killed. Having received travel plans to Hungary and a mission to meet Janos Vadas, Conklin's contact in Hungary, he proceeds to unravel the truth behind why Alex and Morris Panov were killed. Meanwhile, a group of Chechen terrorists have been fighting a losing battle against Russian invaders when a man named Stepan Spalko appears to solve their problems. Spalko, we later discover, had Conklin and Panov killed and kidnapped a doctor by the name of Felix Schiffer. Schiffer is an expert in bacteriological particulate behavior. Spalko intends to release a bacteriological weapon during peace negotiations between many world leaders to be held in Reykjav√≠k, using the terrorists he is cultivating as a diversion. The book charts Bourne's course from the United States, to France and then to Budapest in Hungary where he learns the final thing he needs to do‚Äîto stop Spalko's attack in Iceland. This, of course, all has to be done in the face of a CIA sanction for him to be immediately terminated, as he is believed responsible for the deaths of Conklin and Panov. There is also the matter of Spalko's hired assassin, Khan, who is preternaturally able to track Bourne where everyone else cannot. Khan is revealed In the Bourne Legacy; he is Joshua Webb, David Webb's son from his first marriage, who believes erroneously that he was left for dead by his father in Vietnam. Bourne, however, refuses to believe that Khan is Joshua, convinced that Joshua was killed decades ago, and continually tries to avoid him and the truth. Though Khan is at first working for Spalko, he eventually realizes that he has been used as a pawn in Spalko's personal game. After revealing later on to Bourne that Annaka Vadas, the daughter of Janos Vadas, is a traitor, he begins to feel that Bourne is not the hateful father that he had imagined. Unfortunately, Bourne is still unable to believe Khan is Joshua‚Äîuntil he hacks into the CIA database and discovers that Joshua's body had never been found. In a fit of rage, he attacks Khan, first believing that it is a conspiracy to hurt him, but is later captured by Spalko. After rescuing Bourne from Spalko, Khan makes an uneasy peace with his father. While on the plane to Iceland, however, Khan reveals a piece of information that finally convinces Bourne that Khan is his son. When Bourne subsequently reveals that he lost his memory while undercover as Cain, Khan begins to rethink his views regarding his father. After completing the operation and stopping Spalko, Khan‚ÄîJoshua‚Äîmakes up with his father and realizes that his hatred was always a reflection of his personal struggles and that, in truth, he truly loved Bourne. He requests Bourne, however, not to reveal his identity to Marie, in whose life he feels he has no place. ==Film== George Nolfi, who co-wrote the screenplay for the Bourne Ultimatum film, was to write the screenplay for a fourth film. Matt Damon was also attached to the project from the start, and Julia Stiles as well as Joan Allen had been asked to join the project, with Paul Greengrass slated to return as director.

It was a box office hit in Sweden and several other countries. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Hollywood 77th Academy Awards. ==Plot== Daniel Dar√©us (Michael Nyqvist) is a successful and renowned international conductor whose life aspiration is to create music that will open people's hearts. His own heart, however, is in bad shape. After suffering a heart attack on stage at the end of a performance, he retires indefinitely to Norrland in the far north of Sweden, to the village where he endured a terrible childhood of bullying. Daniel buys the old elementary school in the village, and soon after is asked to come along one Thursday night and listen to the local choir. He is only asked to listen, and maybe offer some helpful advice, but their intentions of persuading him to help are obvious. He eventually agrees to help, albeit reluctantly. Daniel approaches the parish minister to seek for the position of cantor. He starts helping the choir grow and develop, rediscovering his own joy in music. Almost immediately, Lena (Frida Hallgren), an attractive young girl in the choir, catches his attention. As they grow closer and fall in love, he realises that he is surrounded by the villagers' personal problems. Inger (Ingela Olsson) is married to the respected minister, Stig (Niklas Falk), but has failed to develop a loving sexual relationship with her husband. Siv (Ylva L√∂√∂f) is so obsessed with morality that she cannot enjoy herself. Arne (Lennart J√§hkel) is so ambitious for the choir's success that he obsesses over tiny mistakes, failing to see that he is making bigger mistakes himself. Tore (Andr√© Sj√∂berg) is mentally handicapped and shunned but is eventually included in the choir; Holmfrid (Mikhael Rahm) has put up with being called \\"Fatso\\" by Arne since childhood and eventually stands up to him. Gabriella (Helen Sj√∂holm) is beaten and abused by her husband, Connie (Per Morberg), a fact that is known and ignored by the whole village. She eventually finds the strength to leave him, as the whole village finds its strength to help her. Connie himself turns out to be the bully who was at school with Daniel and drove him from the village. He blames the choir and Daniel for his wife's decision and beats him up. This lands Connie in jail. The minister, Stig, is jealous of the choir's success and tries to close it down. His failure precipitates his eventual nervous breakdown. The heart of each member of the choir starts to open, as it has always been Daniel's dream. The choir is accepted into the annual \\"Let the Peoples Sing\\" competition (Arne has decided to register the choir without previous notice), and they journey to Innsbruck, Austria, to perform. Lena fears Daniel will leave her for his sophisticated friends from the music world, when she see their kissing and hugging him. He dares at last to tell her he loves her and then they make love. On the day of the competition, the choir is ready on stage but Daniel is nowhere to be seen. His heart has been affected by his anxiety, and he has another heart attack. Daniel staggers into the restroom, unsure of how to handle the situation, then stumbles and hits his head on the pipe below a sink, causing him to bleed severely. He lies helplessly on the tile, blood gushing from his head, listening to the choir harmonising over the loudspeakers. The audience in the auditorium is enchanted and sings along. Daniel smiles to himself and turns motionless, thus leaving the viewer to decide whether he lives or dies, completely fulfilled by reaching his goal. The final scene shows Daniel rushing towards his younger self within the wheat fields as he embraces his life's goal, to \\"create music that will open a person's heart\\". ==Cast== * Michael Nyqvist as Daniel Dar√©us * Frida Hallgren as Lena * Helen Sj√∂holm as Gabriella * Lennart J√§hkel as Arne * Ingela Olsson as Inger * Niklas Falk as Stig * Per Morberg as Connie * Ylva L√∂√∂f as Siv * Andr√© Sj√∂berg as Tore * Mikael Rahm as Holmfrid * Barbro Kollberg as Olga * Axelle Axell as Florence * Lasse Petterson as Erik * Ulla- Britt Norrman as Amanda ==Release== As It Is in Heaven was particularly successful in Australia. The Hayden Orpheum in Cremorne showed the film for 103 weeks (as of November 2008), making it one of the longest-running films in Australian history. By comparison, The Sound of Music ran in Adelaide for over three years. A celebration of the popularity and spirit of the film was held at the Orpheum in August 2007 with a concert of Scandinavian music including a finale of \\"Gabriella's Song\\" from the film. A recording of proceedings was made for the director Kay Pollak and via a pre-recorded message to the audience, he thanked Sydneysiders for embracing the film so warmly. It ran for 52 weeks in New Zealand and had good word-of-mouth audiences in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. ==Awards and nominations== The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards. At the Swedish Guldbagge Awards it made history by being nominated in every possible category, while at the same time failing to win a single award. ==References* * * Category:2004 films Category:2000s musical drama films Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish-language films Category:Swedish musical drama films Category:Films about classical music and musicians Category:Films directed by Kay Pollak Category:Films set in Sweden Category:2004 drama films ","title":"As It Is in Heaven"},{"id":"1431307","text":"Nuker may refer to: *Nuker, microwave oven *Nuker, high-capacity Internet Web distribution site or topsite (warez) *A (usually malicious) program designed to disable a computer or destroy data *Nuker Team, the scientific group that studies galaxies ","title":"Nuker"},{"id":"1431314","text":"Patrick George Walden (born 5 October 1978 in Islington, London) is best known as the former guitarist for Babyshambles. Prior to joining Babyshambles, Walden belonged to a variety of London groups, among which were Fluid, the Six Cold Thousand, and The White Sport. He played guitar for The White Sport alongside another future Babyshambles member, drummer Adam Ficek. Walden also worked as a live guitarist and as a session musician, playing bass and guitar for numerous recording artists. Among those acts were Whitey, James Blunt, 500 and Crave, Ed Laliq, and, very briefly, The Honeymoon. ==Career== ===Babyshambles=== In the early summer of 2004, when Pete Doherty once again found himself cast out of The Libertines because of his drug use, he brought Babyshambles to the fore with Walden on lead guitar. The band's line-up underwent several changes before stabilizing during the late summer of 2004 with Doherty on vocals, Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and Drew McConnell on bass. Walden co-wrote a number of Babyshambles songs with Pete Doherty. One of them, \\"The Man Who Came To Stay,\\" was released as the B-side to the Killamangiro single in November 2004. Other Doherty/Walden compositions include Top-10 single \\"Fuck Forever\\" and \\"Loyalty Song,\\" \\"352 Days,\\" \\"In Love With a Feeling,\\" \\"Up the Morning,\\" \\"Pipe Down,\\" \\"32nd of December,\\" and \\"8 Dead Boys.\\" He co-wrote six of the sixteen tracks that made it onto Down In Albion, Babyshambles' debut album. At Babyshambles' live shows, he usually performed using an Olympic White 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, with a 1985 Jazzmaster and a 90s American Stratocaster as backups. Often citing experimental guitarists like J Mascis, Thurston Moore and Jimi Hendrix as early influences, Walden's unusual playing style set Babyshambles apart from other bands in the East London music scene. Marshall magazine \\"Marshall Law\\" lists him as using a JCM900 head with a 1960A cab. In December 2005, Walden left Babyshambles. The band continued to perform under the same name, but did not replace Walden with a different guitarist immediately. In the 10 January 2006 issue of NME, Walden's departure was officially announced. However, on 23 January 2006, Walden turned up to play guitar for the Babyshambles at a gig in the Junction, Cambridge. He returned once more to the band in February and played several of the gigs on that tour, but has not appeared with them onstage since. Walden's reason to leave the band was his heavy drug abuse. In April 2006 Babyshambles went on tour without Walden who was accused of assaulting his girlfriend, arrested and spent nine days in Pentonville prison. All charges against Walden were eventually dropped. He left London in order to get clean of drugs and Mick Whitnall became Babyshambles' new guitarist. Walden was supposed to have played with Babyshambles on their November‚ÄìDecember 2007 Arena tour. The band released a statement saying that he had dropped out at the last minute, even after travelling with them on the tour bus. Walden later stated that he did not appear on stage because there were drugs about, even though it was supposed to be a drug-free tour. Furthermore, Walden stated that his successor, Mick Whitnall, did not want him to play with the band anymore.21 January 2008, issue of NME ===Post Babyshambles=== Walden was rumoured to have been playing at The Cheltenham Jazz Festival (27 April‚Äì2 May) as a special guest with Seb Rochford's band Fulborn Teversham, but cancelled the appearance. Walden appeared at the Rock Against Racism 30th Anniversary Show at the Hackney Empire on 19 July 2007. He played Babyshambles' classics with his old bandmate Drew McConnell. The set list included \\"The Man Who came To Stay\\" and \\"8 Dead Boys\\" On 3 August 2007 played a small gig in Hackney with all of his former Babyshambles bandmates (as well as Mick Whitnall) for friend Peter Wolfe's birthday. On 6 November 2009 Pat played a few songs with Babyshambles including \\"Pipedown\\" and \\"Black Boy Lane\\" at a gig at Halo in Battersea. ===Big Dave=== In late 2007 Walden formed the band Big Dave with drummer Seb Rochford and Ruth Goller on bass. In the first half of 2008 the band played a few gigs in small venues. Walden announced that a debut EP will be recorded in 2008. But so far, nothing much has been heard since then. In August 2010, Waldens career appeared to be off the rails again after he appeared in court charged with receiving stolen goods. After being spotted acting suspiciously in a Sutton branch of Wilkinsons, Walden was pursued by security who found in his possession stolen goods and Methodone prescribed to another user. ===April 2011=== In April 2011 Walden completed a spell in rehab and began work on a new project with ex Rebecas member Robert Mannall. The duo have recorded thirty two demos that have been posted on various sites on the internet. On 1 May 2011 Walden previewed a selection of new material at the Hawley Arms, as part of Camden Crawl 2011, with Drew McConnell. ===November 2014=== In November 2014 Walden did his first interview and photoshoot in a number of years with friend, music enthusiast and blogger, Olivia Collins for the website www.themusicalacidtest.com and photographer, Jack Grange. In the interview he says he is studying a Jazz Composition degree in an effort to reconnect with his first love, jazz music. ==References== ==External links== *Official Babyshambles website Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:English rock guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English songwriters Category:21st-century guitarists Category:21st- century British male musicians Category:Babyshambles members ","title":"Patrick Walden"},{"id":"1431322","text":"Unipolar encoding is a line code. A positive voltage represents a binary 1, and zero volts indicates a binary 0. It is the simplest line code, directly encoding the bitstream, and is analogous to on-off keying in modulation. Its drawbacks are that it is not self-clocking and it has a significant DC component, which can be halved by using return-to-zero, where the signal returns to zero in the middle of the bit period. With a 50% duty cycle each rectangular pulse is only at a positive voltage for half of the bit period. This is ideal if one symbol is sent much more often than the other and power considerations are necessary, and also makes the signal self-clocking. NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) - Traditionally, a unipolar scheme was designed as a non- return-to-zero (NRZ) scheme, in which the positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0. It is called NRZ because the signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit, as instead happens in other line coding schemes, such as Manchester code. Compared with its polar counterpart, polar NRZ, this scheme applies a DC bias to the line and unnecessarily wastes power ‚Äì The normalized power (power required to send 1 bit per unit line resistance) is double that for polar NRZ.

The battle was won by the Russian-Austrian army and it is presumed that the Hungarian poet and national hero S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi died in the battlefield, though his body was never found. ==Hungarian order of battle== Bem had returned to Transylvania after a sally to Moldavia against Russian forces under the command of General Ustrugov. He prepared an offensive against the Russian army group under General Grotenhjelm. He had to cancel this offensive because he got information that the L√ºders, having captured the V√∂r√∂storony pass (now Turnu Ro»ôu Pass) and the city of Nagyszeben (now Sibiu), was advancing towards him. Bem knew that a battle against L√ºders would be decisive for the campaign in Transylvania so he decided to concentrate his forces. He sent orders to Colonel Kem√©ny, commander of the Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca) Division, that it was to go to Segesv√°r and support the main Hungarian forces in the fight against the Russian V corps. The remnants of four Nagyszeben divisions and parts of the Brass√≥ (now Brasov) and H√°romsz√©k divisions were to concentrate in Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r (now Cristuru Secuiesc), which Bem occupied. Colonel Dobay's group had to move from Fels≈ër√°kos (now Racosul de Sus) across K≈ëhalom (now Rupea) to Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r in order to support the army group. All of these forces under Bem's command added about 10 to 12,000 infantry and cavalry soldiers and more than 30 cannon. However, in the event Bem only had 6,000 soldiers and 12 cannon on the field. The right wing of the Hungarian army consisted of a battalion of infantry with two supporting cannons placed near the road from Udvarhely to Feh√©regyh√°za (now Albesti). The Hungarian center included 8 cannons along with cavalry and 4 infantry formations. Two infantry battalions were positioned on the left wing, above the adduction of a stream crossing the road from Segesv√°r to Feh√©regyh√°za. Reserves were placed about from the front. ==Russian order of battle== L√ºders had under his command about 12,000 soldiers and 30 cannon. He was worried that an attack by the Hungarian reinforcements would come from a side road to Marosv√°s√°rhely (now T√¢rgu Mure≈ü), so he defended it with three rifle regiments from Zamo≈õƒá, 16 cannon, 5 sapper battalions, 4 squadrons from Prince de Nassau ulan regiment, one division of horse and a Cossack squadron. He placed a rifle infantry regiment from Lublin on the route to Udvarhely, with 5 rifle battalions, 12 cannon, another 4 squadrons of cavalry and 3 squadrons of Cossacks, placing General Engelhardt in command of the group. He positioned a Cossack reconnaissance squadron on the route to Fogaras (now FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü). The artillery battalion was placed on the route to Medgyes (now Media»ô). In addition to these forces, L√ºders had the support of Austrian allies under General Clam-Gallas. His group, consisting of six infantry battalion, some Cossacks units, and 6 or 8 cannon, was ordered to join forces with V Corps. After getting intelligence at 8 am that Hungarian forces had been seen from the road to Udvarhely, the commander of V Corps ordered his chief of staff (General Skariatin) to prepare to fight the column of General Essau≈Çov. Skariatin moved his column to the ford across the Segesv√°r - Feh√©regyh√°za road. He placed 6 cannon, defended by an infantry battalion, on the right side of road. Two more cannon were positioned on the road along with the second battalion. A third battalion established position to the right of the road at the edge of a forest covering Mount Waldenberg. Parts of the fifth battalion were stationed on the peak of that mountain. A left wing, slightly behind the center, was composed of cavalry, cossacks, and a few cannons. L√ºders kept 2 infantry battalions and some artillery in reserve. After observing the Hungarians establish their positions, L√ºders was certain that the main attack would come from Marosv√°s√°rhely. ==Battle== After 10 a.m. Bem began strong artillery fire on the main group of the Russian army and began to advance his left wing. During the fighting, a bullet mortally wounded Skariatin. Command passed to General Iwin. The fighting was fierce for about three hours. At about 2 p.m., Russian resistance on the right wing began to weaken. Iwin sent two companies of the first battalion to reinforce their position. The commander of V Corps ordered the reserve artillery and cavalry to attack the Hungarian right wing, on the other side of the field. L√ºders, after getting information that Hungarian reinforcements from Marosv√°s√°rhely had not appeared, sent formations to secure that road. After the arrival of the artillery battery and some cavalry units, General Iwin's cavalry begin to encircle the Hungarian right wing. After breaking the Hussars, the Russian cavalry moved around the rear of the Hungarians. The Hungarians begin to retreat to Feh√©regyh√°za as their front collapsed, with the Russians in pursuit. Meanwhile, the column of Colonel Dobanay was defeated by General Clam-Gallas's troops. ==Aftermath== Hungarian forces withdrew to Marosv√°s√°rhely where they joined the \\"Kolozsv√°r\\" division, after which they continued to Nagyszeben. There, Bem won his last victory against Russian General Hasford's group. ==Gallery== File:J√≥zef Bem 111.JPGJ√≥zef Zachariasz Bem File:Luders.jpgAlexander von L√ºders File:Eduard Clam-Gallas.jpgEduard Clam-Gallas File:Feh√©regyh√°za-a-segesv√°ri csata eml√©km≈±ve.jpgMonument of the Battle of Segesv√°r in Feh√©regyh√°za File:Segesv√°ri-obeliszk-oldal√°n.jpgInscription on the obelisk of the Battle of Segesv√°r File:Pet≈ëfi szobra-Feh√©regyh√°za-a csata eml√©km≈±v√©n√©l.jpgStatue of S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi in Feh√©regyh√°za ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Conflicts in 1849 Segesvar 1849 Segesvar 1849 Segesvar 1849 Category:Military history of Hungary Category:Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Category:History of Transylvania (1848‚Äì1867) ","title":"Battle of Segesv√°r"},{"id":"1431342","text":"In mathematics and mathematical physics, potential theory is the study of harmonic functions. The term \\"potential theory\\" was coined in 19th-century physics when it was realized that two fundamental forces of nature known at the time, namely gravity and the electrostatic force, could be modeled using functions called the gravitational potential and electrostatic potential, both of which satisfy Poisson's equation‚Äîor in the vacuum, Laplace's equation. There is considerable overlap between potential theory and the theory of Poisson's equation to the extent that it is impossible to draw a distinction between these two fields. The difference is more one of emphasis than subject matter and rests on the following distinction: potential theory focuses on the properties of the functions as opposed to the properties of the equation. For example, a result about the singularities of harmonic functions would be said to belong to potential theory whilst a result on how the solution depends on the boundary data would be said to belong to the theory of the Laplace equation. This is not a hard and fast distinction, and in practice there is considerable overlap between the two fields, with methods and results from one being used in the other. Modern potential theory is also intimately connected with probability and the theory of Markov chains. In the continuous case, this is closely related to analytic theory. In the finite state space case, this connection can be introduced by introducing an electrical network on the state space, with resistance between points inversely proportional to transition probabilities and densities proportional to potentials. Even in the finite case, the analogue I-K of the Laplacian in potential theory has its own maximum principle, uniqueness principle, balance principle, and others. ==Symmetry== A useful starting point and organizing principle in the study of harmonic functions is a consideration of the symmetries of the Laplace equation. Although it is not a symmetry in the usual sense of the term, we can start with the observation that the Laplace equation is linear. This means that the fundamental object of study in potential theory is a linear space of functions. This observation will prove especially important when we consider function space approaches to the subject in a later section. As for symmetry in the usual sense of the term, we may start with the theorem that the symmetries of the n-dimensional Laplace equation are exactly the conformal symmetries of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. This fact has several implications. First of all, one can consider harmonic functions which transform under irreducible representations of the conformal group or of its subgroups (such as the group of rotations or translations). Proceeding in this fashion, one systematically obtains the solutions of the Laplace equation which arise from separation of variables such as spherical harmonic solutions and Fourier series. By taking linear superpositions of these solutions, one can produce large classes of harmonic functions which can be shown to be dense in the space of all harmonic functions under suitable topologies. Second, one can use conformal symmetry to understand such classical tricks and techniques for generating harmonic functions as the Kelvin transform and the method of images. Third, one can use conformal transforms to map harmonic functions in one domain to harmonic functions in another domain. The most common instance of such a construction is to relate harmonic functions on a disk to harmonic functions on a half-plane. Fourth, one can use conformal symmetry to extend harmonic functions to harmonic functions on conformally flat Riemannian manifolds. Perhaps the simplest such extension is to consider a harmonic function defined on the whole of Rn (with the possible exception of a discrete set of singular points) as a harmonic function on the n-dimensional sphere. More complicated situations can also happen. For instance, one can obtain a higher-dimensional analog of Riemann surface theory by expressing a multi- valued harmonic function as a single-valued function on a branched cover of Rn or one can regard harmonic functions which are invariant under a discrete subgroup of the conformal group as functions on a multiply connected manifold or orbifold. ==Two dimensions== From the fact that the group of conformal transforms is infinite-dimensional in two dimensions and finite-dimensional for more than two dimensions, one can surmise that potential theory in two dimensions is different from potential theory in other dimensions. This is correct and, in fact, when one realizes that any two-dimensional harmonic function is the real part of a complex analytic function, one sees that the subject of two-dimensional potential theory is substantially the same as that of complex analysis. For this reason, when speaking of potential theory, one focuses attention on theorems which hold in three or more dimensions. In this connection, a surprising fact is that many results and concepts originally discovered in complex analysis (such as Schwarz's theorem, Morera's theorem, the Weierstrass-Casorati theorem, Laurent series, and the classification of singularities as removable, poles and essential singularities) generalize to results on harmonic functions in any dimension. By considering which theorems of complex analysis are special cases of theorems of potential theory in any dimension, one can obtain a feel for exactly what is special about complex analysis in two dimensions and what is simply the two-dimensional instance of more general results. ==Local behavior== An important topic in potential theory is the study of the local behavior of harmonic functions. Perhaps the most fundamental theorem about local behavior is the regularity theorem for Laplace's equation, which states that harmonic functions are analytic. There are results which describe the local structure of level sets of harmonic functions. There is B√¥cher's theorem, which characterizes the behavior of isolated singularities of positive harmonic functions. As alluded to in the last section, one can classify the isolated singularities of harmonic functions as removable singularities, poles, and essential singularities. ==Inequalities== A fruitful approach to the study of harmonic functions is the consideration of inequalities they satisfy. Perhaps the most basic such inequality, from which most other inequalities may be derived, is the maximum principle. Another important result is Liouville's theorem, which states the only bounded harmonic functions defined on the whole of Rn are, in fact, constant functions. In addition to these basic inequalities, one has Harnack's inequality, which states that positive harmonic functions on bounded domains are roughly constant. One important use of these inequalities is to prove convergence of families of harmonic functions or sub-harmonic functions, see Harnack's theorem. These convergence theorems are used to prove the existence of harmonic functions with particular properties. ==Spaces of harmonic functions== Since the Laplace equation is linear, the set of harmonic functions defined on a given domain is, in fact, a vector space. By defining suitable norms and/or inner products, one can exhibit sets of harmonic functions which form Hilbert or Banach spaces. In this fashion, one obtains such spaces as the Hardy space, Bloch space, and Bergman space. ==See also== * Subharmonic function * Kellogg's theorem ==References== * * *S. Axler, P. Bourdon, W.

Beethoven was the soloist in the public premiere as part of the concert on 22 December 1808 at Vienna's Theater an der Wien. ==Orchestration== It is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of a flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. ==Premiere and reception== It was premiered in March 1807 at a private concert of the home of Prince Franz Joseph von Lobkowitz. The Coriolan Overture and the Fourth Symphony were premiered in that same concert.Steinberg, Michael. The Symphony: A Listeners Guide. pp. 19‚Äì24. Oxford University Press, 1995. However, the public premiere was not until a concert on 22 December 1808 at Vienna's Theater an der Wien. Beethoven again took the stage as soloist. The marathon concert saw Beethoven's last appearance as a soloist with orchestra, as well as the premieres of the Choral Fantasy and the Fifth and Sixth symphonies. Beethoven dedicated the concerto to his friend, student, and patron, the Archduke Rudolph. A review in the May 1809 edition of the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung states that \\"[this concerto] is the most admirable, singular, artistic and complex Beethoven concerto ever\\".Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, 17 May 1809, p. 523 However, after its first performance, the piece was neglected until 1836, when it was revived by Felix Mendelssohn. Today, the work is widely performed and recorded, and is considered to be one of the central works of the piano concerto literature. == Movements == Title page, first edition ===I. Allegro moderato=== The first movement opens with the solo piano, playing simple chords in the tonic key before coming to rest on a dominant chord. The orchestra then enters with the same theme, in B major, the major mediant key, which is in a chromatic mediant relationship to the tonic. Thus enters the first theme. The orchestra states the main theme in B major, dropping through the circle of fifths to a cadence in the tonic, G major. The theme is then stated again, this time in stretto between upper and lower voices. A very strong cadence in the tonic, withering away within one bar, introduces a transitional, modulatory theme with restless triplet accompaniment, also containing hints of stretto. The music moves to the minor mediant key, B minor, while its dynamic is reduced to pianissimo, at which point material from the opening theme returns. Through a rising bass line and sequential harmonies, the music regains the tonic key (on a dominant pedal) with a new theme derived from bars 3, 4, and 5. The final cadence is delayed for several bars before the material from the opening bar resurfaces as the movement's closing theme, accompanied by a tonic pedal over forte dominant chords. Felix Salzer says the following about this opening, \\"[It is] one of the most fascinating substitutions of the entire literature...The whole passage appears as a most imaginative prolongation of interruption, the post- interruption phrase starting with a B-Major chord boldly substituting for the tonic. In addition, this post-interruption phrase introduces a very interesting melodic parallelism in form of an augmentation of the end of the pre-interruption phrase one step higher.\\"Salzer, Felix, Structural Hearing, p. 195, Dover 1962, The piano's entrance resembles an Eingang, an improvisatory passage from Mozart's day that would have occurred after the orchestra's last unresolved dominant chord, but before the piano played the main theme. Beethoven captures this improvisatory style by accelerating the rhythm in the piano part, from eighth notes, to triplets, to sixteenth notes, and finally in a scale that rushes downward in sixteenth-note sextuplets. A long preparation is then made before a tonic cadence duly arrives, and the orchestra once again takes up the main theme. ===II. Andante con moto=== The second movement has been associated with the imagery of Orpheus taming the Furies (represented, respectively, by the piano and unison strings) at the gates to Hades, a suggestion of Beethoven's 1859 biographer Adolf Bernhard Marx. The movement's quiet E minor ending leads without pause into the C major chords that open the finale. ===III. Rondo (Vivace)=== In contrast to the preceding movements, the third movement, in traditional rondo form, is simpler, characterized by a very rhythmic theme. The main theme begins in the subdominant key of C major before correcting itself to reach a cadence in the tonic G major. == Cadenzas == Cadenzas for the Fourth Piano Concerto have been written by a number of pianists and composers throughout its history; these include Beethoven himself (two separate sets of cadenzas), Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann, Ferruccio Busoni, Hans von B√ºlow, Ignaz Moscheles, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Anton Rubinstein, Wilhelm Kempff, Nikolai Medtner, Eugen d'Albert, Leopold Godowsky, Wilhelm Backhaus, Samuil Feinberg, Manuel M.

Designed by Marr & Holman Architects, it was built in 1933-34 for $1.5 million. Its location near Union Station was convenient for mail distribution, since most mail at that time was moved by train. By the 1980s, downtown was no longer a good location for postal distribution. When a new main post office was built near the airport in 1986, the historic old facility became a downtown branch using only a small portion of one floor. In the early 1990s Thomas F. Frist, Jr., and his family, through the charitable Frist Foundation, identified the post office building, an example of Art Deco and Stripped Classicism style, as a good location for a proposed downtown art museum. The Foundation implemented a public-private venture between the foundation, the U.S. Postal Service, and the city of Nashville. In 1999 the City of Nashville acquired the building from the U.S. Postal Service for the purpose of creating the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, paying $4.4 million. The city contributed $15 million toward renovating the building, and the Frist Foundation and Frist family contributed $25 million for the renovation and to start an endowment for the art museum. The city owns the building but granted the Frist a 99-year lease for $1 per year. A renovated post office branch was opened in the basement in 1999. The art center opened in April 2001 with approximately of gallery space presenting visual art from local, state and regional artists, as well as major U.S. and international exhibitions. On April 2, 2018, the Frist announced that it changed its name from The Frist Center of the Visual Arts to The Frist Art Museum. The change became legally effective April 1, 2018. The post office branch remains open and has its own separate entrance on the western end of the building. ==Exhibition and program information== As a non-collecting museum, the Frist does not have a permanent collection; rather, the center focuses on creating exhibitions as well as securing traveling exhibitions from around the country and the world. Information regarding past, current and future exhibitions is found on the Frist's website. Each exhibition page contains detailed information about exhibition-related programs and an array of resources, including gallery guides, audio guides, videos and additional information from varying sources. == References == ==External links== * Category:1931 establishments in Tennessee Category:2001 establishments in Tennessee Category:Art Deco architecture in Tennessee Category:Art museums established in 2001 Category:Art museums in Tennessee Category:Arts centers in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1932 Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States Category:Frist family Category:Former post office buildings Category:Museums in Nashville, Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Neoclassical architecture in Tennessee Category:Post office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:PWA Moderne architecture Category:Stripped Classical architecture in the United States ","title":"Frist Art Museum"},{"id":"1431409","text":"Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek (born 28 February 1969 as Eva Glawischnig) is an Austrian politician of the Austrian Green Party, and its federal spokeswoman from 2008 until 2017.

In telecommunication, bipolar encoding is a type of return-to-zero (RZ) line code, where two nonzero values are used, so that the three values are +, ‚àí, and zero. Such a signal is called a duobinary signal. Standard bipolar encodings are designed to be DC-balanced, spending equal amounts of time in the + and ‚àí states. The reason why bipolar encoding is classified as a return to zero (RZ) is that when a bipolar encoded channel is idle the line is held at a constant \\"zero\\" level, and when it is transmitting bits the line is either in a +V or -V state corresponding to the binary bit being transmitted. Thus, the line always returns to the \\"zero\\" level to denote optionally a separation of bits or to denote idleness of the line. == Alternate mark inversion == One kind of bipolar encoding is a paired disparity code, of which the simplest example is alternate mark inversion. In this code, a binary 0 is encoded as zero volts, as in unipolar encoding, whereas a binary 1 is encoded alternately as a positive voltage or a negative voltage. The name arose because, in the context of a T-carrier, a binary '1' is referred to as a \\"mark\\", while a binary '0' is called a \\"space\\".\\"alternate mark inversion (AMI) signal\\", ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000, last updated 28 February 2001, retrieved 25 January 2007 == Voltage Build-up == The use of a bipolar code prevents a significant build-up of DC, as the positive and negative pulses average to zero volts. Little or no DC-component is considered an advantage because the cable may then be used for longer distances and to carry power for intermediate equipment such as line repeaters.\\"T1 Fundamentals\\", Revision 1.0, dated 23 January 1997, by Digital Link, retrieved on 25 January 2007 The DC- component can be easily and cheaply removed before the signal reaches the decoding circuitry. == Synchronization and Zeroes == Bipolar encoding is preferable to non-return-to-zero whenever signal transitions are required to maintain synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. Other systems must synchronize using some form of out-of-band communication, or add frame synchronization sequences that don't carry data to the signal. These alternative approaches require either an additional transmission medium for the clock signal or a loss of performance due to overhead, respectively. A bipolar encoding is an often good compromise: runs of ones will not cause a lack of transitions. However, long sequences of zeroes remain an issue. Long sequences of zero bits result in no transitions and a loss of synchronization. Where frequent transitions are a requirement, a self-clocking encoding such as return-to-zero or some other more complicated line code may be more appropriate, though they introduce significant overhead. The coding was used extensively in first-generation PCM networks, and is still commonly seen on older multiplexing equipment today, but successful transmission relies on no long runs of zeroes being present.\\"All You Wanted to Know About T1 But Were Afraid to Ask\\", Bob Wachtel, retrieved on 25 January 2007 No more than 15 consecutive zeros should ever be sent to ensure synchronization. There are two popular ways to ensure that no more than 15 consecutive zeros are ever sent: robbed-bit signaling and bit stuffing. T-carrier uses robbed-bit signaling: the least-significant bit of the byte is simply forced to a \\"1\\" when necessary. The modification of bit 7 causes a change to voice that is undetectable by the human ear, but it is an unacceptable corruption of a data stream. Data channels are required to use some other form of pulse-stuffing, such as always setting bit 8 to '1', in order to maintain a sufficient density of ones. Of course, this lowers the effective data throughput to 56 kbit/s per channel.Telecom Dictionary, retrieved 25 January 2007 If the characteristics of the input data do not follow the pattern that every eighth bit is '1', the coder using alternate mark inversion adds a '1' after seven consecutive zeros to maintain synchronisation. On the decoder side, this extra '1' added by the coder is removed, recreating the correct data. Using this method the data sent between the coder and the decoder is longer than the original data by less than 1% on average. ==Error detection== Another benefit of bipolar encoding compared to unipolar is error detection. In the T-carrier example, the bipolar signals are regenerated at regular intervals so that signals diminished by distance are not just amplified, but detected and recreated anew. Weakened signals corrupted by noise could cause errors, a mark interpreted as zero, or zero as positive or negative mark. Every single-bit error results in a violation of the bipolar rule. Each such bipolar violation (BPV) is an indication of a transmission error. (The location of BPV is not necessarily the location of the original error). == Other T1 encoding schemes == For data channels, in order to avoid the need of always setting bit 8 to 1, as described above, other T1 encoding schemes (Modified AMI codes) ensure regular transitions regardless of the data being carried. In this way, data throughput of 64 kbit/s per channel is achieved. B8ZS is a newer format for North America, where HDB3 is the original line coding type used in Europe and Japan. A very similar encoding scheme, with the logical positions reversed, is also used and is often referred to as pseudoternary encoding. This encoding is otherwise identical. == Historical Uses == B-MAC, and essentially all family members of the Multiplexed Analogue Components Television Transmission family used Duobinary to encode the digital audio, teletext, closed captioning and selective access for distribution. Because of the way Duobinary was coupled to the NICAM like digital audio subsystems for the MAC family, up to 50% of data reduction was possible in both Stereo and Mono transmission modes. At least with some data transmission systems, duobinary can perform lossless data reduction though this has seldom been utilized in practice. == See also == * MLT-3 encoding * polar encoding == References == Category:Encodings Category:Line codes ","title":"Bipolar encoding"},{"id":"1431414","text":"United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that a criminal prohibition against burning a draft card did not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Though the Court recognized that O'Brien's conduct was expressive as a protest against the Vietnam War, it considered the law justified by a significant government interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and was tailored towards that end. O'Brien upheld the government's power to prosecute what was becoming a pervasive method of anti-war protest. Its greater legacy, however, was its application of a new constitutional standard. The test articulated in O'Brien has been subsequently used by the Court to analyze whether laws that have the effect of regulating speech, though are ostensibly neutral towards the content of that speech, violate the First Amendment. Though the O'Brien test has rarely invalidated laws that the Court has found to be \\"content neutral\\", it has given those engaging in expressive conduct--from wearing of black armbands to burning of flags-- an additional tool to invoke against prohibitions. ==Background of the case== ===Draft cards under the Selective Service Act=== In 1948, the United States instituted a peace-time draft with the Universal Military Training and Service Act (also called the Selective Service Act), which required all male American citizens to register with a local draft board upon reaching the age of 18. In 1965, Congress amended the Act to prohibit the willful destruction of \\"draft cards\\" or registration certificates. These were small white cards bearing the registrant's identifying information, the date and place of registration, and his Selective Service number, which indicated his state of registration, local board, birth year, and his chronological position in the local board's classification record. The Act had already required all eligible men to carry the certificate at all times, and prohibited alterations that would perpetrate a forgery or fraud. The 1965 amendment, however, made it a separate crime under 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 462(b)(3) to \\"knowingly destroy\\" or \\"knowingly mutilate\\" the card. This amendment was passed at a time when public burnings of draft cards to protest the Vietnam War were a growing phenomenon, many observers (including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit) believed that Congress had intentionally targeted such protesters.On the intent behind the amendment, the Court of Appeals wrote, \\"We would be closing our eyes in the light of the prior law if we did not see on the face of the amendment that it was precisely directed at public as distinguished from private destruction. In other words, a special offense was committed by persons such as the defendant who made a spectacle of their disobedience.\\" O'Brien v. United States, 376 F.2d 538, 541 (1st Cir. 1967). ===O'Brien's protest and conviction=== On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their draft cards on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse, in front of a crowd that happened to include several FBI agents. After the four men came under attack from some of the crowd, an FBI agent ushered O'Brien inside the courthouse and advised him of his rights. O'Brien proudly confessed to the agent and produced the charred remains of the certificate. He was subsequently indicted for violating ¬ß 462(b)(3) and put on trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.The facts of O'Brien's protest, arrest, and trial are summarized in the Supreme Court's opinion, United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 369-70 (1968). O'Brien insisted on representing himself at his trial and argued that the Act was unconstitutional. He explained to the jury that he burned the draft card publicly to persuade others to oppose the war, \\"so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position\\". O'Brien was convicted and sentenced to the maximum of six years, as a \\"youth offender\\" under the now-repealed Youth Corrections Act, which submitted him to the custody of the Attorney General \\"for supervision and treatment\\".This provision of the Youth Corrections Act was formerly codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 5010(b). ===Appeal=== On appeal, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 1965 amendment ran afoul of the First Amendment because it singled out \\"persons engaging in protest for special treatment\\".376 F.2d at 541. The court's decision was written by Chief Judge Bailey Aldrich, and joined by Judges McEntee and Coffin. However, although O'Brien could not be convicted for protesting, the First Amendment could not protect him from being required to carry a draft card. The court believed that all the factual issues necessary for a \\"nonpossession\\" conviction had been fully litigated, and so affirmed his conviction on that basis and remanded for appropriate resentencing.Id. at 541-42. Both O'Brien and the United States petitioned for review by the Supreme Court, with the government in United States v. O'Brien (No. 232) challenging the lower court's invalidation of ¬ß 462(b)(3) and O'Brien challenging in the nonpossession conviction in O'Brien v. United States (No. 233).Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold argued the case before the Supreme Court for the United States; he was joined on the brief by Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jr. (the son of the late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson), Assistant Solicitor General Francis X. Beytagh, Jr., and Dept. of Justice Attorneys Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit. Marvin M. Karpatkin, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, argued for O'Brien. The Court decided both actions together and, in a 7‚Äì1 decision, upheld the constitutionality of ¬ß 462(b)(3), vacated the First Circuit's decision and reinstated O'Brien's sentence. O'Brien had also argued to the Court that the First Circuit had unconstitutionally sustained his conviction for a crime of which he was neither convicted nor tried, and much of the Court's questioning of the government during oral argument challenged this ruling. However, with that decision vacated, the Court did not reach that issue. ==Supreme Court's decision== Chief Justice Warren's decision for the Court rejected O'Brien's argument that the 1965 amendment to ¬ß 462(b)(3) was only passed to stifle the speech of anti-war protesters. The law did not restrict speech on its face, but instead only addressed conduct that was not necessarily expressive, and applied without regard to whether the draft card was destroyed in private or before an audience. It also did not matter to the Court if Congress had passed it with the intention of stifling protest, as long as it could be justified on another basis; Chief Justice Warren declared that \\"this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive\\".391 U.S. at 383. Despite finding that ¬ß 462(b)(3) only prohibited conduct, the Court continued its First Amendment inquiry to determine whether the rule was unduly restrictive of the element of O'Brien's conduct that was expressive. The Court plainly questioned whether this communicative element was \\"sufficient to bring into play the First Amendment\\" in O'Brien's case, and so this portion of the Court‚Äôs opinion was effectively hypothetical musing.391 U.S. at 376. Nevertheless, Justice Harlan, in his concurring opinion, recognized this as the \\"crux\\" of the Court‚Äôs decision.391 U.S. at 388. Warren wrote that when a regulation prohibits conduct that combines \\"speech\\" and \\"nonspeech\\" elements, \\"a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms\\". The regulation must # be within the constitutional power of the government to enact, # further an important or substantial government interest, # that interest must be unrelated to the suppression of speech (or \\"content neutral\\", as later cases have phrased it), and # prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest. The Court ruled that ¬ß 462(b)(3) satisfied this test.391 U.S. at 376-77. First, the law was, to the Court, unquestionably within the \\"broad and sweeping\\" constitutional powers of Congress under Article I to \\"raise and support armies\\" by \\"classify[ing] and conscript[ing] manpower for military service\\". Under the second prong of the test, the issuance of registration certificates was regarded as a \\"legitimate and substantial administrative aid\\" in the functioning of the draft system, as were laws that insured the \\"continuing availability\\" of issued draft cards. The Court rejected O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs characterization of the draft cards as nothing more than a superfluous notification of registration. Instead, the cards advanced \\"the smooth and proper functioning of the system\\" through functions such as providing proof of registration, facilitating contact between the registrant and draft board, reminding the registrant of the need to notify the board of changes of address, and further preventing fraud or forgery. Third, the registration and raising of troops was unrelated to the suppression of speech. And fourth, the Court saw \\"no alternative means\\" by which the government could ensure that draft cards would continue to be available than a law that prohibited their willful destruction. Both the government‚Äôs interest and ¬ß 462(b)(3), Warren wrote, \\"are limited to the noncommunicative aspect of O'Brien's conduct. The governmental interest and the scope of the 1965 Amendment are limited to preventing harm to the smooth and efficient functioning of the Selective Service System. When O'Brien deliberately rendered unavailable his registration certificate, he willfully frustrated this governmental interest. For this noncommunicative impact of his conduct, and for nothing else, he was convicted.\\"391 U.S. at 381-82. ===Harlan's concurrence=== Justice Harlan, though joining Warren's opinion, wrote a brief separate concurrence.391 U.S. at 388-89 (Harlan, J., concurring). Harlan wished to extend First Amendment protection to instances in which, though the majority's test was satisfied, the regulation at issue additionally had \\"the effect of entirely preventing a ‚Äòspeaker‚Äô from reaching a significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate\\". This was adopted in later cases by the Court as an additional prong of the O‚ÄôBrien test, that the regulation must leave (as phrased in later decisions) \\"ample alternative channels\\" of communication. As Harlan felt that O‚ÄôBrien had other means by which he could communicate his message, he had no problem affirming his conviction. ===Douglas's dissent=== Justice Douglas was the sole dissenter.391 U.S. at 389-91 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Though he did not express disagreement with the Court's First Amendment analysis, he believed that the asserted government interest was only valid when the nation was in a state of war as declared by Congress (which had not been the case since World War II). Douglas questioned whether a peacetime draft was even constitutional, and wanted to reschedule O'Brien for reargument along with two cases challenging the draft that were denied review by the Court the same day O'Brien was handed down,Holmes v. United States, 391 U.S. 936, and Hart v. United States, 391 U.S. 956. even though the parties in O'Brien had not presented arguments or briefs on that issue. ==Subsequent developments== ===Vietnam War protests and developments in the draft=== As the Vietnam War became more unpopular, the draft became more of a focal point for opposition and, despite O'Brien, public protests involving the burning of draft cards proliferated. Though the Court has not revisited this specific issue, the Court ruled for other anti-war protesters very soon after O'Brien in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District,Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969) which involved public school students who were suspended for wearing black armbands, and Cohen v. California, in which a man was convicted for disturbing the peace by wearing a jacket that read \\"Fuck the Draft\\" in a state courthouse.. Due in part to increasing domestic opposition, the United States reduced its involvement in Vietnam and completed withdrawal of its forces in 1973; the draft ended the same year. On January 21, 1977, the day after his inauguration, President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 11967, which granted a full pardon to anyone who had committed or been convicted of a non-violent violation of the Selective Service Act.Executive Order 11967 --Relating to violations of the Selective Service Act, August 4, 1964 to March 28, 1973. This included everyone from draft dodgers to protestors such as O'Brien. The pardon covered all such acts committed between August 4, 1964, the date of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, and March 28, 1973, the end of American withdrawal. In 1980, however, Congress reinstated the requirement that young men register with the Selective Service System, but without reinstating an active draft. In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld the registration requirement against a claim that it violated the privilege against self-incrimination.. The following year, it upheld the conviction of a man who refused to register despite his argument that this refusal constituted a political protest.. , male citizens (and many male noncitizen residents) between the ages of 18 to 25 are still required to register for preparation should a military draft be reinstated. The same provision in ¬ß 462(b)(3) of the Act under which O'Brien was convicted remains law, though destroying draft cards is no longer a common form of protest and recent arrests for that offense are unknown. ===Subsequent First Amendment decisions=== For a few years following O'Brien, the decision was primarily cited to by the Court for the proposition that an illicit legislative motive would not render a law unconstitutional.See, e.g., . Finally, in 1972, the Court relied in part on O'Brien to invalidate a law that prohibited picketing outside public schools that was not related to a labor dispute. Quoting O'Brien, the Court held that the law \\"imposes a selective restriction on expressive conduct far 'greater than is essential to the furtherance of [a substantial governmental] interest'\\". (internal marks in original). Two years later, the Court declared in Spence v. Washington that the O'Brien test was \\"inapplicable\\" when the asserted government interest \\"directly related to expression in the context of activity\\".Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 415 n.8 (1974). Spence ruled that a man who displayed an American flag with a peace symbol taped to it was engaging in protected expression; in 1989, the Court similarly upheld the right to burn the American flag as expressive conduct in Texas v. Johnson.. The Court revisited the necessary fit between the important governmental interest and the means to actualize that interest in Clark v. C.C.N.V., 468 U.S. 288 (1984), in which it held that the nexus need merely be reasonable. The Court also merged its doctrine of time-place-manner restrictions and the O'Brien test into an intermediate scrutiny hybrid. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 391 *Conscription in the United States *Opposition to the Vietnam War *Symbolic speech ==Notes== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * First Amendment Library entry on United States v.

Girls who reached the upper age limit were transferred to the Ravensbr√ºck women's camp. Camp administration was provided by the Ravensbr√ºck camp.

Guest stars in season four include S√¥nia Braga, Joel Grey, Michael McKean, Lena Olin, Isabella Rossellini . Speaking of the previous season, J.J. Abrams said: \\"We weren't as true to the characters. They became pawns in a plot-driven story.\\" He described the season as a year of \\"reinvention\\", which refocused on relationships. Unlike all other seasons of the series, the fourth season aired entirely during the latter half of the American television season, allowing for a more continuous run. Only one Wednesday evening (February 2) was skipped in this run, so as not to coincide with the 2005 State of the Union Address from President George W. Bush. The scheduling shift for the fourth season was prompted by displacement of the series from its previous time slot (Sundays 9:00 p.m. ET/8:00 p.m. CT), due to the success of Alias' fall replacement ‚Äî season one of Desperate Housewives. ABC's other notable new series from the season, Lost, became the lead-in program for Alias. A new night, new lead-in, and noticeable lack of weeks without new episode broadcasts are thought to have contributed to some of the series' best overall ratings during its five-season run. ==Cast== Main characters * Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow (22 episodes) * Ron Rifkin as Arvin Sloane (21 episodes) * Michael Vartan as Michael Vaughn (22 episodes) * Carl Lumbly as Marcus Dixon (20 episodes) * Kevin Weisman as Marshall Flinkman (21 episodes) * M√≠a Maestro as Nadia Santos (21 episodes) * Greg Grunberg as Eric Weiss (20 episodes) * Victor Garber as Jack Bristow (22 episodes) Recurring characters == Episodes == ==Home release== The 6-DVD box set of Season 4 was released in region 1 format (US) on October 25, 2005, in region 2 format (UK) on November 21, 2005 and in region 4 format (AU) on January 16, 2006.

He has been identified as the High Priest of Amun Takelot F, son of the High Priest of Amun Nimlot C at Thebes and, thus, the son of Nimlot C and grandson of king Osorkon II according to the latest academic research.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Historische Probleme Der 3.

As Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton write in their comprehensive book on the royal families of Ancient Egypt: > Takelot II is likely to have been identical with the High Priest Takelot F, > who is stated in [the] Karnak inscriptions to have been a son of Nimlot C, > and whose likely period of office falls neatly just before Takelot II's > appearance.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of > Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, (2004), p. 224 Takelot II rather ruled a separate kingdom that embraced Middle and Upper Egypt, distinct from the Tanite Twenty-second Dynasty which only controlled Lower Egypt. Takelot F, the son and successor of the High Priest of Amun Nimlot C, served for a period of time under Osorkon II as a High Priest of Amun before he proclaimed himself as king Takelot II in the final three regnal years of Osorkon II. This situation is attested by the relief scenes on the walls of Temple J at Karnak which was dedicated by Takelot F - in his position as High Priest - to Osorkon II, who is depicted as the celebrant and king.Aston (1989), p. 147 All the documents which mention Takelot II Si-Ese and his son, Osorkon B, originate from either Middle or Upper Egypt (none from Lower Egypt) and a royal tomb at Tanis which named a king Hedjkheperre Setepenre Takelot along with a Year 9 stela from Bubastis are now recognised as belonging exclusively to Takelot I. While both Takelot I and II used the same prenomen, Takelot II added the epithet Si-Ese (\\"Son of Isis\\") to his royal titulary both to affiliate himself with Thebes and to distinguish his name from Takelot I. ==The Crown Prince Osorkon== temple of Ptah at Karnak.Henri Gauthier, Le Livre des rois d'√âgypte, recueil de titres et protocoles royaux, 3, De la XIXe √† la XXIVe dynastie, MIFAO 19, Cairo 1914, p. 354. Takelot II controlled Middle and Upper Egypt during the final 3 Years of Osorkon II and the first 2 decades of Shoshenq III. The majority of Egyptologists today concede that king Osorkon III was the illustrious \\"Crown Prince and High Priest Osorkon B,\\" son of Takelot II. A misunderstanding arose over his identity because in the Crown Prince's famous Chronicle, which was carved on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak, Osorkon dates his actions by both the regnal years of Takelot II (years 11 through 24) ‚Äì with a short year 25 left unmentioned ‚Äì and then by those of the Tanite king, Shoshenq III (from regnal years 22 through 29).Aston (1989), p. 143 While Kenneth Kitchen has interpreted this to mean that Shoshenq III succeeded Takelot II at Tanis, in fact Takelot II and Shoshenq III were likely close contemporaries because immediately after the death of his father in year 25 of Takelot II, Osorkon B started dating his activities to year 22, and not year 1, of Shoshenq III onwards. Consequently, there was never a two decade long break in Osorkon B's struggle to regain control of Thebes (from Year 1 to Year 22 of Sheshonq III) as Kitchen's chronology implies because year 25 of Takelot II is equivalent to year 22 of Sheshonq III.Aston, (1989), pp. 143 and 148‚Äì149 Osorkon B did not immediately ascend to his father's throne presumably because he was involved in a prolonged civil war with his rival Pedubast I and, later, Shoshenq VI, for control of Thebes. Instead, he merely dated his activities to the serving Dynasty 22 Pharaoh at Tanis: Shoshenq III. The Crown Prince Osorkon B was not outmaneuvered to the throne of Tanis by Shoshenq III because both men ruled over separate kingdoms with the 22nd Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt, and Takelot II/Osorkon B ruling over most of Upper Egypt from Herakleopolis Magna to Thebes, where they are monumentally attested. In 1983, a donation stela was discovered by Japanese excavators (Heian Museum 1983) at Tehna which reveals that Osorkon III was once a High Priest of Amun himself.* [article language is English] This person can only be the well-known High Priest Osorkon B since no other Theban High Priests named Osorkon are known until the reign of Takelot III half a century later when the latter's son Osorkon F served in this office.Kitchen, Kenneth (1996). The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100‚Äì650 BC), 3rd edition (Warminster: Aris & Phillips), pp. 565 & 581 ==Theban Uprising and Conflict== In Year 11 of Takelot II, an insurrection began under Pedubast I whose followers challenged this king's authority at Thebes. Takelot reacted by dispatching his son, Osorkon B, to sail southwards to Thebes and quell the uprising. Osorkon B succeeded in retaining control of the city and then proclaimed himself as the new High Priest of Amun. Some of the rebels' bodies were deliberately burned by Osorkon to permanently deny their souls any hope of an afterlife. However, just four years later, in year 15 of Takelot II, a second major revolt broke out and this time Osorkon B's forces were expelled from Thebes by Pedubast I. This caused a prolonged period of turmoil and instability in Upper Egypt as a prolonged struggle broke out between the competing factions of Takelot II/Osorkon B and Pedubast I/Shoshenq VI for control of Thebes. This conflict would last for 27 long years - from Year 15 to Year 25 of Takelot II and then from Year 22 to Year 39 of Shoshenq III when Osorkon B finally defeated his enemies and conquered this great city. Osorkon B proclaimed himself as king Osorkon III sometime after his victory. On other matters, the Chronicle of Prince Osorkon B, which is carved on the Bubastis Portal at Karnak, records Osorkon's activities between regnal years 11 and 24 of his father and then from regnal years 22 through 29 of Shoshenq III. However, Takelot II's brief 25th year is attested by a donation stela made by his son in his position as High Priest at Thebes shortly before Takelot died; it granted 35 aurourae of land to Takelot II's daughter, Karomama E.Broekman, (2005), p.30 Papyrus Berlin 3048 has also now been conclusively dated to Takelot II's (and not Takelot III's) reign due to the attestation of a certain Harsiese‚Äîdesignated the fourth prophet of Amun‚Äîin this document who is known to have served in office during king Takelot II's reign.Fr√©d√©ric Payraudeau, Takeloth III: Considerations on Old and New Documents in 'The Libyan Period in Egypt.'

They had a son: * Nimlot, mentioned on a wooden stela (Turin 1468/Vatican 329) as the son of King Takelot and Tashep[...]. Thought to be a son of Takelot II.

Harry features jazz saxophonist Tom Scott, pianist Mike Melvoin, flutist Jim Horn, session drummer Jim Gordon, Larry Knechtel on bass, and David Cohen and Howard Roberts on guitars. The album has not one distinctive style but ranges over ballads, show tunes, nostalgic Americana, and tin pan alley-like soft shoe numbers. William E.

Nora Ephron would use Harry's own version for the opening credits of her 1998 film, You've Got Mail. Kenny Loggins covered it on his 2009 album All Join In. Others have covered \\"The Puppy Song\\" as well: David Cassidy sang a cover of it and took it to a UK #1 as a double A-side single with the song \\"Daydreamer\\"; Victoria Williams covered it on For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson ‚Äì a tribute album released in 1995; Astrud Gilberto performed a bossa nova lounge version on 2001's The Girl From Ipanema; and 70's Australian pop group New World released their cover on their Best of... album in 2002. ===Open Your Window=== Ella Fitzgerald covered this song on her album Ella, released in 1969, the same year as Harry. She also performed it live on Ella Fitzgerald in Budapest, recorded in May 1970. Louis Bellson recorded a cover for his 1975 album, The Louis Bellson Explosion. In 1973, The 5th Dimension recorded the song for their album Living Together, Growing Together. ===Mother Nature's Son=== The Beatles once referred to this recording as their favorite Beatles cover song. ===Mournin' Glory Story=== This song, about a homeless woman's confusion and misery, has been covered by Melanie Safka, Bobby Graham, Jennifer Trynin, Jiffipop, and Al Kooper. ===Maybe=== Barbra Streisand covered this song on her 1971 album Stoney End. Karen Akers recorded a medley of \\"Maybe\\" and \\"Nevertheless, I'm in Love With You\\" on her 1990 album, In a Very Unusual Way. Richard Barnes recorded a cover for his only album, Richard Barnes, released in 1970. ===Marchin' Down Broadway=== This song is based on a song written by Bette Nilsson, Harry's mother. ===I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City=== Nilsson wrote this song for the film Midnight Cowboy. Director John Schlesinger had been using Nilsson's cover of Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" as an example of the kind of song he wanted on the final soundtrack but then decided not to replace it. If \\"I Guess the Lord ...\\" had been included, it would have been eligible for an Oscar, as it was an original song. Harry Nilsson did win a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\", however. \\"I Guess the Lord ...\\" was used in a film ‚Äì 1971's La Mortadella (US title: Lady Liberty), starring Sophia Loren. In 1969 a popular cover version of the song was released in UK by Eternal Triangle on the Decca Label. Sin√©ad O'Connor recorded a cover of the song for the film You've Got Mail, but director Nora Ephron decided to use Nilsson's original. O'Connor's version appears on the soundtrack album. Mac DeMarco also recorded a cover of this song for the debut Makeout Videotape Ep Heat Wave. ===Rainmaker=== Co-written with William \\"Bill\\" Martin in 1968, this song has been covered by The Cryan Shames (non-album, 1969), Tom Northcott (#38 Canada 1970), Michael Nesmith (Nevada Fighter, 1971) and The 5th Dimension (Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes, 1971). Country group the Wright Brothers Band did a medley of this song together with \\"Dawson\\", in both studio and live versions, on the albums Cornfield Cowboys and Memorabila Box. The song charted for folk/rock singer Tom Northcott in Canada in 1970. It also appeared on Valdy's debut album Country Man in 1972. ===Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear=== This is a cover of a song written by Randy Newman and popularized by the Alan Price Set. The song also appeared on an episode of The Muppet Show, performed by Fozzie Bear and Scooter. Nilsson was impressed by Newman's talents and his next album was Nilsson Sings Newman, ten covers of songs by Newman, with Newman on piano and Nilsson doing vocals. In 2000, BMG released a combined CD of Harry and Nilsson Sings Newman. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Harry Nilsson, except where noted.

In his work Germania, Tacitus describes them as using black shields and painting their bodies (\\"nigra scuta, tincta corpora\\"), and attacking at night as a shadowy army, much to the terror of their opponents. Theories have been proposed connecting the Harii to the einherjar, ghostly warriors in service to the god Odin, attested much later among the North Germanic peoples by way of Norse mythology, and to the tradition of the Wild Hunt, a procession of the dead through the winter night sky sometimes led by Odin. ==Germania== Regarding the Harii, Tacitus writes in Germania: > As for the Harii, quite apart from their strength, which exceeds that of the > other tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by > skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark > nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they > cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so unexpected and hellish; in > every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.Orchard (1997:36). ==Theories== According to John Lindow, Andy Orchard, and Rudolf Simek connections are commonly drawn between the Harii and the Einherjar of Norse mythology; those that have died and gone to Valhalla ruled over by the god Odin, preparing for the events of Ragnar√∂k.Lindow (2001:104‚Äì105).Simek (2007:71). See also discussion on the Odinic name Herjann in Simek (2007:143). Lindow says that regarding the theorized connection between the Harii and the Einherjar, \\"many scholars think there may be basis for the myth in an ancient Odin cult, which would be centered on young warriors who entered into an ecstatic relationship with Odin\\" and that the name Harii has been etymologically connected to the -herjar element of einherjar. Simek says that since the connection has become widespread, \\"one tends to interpret these obviously living armies of the dead as religiously motivated bands of warriors, who led to the formation of the concept of the einherjar as well as the Wild Hunt\\". ==See also== * Einherjar ==Notes== ==References== *Lindow, John (2001).

It was tall and from 1864 to 1877 the tallest building in Manchester. Widely admired, it has been referred to as one of Britain's 'lost buildings'. ==History== Illustration of the Assize Courts from Charles Eastlake's History of the Gothic Revival The Assize Courts was the first civic building to be constructed in Manchester after the town hall on King Street by Francis Goodwin in 1819. The Builder described it as the most important building outside Whitehall.Parkinson-Bailey (2000), p 100. Its design was the result of a competition in 1858 that attracted more than 100 entries. The competition was won by Alfred Waterhouse whose design beat schemes from other renowned architects such as Thomas Worthington and Edward Walters. Waterhouse designed the building in the Venetian Gothic style; construction began in 1859 and was completed in 1864. The nearby 1862 Strangeways Prison was included in his design as part of the scheme; it is currently a Grade II listed structure. The building contained exterior sculptures by Thomas Woolner and the firm of O'Shea and Whelan. They depicted lawgivers from history, along with a \\"drunk woman\\", a \\"good woman\\", a scene of the Judgment of Solomon and carvings depicting different punishments throughout history. As part of the court system changes, the assize court system in Manchester was abolished in 1956 and changed to the Crown Court system. The courts building was severely damaged in the Manchester Blitz in 1940 and 1941. It was said that everything was destroyed except the Great Ducie Street facade and the judges' lodgings.Parkinson-Bailey (2000), p. 102 Some war-damaged buildings in the city were repaired, but Manchester Assize Courts was demolished in 1957, soon after the assize court abolition.

Penne is the plural form of the Italian penna (meaning feather but pen as well), deriving from Latin penna (meaning \\"feather\\" or \\"quill\\"), and is a cognate of the English word pen. When this format was created, it was intended to imitate the then- ubiquitous fountain pen's steel nibs. ==Origins== Penne are one of the few pasta shapes with a certain date of birth: in 1865, Giovanni Battista Capurro, a pasta maker from San Martino d'Albaro (Genoa), obtained a patent for a diagonal cutting machine. His invention cut the fresh pasta into a pen shape without crushing it, in a size varying between mezze penne (half pens) and penne (pens). ==Description and variations== In Italy, penne are produced in two main variants \\"penne lisce (smooth) and \\"penne rigate (furrowed), the latter having ridges on each penna. Pennoni (\\"big quills\\") is a wider version of penne. A slightly larger version called mostaccioli (meaning \\"little mustache\\" in some Italian dialects) can also be found, which can also be either smooth or ridged in texture. Penne is traditionally cooked al dente and its shape makes it particularly adapted for sauces, such as pesto, marinara, or arrabbiata. The latter has been celebrated several times in Italian movies, notably in Marco Ferrari's La Grande Bouffe and Federico Fellini's Roma. In the Trenton, New Jersey area, penne pasta is called \\"pencil points\\" due to its shape. ==See also== * List of pasta ==References== Category:Types of pasta ","title":"Penne"},{"id":"1431471","text":"Simon J. \\"Bobby\\" Engram III (born January 7, 1973) is a retired American football wide receiver and current Tight Ends coach for the Baltimore Ravens. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 1996 NFL Draft. He played college football at Penn State. Engram also played for the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs. ==Early years== Engram was born to Simon and Dorothy Engram. He attended Camden High School in Camden, South Carolina, where he was a three-time All-State selection at wide receiver. In 1991, Engram's father died in an automobile accident. ==College career== As a college junior, Engram was the go-to receiver on Penn State's undefeated 1994 team. Wearing #10, he was quarterback Kerry Collins' favorite target. He garnered All-American honors and won the first-ever Biletnikoff Award, recognizing the nation's best wide receiver. Engram was the Nittany Lions' career receptions leader until 2008, when Deon Butler passed his mark of 167. He is still the all-time leader in yards and touchdowns with 3,026 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also racked up 786 career punt return yards for the Nittany Lions, ranking him second in school history. Engram missed the 1992 season as punishment from head-coach Joe Paterno, when he was charged with being involved in a college apartment burglary with teammate Ricky Sayles. Sayles and Engram went into an apartment and removed a stereo. However, the police investigation assumed that Sayles was the instigator behind the burglary and Engram may have been led to believe that he and Sayles were authorized to take the stereo. Consequently, Engram was allowed to complete a pre-trial diversionary program and the charges were later dropped. Sayles, on the other hand, was permanently dismissed from the team. He earned a Bachelor of Science in exercise science from Penn State in 1995. ==NFL career== ===Chicago Bears=== Engram was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1996 NFL Draft, 52nd overall to the Chicago Bears. In his rookie season, he had 33 receptions for 389 yards and 6 touchdown catches. He also returned kicks. In 1999, he had his first 10-reception game in week 15 with 10 receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown, following this with a franchise-record 13 receptions 143 yards and two touchdowns.Bobby Engram game log The following season, he had just 16 receptions in three games before injury ended his 5 seasons with the Bears. ===Seattle Seahawks=== Engram signed with the Seattle Seahawks before the 2001 season. He would spend 8 seasons with the Seahawks and reached the 1,000-yard receiving threshold in 2007 (94 catches, 1,147 yards), which was the only 1,000-yard season of his career. Despite being a starter in only 67 of the 109 games he played with Seattle, Engram ranks fifth in franchise history in receptions (399) and fourth in receiving yards (4,859). His 94 receptions in 2007 is a Seahawks single-season record, and he led the team in catches during the team's Super Bowl XL season in 2005 with 67. Engram was named to the Seahawks‚Äô 35th Anniversary Team in May 2011. ===Kansas City Chiefs=== Engram joined the Kansas City Chiefs in 2009, but only played in 5 games for the team. ===Cleveland Browns=== Engram signed with the Cleveland Browns in the 2010 preseason, but failed to make the roster and was released before the regular season began. ===Retirement, coaching career=== On January 28, 2011, Engram announced that he had retired from the NFL as a player, but that he had accepted a job as an offensive assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers. In 2012, it was announced that Engram would become the wide receivers coach for the Pittsburgh Panthers.http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/spec- rel/012712aab.html On February 6, 2014, the Ravens announced Engram as their new wide receivers coach. On January 11, 2018 the Ravens announced Engram as their tight ends coach. ==Personal life== Engram and his wife Deanna have four children, one of whom was born with sickle-cell disease and died in 2018. In October 2006, Engram was diagnosed with Graves' disease. His subsequent accelerated heart rate, debilitating fatigue, and weight loss caused him to miss a significant amount of playing time during the 2006 season. When playing games in the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Engram laced his shoes with white shoelaces as opposed to the regular black as a tribute to the old-school beliefs of his college coach, Joe Paterno.\\"Healthy Engram plans to keep playing\\" , The Patriot-News, October 10, 2007 ==References== ==External links== *Kansas City Chiefs bio *Seattle Seahawks bio *Hired by 49ers Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Ravens coaches Category:Pittsburgh Panthers football coaches Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:People from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:American football wide receivers Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:San Francisco 49ers coaches Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football coaches ","title":"Bobby Engram"},{"id":"1431476","text":"Nilsson Sings Newman is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, released in February 1970 on RCA Victor. It features songs written by Randy Newman. Recorded over six weeks in late 1969, the album showcases Nilsson's voice multi-tracked in layers of tone and harmony. Its arrangements are otherwise sparse, with most of the instrumentation provided by Newman on piano. The record was not a great commercial success, but won a 1970 \\"Record of the Year\\" award from Stereo Review magazine. The LP record cover art was illustrated by Dean Torrence. ==Background== Randy Newman in 1975 In 1968, Ricky Nelson released his concept album Perspective, a move to expand his musical horizons. The album included songs by Newman, Nilsson and others woven together to tell the story of the interactions of a famous family; author Kevin Courrier writes that this album may have been part of the inspiration for Nilsson Sings Newman. In August 1969, Nilsson released his fourth album Harry. It ended with one of Newman's songs: \\"Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear\\". Years later, Nilsson told Paul Zollo that he was in awe of Newman writing so many songs, ones he thought were better than his own. ==Recording== On August 20, 1969, Nilsson and Newman began to record what would become Nilsson Sings Newman. After basic tracks were laid down, Nilsson spent six weeks overdubbing his voice to create layers and harmonies, line by line. As many as 118 overdubs were laid down for a single song. Nilsson occasionally broke the fourth wall in his performance. His voice in the control room is heard on several songs, instructing the recording engineer to add more echo or remove a voice. On the album's final song \\"So Long Dad\\", amid a multi-Nilsson chorus of voices, Nilsson softly asks for \\"more first voice.\\" Louder, he counters himself by saying \\"actually I need more current voice. Forget the one that's saying 'more first voice. Besides piano, other instruments were sometimes used in the studio, including bass drum, tambourine and various electronic keyboards. On the song \\"Cowboy\\", Nilsson used electronic harpsichord to bring in a different concluding theme, quoting John Barry's theme from the film Midnight Cowboy, an inside joke that referenced Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" from the same film, a major success for Nilsson earlier that year. A number of alternate takes and songs were recorded but left off the 1970 album. Two such songs were \\"Snow\\" and \\"Linda\\". Newman wrote one song specifically for the album: \\"Caroline\\", a straightforward love song. According to Nilsson, Newman was \\"tired of the album when we were finished making it. ... For him it was just doing piano and voice ... over and over.\\" He explained that \\"once I got the take down, I knew what I was going to do with it later. He didn't.\\" Newman said of his experience that he \\"was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs. ... he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do‚Äîlike hold a note.\\" ==Release == In February 1970, Nilsson Sings Newman was released by RCA Records. The cover art was drawn by Dean Torrence; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old American car through the countryside with Newman in the back seat. Sales of the album were underwhelming. Courrier speculates that this was possibly because of the \\"idiosyncratic quality\\" of its ballads and the paucity of reviews. Newman said in an interview how he personally went to assess the sales of the album at a record store in Los Angeles. He asked a clerk (who did not recognize him) \\"do you have any Nilsson albums?\\" The clerk guided Newman through each one, describing its sales and whether he recommended it; he came to Nilsson Sings Newman and said, \\"this is the one that nearly finished him off.\\" Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau awarded the album a B+ and wrote: \\"For those benighted who still believe the original can't sing, here's a sweeter version, including appropriately lovely versions of two rare urban celebrations--'Vine Street' ... and 'Dayton, Ohio 1903.' Not so dynamic musically, though--just Nilsson singing, and Newman behind on piano.\\" The audio equipment and record review magazine Stereo Review named Nilsson Sings Newman their album of the year. The weekly magazine Cue in New York praised the artistry saying that \\"Nilsson was dealing with material as powerful as his own, but was free to concentrate entirely on his gifts as a performer.\\" Cue said that the album was free of the \\"overwhelmingly complex\\" personal expressions that came earlier from \\"Nilsson singing Nilsson, and Newman singing Newman\\". ==Legacy== Here Comes Inspiration, a 1974 album by Paul Williams, begins with a 54-second track called \\"Nilsson Sings Newman\\". In 1993, Newman prepared to record an entire album of Nilsson songs, a returning of the favor 25 years later. Newman had never before recorded a Nilsson song. After Nilsson's death in January 1994, the intended homage became a memorial, titled For The Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson. To leave room for participation by other artists, Newman sang only one song, \\"Remember (Christmas)\\", a sad and dreamy tune which opened the album. Newman said, \\"I just hope Harry knew how great he was. He was always putting himself down, making fun of himself.\\" Nilsson Sings Newman was re- released as a CD in 1995. In 2000, the 30th anniversary release was padded with five additional tracks. One was \\"Snow\\", unreleased in 1970 for lack of room on the LP, and four were alternate versions of songs that were on the original album. In 2000, Ben Wener of The Orange County Register wrote that \\"Newman's sly, dramatically structured impressionistic pop was ideally suited for Nilsson's theatrical tone ... It's not so much that Nilsson's takes are better than Newman's ... just refreshingly different‚Äîless wicked and vicious, more melancholy.\\" Artists who have expressed a fondness for the album include Rufus Wainwright, Joanna Newsom, Ron Sexsmith, Jellyfish, Adrian Belew, and Shane Tutmarc. AllMusic wrote of Nilsson Sings Newman as \\"a subtle, graceful masterpiece where the pleasure is in the grace notes, small gestures, and in- jokes,\\" and that once a listener has acquired a taste for Newman's idiosyncratic songs, \\"is as sweet as honey.\\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Harry Nilsson ‚Äì vocals, additional instruments *Randy Newman ‚Äì piano, electronic keyboards The credits give \\"special thanks to George Tipton and Lenny Waronker\\". ==References== Category:Harry Nilsson albums Category:Randy Newman albums Category:1970 albums Category:RCA Victor albums Category:Collaborative albums Category:Tribute albums Category:Albums with cover art by Dean Torrence ","title":"Nilsson Sings Newman"},{"id":"1431478","text":"Minicom running a Windows 2003 EMS prompt Minicom is a text-based modem control and terminal emulator program for Unix-like operating systems, originally written by Miquel van Smoorenburg, and modeled after the popular MS-DOS program Telix.

He played the majority of his career with the San Diego Chargers and retired after the 2012 season. Playing college football for the Iowa Hawkeyes, Kaeding earned All-American honors and won the Lou Groza Award, given annually to the top collegiate kicker in the nation. The Chargers drafted him in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He was twice named to the Pro Bowl, and he was a two-time All-Pro selection. However, he struggled in the playoffs, making just 8 of 15 (53.3%) field goals. He was released by San Diego midway through the 2012 season after a groin injury. He finished the season with the Miami Dolphins before retiring. He is currently a kicking consultant for the Minnesota Vikings. ==Early years== Kaeding was born in Iowa City, Iowa. He attended Iowa City West High School, and played high school football for the Iowa City West High Trojans. He won two state championships as the team's kicker, and The Des Moines Register named him Iowa High School Athlete of the Year in 2000. In high school, he played in state championship games in three different sports: (basketball, football and soccer) at Iowa City West High School. ==College career== Kaeding attended the University of Iowa, where he played for the Hawkeyes from 2000 to 2003. Kaeding earned a teaching certificate in secondary education while at Iowa. He won the Lou Groza Award in 2002 and is the all- time leading scorer. ==Professional career== ===San Diego Chargers=== During the 2004 season, Kaeding attempted to become the first rookie since the 1970 season to make a game-winning field goal in the playoffs in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter or in overtime. His 40-yard field goal attempt on a wet field missed, and the Chargers lost in the wild card round to the New York Jets, who won the game on a Doug Brien field goal. Kaeding's postseason struggles continued in the 2006 NFL Playoffs, when he missed a potential game tying 54-yard field goal attempt against the New England Patriots. He had not missed a field goal at home in the previous two years prior to that 54-yard attempt. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl that season, where he kicked the game-winning 21-yard field goal with four seconds left in the game. Kaeding suffered a fractured fibula when he made a tackle on the opening kickoff against the Denver Broncos on December 24, 2007 and played the final 5 games of the season with the fractured fibula. Kaeding in 2008 In the 2007 playoffs, Kaeding missed a field goal each in the Wild Card weekend game against Tennessee (which San Diego won) and against the Indianapolis Colts (which San Diego also won). His streak of consecutive playoff games with a missed field goal stood at 4 but was ended with a made field goal from 40 yards against New England. In 2009, Kaeding was tied for the NFL lead for most field goals made (32) and was one of only four to covert on over 90% of his attempts (91.4%). His season long of 54 yards came in a Week 15 victory over Cincinnati Bengals. However, in the AFC Divisional Round against the New York Jets, Kaeding's postseason struggles continued as he missed all three of his attempted field goals, from 36, 57, and 40 yards; the Chargers lost the game 17‚Äì14. His three misses in the game were a career-high and matched his entire total from the regular season. In his postseason career, Kaeding was 3-for-9 on field goal attempts at home and 8-for-15 (53.3%) overall in eight playoff games. In 2011, Kaeding was injured on the first play of the season when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament, causing him to miss the duration of the season and necessitated the signing of Nick Novak. Kaeding ended the 2011 season as the NFL‚Äôs most accurate kicker of all-time, converting 86.5% of his field goals attempts. He competed for his job in 2012 and beat out Novak, who also had a strong showing. However, Kaeding suffered a right groin injury and was replaced by Novak in the week 4 game against Kansas City. After missing three games, Kaeding was placed on injured reserve with a minor injury designation that required the Chargers to release him after he recovered. On October 30, Kaeding became an unrestricted free agent after he was released by the Chargers upon a physical; he collected over $1 million in termination pay. Kaeding made all seven of his field goal attempts with the Chargers in 2012, and left the team as the most accurate kicker in NFL history at 87% (180-of-207). ===Miami Dolphins=== On December 21, 2012, Kaeding signed with the Miami Dolphins, replacing incumbent Dan Carpenter, who was out with a groin injury. He missed two of three field goals as a Dolphin, making a 45-yard attempt while missing from 41 and having a 46-yard attempt blocked. His career percentage dropped to 86.2, falling to second behind Mike Vanderjagt (86.5). ===Retirement=== On April 2, 2013, Kaeding signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he suffered another groin injury during the offseason. On May 2, he retired from the NFL, citing \\"chronic issues\\" with his groin muscle. ==Personal== In January 2008, Kaeding began writing weekly movie reviews for CorridorBUZZ, a daily arts & entertainment web site serving the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids, Iowa corridor. He co-owns a restaurant in Iowa City called Short's Burgers as well, as another named Pullman Cafe and Diner. Nate and his wife, Samantha (n√©e Gervich), have two sons, Jack and Wyatt, and a daughter, Tess. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American football placekickers Category:Iowa Hawkeyes football players Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:All-American college football players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Sportspeople from Iowa City, Iowa Category:Players of American football from Iowa Category:Iowa City West High School alumni ","title":"Nate Kaeding"},{"id":"1431484","text":"NSP may refer to: ==Companies and organizations== * Afghan National Solidarity Programme, an initiative to develop villages in Afghanistan * National Ski Patrol, a rescue organization in ski areas in the United States * National Solidarity Party (Singapore) * Nature's Sunshine Products, US health supplement manufacturer * Nebraska State Patrol * Network of Spiritual Progressives, US political movement * New Sarum Police, former name for the Salisbury City Police in the 1830s * Nevada State Prison * Nordic Service Partners, fast food franchisee * Northern States Power Company, a division of Xcel Energy * Nova Scotia Power, Canada ==Technology== * Native Signal Processing, Intel's term for host signal processing * Network security policy, rules for computer network access * Network service provider, a business that provides access to the Internet * Nvidia Shield Portable ==Other uses== * Natural swimming pool, another name for a natural pool * Needle and syringe programme, another name for Needle exchange programme, a program to reduce disease in drug users * Netaji Subhash Place metro station * New Science Projects, a blues-punk band from Denton, TX * Ninja Sex Party, an American musical comedy band * Non-starch polysaccharide, often incorrectly used interchangeably with dietary fiber * Nuovo Siluro Pesante, a torpedo used by the Italian Navy * Nurse scheduling problem * Nonstructural protein of viruses as to be found e. g. in Rotavirsues (NSP1‚ÄìNSP6) and Corinaviruses (NSP1‚ÄìNSP16): NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6. * Nsp is the acronym for the gene encoding a nonstructural protein (in italics: Nsp1, Nsp2 ‚Ä¶).

The tribe was mentioned by the Roman historians Publius Herennius Dexippus and Ammianus Marcellinus. The meaning of their name is ‚Äúdescendants‚Äù, and refers to the ancient Suebian tribe of the Semnoni. The Juthungi invaded Italy in 259-260, but on their way back they were defeated near Augsburg on 24-25 April 260 by Marcus Simplicinius Genialis (this is recorded on a Roman victory altar found in 1992). At this time the Roman Empire lost control of this part of the limes. The Juthungi invaded Italy again in 271, defeating the Romans at the Battle of Placentia, but they were repulsed by Aurelian after the Battle of Fano and Battle of Pavia. Between 356 and 358 the Juthungi and the Alamanni invaded the province of Raetia, and destroyed Castra Regina (Regensburg), which was the Roman capital of the province, and one of the biggest Roman military camps in south Germany, with massive stone walls and a village. A second invasion of Raetia in 383 was repelled by an army of Alans and Huns. Between 429 and 431 the Roman general A√´tius also fought against the Juthungi in Raetia. ==Historical sources== * Augsburg Victory Altar (around 260) * Dexippus - FGrHist 100 (around 270/271) * Panegyrici Latini VIII 10.4 (around 297) * Ammianus Marcellinus 17,6 (around 375) * Sidonius Apollinaris, c. 7, 233 (around 429/430) ==See also== *List of ancient Germanic peoples Category:Early Germanic peoples Category:Alemanni ","title":"Juthungi"},{"id":"1431491","text":"Eric Barton (born September 29, 1977) is a former American football linebacker who played for twelve seasons in the National Football League.

The town is famous for its folk craft of goldwork embroidery. Population: ==History== General view of the town in the 1910s Aerial view of Torzhok Torzhok was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1139 as Novy Torg. The Mongols burned it in 1238, but did not proceed northward to Novgorod. At that time, the town commanded the only route whereby grain was delivered to Novgorod. Once Torzhok blocked the route, a great shortage of grain and famine in Novgorod would follow. Consequently, Torzhok was known as a key to the Novgorod Republic and frequently changed hands during feudal internecine wars. The town was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow with the rest of the Novgorod Republic in 1478. The Polish army frequently ravaged it during the Time of Troubles. During the imperial period, Torzhok was known as an important post station on the highway from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Alexander Pushkin, for instance, used to pass through Torzhok on a number of occasions, and there is a museum dedicated to him in the town. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Torzhok was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Torzhok was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. In 1775, Novotorzhsky Uyezd was established, with the center in Torzhok, and Torzhok was granted town status. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Novotorzhsky District, with the administrative center in Torzhok, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Novotorzhsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Torzhoksky, Likhoslavlsky, and Kamensky District were merged into a new district which was called Torzhoksky District. On March 4, 1964 Likhoslavlsky District, and on January 12, 1965 Kuvshinovsky District (which occupied the same area as the former Kamensky District) were re-established. Torzhoksky District retained the new name. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Torzhok serves as the administrative center of Torzhoksky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #34-ZO As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Torzhok Okrug‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Torzhok Okrug is incorporated as Torzhok Urban Okrug.Law #4-ZO ==Economy== Torzhok has twenty-two large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. Two of them are especially significant. JSC Pozhtekhnika and OAO Torzhok Plant Printing Inks account for 70% of all industrial output. ===Transportation=== A railway line which connects Likhoslavl with Soblago via Selizharovo runs through Torzhok. Another railway line branches off in Torzhok and heads south to Rzhev via Vysokoye. Both lines are served by infrequent passenger traffic. The M10 highway, which connects Moscow and St. Petersburg, passes close to Torzhok. A road to Ostashkov branches off to the west. There is also a road connecting Torzhok with Staritsa. There are local roads as well, with the bus traffic originating from Torzhok. ==Architecture== Architectural monuments of Torzhok include a number of parish churches, dating back to the late 17th or early 18th centuries. Under Catherine the Great, the old monastery of Sts. Boris and Gleb was redesigned in Neoclassical style by a local landowner, Prince Lvov. The main city church is the Savior-Transfiguration Cathedral, founded in 1374. The current edifice was consecrated in 1822.

It is the highest area in the neighborhood and commands a view of both Boston Harbor and downtown. ==History== Dorchester is remembered in American history for an action in the American Revolutionary War known as the Fortification of Dorchester Heights. After the battles of Lexington and Concord, Revolutionary sentiment within New England reached a new high, and thousands of militiamen from the Northern colonies converged on Boston, pushing the British back within what were then relatively narrow city limits. In June 1775 British soldiers under General William Howe attacked and seized Bunker Hill, but in the process sustained many losses. Following this encounter, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia gave George Washington the title of commander-in-chief and sent him to oversee the Siege of Boston. The stalemate in Boston lasted for months, only breaking when Colonel Henry Knox returned from Fort Ticonderoga in New York, having led a team of sleds loaded with tens of thousands of pounds of artillery in winter from the fort across hundreds of miles to Boston. This added artillery gave Washington the firepower needed to make a decisive move. On the night of March 4, 1776, as 800 American soldiers stood guard along the river of Dorchester shores, 1,200 American soldiers occupied Dorchester Heights. They began working through the night to build structures suitable to defend against the British Army. A large portion of the artillery, pulled by oxen, was moved and installed, without being noticed by the British, at Dorchester Heights, a point of strategic importance due to its elevation and commanding view of all of Boston and Boston Harbor. In response, Howe planned a counteroffensive to take the fortified positions on the Heights, but bad weather forced him to reconsider. The Royal Navy evacuated the British Army from Boston on March 17, 1776, along with many Loyalists. March 17 is observed as the holiday Evacuation Day in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. ==Panoramic fireworks displays on the Fourth of July== Dorchester Heights is a hilltop, and affords panoramic views of many communities to the south and west of the city. This view is of particular interest on July 4, where after sunset one can watch the official fireworks from over a dozen communities, along with countless amateur displays, as they unfold on the horizon over the course of the evening. ==Notable places== ===Historic district=== A area of Dorchester Heights, centered on Thomas Park and the monument, was listed as the Dorchester Heights Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, encompassing the period of residential development of the area beginning in the later decades of the 19th century. The Dorchester Heights monument area was separately listed on the National Register in 1966. ===Monument=== left An area near the top of Telegraph Hill was used as the site of a reservoir to provide water to South Boston in 1849, with water provided from Lake Cochituate in the western suburbs. This reservoir was later filled in and South Boston High School was built on the site in 1901. The rest of the summit of the hill was developed as Thomas Park in the 1850s, a roughly elliptical park with ornamental plantings and walkways. During restoration work in the 1990s, archaeologists uncovered evidence of the Revolutionary War fortifications, previously thought to have been destroyed by the park's construction. The Dorchester Heights Monument, located at the center of Thomas Park, was completed in 1902 to designs by Boston architects Peabody and Stearns. It is 115 feet (35m) tall, built of Georgia white marble capped with octagonal cupola and weather vane, and is generally reminiscent of a church steeple in the Federal style. The monument is now operated by the National Park Service as part of Boston National Historical Park. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts ==References== Notes Sources * National Park Service: Dorchester Heights * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boston Category:Landmarks in South Boston Category:American Revolutionary War sites Category:Peabody and Stearns buildings Category:Geography of Suffolk County, Massachusetts Category:Boston National Historical Park Category:Historic districts in Suffolk County, Massachusetts ","title":"Dorchester Heights"},{"id":"1431545","text":"RinneRadio is a Finnish group of electro jazz pioneers. Operating on the boundaries of jazz and electronic music, RinneRadio fused jazz into ambient music and techno years before it became a worldwide trend and added hints of world music into it. In the third part ‚ÄúSuomi soi 3 ‚Äí √Ñ√§niaalloilta parrasvaloihin‚Äù (Tammi, 2005) of a book series about popular music in Finland it has been written that RinneRadio was several years ahead of their time when they started. The biography on the band's website provides the following description of the music they produce: \\"As the drum'n'bass and techno rhythms are fermented with dark dub, lush ambient soundscapes and timeless saxophone and bass clarinet textures, the resulting brew becomes equally sexy trance jazz and surreal dance music.\\" RinneRadio currently consists of Tapani Rinne (reeds), Aleksi Myllykoski (electronics), and Juuso Hannukainen (percussion). Author Petri Silas described Tapani Rinne's status as a Finnish musician the following way in the fifth edition of Finnish Jazz published by the Finnish Music Information Centre in 1998: ‚ÄúForever on the lookout for new horizons, Rinne‚Äôs sexy soprano sax and solemn bass clarinet remain among the most original Finnish jazz voices.‚Äù ==Early history== The band was formed in 1988 by saxophone player/reedsman and composer Tapani Rinne, who still leads the band and is the musical conductor. Rinne participated in the composer and drummer Edward Vesala's Sound & Fury workshops in Helsinki, and during these workshops the band started to form. RinneRadio's eponymous debut album was released in 1988 and it featured a stellar cast of Finland's current jazz elite, including Raoul Bj√∂rkenheim, Iro Haarla and Seppo Tyni. The second album Dance and Visions was released in 1990 and the album featured the Sami yoik singer Wimme Saari for the first time in RinneRadio's history. Dance and Visions also introduced Jari Kokkonen as a new member of RinneRadio. He continued in the group until 2001. Dance and Visions established RinneRadio's trademark sound, which they are best known for, fusing electronic music from ambient techno to drum‚Äôn‚Äôbass and jazzy wind instruments. RinneRadio's club- friendly sound with strong electronic influence caused stir and confusion in the Finnish jazz scene as well as abroad when the band performed in the beginning. In an interview with Markus Partanen on his book Rytmih√§iri√∂it√§ ‚Äí Uuden Suomi-jazzin nousu Tapani Rinne described their early years: ‚ÄúWe probably focused performing too much at jazz and art music venues. Techno scene and clubs were a different thing, but we got into these circles only afterwards after the band had achieved more commercial success.‚Äù In 1992 RinneRadio released the album Joik, where another long-time collaborator of Rinne, Kimmo Kajasto appeared for the first time. The same year, Tapani Rinne garnered the Finnish Georgie Award (Yrj√∂) for Jazz Musician of the Year, given by the Finnish Jazz Federation. The group's fourth album, Unik was released in 1994. It followed an EP titled DiorInNera released one year earlier. Unik received one of the highest record industry accolades in Finland, the Jazz Emma Award, which could be called the Finnish equivalent of the Grammy Award. By this time, word had spread about the new concoction of jazz, techno and ambient sounds played by RinneRadio, and the band toured extensively in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Japan, Spain and Sweden. The band's core group was now Rinne, Kajasto and Kokkonen. The trio continued to develop the sound further particularly on RinneRadio's fifth album RoK (1996) consisting of influences from hip hop, drum & bass and jazz. The same year they won The Golden Pumpeli Award at the Oulu Music Video Festival for the visuals for \\"Aromaa AltToo\\". RoK was the ultimate commercial breakthrough for RinneRadio. It peaked at no. 22 in 1996 on the Official Finnish Album Chart and stayed on the chart for six weeks. According to Tapani Rinne, after ‚Äúbeing in wrong places at the wrong time so many times earlier‚Äù, situation was now opposite to that. The big audience was now ready for RinneRadio's music and suddenly they were considered trendsetters, although that was never their aim. The band found new passionate fans especially in the European club music scene, which was driven by the rising deejay culture. In 1997, RinneRadio released a new album titled pfft, which was a collaboration with Pan Sonic's Mika Vainio, based on an earlier live remix project where Vainio remixed one of RinneRadio's live shows. In 1997, they also played a show at Knitting Factory in New York City from where the audio signal was sent live to Finland and Pori Jazz Festival where DJ Spooky made a live interpretation of the concert for the festival audience. After this, two more smaller releases, EP's Osaka and Juju, were issued before RinneRadio started to work on a new album, G. The album was released in 1998 and was an important milestone because programmer Kimmo Kajasto had been replaced with DJ Ken-One (aka Jean Johansson) in the lineup. Their collaborations with various DJ's culminated in the 1999 release B, which features RinneRadio tracks remixed by Finland's top DJs and remixers, including Brothomstates, Jori Hulkkonen, JS16 and Slow. ==2000 ‚Äì 2009== Work with Jori Hulkkonen continued, as he was largely responsible for the production of the next RinneRadio album, Nao (2001), along with Veikka Erkola. DJ Ken-One was now replaced by percussionist Zarkus Poussa and later by Abdissa Assefa in the live performances. Nao reached no. 32 on the Official Finnish Album Chart making it the group's most commercially successful album after RoK. This was followed by another album, Lumix, in 2003, which soundwise included strong efforts by Veikka Erkola and Pauli Saastamoinen. The latter has been in a significant role in the RinneRadio sound through the years regarding recording, mixing and mastering. During the same years, Verneri Lumi and Juusonik (known also from Don Johnson Big Band) joined the band with Tapani Rinne and RinneRadio reformed as a trio. Their first joint effort was the new album Pan in 2004. Pan featured again a range of guests, such as Pekka Kuusisto on violin. In 2005, RinneRadio concentrated on touring and performed at a festival curated by Herbie Hancock at Barbican Arts Centre in London as well as in the Dutch North Sea Jazz Festival. In 2006, they were invited to play at the 40th anniversary opening night of Midem in Cannes. After Midem the band was ready to release their twelfth full-length album, simply called +. The violinist, Pekka Kuusisto, returned on this album as a guest. In September 2007, RinneRadio released On. It featured Sanni Orasmaa and Icelander Kira Kira on vocals. Next year the band celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing a compilation album titled 20, which featured 20 tracks from throughout their career. The tracks were chosen by radio and club DJ's who were asked to give a list of tracks of their personal RinneRadio dream album. The result was a double album with tracks categorized into Side A(mbient) and Side B(eat). In 2009, RinneRadio released again material in the form of the album Pole Stars. Soundwise it represented an upgrade to their \\"ethno techno\\" with a strong Nordic twist. The album featured artists such as S√°mi yoik singers Ulla Pirttij√§rvi and Wimme Saari, Johanna Juhola on accordion and Eva Alkula playing Finnish zither. ==2010 ‚Äì present day== The next phase of RinneRadio started with Tuomas ‚ÄúVerneri Lumi‚Äù Norvio being replaced in the lineup with the Finnish drum‚Äôn‚Äôbass artist Konsta ‚ÄúDJ Muffler‚Äù Mikkonen, soon after the release of Pole Stars album. The biggest evolution was the new raw and hard-edged flavour combined with the moody and floating RinneRadio sound. This is also very recognizable on their next StaRRk (2012) album, which has been stylistically described as more rugged, sharper and darker than their earlier productions. The official lineup (including Tapani Rinne and Juuso Hannukainen) stayed the same for several years until 2020, when DJ Muffler was replaced in the line-up by Helsinki-based electronic music artist Aleksi Myllykoski, who had been filling in for him more and more often on live occasions. Although RinneRadio has been actively performing live both domestically as abroad, they have not released a new album since StaRRk in 2012. All the members of the group have been busy with other projects. For example, group leader Tapani Rinne released his fourth solo album Radioton in 2019, the second collaboration album with Wimme Saari titled Human in 2017 as well as collaboration albums Under The Ground (2015) and Inside The Temple (2012) with Teho Majam√§ki. Since 1996, all the official RinneRadio releases had been published by the Finnish record label, Rockadillo Records.

The London-based label published their latest two singles \\"Yasmin\\" in 2017 and \\"Zarkukselle\\" in 2018. Hence they have been working material for their next album, scheduled to be released by Rockadillo Records in winter 2020‚Äì2021.

He formerly played for the Minnesota Vikings and Baltimore Ravens. He attended the University of Kentucky. ==High school years== While attending Spencer High School in Columbus, Georgia, Williams was a standout running back in football. As a senior, he garnered All-American honors, was named the Georgia High School Player of the Year, and lead his team to its first playoff appearance in 24 years. ==College years== At the University of Kentucky, Williams made an immediate impact, setting the freshman rushing record with 986 yards in 1993. He gained 58 yards on 13 carries in the Peach Bowl at the conclusion of his freshman season at the University of Kentucky. In 1994, despite playing for a team that finished with a 1-10 record, Williams gained 805 yards on 160 carries, starting all eleven games. In 1995 Williams put together the best single-season rushing performance in school history, rushing for 1,600 yards in 1995 and topping 100 rushing yards in seven games. In that season Williams also led the Southeastern Conference in rushing yards per game (145.5), all purpose yardage (1,826 yards, 166 yards per game) and scoring (102 points). For the season Williams was honorable mention All America, a consensus All- Southeastern Conference selection and a finalist for the Doak Walker Award. During the 1995 season in a single game at South Carolina Williams rushed for 299 yards (with three touchdowns in the first half) and a total of 429 all purpose yards (57 receiving and 73 on kickoff returns), the most ever by a player in the Southeastern Conference and the second highest total in NCAA history. His 7.5 yards per rush was also an SEC record (minimum 40 attempts). After that game Williams was named the national player of the week by the National Football Foundation, Sports Illustrated and the SEC. Williams left Kentucky with a career total of 3,333 rushing yards in three seasons (an average of 5.4 yards per carry on 618 attempts), along with 38 receptions for 313 yards (8.2 per catch) and 27 touchdowns scored. Williams entered the NFL Draft in 1996 and was chosen in the 3rd round by the Minnesota Vikings. ==NFL years== Williams spent most of his 10-year NFL career with the Vikings, with the exception of a season with the Baltimore Ravens in 2001. Williams' best year came in 2003, when he amassed 745 rushing yards and 644 receiving yards. Williams was involved in the 2005 Minnesota Vikings boat cruise scandal in October 2005. He was charged in December 2005 with indecent conduct, disorderly conduct and lewd or lascivious conduct. On April 20, 2006, he was found guilty of disorderly conduct and was acquitted of the two other misdemeanor charges and sentenced to a $300 fine and 30 hours of community service. ==After the NFL== Williams has recently turned his attention to professional horse racing. He now trains thoroughbreds and recently won his first race as a trainer at Calder Race Course. ==External links== * * Moe Williams Kentucky Statistics Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:American football running backs Category:American horse trainers Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:Kentucky Wildcats football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:Sportspeople from Columbus, Georgia Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Moe Williams"},{"id":"1431556","text":"Borovsk () is a town and the administrative center of Borovsky District of Kaluga Oblast, Russia, located on the Protva River just south from the oblast's border with Moscow Oblast.

The core‚Äìmantle boundary (CMB in the parlance of solid earth geophysicists) of the Earth lies between the planet's silicate mantle and its liquid iron-nickel outer core. This boundary is located at approximately 2891 km (1796 mi) depth beneath the Earth's surface. The boundary is observed via the discontinuity in seismic wave velocities at that depth due to the differences between the acoustic impedances of the solid mantle and the molten outer core. P-wave velocities are much slower in the outer core than in the deep mantle while S-waves do not exist at all in the liquid portion of the core. Recent evidence suggests a distinct boundary layer directly above the CMB possibly made of a novel phase of the basic perovskite mineralogy of the deep mantle named post-perovskite. Seismic tomography studies have shown significant irregularities within the boundary zone and appear to be dominated by the African and Pacific large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs). The uppermost section of the outer core is thought to be about 500‚Äì1,800 K hotter than the overlying mantle, creating a thermal boundary layer. The boundary is thought to harbor topography, much like Earth's surface, that is supported by solid-state convection within the overlying mantle. Variations in the thermal properties of the core-mantle boundary may affect how the outer core's iron-rich fluids flow, which are ultimately responsible for Earth's magnetic field. == The D‚Ä≥ region == The approx. 200 km thick layer of the lower mantle directly above the boundary is referred to as the D‚Ä≥ region (\\"D double-prime\\" or \\"D prime prime\\") and is sometimes included in discussions regarding the core‚Äìmantle boundary zone. The D‚Ä≥ name originates from mathematician Keith Bullen's designations for the Earth's layers. His system was to label each layer alphabetically, A through G, with the crust as 'A' and the inner core as 'G'. In his 1942 publication of his model, the entire lower mantle was the D layer. In 1949, Bullen found his 'D' layer to actually be two different layers. The upper part of the D layer, about 1800 km thick, was renamed D‚Ä≤ (D prime) and the lower part (the bottom 200 km) was named D‚Ä≥.Bullen K., Compressibility-pressure hypothesis and the Earth‚Äôs interior.

At this depth, primary seismic waves (P waves) decrease in velocity while secondary seismic waves (S waves) disappear completely. S waves shear material, and cannot transmit through liquids, so it is thought that the unit above the discontinuity is solid, while the unit below is in a liquid or molten form. The discontinuity was discovered by Beno Gutenberg (1889-1960), a seismologist who made several important contributions to the study and understanding of the Earth's interior. The CMB has also been referred to as the Gutenberg discontinuity, the Oldham-Gutenberg discontinuity, or the Wiechert-Gutenberg discontinuity.. In modern times, however, the term Gutenberg discontinuity or the \\"G\\" is most commonly used in reference to a decrease in seismic velocity with depth that is sometimes observed at about 100 km below the Earth's oceans. == See also == * Core-mantle differentiation * Ultra low velocity zone ==References== ==External links== *Earth's Core‚ÄìMantle Boundary Has Core- Rigidity Zone * *Mineral phase change at the boundary *Superplumes at the boundary *About.com article on the name of D‚Ä≥ Category:Geophysics Category:Structure of the Earth ","title":"Core‚Äìmantle boundary"},{"id":"1431562","text":"The Seychelles bulbul (Hypsipetes crassirostris) is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is a common endemic species of the Seychelles, breeding on Mah√©, Praslin, La Digue and Silhouette as well as some smaller islands. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Alternative names for the Seychelles bulbul include the Seychelles black bulbul and thick-billed bulbul. The species is very closely related to both the Grand Comoro bulbul and the Moheli bulbul. ==Behaviour and ecology== The Seychelles bulbul is social, living in pairs, family groups or small flocks in forest and woodland from the sea to the mountains on granitic mountains. The Seychelles bulbul is monogamous and territorial in the breeding season. The territory is about in diameter. It is defended against other bulbuls and potential predators with loud alarm calls, and even large intruders, including man, can be mobbed. A helper, probably a previous offspring, is tolerated but not allowed to approach the nest. ===Breeding=== The breeding season of this bird usually begins at the start of the monsoon, around October to January, although breeding can occur at any time. It builds a circular nest out of palm fibres, leaves, twigs and moss in a forked tree branch, usually 10 m or more above the ground. Two whitish eggs with spots are usually laid per season, although in most cases only one chick is successfully raised to fledging age. Incubation lasts for 15 days and fledging occurs 21 days after hatching, but young fledglings will accompany adults after fledging, possibly to learn foraging skills. ===Food and feeding=== The species is omnivorous, taking fruit, flowers, eggs, and insects gleaned from foliage or hawked during short flights. They are very aggressive towards other birds species, chasing away birds as large as green-backed herons from areas in which they are feeding. ==References== * Skerrett A, Bullock I & Disley T (2001) Birds of Seychelles.

It was the second game developed by Cave, and the sixth on Cave's first-generation arcade hardware. As with its predecessor DonPachi, the title is both a Japanese term for expressing the sound of gunfire, and a term that relates to bees (here it means \\"angry leader bee\\"). The sequel to this game is DoDonPachi II, which was made by a different developer. The original developer later released its own sequel, DoDonPachi DaiOuJou. ==Gameplay== Compared to DonPachi, DoDonPachi is generally known for introducing new gameplay elements while improving or changing existing ones. The overall background of the game, unlike following sequels, remains more or less centered around a supposed invasion by a mysterious race of mechanized aliens, which the player is called to face throughout its run. However, more sinister and shocking secrets lie beneath the surface, accessible only to those brave and skilled enough to clear the entire game. ;Fighters The player takes on the role of a squadron fighter facing a race of mechanized aliens that recently appeared and started causing havoc. There are three different ships to choose between, and each ship can be played in Laser or Shot mode. * Type A: A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots. * Type B: A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement. * Type C: A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots. ;Weapons Each aircraft has a main forward-firing gun used by tapping the two shot buttons, the style of which is determined by the type of fighter chosen. Each ship also has two small floating guns which it deploys at the start of the game. The placement of the guns is different on each craft, which affects their firing style. If the fire button is held down, the floating guns combine in front of the ship to produce a vertical beam, which provides more firepower than standard fire. This also makes the ship move more slowly. An aura is generated around the player's ship, which damages any contacting enemy. If the laser is fired at close proximity to an enemy, the laser delivers more damage to the enemy. The ship has a limited number of bombs, which are activated by pressing the bomb button. There are two types of bombs that can be used at any time the player could normally use, and there is no penalty for picking a particular bomb to use, aside from the point reductions that using a bomb might give said player. These bombs are triggered based on whether the player is using standard fire or laser fire when the bomb button is pressed: * While firing standard shots, bombs produce a large explosion which damages or destroys all enemies on- screen, and makes all enemy projectiles disappear for the entire duration of the explosion. * While firing the laser, the ship unleashes a high-powered beam instead, which does more damage at the cost of range. Enemy projectiles in the beam's range will be destroyed. At the beginning of the game, the player has 3 bomb slots, and the slot count increases by 1 every time the player loses a life (up to 6 slots). ;Power-Up Modes Each ship can be played with a Shot or Laser boost, making the chosen mode of firing more powerful; the mode is chosen as the player chooses their ship: * Shot Mode increases the density/spread of standard shots, essentially doubling standard firepower. * Laser Mode increases the effectiveness of the laser weapon, allowing the laser to penetrate through multiple enemies. It also gives the player a shield against minor bombarding enemies while firing the beam. When the player loses a life, the chosen weapon's power is decreased by one, and the other weapon's power is decreased to the lowest level. ;Collectible Items There are three types of power-up items in the game, identified by different letters: *P: Makes the player's guns stronger and laser thicker. *B: Adds one bomb to the player's supply. The player can hold a maximum of three bombs at the start; this maximum increases by one whenever the player loses a life, to a complete maximum of six. At the end of a stage, the player's bomb supply is fully restored, to the limit it is currently at. *MP: Appears after the player has lost all their lives; as such, it can only be picked up upon a continue. Collecting this powers up the player's weapons to full strength. *Bee: There are 13 golden bees scattered throughout the stage, which are exposed by firing the head of lasers over the area. The value of each collected bee increases throughout each stage, provided the player does not lose a life, beginning with 100, then 200, 400, 800, 1,000, 2 000, 4 000, 8,000, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, 80,000, and finally 100,000. When the player loses a life, the next collected bee drops back to 100 points. *Star: Gives 100 points when picked up. When a mid-boss or end boss is destroyed, each of its bullets is converted into a star. *Giant star: Gives 10,000 points when picked up. In a multi-part boss, destroying a non-critical component causes a giant star to appear. *Pentagon: Gives 300 points when picked up. Pentagons are only found on the ground. ;MAXIMUM bonus New to DoDonPachi is the addition of \\"MAXIMUM mode\\". This mode is triggered whenever a bomb is collected when all bomb slots are full. During MAXIMUM mode, the player's score increases by at least 220 points per 1/60th second, except during boss fights. The score multiplier begins with 2, and increases by 1 for every successive bomb collected in MAXIMUM mode. Whenever a bomb is used or the player loses a life, MAXIMUM mode ends until bomb overstocking occurs again, which will cause the multiplier to resume at the last multiplier value. The multiplier is carried over to successive stages (including new loops). ;Get Point System The Get Point System (GPS) from DonPachi is improved. Destroying an enemy or part of an enemy increases the combo by 1 and builds up a combo gauge on the left side. The combo gauge constantly drains, and the combo is broken when it empties. Using the laser to continuously damage an enemy will maintain a low level on the gauge and periodically increases the combo by 1. The player receives an increasing number of points for the same enemy with a larger hit count. In boss battles, there is no combo gauge. A combo hit counter simply increases when the boss is hit by the player's Laser or Laser Bomb, and decreases otherwise. The part of the boss being hit can be a non-critical portion to increase the hit count, but not including enemies released by the boss after the boss battle began. ;Areas The game has 7 areas, but area 7 is only accessible by entering the 2nd loop. Said 2nd loop is accessible by completing the first 6 areas on 1 credit and fulfilling one of the following requirements: Arcade version screenshot showcasing Type A ship fighting against Hachi. *Loses at most 2 fighters (lives). *Depending on the fighter used, have a maximum hit count of at least the following: :Type A: 270 hits :Type B: 300 hits :Type C: 330 hits *Score at least 50 million points at the end of area 6. *Collect all 13 bees in four of the six areas. The second loop has the same areas, enemy patterns, and bosses as the first loop, but the number of bullets the enemies fire is greatly increased. Destroying the area 6 boss in the second loop unlocks a secret area where the player fights the trademark boss of the series, the giant mechanical bee Hachi (ËúÇ; 'bee'). When the player defeats it, they will then fight Hibachi (ÁÅ´ËúÇ; 'fire bee'), the true final boss in DoDonPachi. If it is defeated then the best ending is achieved. After completing an area, the player gains the following scores based on performance in the completed area: *Boss hit: It is the sum of the base boss score, and rewards 5,000 points per hit combo when a boss is destroyed. *Star: 500 points per item collected in the area using the current life. *Pentagon: 1,000 points per item collected in the area using the current life. *NO MISS: If the player did not lose a life in the completed area, the player gets 200,000 points for Area 1, and the bonus increases by 100,000 points for each successive area. For 2nd loop areas, the player gets 2,000,000 points for Area 1, and the bonus increases by 1,000,000 points for each successive area. If the 2nd loop is completed with 1 credit, the player gets 10 million points for each reserved fighter. ;Endings Should a player fail to meet the requirements for second loop access, he/she is simply congratulated by the DonPachi Corps leader, Colonel Schwarlitz Longhener, for his/her bravery in battle. No credits will be presented to the player for finishing the game this way. Should the requirements be met, however, Longhener reveals - in a shocking twist - that the \\"mechanized aliens\\" were in fact the pilot's own comrades (the International version of the game renders this as a \\"lost fleet\\" legendary among cadets) trying to actually stop him/her, being aware of Longhener's nefarious scheme revealed in the true and final ending. Having served its purpose, Longhener orders his elite fleet to annihilate the pilot, and on this premise the second loop of the game begins. If the player completes the game once again, this time without any kind of requirement except the annihilation of the ultimate fighting machine Hibachi (in which Longhener is killed piloting), in the true ending the pilot realizes that the DonPachi's true goal was to annihilate the human race, owing to Longhener's deranged idea that mankind was a flawed creation to be eradicated from existence. The existing problems of overpopulation, environmental pollution, and arms races were solved by this one-man war. The pilot wonders in the end if maybe Longhener - instead of being the genocidal maniac he claimed to be - had actually intended this extreme solution from the very beginning. The staff credits appear afterwards. == Development == == Release == The EzWeb version was released as two separate games.https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20040603/cave.htm DoDonPuchi was a mobile version of the game released in 2003 for NTT DoCoMo 504i series cellphones.https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/cda/article/news_toppage/10947.html An i-mode version was released after the original DoDonPuchi port, and included enhanced graphics. === Campaign Version === Also called Special Version, or DDP BLUE ROM, this is a special arcade board handed out to the winner of a DoDonPachi scoring contest held by Cave to promote the game's Saturn port, in which each participant was asked to submit the highest score they could reach within a three-day period. It is essentially the same game with an extreme increase in difficulty, the addition of a Hyper Mode (a primitive form of the feature later seen in the sequel DoDonPachi DaiOuJou) and a blue (rather than red) title screen. Extremely rare and sought after, only a single specimen has been confirmed to exist so far, property of contest winner ZBL-NAI. In a 2010 press conference, Cave's Makoto Asada confirmed that no other boards have been produced and the company has lost every copy of the game's source code, effectively exposing the Campaign Version to the risk of being lost forever in case of hardware failure. Asada's comments, however, are peculiar as the very first Cave Matsuri (Cave Festival), held at the HEY! arcade in Akihabara in late December 2006 featured not one, but two copies of the board. This event was before Asada joined the company, and is most likely the default statement the company makes to avoid ROM dump requests. While his statements, chronologically, could still be true, the loss of the two sets of ROMs and possibly the source code would have to have happened in the three years between the festival and the press conference, after having survived some 15 years prior. == Reception == Readers of the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine voted to give the Saturn port a 8.9766 out of 10 score, ranking at the number 83 spot. DoDonPachi was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. == Notes == == References == == External links == * DoDonPachi at GameFAQs * DoDonPachi at Giant Bomb * DoDonPachi at Killer List of Videogames * DoDonPachi at MobyGames Category:1997 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Atlus games Category:Bullet hell video games Category:Cave (company) games Category:DonPachi Category:Mobile games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with alternate endings ","title":"DoDonPachi"},{"id":"1431577","text":"StƒÖpork√≥w is a town with 6,200 inhabitants in Ko≈Ñskie County, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship, Poland. The town belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and its name is probably derived from the name of the owner, StƒÖpor. In the past, it also used to be called Stompork√≥w. The history of StƒÖpork√≥w dates back to the mid-16th century, and is associated with early ironworks, which was part of the Old-Polish Industrial Region. In 1738 - 1739 a blast furnace was built here by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Malachowski. In 1781, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, a German pioneer in mining and metallurgy, visited StƒÖpork√≥w. At that time, the village's furnace produced a hundredweight of pig iron per week, more than similar plants in Upper Silesia. In 1838 the Malachowski family expanded and modernized the plant. An old blast furnace was replaced by two modern ones. Between 1876 and 1895, new upgrades and expansions of the plant took place. Despite the widespread destruction and requisition of equipment during World War I, the plant operated until 1938, and the buildings survived until 1945, when they were destroyed during heavy fighting. After World War II, the local industry was reopened, and iron ore mining was initiated. The iron foundry in 1961 employed 1,100 people, and StƒÖpork√≥w population increased from 700 in 1946 to 3,472 in 1961. In 1967 StƒÖpork√≥w received municipal rights, and in the late 1960s, a Health Centre, a Gymnasium, and a sports hall were built.

His parents were Peder Larsson (1755‚Äì1841) and Inger Sjursdotter (1744‚Äì1814). Cleng Peerson grew up on the farm Hesthammar in Tysv√¶r, but was born on the farm Lervik in the same district. In 1821, he first traveled to the United States at the request of a religious community in Stavanger. This community was made up principally of Quakers, together with Haugeans, both groups having been influenced by the beliefs of German Rappites.Haugeans, Rappites, and the Emigration of 1825 (by Ingrid Semmingsen, translated by C. A. Clausen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 29: Page 3) ==Immigration== In 1824, when Peerson came back to Norway, it was decided that a group should emigrate. Peerson returned to America to prepare for their arrival. Cleng Peerson met the immigrants when they landed in New York on October 9, 1825. They moved to northern New York, settling about northwest of Rochester in the town of Kendall, near Lake Ontario, in Orleans County. The road that ran through this settlement is today known as Norway Road.The Norwegian Quakers of 1825 (Henry J. Cadbury, Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume I: Page 60)The Kendall Settlement Survived (Richard L. Canuteson, Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 27: Page 243) In 1834, Cleng Peerson led a group of settlers to a little settlement on the Illinois River, in the Fox River Valley. The community of Norway in LaSalle County, Illinois is the site of the Norwegian Settlers Memorial which was dedicated in 1934.Norwegian Settlers Memorial (Illinois Historic Preservation Agency) Starting in 1838, Peerson returned to Norway several times. By 1840, Peerson had settled in Sugar Creek in Montrose Township, Lee County in the southeastern part of Iowa. Cleng Peerson was listed in the United States census records as a settler in 1840. He lived here for several years, including the period 1840‚Äì47. In 1847, he joined the Swedish immigrant society at Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois, which had been founded by sect leader Erik Janson.The Sugar Creek Settlement in Iowa (H. F. Swansen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume IX: Page 38) During 1854, the Texas State Legislature granted Peerson of land west of Clifton, in Bosque County, Texas.

It had been an important military outpost throughout the 15th-16th centuries. The only time it was conquered was in 1501, by the Livonian Order after the Battle of the Siritsa River. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate).

On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940, Ostrovsky District was a part of the restored Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. Between July 6, 1941 and July 21, 1944, Ostrov was occupied by German troops. An underground resistance group was active in Ostrov during the war. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Ostrov serves as the administrative center of Ostrovsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #833-oz stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #420-oz, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal districts, lists the town of Ostrov as a part of Ostrovsky District. As a municipal division, the town of Ostrov is incorporated within Ostrovsky Municipal District as Ostrov Urban Settlement.Law #420-oz ==Economy== ===Industry=== The economy of Ostrov is based on food, electronic, and textile industries (5.4%). ===Transportation=== A railway from St. Petersburg via Pskov to Pytalovo and further to Rƒìzekne in Latvia passes Ostrov. In Latvia, it provides access to Riga and Vilnius (via Daugavpils). As of 2012, there was passenger traffic on the railway. The M20 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Vitebsk via Pskov, passes Ostrov as well. Ostrov is the northern terminus of the European route E262, which proceeds to Kaunas via Rƒìzekne and Daugavpils. There are also road connections from Ostrov northwest to Pechory via Palkino, northeast to Porkhov, and southeast to Novorzhev, as well as local roads. ==Military== The town was home to Ostrov air base, a major medium-range bomber base during the Cold War. ==Culture and recreation== The St. Nicholas Church in Ostrov The town possesses a Neoclassical cathedral from 1790 and a typical Pskovian church from 1543.

Cohen is especially known for his observational portraits of urban landscapes, blending of media formats (sixteen-millimetre, Super 8, videotape) and collaborations with musicians. He is the recipient of the Independent Spirit Award for feature filmmaking. \\"Cohen's films have been broadcast in Europe by the BBC and ZDF/ARTE, and in the United States by the Sundance Channel and P.B.S. They are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney, and Melbourne's Screen Gallery.\\" He also makes multichannel installations and still photographs and had a photography show at Robert Miller Gallery in 2009. He has received grants from the Guggenheim, Creative Capital, Rockefeller and Alpert Foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and other organizations. ==Early life== Cohen was born in Kabul, Afghanistan where his father was working for the United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.). He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1984, with a concentration in film and photography. ==Career== Cohen found the mainstream Hollywood film industry incompatible with his sociopolitical and artistic views. By applying the D.I.Y. ethos of Punk Rock to his film- making approach, he crafted a distinct style in his films through various small gauge formats of Super 8, sixteen-millimetre, and videotape. In an interview with web-site The Lamp, Cohen said, \\"...it's very inspiring to me, to see people kind of take something outside of the industry, outside of the music industry, and it gave me something of a template to work in film outside of the film industry.

Another film that covers a ten-year arc, Benjamin Smoke, is about the life of the frontman of the Atlanta, Georgia band Smoke. Other works of note are Lost Book Found, his Walter Benjamin-inspired portrait of New York City, Buried in Light, a series of connected Central and Eastern European city portraits, and his short film about the late Elliott Smith, Lucky Three. In 2002, Cohen made Chain X Three, a precursor to the Chain feature film, which was exhibited as a three-channel installation. His concert film of the Dutch band The Ex, Building a Broken Mousetrap, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2006. Cohen was a resident at Eyebeam in 2002. In 2005, Cohen curated the four-day FUSEBOX Festival in Ghent, Belgium. A celebratory gathering \\"at the crossroads of film, music, and activism,\\" participants included Guy Picciotto of Fugazi, Patti Smith and Tom Verlaine, The Evens, and a side project of Montreal's Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, called Thee Silver Mountain Elegies Play War Radio, which formed for the occasion. Other music artists Cohen has collaborated with over the years include Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Vic Chesnutt, Terry Riley, Sparklehorse, R.E.M., T.Griffin, Stephen Vitiello, Miracle Legion, DJ /rupture, Blonde Redhead, and The Ex. He has also cited that he has previously worked for the film industry as a technician and prop man, some of the directors he has worked under include Alex Cox, John Sayles, and Martin Scorsese. In addition to his film-making, Cohen has taught a workshop titled 'Documentary as a Lyrical Force\\" at the International Center of Photography. The works of Humphrey Jennings, Helen Levitt, Georges Franju, Santiago √Ålvarez, and Forugh Farrokhzad, as well as his own, are discussed. Photographer Sid Grossman had been married to Cohen's mother. Grossman was the father of his (half) brother Adam, also a filmmaker. ==Filmography== * A Road in Florida (1983) * Witness (1986) * This Is a History of New York (The Golden Age of Reason) (1987) * Selected City Films (1989) * Talk About the Passion (1989) collaboration with R.E.M. * You're the One Lee (1989) collaboration with Miracle Legion * Glue Man (1989) collaboration with Fugazi * Light Years (1989) * Love Teller (1989) collaboration with Ben Katchor * Never Change (1988) text by Blake Nelson * 4:44 (from her house) (1989) * What does Away Mean?

The style is a type of combat boot and versions were developed in many countries simultaneously with the adoption of airborne infantry forces during World War II. Modern jump boots are earned in some countries and therefore have become a mark of achievement and distinction, mainly worn as dress and parade boots. The uppers are generally made of smooth black leather with toe-caps and heel counters that accept a high polish (\\"spit-shine\\" or \\"spittle-shine\\"). It is also a paratrooper tradition to lace jump boots in a ladder or cobweb styleReglamento de Uniformes y Divisas del Ejercito y Fuerza Aerea Mexicanos EDICIONES ATENEO 1970 which increases ankle support during a parachute jump. ==Description== Although there is considerable variation in the features of modern jump boots, the defining characteristics of the original US M1942 \\"Boots, Parachute Jumper\\" (as popularized by the Corcoran Boot Company during World War II) are extended lacing from the instep to the calf and rigid, reinforced toe caps;Lemons, Charles. \\"Uniforms of the US Army Ground Forces 1939-1945, Volume 6, Footwear.\\" . p62. these features were intended to give greater support to the wearer's ankles and toes during the rough landings routinely experienced by paratroopers. The most common US combat boots of the World War II era (the M1939 \\"Shoes, Service, Composition Sole\\") had non-reinforced uppers and only laced to just above the ankle, requiring the use of separate leggings or puttees to provide support and prevent mud and dirt from entering the boot. Although less flexible than the lighter standard issue boot‚Äîand therefore often less comfortable when marching, especially when cold or not well broken in‚Äîsuch specially reinforced footwear was seen as a practical necessity, as upwards of 30% of paratroopers were expected to suffer lower extremity injuries during a combat jump. Leggings were also considered to present a risk of entanglement with parachute risers. ==Users== ===Germany=== During World War II, the Fallschirmj√§ger wore jump boots with side lacing. Side laced boots were also used by Czechoslovak Paratroopers after 1945. ===Brazil=== Brazilian Paratroopers wear brown leather jump boots manufactured by Atalaia. ===Netherlands=== Dutch soldiers were issued the M57 Jump Boot from 1958 to 1976. They were a dark brown leather and had stitched soles. ===Portugal=== Jump Boots in Portugal are manufactured by Proheral and are laced in the aforementioned distinctive style. While these boots are sometimes worn by non- paratroopers in Portugal, only paratroopers wear them with surplus green paracord instead of the usual black lace. On parade, they are usually worn with white paracord. ===Spain=== In Spain they are referred to as BRIPAC boots (Spanish: BOTAS MARCA IMEPIEL, DE LA BRIPAC) They lack the triple buckles which are worn by other soldiers for safety reasons, as a parachute could get dangerously hooked on them. They are also slightly higher, providing more shin, ankle, and foot support, and have reinforced toes and heels. ===Italy=== Italian Paratroopers are issued the stivaletti combattimento esercito italiano mod. 2000. These usually come in a dark brown/black leather and soles may vary. French paratroopers of the 1950s worn the very similar \\"Bottes de saut Mle 50\\". The only differences between the Italian and French models are the heel and in the outsole tread patterns. ===United Kingdom=== During WW2, the British Army issued trial copies of Fallschirmj√§ger-type side laced boots in the early days of the Parachute Regiment, but they were not adopted. A high version of the standard ammo boot was trialled with an extra cuff with eyelets added to the top of the boot. They were also fitted with thick crepe rubber soles. Once again, though trialled, they were not adopted. ===United States=== William P. Yarborough initially designed the boots in 1941 for use in the 501st Parachute Test Battalion. Also known as paratrooper boots, or \\"Corcorans\\" after The Corcoran And Matterhorn Company, a division of Cove Shoe Company, which had the exclusive Department of Defense contract to artifice and supply them for years.http://www.corcoranandmatterhorn.com/ItemDisplay.asp?Style=1500&CategoryID;=34 This design is still in production. Jump boots with zippers were not authorized for wear by US Forces. Certain US Army soldiers, notably those parachute qualified and assigned to an Airborne/Special Forces unit, are authorized to wear jump boots with dress uniforms.Army Regulation 670-1, Paragraph 27-3, Section C, Item 3. A modified version of the paratrooper boot was issued to U.S. Navy personnel working on flight decks and Aircrewmen. This variation of the jump boot featured a steel-toe and zig-zag pattern on the out-sole designed to prevent gathering FOD, or Foreign-Object Debris, that could potentially damage aircraft by being sucked into the jet engine's intake. These boots were sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"wing-walkers.\\" Generally they were black in color, but a brown version was issued to Flight Officers. This style is no longer issued, but is still generally authorized to wear with most Navy working uniforms (i.e. NWUs, coveralls, Aviation Working Greens). Wing-Walkers became popularly known when their characteristic footprints were linked to the Zodiac Killer. == References == * * Paratrooper boots Category:Military boots Category:Military parachuting Category:Paratroopers Category:Military uniforms Category:High-heeled footwear ","title":"Jump boot"},{"id":"1431632","text":"The Sea or the Water is an area of the sky in which many water-related, and few land-related, constellations occur.

He serves as director of pro personnel for the Washington Wizards. Jamison played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels, being named national player of the year in 1998. He was selected by the Toronto Raptors as the fourth overall pick of the 1998 NBA draft before being traded to the Golden State Warriors for former Tar Heel teammate Vince Carter. Named to the NBA All-Rookie Team with the Warriors, Jamison was a two- time All-Star and won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2004. He was a member of the United States national team in 2006. Upon his retirement from the NBA, he worked as an analyst for Time Warner Cable SportsNet and as a scout for the Los Angeles Lakers before being hired by the Washington Wizards as their director of pro personnel in 2019. ==Early years== Jamison was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His parents named him \\"Antwan\\", but the hospital misspelled it \\"Antawn\\" on his birth certificate. The error was never corrected, but the pronunciation (as \\"Antoine\\") did not change. Jamison played basketball and football (as a quarterback) at Quail Hollow Middle School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He went on to play high school basketball at Charlotte's Providence High School, where he was named a McDonald's All- American after his senior season, during which he averaged 27 points, 13 rebounds and 4.5 blocks per game. ==College career== Jamison played three seasons of college basketball for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, averaging 19.0 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. In his junior year, he was awarded both the Naismith and Wooden Awards as the most outstanding men's college basketball player for the 1997‚Äì98 season. Jamison decided to forgo his senior year of eligibility and enter the NBA draft in 1998. He subsequently returned and earned a B.A. in Afro-American and African studies, graduating in August 1999.They got game, but do NCAA players graduate? On March 1, 2000, Jamison's #33 was retired at the Dean E. Smith Center, the seventh Tarheel so honored. ==Professional career== ===Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks (1998‚Äì2004)=== Jamison was selected with the fourth pick of the 1998 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors, who then dealt his rights to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for former North Carolina teammate and best friend Vince Carter. Jamison spent the first five years of his NBA career with the Warriors. He scored a career-high 51 points on two occasions, back-to-back against Seattle and the Lakers (the Warriors won that game). He averaged a career-high 24.9 points per game in 2000‚Äì01, his third season in the league. In 2003, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a nine-player deal that sent Jamison, forwards Danny Fortson and Chris Mills, and guard Ji≈ô√≠ Welsch to the Mavs and guard Nick Van Exel, center Evan Eschmeyer, guard Avery Johnson, and forwards Popeye Jones and Antoine Rigaudeau to the Warriors. With Dallas, Jamison experienced his first winning season in 2003‚Äì04 as the Mavericks finished 52‚Äì30 and made the playoffs, which also marked the first time in his career that Jamison had experienced post-season play. Jamison was named as the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year for his efforts. The Mavericks suffered a setback in the first round, falling in five games to the Sacramento Kings. ===Washington Wizards (2004‚Äì2010)=== Antawn Jamison with the Wizards in 2007. At season's end Jamison was traded again, this time to the Wizards, in exchange for former Tar Heel Jerry Stackhouse, Christian Laettner, and a first-round draft pick (which turned out to be University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison point guard, Devin Harris). In the 2004‚Äì05 season with the Wizards, he was named to the NBA All- Star team for the first time in his career and the Wizards enjoyed a solid 45‚Äì37 win‚Äìloss season, their finest effort in 26 years. They also made the playoffs for the first time since 1997 and advanced to the second round for the first time since 1982. In 2006, Jamison played for the US national team in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, winning a bronze medal. Jamison led the Wizards against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the 2007 playoffs. Jamison averaged 32 points and 10 rebounds per game during the series. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, Jamison was named to his second NBA Eastern All-Star team. On June 30, 2008, Jamison signed a four-year, $50 million contract with the Wizards. ===Cleveland Cavaliers (2010‚Äì2012)=== Jamison with the Cavaliers in 2010. On February 17, 2010, Jamison was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers as part of a three-team, six-player trade that sent Al Thornton from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Washington Wizards, ≈Ωydr≈´nas Ilgauskas, a 2010 first-round pick and the rights to Emir Preld≈æiƒç from Cleveland to Washington, Drew Gooden from Washington to Los Angeles and Sebastian Telfair from Los Angeles to Cleveland. In his first game with the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Charlotte Bobcats, Jamison scored only two points from two free throws as he went 0 for 12 from the field. In his second game with the Cavaliers, Jamison scored 19 points against the Orlando Magic. The Cleveland Cavaliers made the NBA playoffs as the team with the best record. The Cavaliers defeated Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls in five games, but fell to the Boston Celtics in 6 games. Weeks after the series, Jamison's teammate LeBron James left the Cavaliers, to join the Miami Heat alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The Cavaliers had very little success in the 2010‚Äì11 NBA season, setting an NBA record 26-game losing streak (breaking a mark set by the franchise in 1983). That streak was finally snapped with a 126‚Äì119 overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers. In January 2011, Jamison said that he was considering retirement, and that his 2011‚Äì12 season could be his last.Tomasson, Chris \\"Antawn Jamison Says Next Season Could Be His Last\\", FanHouse, January 16, 2011, accessed January 18, 2011. On February 27, in a loss to the 76ers, Jamison was fouled and broke his left pinky. He underwent a surgery, and would be out the rest of the season. He finished his 14th NBA season in 2011‚Äì12 with averages of 17.2 points and 6.3 rebounds. ===Los Angeles Lakers (2012‚Äì2013)=== Jamison playing for the Lakers, 2013 On July 25, 2012, Jamison signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA veteran's minimum. On November 30 against the Denver Nuggets, he scored a season-high 33 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, becoming the first Laker since Shaquille O'Neal in 1998 to record a 30/10 game as a reserve. However, coach Mike D'Antoni did not play him for multiple games, partially due to Jamison's inconsistent shooting and subpar defense. On January 4, 2013, he played against the Los Angeles Clippers for the first time after six games on the bench. On January 6, he entered in the first quarter against the Denver Nuggets and hit a jumper for his first points since December 13. He played four minutes before being benched the rest of the game. Jamison again became a part of the Lakers' regular rotation after forward Pau Gasol was out with a foot injury. After the early communication issues with D'Antoni, their relationship improved significantly. ===Los Angeles Clippers (2013‚Äì2014)=== On August 28, 2013, Jamison signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 11, 2013, in the second quarter against the Boston Celtics, Jamison scored a 3-pointer which took his career points tally past the 20,000 mark, becoming just the 39th player in NBA history to achieve this. On February 20, 2014, Jamison was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for the draft rights to Cenk Akyol. He was waived by the Hawks the next day.HAWKS REQUEST WAIVERS ON ANTAWN JAMISON ===Retirement and legacy=== Jamison retired from the NBA in 2014. Of all former NBA players that are (or have been) eligible for election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Jamison and Tom Chambers are the only players to have scored 20,000 or more career points without being elected to the Hall. ==Post-NBA career== In October 2014, Jamison retired from professional basketball and became a broadcaster for Time Warner Cable SportsNet as a TV analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers. On October 3, 2017, Jamison was hired in a scouting role by the Los Angeles Lakers. In August 2019, he was hired by the Wizards to become their director of pro personnel. ==Philanthropy== Jamison awarded his first Antawn C. Jamison Scholarship at his high school alma mater in 2003. Jamison has also launched a campaign which he calls \\"A Better Tomorrow\\" which he hopes to use to provide the underprivileged with a chance at a better future. He says of the project: \\"As a professional athlete, I have an obligation to help those less fortunate. I really enjoy being in a position to aid my community ‚Äì both in the Bay Area and back home in Charlotte ‚Äì and put a smile on somebody's face. That is what it is all about. I think it is especially important to give back during the holidays, when people tend to feel a little down if things are not going too well.\\" ==Career statistics== ===College=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 1995‚Äì96  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina  32  29  32.9  .624  .000  .596  9.7  1.0  .8  1.0  15.1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 1996‚Äì97  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina  35  *  34.3  .544  .182  .621  9.4  0.9  1.1  .6  19.1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 1997‚Äì98  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina1997‚Äì98 UNC Team Stats (Players with 5+ MPG), in Tar Heel Tip-Off 2010‚Äì2011, Maple Leaf Press, 2010, p. 112.  37  *  33.2  .579  .400 .667  10.5  0.8  0.8  0.8  22.2 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  104  *  33.5  .577  .296  .617  9.9  0.9  0.9  .8  19.0 ===Regular season=== -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  47  24  22.5  .452  .300  .588  6.4  .7  .8  .3  9.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  43  41  36.2  .471  .286  .611  8.3  2.1  .7  .3  19.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  82  82  41.4  .442  .302  .715  8.7  2.0  1.4  .3  24.9 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  82  82  37.0  .447  .324  .734  6.8  2.0  .9  .5  19.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  82  82  39.3  .470  .311  .789  7.0  1.9  .9  .5  22.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Dallas  82  2  29.0  .535  .400  .748  6.3  .9  1.0  .4  14.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  68  68  38.3  .437  .341  .760  7.6  2.3  .8  .2  19.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  82  80  40.1  .442  .394  .731  9.3  1.9  1.1  .1  20.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  70  70  38.0  .450  .364  .736  8.0  1.9  1.1  .5  19.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  79  79  38.7  .436  .339  .760  10.2  1.5  1.3  .4  21.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  81  81  38.2  .468  .351  .754  8.9  1.9  1.2  .3  22.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  41  41  38.9  .420  .345  .700  8.8  1.3  1.0  .2  20.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Cleveland  25  23  32.4  .485  .342  .506  7.7  1.3  1.1  .5  15.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Cleveland  56  38  32.9  .427  .346  .731  6.7  1.7  .9  .5  18.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Cleveland  65  65  33.1  .403  .341  .683  6.3  2.0  .8  .7  17.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  L.A.

Tanker boots of an M1 Abrams crewman. Tanker boots are military bootsArmy, Volume 33, Association of the United States Army. \\"For combat-vehicle crewmen, there is a new tanker's boot under development, with a wraparound strap-and-buckle closure system for easy donning and doffing. It comes with a \\"chevron\\" design and a semiwedge heel\\"Inside the Us Army, Gordon L. Rottman closely associated with soldiers who serve on tanks. The tanker boot was \\"designed by Dehner's own H. E. Ketzler and General George S. Patton Jr. in 1937\\" who \\"wanted something easy and fast to get on.\\"The Dehner Company, Inc...Over 130 years...our history Regular combat boots are laced through metal eyelets in the leather upper, but the tanker boots are fastened with leather straps which wrap around the upper and buckle near the top. This benefits the wearer in several ways: * The leather straps are advantageous specifically to those working inside tanks. The problem with laces is that they can become undone easily and then entangled in the many exposed moving parts of a tank, and drag the wearer or part of his body into the machinery. * Many boots have nylon or canvas panels in their uppers and also nylon laces which will melt if exposed to fire. Melting boots and laces will serve to further injure a crewman and make evacuating him out of the vehicle more difficult. * Tracked crewmen typically find themselves working in very muddy environments. Another advantage of tanker boots is that they are much easier to loosen than a regular laced boot when caked in mud. * Today's modern tankers are exposed to many harmful chemicals - Flame-Resistant Hydraulic Fluid (FRH), turboshaft engine oil, grease, oils and various fuels. The all-leather construction of tanker boots stops these chemicals from soaking into the boots and thus coming into close and prolonged contact with the wearer's skin. * Tanker boots allow for improved circulation to crew-members' feet, as they may be sitting or immobile for long periods of time. Tank crewmen during the Gulf War reported remaining seated at their gunners', drivers', and commanders' stations for up to the entire 14 hours of ground combat. * The tongues of tanker boots, unlike with most traditional combat boots, are sewn into the boot up to about shy of the top of the boot, to better waterproof the boot. Up to of water depth can be stood in without entry of water when sealed/waxed properly, depending on the height of the boot design. The tongue is made with excess leather left and right that does not need it to separate to remove the foot. However, the new desert tanker boots are not waterproof at all. * Tanker boots are normally equipped with steel toe guards, steel or plastic shank/heel guards, and in at least modern variants, steel or other protective metal inserts in portions of the sole as well, as befit a boot intended for an operating environment filled with potentially injurious hazards, as opposed to the traditional combat boot designed for a sandy or muddy battlefield environment. When the desert tanker boots came out, it was not authorized to have steel toe inserts for fear that the crewman may have his toe cut off if too much weight was put on the boot. Tanker boots have a significant disadvantage over traditional lace-up combat boots in that they provide comparatively little ankle support; however, for troops that fight sitting in an armoured vehicle, this is relatively unimportant. An unauthorized variant of the tanker boot is the cavalry boot, or 'cav boot', which is higher above the ankle (in imitation of riding boots worn by the old horse cavalry) and might be worn by soldiers assigned to armored cavalry squadrons and scout units. The cav boots are more commonly seen being worn by officers in armored cavalry units. ==References== Category:Military uniforms Category:Military boots ","title":"Tanker boot"},{"id":"1431649","text":"The government of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic. El Salvador elects its head of state - the President of El Salvador - directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority. If an absolute majority (50% + 1) is not achieved by any candidate in the first round of a presidential election, then a run-off election is conducted 30 days later between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round. The presidential period is five years. Consecutive re-election is not permitted, though previously elected presidents may run for a second, non-consecutive term. Salvadorans also elect a single- chamber, unicameral national legislature - the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador - composed of 84 members (deputies). They are elected by open-list proportional representation for three-year terms, with the possibility of immediate re-election. All 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of 14 multi-member constituencies (corresponding to El Salvador's 14 departments). They range from 3-16 seats each according to department population size. == Political culture == El Salvador has a multi-party system. Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009. Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. ==Schedule== ===Election=== {class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Position !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 - !Type  Gubernatorial (March) National Congress (March)colspan=1NonePresidential (March)National Congress (March) Gubernatorial (March)colspan=2None - !President and vice president colspan=2None President and vice president colspan=3None - !National Congress All seats colspan=2None All seats colspan=2None - !Provinces, cities and municipalities All positions colspan=2None All positions colspan=2None } ===Inauguration=== {class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Position !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 - !Type  Gubernatorial (June) National Congress (June)colspan=2NonePresidential (June) National Congress (June)colspan=2None - !President and vice president colspan=2None 1 June colspan=4None - !National Congress 1 May colspan=2None 1 May colspan=2None - !Provinces, cities and municipalities 1 May colspan=2None 1 May colspan=2None } ==Presidential elections== ===1915=== { class= style=text- align:right !colspan=2Candidate !Party !Votes !% - bgcolor=#90EE90 align=leftCarlos Mel√©ndez Ramirezalign=leftNational Democratic Party 100 - align=left colspan=3Invalid or blank votes ‚Äì - align=left colspan=3Total 100 - align=left colspan=3Registered voters/turnout??

Local elections are held every four years to elect governors, metropolitan mayors, municipal mayors, and provincial and municipal legislatures. The president is directly elected for a single five-year term by plurality vote. The National Assembly has 300 members elected for a four-year term, 253 in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. Each individual party willing to represent its policies in the National Assembly is qualified on the legislative (general) election if: i) the national party-vote reaches over 3% on proportional contest or ii) more than 5 members of the party are elected from each of their first-past-the-post election constituencies.Representation System(Elected Person) , the NEC, Retrieved on April 10, 2008 Since the 2020 legislative elections, South Korea has two main parties, the centre-left liberal Democratic Party of Korea and the right-wing conservative United Future Party. In addition, there are currently two notable minor (non-aligned) parties: the liberal-conservative centrist Minsaeng Party & the progressive Justice Party. ==Election Technology== South Korean ballots from 2010. Polling places are usually located in schools. During the absentee or early voting period, voters can vote at any polling place in the country. On election day, voters may only vote at polling places in their registered constituency. Korean voters mark paper ballots with a rubber stamp using red ink. There is one race per ballot paper; if there are multiple office up for election, ballot papers are color coded and voters are issued one ballot per race.Tim Meisburger, Korean Elections: A Model of Best Practice, April 20, 2016. Korea uses a central count model. After the polls close, ballot boxes are sealed and transported to the constituency's counting center. Traditionally ballots were hand counted, and optical scanners have been adopted since 3rd local elections held on 13 June 2002. The scanners resemble cash sorter machines, sorting the ballots into stacks by how they are voted. Stacks are then counted using machines resembling currency counting machines.Oglim, The South Korean 2012 Presidential Election was Fraudulent, Feb. 21, 2013. (archived version.) Korean elections have been praised as a model of best practice. However, the legality of the introduction of optical scan technology has been challenged and there have been allegations of rigged counting. ==Schedule== ===Election=== {class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Position !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022 - !Type  Presidential (May)  Local (June)  None  National Assembly (April)  None  Local (June) Presidential (March) - !President President colspan=4None President - !National Assembly colspan=3None All seats colspan=2None - !Provinces, cities and municipalities  None All positions colspan=3None All positions } ===Inauguration=== {class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Position !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022 - !Type  Presidential (May)  Local (July)  None  National Assembly (May)  None  Local (July) Presidential (May) - !President May 10 colspan=4None May 10 - !National Assembly colspan=3None May 30 colspan=2None - !Provinces, cities and municipalities NoneJuly 1 colspan=3None July 1 } ==Latest elections== ===2017 presidential election=== ===2020 legislative election=== In the 2020 South Korean legislative election the Democratic Party and its satellite, the Platform Party, won a landslide victory, taking 180 of the 300 seats (60%) between them.

It was initially produced at the Speke, Liverpool factory, moving to Canley, Coventry in 1978 and then finally to the Rover Solihull plant in 1980. The car was launched in the United States in January 1975, with its UK home market debut in May 1976. The UK launch was delayed at least twice because of high demand for the vehicle in the US, with final sales of new TR7s continuing into 1982. ==Design and features== Side view of 1975 TR7 (United Kingdom) Rear view of 1975 TR7 (United Kingdom) The car, characterised by its \\"wedge\\" shape and by a swage line sweeping down from the rear wing to just behind the front wheel, was commonly advertised as: \\"the shape of things to come\\". The design was penned by Harris Mann who also designed the wedge-shaped Princess. The car has an overall length of 160 inches (406 cm), width of 66 inches (168 cm), wheelbase of 85 inches (216 cm) and height of 49.5 inches (126 cm). The coup√© has a kerbside weight of 2205 pounds (1000 kg). During development, the TR7 was referred to by the code name \\"Bullet\\". The original full-size model wore MG logos because it was styled at Longbridge, which was not a Triumph factory. Power is provided by a 1,998 cc eight-valve four-cylinder engine that shares the same basic design as the Triumph Dolomite 1850 engine, albeit increased to 2 litres and fitted with larger carburettors, mounted in-line at the front of the car. Power is at 5500 rpm, maximum torque at 3500 rpm, the North American version produces . Australian buyers received the same version in order to meet local emissions regulations. Drive is to the rear wheels via a four-speed gearbox initially, with an optional five-speed manual gearbox and a three- speed automatic available from 1976. The front independent suspension uses coil spring and damper struts and lower single link at the front, and at the rear is a four-link system, again with coil springs. There are front and rear anti-roll bars, with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear. ===Revisions=== TR7 broadcord interior. Note lack of lights in driver's door. Green tartan interior (with US spec. steering wheel center) The interior trim was revised in March 1977, with the broadcord seat covers being replaced with red or green \\"tartan\\" check inserts with black leather effect vinyl edging. The tartan trim is also reflected in the door cards in padded matching red or green tartan cloth inserts in the black leather effect vinyl. The development of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, which was in the headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the seats on the back panel below the rear parcel shelf, was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black trims that covered only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, covering the whole wheel. Only a small number of 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977‚Äì78. Solihull-built TR7 drop head coupe with double bulge bonnet Tan plaid interior of a Triumph TR7. Note later rectangular door lock button in left top. The development of a V8-engined version, which became the Triumph TR8, required an addition bulge in the bonnet, to clear the carburettors. This produced the \\"double bulge\\" or \\"double bump\\" bonnet, characteristic of TR7s and TR8s built at Canley and Solihull. However, at least some of the TR7s built at Canley have single bump bonnets; though it is possible these were cars that had not been completed at Speke, possibly due to the industrial action there, and finished off at Canley after production was moved During production at Canley, the seat trim was again revised, with a plaid cloth in navy blue or tan, with matching coloured leather effect edging, and matching door cards. A further trim change during production at Solihull saw the use of a ruched velour in blue or tan on the seats, with matching inserts on the doors. Also, the internal door lock buttons were changed from the earlier standard BL round ones, to rectangular buttons held on with small grub screws. There was also a change to the trip mile counter's reset button, which became a push type operated through the instrument \\"glass\\", rather than a turn type under the dash. ==Media appearances and promotions== Various British Leyland vehicles were driven by the lead characters in the British secret agent television series The New Avengers, produced between 1976 and 1977. Amongst them was a yellow TR7 hardtop driven by the character Purdey. The car was immortalised as a children's Dinky Toy and Revell construction kit. Lucy Ewing drove a silver convertible on the TV show Dallas. In 1978 Coca-Cola and Levi's ran promotional competitions with the top prizes being three TR7s in special red and white Coke livery. They also featured denim upholstery and genuine jean patch pockets on the door interiors. Also included were a 12V fridge in the boot and a TV in the glove compartment. Two of the three Coca-Cola cars are known to still exist. A yellow TR7 coup√© is driven by one of the two protagonists, Lance Stater (Toby Jones) in the BAFTA award-winning television series Detectorists about two middle aged English metal detector enthusiasts, written by and co-starring Mackenzie Crook. In the 1976 television film Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby, the protagonist, Andrew/Adrian, drives a TR7. A blue TR7 hardtop was also driven by CI5 agent, Ray Doyle in the ITV series The Professionals, a notable episode being Private Madness, Public Danger. ==Variants and derivatives== ===TR7 Drophead Coup√©=== Triumph TR7 cabriolet 1998cc Aug 1982 Because of proposed US legislation on roll-over protection at the time of its launch, the TR7 was not initially available as a convertible. In early 1979, Triumph belatedly introduced a convertible version, called the TR7 Drophead Coup√© (DHC), which first went on sale in the US (the original hardtop model being known as the Fixedhead Coup√©, or FHC). A small number of pre-production cars were manufactured at Speke in 1978, soon after the pre-production TR7 V8 (later designated TR8) and TR7 Sprint cars. The British market received it in early 1980. The prototype for the convertible version of the original Harris Mann design came from Michelotti and the engineering to make it work was done by Triumph. ===TR8=== For export to the US market, Triumph created a much more powerful Triumph TR8 model in 1977/78, which was a TR7 with a 3.5 L Rover V8 engine. While some genuine TR8 models stayed in Britain, these examples are exceedingly rare. Most TR8s went to the US, where they did not fare well, owing to Triumph's poor build quality at the time and the unusually strong pound, which peaked at around $2.40 by 1980, making Triumphs fairly expensive compared to competitors. ===Spider=== In 1980, a limited edition version of the TR7 Drophead was launched for the US market by the US importer. Called the TR7 Spider, it was available only in Maraschino Black, with reflective red striping and badging plus black interior trim. Alloy wheels and the steering wheel from the TR8 were fitted, along with a \\"pewter grey\\" carpet and grey striped upholstery. Based on an exhaustive inventory of the factory build cards at the British Heritage Motor Centre archives, it has been confirmed that 1,070 carbureted Spiders were built at the Solihull factory with an additional 548 fuel-injected (Bosch L-jetronic) Spiders built specifically for California. VIN numbers for Spiders run from 400301 to 401918 overall and for the fuel-injected version from 401374 to 401918. All the Spider-specific equipment was installed at the factory, with the exception of the radio/cassette, which was stored in the boot and installed at the port of entry. ===Cancelled variants=== ====TR7 Sprint==== A variant of the TR7 powered by the Dolomite Sprint engine (dubbed the TR7 Sprint) was developed, but never put into full production; though British Leyland had the 16-valve engined TR7 homologated for use in competition. These cars can be identified by a different chassis number to the production 8-valve model: prefixed ACH rather than ACG, etc. The original engines are also numbered with the format CHnnnHE, rather than the VAnnnnHE format of Dolomite 16-valve engines. Production records at the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust (BMIHT) cover 58 prototype and pre-production cars, all Fixedheads, built between February and October 1977. Another car, without production records, is identified by DVLA details, and the possible existence of two more has been inferred from the commissioning number sequence; making a possible maximum of 59 to 61 cars, of which several still exist in the UK and elsewhere.British Motor Industries Heritage Trust Archives, Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon, Warwickshire, England: accessed June 2013. These cars were built at the BL plant at Speke, at the same time as the pre-production runs for the convertibles and TR7 V8s, including a run of about 30 cars built on the line during the factory changeover to the 1978 year model in June 1977. However, it is claimed that some cars at least were converted at Canley from completed TR7s built at Speke. Production of the TR7 Sprint stopped with the closure of the Speke plant. However, the failure of the TR7 Sprint to go into full series production is also blamed on BL's Sales and Marketing Department because they claimed its performance was not sufficiently different from the TR7, though its top speed and 0‚Äì time were almost identical to those for the US specification carburettor version of the 3.5 litre Rover V8 powered Triumph TR8. Also, the Sprint engine was unsuitable for the emission-control equipment necessary for sale in the US, which was Sales and Marketing's main target market for the TR7 and TR8. Even so, BL required some, probably about 50, 16-valve engined TR7s suitable for normal sale before the end of 1977. This was for the rehomologation of the 16-valve head to allow the 16-valve TR7 rally car to be used in the 1978 season following a chgange to the FIA's rules. That the TR7 Sprint was used in this is shown by a series of six photographs in the British Motor Museum's archives, taken on the 1st of November and listed as TR7 Sprint Homologation. The 16-valve head was approved for use with the Group-4 rally car a second time in February 1978 in time for the Mintex Rally.FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1976: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, December 11, 1975, Article 252, clause g.J.

Converting a two-valve TR7 to the four-valve Sprint specification is relatively simple, compared to conversion to TR8 specification, because the TR7 and TR7 Sprint have virtually identical engine blocks. As a result, there are a number of such converted TR7 models around: \\"There are a [comparatively] large number of privately built Sprint conversions about ... Buyers should beware of this if they are asked a premium price for an alleged 'genuine' TR7 Sprint.\\" ====Lynx==== 1978 Triumph TR7 (Project Lynx) Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon While the TR7 was under development in the early 1970s, a 2+2 fastback derivative, codenamed Lynx was also planned. The Lynx had a wheelbase stretched by , the Rover V8 engine, with the rear axle from the Rover SD1. Scheduled for launch in 1978, the Lynx was cancelled when the Speke factory was closed. ====Broadside==== In early 1979, a joint MG/Triumph project to produce a new sportscar based on the TR7 was started under the name Project Broadside. This was based on the TR7, with a wheelbase stretched by , with either an O-Series or Rover V8 engine, and both drophead and fastback body styles. Project Broadside was cancelled later in 1979, owing to a lack of funding. Examples of both Lynx and Broadside can be seen at the BMIHT, Gaydon, England. ====Boxer==== During the latter part of 1979, as an exercise in badge engineering, another MG version of the TR7 was developed under the codename Boxer as a potential replacement for the MGB. Various concepts were presented and ultimately a design from BL's American headquarters at Leonia was accepted. Major changes to the standard TR7 Hardtop were the addition of a MG-type grille to the nose panel, headlights similar to those of a Porsche 928 and a new tail panel with light units from a Rover SD1. The proposal was ultimately rejected on the grounds that the car was insufficiently different from the TR7. ==Motorsports== British Leyland ran a team of TR7s in rally competitions from 1976 to 1980. These cars initially used the 16-valve Dolomite Sprint engine and later switched to the Rover V8 engine (before the introduction of the TR8, so dubbed \\"TR7 V8\\"). They were reasonably successful on tarmac events but were less successful on gravel sections. The most successful driver of these cars was Tony Pond. John Buffum won the SCCA PRO Rally Championship from 1977‚Äì80 driving TR7 and TR7 V8 cars. The TR7-V8 models continue to be successful in classic rallying events. Group 44 ran two TR8 cars in TransAm and IMSA Championship from 1978 to 1981, while in Canada a third IMSA car was run with support of JRT Canada and was raced until 1985. Group 44 effort lead to many wins of the TR8 in USA and was the most successful campaign of this type of car. The fastest road race TR7 was built by RMP Motors in Canada, winning two back to back GT1 championships in 2012‚Äì13. The 16-valve engined TR7 rally car was homologated for group 4 in October 1975, well before any 16-valve TR7 Sprints are known to have been produced.RAC TR7 Homologation papers number 3071. This was possible at the time using the \\"100-off rule\\", as John Davenport called it, in the FIA's appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1975.Robson G., The Works Triumphs: 50 Years in Motorsport, 1993, J H Haynes & Co Ltd, . This 100-off rule described a list of \\"Optional equipment which may be recognized with a minimum production of 100 units per year to equip 100 cars\\" and requirements for their use. However, it did not require that any cars actually be so equipped, just that 100 of the \\"bolt-on option kits\\" be produced, listed, and made available for sale. As well as alternative cylinder heads with different numbers of cams and valves, this list of optional equipment also included many other engine, suspension, and transmission components, and so covered the use of the 4-speed, close-ratio gearbox and overdrive from the Triumph Dolomite Sprint (the heavy duty axle from the 5-speed TR7 was initially homologated for group 3 by another, less clear, route, though re-homologated later, presumably on production of 5-speed TR7s).FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1975: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, January 27, 1975, Article 260, clause z, sub-clause bb.Bill Price, B.M.C./B.L. Competitions Department: 25 Years in Motorsport ‚Äì The Cars, the People, the Events, 1989, J H Haynes & Co Ltd, . Further modifications, including the larger front brakes and rear disk brakes, were covered as \\"Optional equipment which may be recognized without a minimum production\\".FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1975: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, January 27, 1975, Article 260, clause z, sub-clause cc. In 1975, Appendix J listed yet more modifications allowed, with restrictions, to cars for group 4, including pistons, manifolds, carburettors, and suspension, etc., that could be fitted without the FIA needing to recognize or approve them. However, the BL rally team had to regain approval for the 16-valve head for the 1978 season, and several others such as Lancia, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Ford had similar problems at that time. This was because the FIA deleted the 100-off rule from 1976, though mechanical parts and cars already using it were allowed to be used until the end of 1977. The number of cars suitable for \\"normal sale\\" required to gain approval of such a modification under the 1976 rules does not appear to be recorded. However, several other similar modifications of the era, including the Vauxhall Chevette HSR, Porsche 924 Carrera GTS, and possibly Ford RS rally cars, involved production of batches of 50 cars. This may explain, at least in part, the production of the 60 or so 16-valve TR7 Sprints in 1977. Their use in this homologation process is shown by 6 photographs of a TR7 Sprint (later registered SJW 530S) described in the British Motor Museum Film and Picture Library archives as \\"TR7 Sprint Homologation\\". The V8 version was homologated on 1 April 1978. This was homologated as a separate model, the TR8, directly into group 4, but because the TR8 had not yet been launched \\"as a compromise to keep the BL marketing people happy, it was called the TR7V8 instead.\\" At that time, appendix J required 400 cars suitable for \\"normal sale\\". However, the number produced by April 1978 is believed to have been less than 150. Journalist and historian Graham Robson quotes John Davenport as saying \\"In those days there was no rigorous FIA inspection system. Provided that one provided a production sheet signed by an important manager, then nobody worried\\". Robson goes on, \\"A lot of fast and persuasive talking then went on, to show that the makings of well over 500 [sic.] cars were either built, partly built, or stuck in the morass of the Speke strike‚Äîthe result being that homologation was gained.\\" However, the FIA rules are specific that these should be \\"entirely finished cars, e.g., cars in running condition and ready for delivery to the purchasers.\\" Also, the Ford Escort Mk2 RS1800 was re- homologated into Group 4, as the 2 L Escort RS, with only about 50 produced in 1977 and only about 109 in total - though has been claimed the FIA had included Escorts modified to RS1800 specification by others, after sale, despite this clearly being outside the FIA's rules. ==Quality problems== Quality problems tended to undermine the car's image in the marketplace. This was primarily the result of the poor relations between management and workforce and frequent strikes at the Speke factory near Liverpool. Quality improved when production was moved to the Canley plant in Coventry, and later Solihull. However it was too late to save the car's reputation. In its Frankfurt Motor Show preview edition of September 1977, the German magazine Auto, Motor und Sport reported that the engine of a TR7 press car had given up the ghost and \\"started to boil\\" while undergoing a maximum speed measurement exercise over a stretch of track as part of a road test. At the time of the report the cause of the problem was still unknown; British Leyland technicians had already been investigating the car, without comment, for nineteen days. ==Production volumes== In total approximately 115,000 TR7 models were built which includes 28,864 soft top/convertibles, and approximately 2,800 TR8 models. Ultimately the TR7 failed to sell in the same volumes as its predecessors, and by the late 1970s, sports cars were becoming a low volume niche product that British Leyland could ill-afford to support, given its volume car business was already struggling. A rationalisation plan introduced by incoming BL chairman Michael Edwardes saw the TR7 put on life support by axing the MG MGB as it was felt that the latter was cannibalizing the TR7's sales - however this controversial decision failed to revive the TR7's fortunes when it too was axed in 1981, with the end of car production at Solihull, which was to become exclusively a Land Rover plant. The demise of the TR7 (and the Dolomite a year earlier) marked the end of the lineage of Triumph sports cars, with the marque continuing on the Triumph Acclaim until 1984. The Acclaim however was a licence-built Honda Ballade, built at the Cowley assembly plant and was pitched as a family saloon rather than as a sports car. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980s cars Category:British Leyland vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Roadsters Category:Sports cars TR7 Category:Cars introduced in 1975 Category:Rally cars Category:Group 4 cars ","title":"Triumph TR7"},{"id":"1431663","text":"Desulfovibrio vulgaris is the best-studied sulfate-reducing microorganism species; the bar in the upper right is 0.5 micrometre long. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) or sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) are a group composed of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfate-reducing archaea (SRA), both of which can perform anaerobic respiration utilizing sulfate (SO42‚Äì) as terminal electron acceptor, reducing it to hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, these sulfidogenic microorganisms \\"breathe\\" sulfate rather than molecular oxygen (O2), which is the terminal electron acceptor reduced to water (H2O) in aerobic respiration. Most sulfate-reducing microorganisms can also reduce some other oxidized inorganic sulfur compounds, such as sulfite (SO32‚Äì), dithionite (S2O42‚Äì), thiosulfate (S2O32‚Äì), trithionate (S3O62‚Äì), tetrathionate (S4O62‚àí), elemental sulfur (S8), and polysulfides (Sn2‚àí). Depending on the context, \\"sulfate-reducing microorganisms\\" can be used in a broader sense (including all species that can reduce any of these sulfur compounds) or in a narrower sense (including only species that reduce sulfate, and excluding strict thiosulfate and sulfur reducers, for example). Sulfate- reducing microorganisms can be traced back to 3.5 billion years ago and are considered to be among the oldest forms of microbes, having contributed to the sulfur cycle soon after life emerged on Earth. Many organisms reduce small amounts of sulfates in order to synthesize sulfur-containing cell components; this is known as assimilatory sulfate reduction. By contrast, the sulfate- reducing microorganisms considered here reduce sulfate in large amounts to obtain energy and expel the resulting sulfide as waste; this is known as dissimilatory sulfate reduction. They use sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor of their electron transport chain. Most of them are anaerobes; however, there are examples of sulfate-reducing microorganisms that are tolerant of oxygen, and some of them can even perform aerobic respiration. No growth is observed when oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. \\" In addition, there are sulfate-reducing microorganisms that can also reduce other electron acceptors, such as fumarate, nitrate (NO3‚àí), nitrite (NO2‚àí), ferric iron [Fe(III)], and dimethyl sulfoxide. In terms of electron donor, this group contains both organotrophs and lithotrophs. The organotrophs oxidize organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, organic acids (e.g., formate, lactate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate), alcohols (methanol and ethanol), aliphatic hydrocarbons (including methane), and aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). The lithotrophs oxidize molecular hydrogen (H2), for which they compete with methanogens and acetogens in anaerobic conditions. Some sulfate-reducing microorganisms can directly utilize metallic iron [Fe(0)] as electron donor, oxidizing it to ferrous iron [Fe(II)]. ==Ecological importance and markers== Sulfate occurs widely in seawater, sediment, and water rich in decaying organic material. Sulfate is also found in more extreme environments such as hydrothermal vents, acid-mine drainage sites, oil fields, and the deep subsurface, including the world's oldest isolated ground water. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms are common in anaerobic environments where they aid in the degradation of organic materials. In these anaerobic environments, fermenting bacteria extract energy from large organic molecules; the resulting smaller compounds such as organic acids and alcohols are further oxidized by acetogens and methanogens and the competing sulfate-reducing microorganisms. Sludge from a pond; the black color is due to metal sulfides that result from the action of sulfate-reducing microorganisms. The toxic hydrogen sulfide is a waste product of sulfate-reducing microorganisms; its rotten egg odor is often a marker for the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms in nature. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms are responsible for the sulfurous odors of salt marshes and mud flats. Much of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides. These metal sulfides, such as ferrous sulfide (FeS), are insoluble and often black or brown, leading to the dark color of sludge. During the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event (250 million years ago) a severe anoxic event seems to have occurred where these forms of bacteria became the dominant force in oceanic ecosystems, producing copious amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfate-reducing bacteria also generate neurotoxic methylmercury as a byproduct of their metabolism, through methylation of inorganic mercury present in their surroundings. They are known to be the dominant source of this bioaccumulative form of mercury in aquatic systems. ==Uses== Some sulfate-reducing microorganisms can reduce hydrocarbons, and they have been used to clean up contaminated soils. Their use has also been proposed for other kinds of contaminations. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms are considered as a possible way to deal with acid mine waters that are produced by other microorganisms. == Problems caused by sulfate-reducing microorganisms == In engineering, sulfate-reducing microorganisms can create problems when metal structures are exposed to sulfate-containing water: Interaction of water and metal creates a layer of molecular hydrogen on the metal surface; sulfate- reducing microorganisms then oxidize the hydrogen while creating hydrogen sulfide, which contributes to corrosion. Hydrogen sulfide from sulfate- reducing microorganisms also plays a role in the biogenic sulfide corrosion of concrete. It also occurs in sour crude oil. Some sulfate-reducing microorganisms play a role in the anaerobic oxidation of methane: :CH4 \\\\+ SO42‚àí -> HCO3‚àí \\\\+ HS‚àí \\\\+ H2O An important fraction of the methane formed by methanogens below the seabed is oxidized by sulfate-reducing microorganisms in the transition zone separating the methanogenesis from the sulfate reduction activity in the sediments. This process is also considered a major sink for sulfate in marine sediments. In hydraulic fracturing, fluids are used to frack shale formations to recover methane (shale gas) and hydrocarbons. Biocide compounds are often added to water to inhibit the microbial activity of sulfate-reducing microorganisms, in order to but not limited to, avoid anaerobic methane oxidation and the generation of hydrogen sulfide, ultimately resulting in minimizing potential production loss. ==Biochemistry== Before sulfate can be used as an electron acceptor, it must be activated. This is done by the enzyme ATP-sulfurylase, which uses ATP and sulfate to create adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS). APS is subsequently reduced to sulfite and AMP. Sulfite is then further reduced to sulfide, while AMP is turned into ADP using another molecule of ATP. The overall process, thus, involves an investment of two molecules of the energy carrier ATP, which must to be regained from the reduction. Overview of the three key enzymatic steps of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. Enzymes: sat and atps respectively stand for sulfate adenylyltransferase and ATP sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.4); apr and aps are both used to adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase (EC 1.8.4.8); and dsr is the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.99.5); The enzyme dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase, dsrAB (EC 1.8.99.5), that catalyzes the last step of dissimilatory sulfate reduction, is the functional gene most used as a molecular marker to detect the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms. == Phylogeny == The sulfate-reducing microorganisms have been treated as a phenotypic group, together with the other sulfur-reducing bacteria, for identification purposes. They are found in several different phylogenetic lines. As of 2009, 60 genera containing 220 species of sulfate- reducing bacteria are known. Among the Deltaproteobacteria the orders of sulfate-reducing bacteria include Desulfobacterales, Desulfovibrionales, and Syntrophobacterales. This accounts for the largest group of sulfate-reducing bacteria, about 23 genera. The second largest group of sulfate-reducing bacteria is found among the Firmicutes, including the genera Desulfotomaculum, Desulfosporomusa, and Desulfosporosinus. In the Nitrospirae division we find sulfate-reducing Thermodesulfovibrio species. Two more groups that include thermophile sulfate-reducing bacteria are given their own phyla, the Thermodesulfobacteria and Thermodesulfobium. There are also three known genera of sulfate-reducing archaea: Archaeoglobus, Thermocladium and Caldivirga. They are found in hydrothermal vents, oil deposits, and hot springs. In July 2019, a scientific study of Kidd Mine in Canada discovered sulfate-reducing microorganisms living below the surface. The sulfate reducers discovered in Kidd Mine are lithotrophs, obtaining their energy by oxidizing minerals such as pyrite rather than organic compounds.'Follow the Water': Hydrogeochemical Constraints on Microbial Investigations 2.4 km Below Surface at the Kidd Creek Deep Fluid and Deep Life Observatory, Garnet S.

The show lasted for three seasons from 1990 until 1992 for a total of 65 episodes. Wild & Crazy Kids starred three teenage co- hosts Omar Gooding and Donnie Jeffcoat in all three seasons, accompanied by Annette Chavez in season 1 and Jessica Gaynes for the last two seasons. In 2002, a revival was produced which lasted ten episodes and aired on Nickelodeon from July 29 to October 7, 2002. It was hosted by Mati Moralejo of Nick GAS. ==Games== Each episode consisted of three games with one host emceeing each game. The teams were identified by the color of the shirts they wore, which varied from show to show (see below). The games varied in style; many were take-offs on playground games, sports with unusual rules added, or messy games involving pies or slime (the latter was referred to as \\"blap\\" beginning in season three). Occasionally, the show taped special episodes at a theme park such as Raging Waters, Wild Rivers, and Six Flags Magic Mountain Unlike, other Nickelodeon game shows, no prizes were ever awarded to any of the players. ===Take-offs on sports=== * The most often repeated (once per season) game was Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby. The game consisted of two teams (one of kids and one of adults) batting in three innings. The kids would attempt to hit home runs off of pitched balls (temporary and closer fencing was put up); any ball that did not leave the field in fair territory was as an out. Once the kids had three outs, the adults would bat. During their half- inning, a grownup would have up to three chances to hit home runs off a batting tee; however, the adult was first required to hold his bat upright against his forehead and spin around it three times; furthermore, each adult would only get thirty seconds to hit the balls. Three adults would bat every half-inning. Donnie Jeffcoat, incidentally, hosted the game all three times. * Three-Legged Soccer, where kids were tied at the ankle like in a three-legged race. * Splash Football, where a quarterback Rodney Peete would throw footballs to kids jumping off a diving board and into a pool. * Bumper Boat Lacrosse, played in bumper boats. * Donkey Basketball, played with kids on donkeys. ===Playground games=== * A giant game of Simon Says which looked more like a comedy routine by leader, Brian Seeman. * Red light/Green light, retitled Red Pie/Green Pie, where if a child was caught trying to advance after the call of \\"red light,\\" they hit them self with a pie. If they reached their goal, they hit one of their parents with the pie. * Cops and Robbers played on the set of the Miami Vice Spectacular at Universal Studios Hollywood. * A Tug of War pitting three professional wrestlers against a team of kids. The wrestlers would face-off against a growing number of kids each round, starting at one and then going to all fifty kids. ===Other popular games=== * Gunk in the Sky Challenge; similar to Pie in the Sky from WWYD, except featuring slime instead of pies. Players would sit under a large bucket of slop, and if they flinched, their opponent got to dump the slime on them. * Human Battleship; where the spaces selected by the players had a giant bucket of navy beans dumped on them (as well as any participant serving as a \\"ship\\" in that space.) from giant crane above the board. * Mustard-Ketchup Quickdraw; where opposing teammates would draw and shoot ketchup and mustard bottles at each-other. The winner received a large number of points for their team, while the loser could earn consolation points by enacting a dramatic death, ultimately falling into an inflatable pool of pie filling. * Pass the Bucket; A modified version of \\"Steal the Bacon\\" involving three teams where the object to be retrieved was a bucket of a mystery substance; contestants who lost a round got its contents dumped onto their heads. To win a round, a player must either steal the bucket without getting tagged by both opponents or tag a thieving player. * Slime by Numbers; Kids sat above their parents holding numbered buckets of slime. The parents had to pick a number, and the kid who had the bucket with the number the parent chose got to pour the bucket of slime over the head of the person seated below them. The last parent remaining would move on to the final round. Kids and parents then reversed, and likewise, the last kid not to be slimed also got to move on to the last round. In it, the last two players would be seated below two extra large buckets (one had green slime, and the other had confetti). They would pick a number, and the loser (usually the parent) was slimed. * Slime Dump-Off; where players would sit across from each-other with a big bucket of slime raised between them, and the winning team would get to dump the slime on the loser. * Sloppy Word Find; where players would face off to find a hidden word (such as baked beans, eggs, and dog food) on a crossword puzzle style board, with the winner getting to dump a bucket of the word they find on the loser. * Smelly Slip 'n' Slide; A Slip 'n' Slide race between two teams would be racing to see who could make it past the finish line first. The loser would be dumped on with buckets of stewed tomatoes upon finishing. * Other games included; A massive game of Twister, Human Space Invaders, Bleacher Pass Relay, and Spiderweb Stickup. ==Pilot== A pilot was shot in 1989, hosted by Matt Brown (who co- hosted Don't Just Sit There on Nickelodeon), Leslie Hibbard and Cory Tyler. ==Guest appearances== During the first and second seasons, there were occasionally adult celebrity guests, and one of Season 2's final episodes held a kids and teens celebrity slide competition game at Raging Waters in San Dimas, California to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The entire third season in 1992 featured at least one (and sometimes more) kid celebrity guest(s) every episode. Guests were people like actor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lark Voorhies from Saved by the Bell, Jonathan Taylor Thomas from Home Improvement, Ashley Johnson from Growing Pains, and Michael Fishman from Roseanne. A young Tobey Maguire appeared on the show long before he was famous, promoting the short-lived Fox sitcom Great Scott!. Other appearances include: * Marc Summers from Double Dare and What Would You Do? (1991 TV program) who appeared in 1990 in a special episode titled \\"Double Dare vs. Wild & Crazy Kids.\\" At the end of the episode, when Team Double Dare won, and Marc tricks Donnie, Omar, and Jessica into a green sliming. He also appeared the following year to pitch in \\"Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby: The Sequel.\\" * California Angels pitcher Scott Bailes pitched the first \\"Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby\\" and Bruce Hurst of the San Diego Padres pitched the third and final installment. * Detroit Lions quarterback Rodney Peete appeared on the premiere episode throwing footballs to kids jumping into a swimming pool. * Michael Bower, Venus DeMilo and Danny Cooksey from the Nickelodeon series Salute Your Shorts appeared on one of the final episodes of the original run. This show pitted two teams‚Äîone headed by the Salute Your Shorts crew and the other headed by the three Wild & Crazy Kids co-hosts‚Äîin an all day showdown. * Olympic skier Bode Miller appeared on the 2002 revival. * Brandon Call was in season 2, and as payback for his Wild & Crazy Kids shirt being in the Goo Pool with shorts and shoes, he took Donnie's shirt, Omar's shorts and Jessica's shoes and ran off to put them into the Goo Pool with the hosts chasing after him. * Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega of the Spy Kids movies appeared on the revival. ==Production== The show was executive produced by Woody Fraser, and aired 65 episodes from July 4, 1990, to December 1, 1992. Reruns aired on Nickelodeon from December 2, 1992, to February 28, 1999, before moving to Nick GAS on March 1, 1999 to December 31, 2007. It was sporadically shown on TeenNick afterwards. It was produced by Woody Fraser Productions in association with Nickelodeon and Reeves Entertainment Group. ==References== Category:Nickelodeon game shows Category:1990s American children's game shows Category:2000s American children's game shows Category:1990s Nickelodeon original programming Category:2000s Nickelodeon original programming Category:1990 American television series debuts Category:1992 American television series endings Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2002 American television series endings Category:Sports entertainment Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series revived after cancellation Category:Television series about children ","title":"Wild &amp; Crazy Kids"},{"id":"1431687","text":"This is a list of Swedish architects, including foreign-born architects who have worked in Sweden. ==A-M== * Johan Fredrik √Öbom (1817-1900) * Carl-Axel Acking (1910-2001) * Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz (1716-1796) * Uno √Öhr√©n (1897-1977) * Axel Johan Anderberg (1860-1937) * Erik Asmussen (1913-1998) * Gunnar Asplund (1885-1940) * Fredrik Blom (1781-1853) * Ferdinand Boberg (1860-1946) * √âtienne de Bonneuil (late 13th century) Uppsala Cathedral * Carl Georg Brunius (1793-1869) * Peter Celsing (1920-1974) * William Chambers (1723-1796) * Isak Gustaf Clason (1856-1930) * Carl Johan Cronstedt (1709-1777) * Erik Dahlbergh (1625-1703) * G√∂sta Danielsson (1912-1978) * Louis Jean Desprez (1743-1804) * Fritz Eckert (1852-1920) * Adolf W.

This second round was held for two candidates to deputies that got the largest number of votes in the first round. The candidate who gets a simple majority of votes cast by the electorate who came to the polls is considered elected to the parliament. At least 33 percent of the registered voters should vote to make this second round of the elections valid. The election was monitored by over 270 observers from 36 countries and representatives of four international missions. Human rights activists described the election campaign as oppressed by the government.\\"Uzbekistan ready for parliamentary polls\\" ===2014‚Äì2015 Parliamentary election=== ===2019-2020 Parliamentary election=== ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system == References == ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive ","title":"Elections in Uzbekistan"},{"id":"1431690","text":"David Roberts (born July 14, 1956) was the 36th mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey, holding the office from 2001 to 2009. Roberts declined to seek re-election in 2009, retiring from a political career of 25 years. ==Biography== He was born on born July 14, 1956. Roberts graduated from Hoboken High School and then attended Jersey City State College and then Thomas Edison State College, where he received a degree in Political Science. Roberts first began serving the public as a Hoboken firefighter in 1981. In 1984 he received a class three citation for valor as a firefighter for his efforts in a team rescue of two children on Clinton Street in Hoboken. Roberts also operates a family owned business, East LA restaurants, which has been in Hoboken for over 25 years. David was elected to Hoboken's City Council in 1985, representing the Sixth Ward. In 1995, he became City Council President. David served as Hoboken's 6th Ward Councilman until 2001 when he ran for Mayor. He was elected mayor on May 8, 2001, replacing Anthony Russo. In the 2001 election, Roberts received 6,064 votes and Russo received 4,759 votes. Roberts' inaugural address was on July 1, 2001, and he announced a \\"master plan\\" for the city that was approved by the Hoboken Planning Board in 2004. The Hoboken Master Plan remains in effect today, where the City continues to adopt many of the initiatives set in place by Roberts. Roberts received the Lincoln Day Honor twice, which is where he was honored for lifetime achievement. On February 8, 1995, Roberts received a joint legislative resolution from the State of New Jersey recognizing his achievements in office. Roberts also served as Chairman of the Hoboken Democratic Committee from 2001-2008. Roberts was appointed by former Governor Tom Kean to the Hoboken School of Industrial Education. In 2007, Roberts was inducted into the Elected Officials Hall of Fame by the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. The award ‚Äú...recognizes the tremendous contributions of the many governing body members who have selflessly serve their communities for 20 years or more.‚Äù(New Jersey Municipalities Magazine, February 2007) ==Master Plan== Roberts called for a City Master Plan in his inaugural address.Conte, Michaelangelo, \\"Roberts Takes Oath\\", Jersey Journal, Monday July 2, 2001 The Master Plan contained over 200 plus recommendations that ‚Äúaimed to transform Hoboken from an industrial enclave to a vibrant, livable, mixed-use community that is increasingly popular among people from all walks of life.‚Äù The plan helped ensure that ‚Äú...future development in Hoboken will be balanced and sustainable, with new parks, upgraded public facilities, and transportation improvements that will benefit the entire community.‚Äù Hoboken‚Äôs Master Plan is based upon the following general goals: 1) Amplify Hoboken‚Äôs sense of community, encompassing its social diversity 2) Enhance Hoboken‚Äôs unique setting as an urban enclave facing New York Harbor 3) Protect its historic rowhouse fabric 4) Celebrate Washington Street‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù character 5) Improve the appearance of Hoboken‚Äôs streets 6) Maintain Hoboken‚Äôs urbane mix of uses 7) Enhance its walkability and pedestrian amenities 8) Contemporize its community facilities 9) Provide additional open space and recreation facilities 10) Tap into the entrepreneurial and community spirit of Hoboken‚Äôs residents. In April 2004, the Hoboken City Council adopted Roberts‚Äô Master Plan in accordance with the State of New Jersey‚Äôs Municipal Land Use Law (NJSA 40:55D-28). ===Parks=== Early on during Roberts‚Äô time on Council, he became the chief negotiator on development project with the Port Authority that began the first steps toward developing Hoboken's waterfront. (Keller, John, \\"Hoboken, NJ sets a major project for its waterfront\\", Wall Street Journal, November 28, 1989). Under the Master Plan Roberts initiated, the plan called for the creation of 16 acres of new parkland. Sinatra Park, Pier A and Pier C Parks, the waterfront Skate Park, Hoboken Cove, the city swimming pool, the 9/11 Memorial, and the WWII Memorial. ===Historic preservation=== Roberts supported an ordinance as Mayor to extend the historic district from 4th and Washington Streets to 14th and Washington Streets. This ordinance created the Castle Point Historic District.05-130 DR-211, introduced Oct. 5, 2005, passed for 2nd and final reading for Nov. 14, 2005 ===Hoboken University Medical Center=== Roberts is credited with saving a major hospital from shutting down. At the time, St. Mary's Hospital in Hoboken was debating closing their hospital. As Mayor, Roberts led the negotiations that ultimately created the Hoboken University Medical Center.(Amabile, Anthony, ‚ÄúIt Takes a Community to Save a Hospital‚Äù, New Jersey Municipalities Magazine, June 2007) Roberts‚Äô plan called for the municipality to take control of the hospital and designating it a non-profit hospital would allow the hospital to continue receiving DSH (disproportionate share hospital) funds and use the hospital‚Äôs real value ($60 million at the time) as collateral. Roberts‚Äô pressed for State legislation, which eventually was introduced by State Senator Bernie Kenny and signed into law (P.L.2006, c.46)http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/PL06/46_.HTM by Governor Jon Corzine, which ultimately allowed Hoboken to take over the hospital. Roberts created the Hoboken Municipal Hospital Authority, and the City Council guaranteed a $52 million bond for the hospital‚Äôs operation. In February 2006, the hospital recorded a profit of $400,000, compared to a $1.8 million loss the same month one year earlier.

This included four tours of England, one of which, in 1882, gave rise to The Ashes. In 2019 Murdoch was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. Although Victorian-born, Murdoch was raised in Sydney, and played his Australian domestic cricket for New South Wales, making his first-class debut in 1875. His Test debut came in 1877, in what was retrospectively classed as the second Test match to be played. Murdoch began his career as a wicket-keeper, but at Test level kept wicket only once, with Jack Blackham being preferred. As a batsman, Murdoch scored both the first double century in Test cricket (211 against England in 1884) and the first triple century in Australian domestic cricket (321 against Victoria in 1882). In later years, he settled in England, playing county cricket for Sussex (1893 to 1899, as captain) and London County (1900 to 1904). In 1892, he toured South Africa with England and played in one Test match, making him one of the few cricketers to represent more than one international team. Murdoch's final first-class match came at the age of 49, in August 1904. He died in Melbourne in 1911, aged only 56. ==Early life== Murdoch was born in Sandhurst (now Bendigo), Victoria, to Gilbert Murdoch and his wife Susanna (n√©e Fleigge).Christopher Morris, 'Murdoch, William Lloyd (Billy) (1854‚Äì1911)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 5, MUP, 1974, pp 314‚Äì315. Retrieved 25 October 2009. His father was an American of Scottish descent, who had been a corporal in the U.S. Army prior to emigrating from Maryland to Tasmania in 1849. He died shortly before his son's birth.Edward Liddle (9 September 2015). \\"Billy Murdoch ‚Äì the first man to captain an Australian XI in Ireland\\" ‚Äì Cricket Europe. Retrieved 10 September 2015. The family moved to New South Wales in the early 1860s. Both Billy Murdoch and his older brother, Gilbert, subsequently studied law at the University of Sydney. Billy Murdoch married Jemima Watson (1863‚Äì1917) daughter of John Boyd Watson on 8 December 1884 at the Free Church of England, Collingwood, Victoria, Australia. ==Playing career== Murdoch made his first-class entry in 1875, at the time regarded as the finest wicketkeeper in Australia, and a highly rated right-handed batsman. He played in the second Test match ever played, the 1877 clash against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Later that year, he qualified as a solicitor and opened up a practice, \\"Murdoch & Murdoch\\", with his brother Gilbert, although it was short-lived, going bankrupt in 1877. Murdoch established himself as one of the era's greatest batsmen over the next few years, leading Australia in several Test series against England. In 1881‚Äì82 he became the first man other than W. G. Grace to score a first-class triple century when, as captain, he made 321 for New South Wales against Victoria at the SCG. The innings comprised 38 fours, nine threes, 41 twos and 60 singles from all of ten Victorian bowlers. It was this knock which established him in the public reckoning as Australia's finest batsman. So unvanquishable was he that Tom Horan (with whom Murdoch would share many a fine batting stand in the years to come) was reduced to bowling Leg theory, the first known instance of that controversial tactic. Murdoch was never far from controversy. His omission as wicketkeeper in the very first Test resulted in Australia's premier fast bowler, Fred Spofforth, boycotting the match. In 1884 as captain of Australia he was involved in the players' strike, where the Australian players refused to play unless they received a greater share of the gate takings. He was also the batsman whose contentious run out caused friction between New South Wales and a visiting English team led by Lord Harris, which also caused a spectator riot. His best Test performances more often occurred in England where both his Test hundreds were scored, 153 not out in the first Test in the old country in 1880 at The Oval, and 211 at the same ground four years later. The former score was the first instance of a captain scoring a Test century, whilst the latter score was the first double-century made in Test cricket. In 1878, Murdoch toured England and North America with Australia's first representative cricket team, participating in a famous victory over a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side. On the 1880 and 1884 tours of England he led the Australian batting averages. In England, he was regarded as a superb captain and enough of a gentleman to be invited to captain Sussex, which he did for several seasons. He was widely regarded the finest Australian batsman of his day, being bettered only by the English champion, W. G. Grace. Murdoch was more of an off-side player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not as impressive as it might be. Also, he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit. He again visited England in 1890, and although he topped that season's averages, he did not have an opportunity to regain his best form. He then settled in England, qualified for Sussex, and captained the county for several seasons. Along with former Australian Test teammate John Ferris, he represented his adoptive land against South Africa in Cape Town in March 1892. His style of play did not favour him in wet seasons, but he made many good scores over a period of about 15 years. Among these may be mentioned 155 for London County against Lancashire in 1903, and in the following year 140 for Gentlemen v Players, though he was then in his forty-ninth year. Murdoch's standing as one of the greatest first-class batsmen of his era were strengthened by his statistics; 16,953 runs scored in 391 matches at the average of 26.86 at a time when batting averages were much lower than in modern times. Murdoch died in Melbourne, Australia on 18 February 1911; present at the Test match between Australia and South Africa, he was seized with apoplexy during the lunch interval and died later in the afternoon. His body was embalmed and brought back to England for burial at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Murdoch's Test captaincy record for Australia was: 16 matches, five wins, seven losses, four draws. He also became the first substitute to take a catch in only the fifteenth Test match ever played ‚Äì a feat he managed for the opposition.

Although the latter term is often used generically, a ‚Äúhook and ladder‚Äù route specifically identifies a hook-and-lateral to a receiver on a ‚Äúladder‚Äù route. Thus a slant, cross, or other pattern collecting a lateral from a stop (or hook) route is not truly a ‚Äúhook and ladder;‚Äù nonetheless, the phrase has long been used in the vernacular to describe any hook and lateral. The \\"hook and lateral\\" starts with the hook, which is where a wide receiver runs a predetermined distance, usually 10 yards down the field, and along the sideline, and \\"hooks in\\" towards the center of the field to receive a forward pass from the quarterback. Another offensive player (usually another wide receiver) times a run so that he is at full speed, just behind the player with the ball at the time of the catch. As the defenders close in on the stationary ball carrier, he laterals or hands the ball to the teammate running at full speed in the opposite direction of the original receiver. If unanticipated, this play puts defenders out of position, running in the wrong direction. If the second receiver catches the lateral in stride, he can be long gone before defenders can react. However, the offense runs a high risk of turning the ball over if it is not handled properly because, unlike a forward pass, a dropped lateral pass results in a live ball. The hook and lateral is one of two common desperation strategies a trailing team can use at the end of a game, the other being the Hail Mary pass. It has the advantage in that it can be attempted anywhere on the field, whereas the Hail Mary can generally only be attempted at a point on the field where the quarterback's throwing arm is strong enough to reach the end zone with a forward pass. == Examples == * The Miami Dolphins executed a successful \\"87 Circle Curl Lateral\\" play at the end of the first half of their AFC playoff game against the San Diego Chargers on January 2, 1982. Wide receiver Duriel Harris caught a 20-yard pass from quarterback Don Strock and then lateraled it to running back Tony Nathan, who ran 25 yards for the score. The play gave the Dolphins huge momentum going into the second half, but the Chargers eventually won in overtime. * In Week 16 of the 2001 NFL season, the New York Giants trailed the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 with seven seconds left. From their own 20-yard line, Kerry Collins threw a pass over the middle to Tiki Barber; he ran the ball to the 34 before lateraling it back to Ron Dixon, who sprinted 62 yards up the left sideline before being tackled six yards short of the end zone by safety Damon Moore as time ran out. The play, named \\"86 Lambuth Special\\" after Dixon's alma mater, subsequently clinched the NFC East for the Eagles and eliminated the Giants from postseason contention. * The Utah Utes ran a successful version of the play in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl against the Pittsburgh Panthers. Steve Savoy caught the ball on a short pass and lateraled to Paris Warren who took it into the end zone. * The Boise State Broncos executed the play (called \\"Circus\\" in their playbook) against the Oklahoma Sooners on fourth down to force overtime in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. Boise State later scored a touchdown in overtime on a wide receiver roll out option pass, and won by scoring the ensuing two-point conversion on the seldom-seen Statue of Liberty play. * The Missouri Tigers executed a hook and lateral to set up a field goal in the fourth quarter of their October 23, 2010 regular season victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, who were at the time ranked number one in the BCS standings. * The Florida International Golden Panthers successfully ran the play on fourth and 17, with less than a minute remaining, in the 2010 Little Caesars Bowl. This helped set up the game-winning field goal as time expired. In an interview after the game, FIU coach Mario Cristobal said the play was called \\"Boise\\", referring to Boise State's play in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl (see more about the play above). * The 2014 Bahamas Bowl * The Arkansas Razorbacks successfully executed the play on fourth and 25 in overtime, down to their last down, in a 2015 meeting against Ole Miss. Known as the \\"Hog & Lateral\\", quarterback Brandon Allen completed a pass to Hunter Henry, who appeared that he was going to be tackled yards short of the first down marker, flung the ball backwards towards running back Alex Collins. Collins scooped the ball up on the bounce at the line of scrimmage and ran it for a 31-yard gain to gain a first down. Though Collins fumbled it at the end of the play, it was recovered by teammate Dominique Reed. Head coach Bret Bielema called the play \\"divine intervention.\\" The Razorbacks scored a touchdown plays later and went on to upset the Rebels on a winning two-point conversion on a quarterback keeper by Allen. * The Miami Dolphins used a hook and lateral with two laterals to score a touchdown and defeat the New England Patriots on the last play of the game during a game at Hard Rock Stadium in 2018. Down by five points, and with only seven seconds remaining in regulation time, Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill completed a pass to wide receiver Kenny Stills who lateraled to fellow wide receiver DeVante Parker, who in turn lateraled to running back Kenyan Drake who completed the scoring play with no time left in regulation. The play has been dubbed the Miracle in Miami. * It has appeared in the season one finale of Friday Night Lights during the final play of the state championship between Dillon and West Cambria. ===Speculation on origins of names=== Some proponents of the term \\"hook and lateral\\" claim that the \\"hook\\" refers to the pattern run by the receiver who catches the pass from the quarterback. The \\"lateral\\" refers to the pitching of the ball by the receiver to his teammate. This is not synonymous with a \\"ladder\\", which is a specific route (also called a \\"chair\\") in which a receiver cuts out before turning up the field along the sideline. If the \\"hook\\" receiver laterals the ball to a teammate running a ladder route, the play could accurately be described as a \\"hook and ladder\\". This would not be true of many hook and lateral plays; in the case of the play run by the Boise State Broncos in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, the player who received the lateral from the \\"hook\\" receiver was running a slant route across the center of the field rather than a ladder route. On the January 2, 2007 broadcast of ESPN's Around the Horn, sportswriter Woody Paige claimed, perhaps facetiously, that the name \\"hook and ladder\\" originated with NYC Firemen Football Team in Hell's Kitchen, New York. This was in response to the other panelists ridiculing his use of \\"hook and ladder\\" rather than \\"hook and lateral\\". The next day, Jay Mariotti claimed the phrase \\"hook and ladder\\" referred to coal mining in Pennsylvania in the 1930s ‚Äî his research claims that coal miners need a hook and ladder when trapped in a mine. Another possible explanation is that \\"hook and ladder\\" is just a corruption of the phrase \\"hook and lateral\\". A \\"hook and ladder\\" is a common name for a firetruck, which used to carry various hooks and ladders. The analogies that could be drawn to this play based on a \\"hook\\" route (with or without an actual \\"lateral\\") and a \\"hook and ladder\\" apparatus are numerous. Long extension ladders include two or more pieces, perhaps the first piece being a \\"hook\\" route, and the second piece being a run up the \\"ladder\\" to the end-zone. The second part of the play is sometimes accomplished with a hand-off, and not a lateral at all. Notwithstanding, there does not seem to be any definitive proof of what the play was originally called or why. ==References== ==External links== * Ten Wild Plays in NFL History at yesbutnobutyes.com Category:American football plays ","title":"Hook and ladder (football)"},{"id":"1431759","text":"The Japanese grosbeak (Eophona personata) or Ikaruga is a finch native to the East Palearctic.

Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the culmen is . The signature feature of the Japanese grosbeak is its large, pointed bright yellow bill. The adult grosbeak has a large black marking extending from the nape to the chin and ear-coverts to the neck. The side of the neck is a contrasting pale whitish grey. The bird's underside is a more dull grey. The back is greyish-brown while the flanks are washed with a gingery or tawny- brown colour. The wings and tail are black but for a white patch on the inner- coverts and band of white in the middle of the primaries, which is visible in flight. Juveniles are a duller grey overall with no black on head. The subspecies, E. p. magnostris is slightly larger than the nominate race. It is also generally paler in tone with a smaller white patch the on primaries. Among the vocalizations issued by Japanese grosbeaks include a short but hard tak tak note given in flight. The song of these birds consists of a series of four flutey whistles. ==Ecology== The alternate subspecies (E. p. magnostris) is completely migratory, breeding around the Amur, Ural and Manchurian regions and then wintering down in Hebei and Beijing, uncommonly ranging south towards North Korea. The nominate race occurs in Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu and is not as seasonally migratory but does wander considerably during winter, largely in pursuit of food sources. The Japanese grosbeak is locally common, occasionally being abundant around prime feeding areas. It occurs in deciduous or mixed forests. More commonly, it is a bird of valleys rather than hillsides. This species also turns up in woods and groves of oak and birch and well-wooded parks and gardens. The species may winter on the edge of cultivated areas. The Japanese grosbeak usually occurs in pairs or small flocks. Behaviourally, it can be deceptively secretive, often staying hidden in foliage near the tree canopy. However, its location may regularly be betrayed by its voice. Mostly, the grosbeak feeds on variety of seeds and insects. During winter, they mainly live on cedar nuts, but also will feed on birch seeds and berries. During the summer, they become largely insectivorous and regularly eat caterpillars and beetles. ==References== *Finches and Sparrows by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (1999). .

Manumatic refers to a torque converter automatic transmission that allows convenient driver control of gear selection. For most of automotive history, automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or column shifter, usually to limit the transmission from shifting beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of overdrive gears when towing. Manumatics enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel-mounted paddle-shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \\"manual mode\\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \\"upshift/downshift\\" manner. Different car manufacturers use a variety of labels for their manumatic transmissions, such as 'Tiptronic,' 'Geartronic,' 'Touchshift,' 'Sportronic,' and others. Some manumatic and automated manuals transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. Hydraulically-coupled Manumatics and most automated manual transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few manumatics also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \\"sport\\" mode, where gear selection is still fully-automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by upshifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing. ==Two-pedal operation== The Automotive Products Manumatic and Newtondrive systems are also known as \\"two-pedal transmissions\\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. At one time, Manumatic solely referred to an older type of \\"clutchless\\" semi-automatic transmission with an automatic clutch system, but today, the term \\"manumatic\\" generally just refers to standard torque converter automatic transmissions, with the ability to override the transmission computer, and select gears \\"manually,\\" via the electronics. ;Manumatic A clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever moved, the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.Staton Abbey (ed) Practical Automobile Engineering Clutch Systems p 193-194 ;Newtondrive The Newtondrive system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from the clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. The systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the Ford Anglia. ==Tradenames== *Acura: Sequential SportShift *Alfa Romeo: Sportronic, Q-System, Q-Tronic *Alpina: Switchtronic *Aston Martin: Touchtronic *Audi: Tiptronic *BMW: Steptronic *Chevrolet: TAPshift *Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram: AutoStick *Ford (Australia): Sequential Sports Shift *Ford (USA): SelectShift *Holden: Active Select *Honda: S-matic, MultiMatic, SportShift *Hyundai: Shiftronic, HIVEC H-Matic *Infiniti: Manual Shift Mode *Jaguar: Bosch Mechatronic *Kia: Sportmatic *Lancia: Comfortronic *Land Rover: CommandShift *Lexus: E-Shift *Lincoln: SelectShift *Mazda: ActiveMatic, SportMatic (North America) *Mercedes-Benz: TouchShift, G Tronic *MG-Rover: Steptronic *Mitsubishi: INVECS, INVECS II, INVECS III, Sportronic, Tiptronic, Allshift *Nissan: Xtronic (also used in \\"Xtronic CVT\\"), DualMatic M-ATx *Opel / Vauxhall: ActiveSelect, Tiptronic *Peugeot: Tiptronic *Pontiac: TACshift (Touch Activated Control), TAPshift (Touch Activated Power), Driver Shift Control (DSC) *Porsche: Tiptronic, Tiptronic S *Proton: PROTRONIC *Saturn: TAPshift *SEAT: Tiptronic *Subaru: Sportshift (a system developed and name used under license from Prodrive Ltd.) *Toyota: ECT *UD Trucks: ESCOT (Usually found on UD Big Thumb and UD Quon) *Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles: Tiptronic *Volkswagen Passenger Cars: Tiptronic *Volvo Cars: Geartronic ===Tiptronic=== Tiptronic is a registered trademark, owned by German carmaker Porsche, who license it for use by other manufacturers, such as Land Rover and the full Volkswagen Group (Audi, SEAT, ≈†koda, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche Volkswagen and Mitsubishi). Many people use the term \\"Tiptronic\\" to refer generically to any type of torque converter automatic transmission that incorporates a manual upshift/downshift feature. A Tiptronic transmission can operate in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission, but also offers the driver an additional method of manually overriding the automatic shift changes. By moving the shift lever into a second operating plane of the shift gate, equipped with two spring-loaded positions: \\"upshift\\" and \\"downshift\\", the driver takes over most of the gear shifting decisions, which would ordinarily be performed by the transmission's computer. For example, this allows delayed upshifts for increased acceleration, increased engine braking, gear holding in curves, downshifting before passing, or early upshifting for cruising. On some models, the upshift and downshift operations can also be controlled by push-buttons or \\"paddle-shifters\\" installed on the steering wheel, with an optional display in the instrument panel indicating the current gear selection. Since adding Tiptronic to an automated manual transmission involves an additional shift gate into the computer and update to the transmission software, it is inexpensive and lightweight to implement. Although Tiptronic transmissions allow the driver a certain measure of discrete control, the Tiptronic design is implemented using a torque converter like other automatic transmissions. A true Tiptronic transmission is not a computer-controlled automated manual transmission (with a conventional clutch), or even a semi-automatic transmission. Most Tiptronic implementations still make some shifts automatically, primarily to protect the engine and transmission. For example, as used by licensee Audi, the five-speed Tiptronic will automatically make the upshift from 1 to 2 when moving off from a stop, even when in manual mode; the transmission then waits for the user's upshift command before proceeding from 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 5, although the transmission will still upshift if the redline is approached. On deceleration, the transmission will make all downshifts automatically when close to the tick-over or idle speed, to prevent the engine from stalling at too-low an RPM, although the user can accelerate any downshift that would not exceed the redline. Most luxury vehicles with a Tiptronic transmission have two fully automatic modes: the primary mode, identified as \\"Drive\\", \\"Comfort\\" or similar; and another, usually called \\"Sport,\\" which delays upshifts higher up the engine rev range (and will also downshift higher up the rev range) for a sportier driving and enhanced engine braking ‚Äî at the expense of fuel, wear, comfort, and noise. Furthermore, because modern Tiptronic-type transmissions use an electronic control unit (ECU), sometimes specifically referred to as the transmission control unit, the transmissions are able to adapt to the user's driving style through \\"fuzzy logic\\". Shift points are tailored to the habits of the driver, through an evolutionary process. ===Tiptronic S=== The Tiptronic S is an upgrade to the original Tiptronic, with the ability to adapt to driver's behaviour, and also allows driver to change gears without entering manual mode. In manual mode, if there is no driver input for a period of eight seconds, the system reverts to automatic mode. It was used as early as 2000 in the Porsche Boxster. In the Porsche Cayenne, the Tiptronic S was upgraded to six-speed. ==See also== *Dual clutch transmission (DCT) *Automated manual transmission == References == Category:Automotive transmission technologies Category:Automobile transmissions ","title":"Manumatic"},{"id":"1431771","text":"The Saint Olav Drama, 2003 P√•l Christian Eggen acting as king Olaf II of Norway in The Saint Olav Drama at Stiklestad 2014.

She is known for her Tuvan throat singing or Kh√∂√∂mei. ==Style== Namtchylak is an experimental singer, born in 1957 in a secluded village in the south of Tuva. She is proficient in overtone singing; her music encompasses avant-jazz, electronica, modern composition and Tuvan influences. In Tuva, numerous cultural influences collide: the Turkic roots and culture it shares with Central Asian states, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Bashkortostan and Tatarstan; the strong Mongolic cultural influence and traditions it shares with Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Buryatia and Kalmykia; the cultural influences from the various Siberian nomadic ethnic groups such as Samoyeds, Yeniseians, Evenks and from the Russian Old Believers, the migrant and resettled populations from Ukraine, Tatarstan and other minority groups west of the Urals. All of these, to extents, impact on Namtchylak's voice, although the Siberian influences dominate: her thesis produced while studying voice, first at the University of Kyzyl, then in the Gnesins Institute in Moscow during the 1980s focussed on Lamaistic and cult musics of minority groups across Siberia, and her music frequently shows tendencies towards Tungus-style imitative singing. Being the daughter of a pair of schoolteachers, she grew up in an isolated village on the Tuvan/Mongolian border, exposed to the local overtone singing ‚Äì something that was generally reserved for the males; in fact, females were actively discouraged from learning it (even now, the best-known practitioners remain male, artists like Huun-Huur-Tu and Yat-Kha). However, she learned much of her traditional repertoire from her grandmother, and went on to study music at the local college, but she was denied professional qualifications. Quietly she studied the overtone singing, as well as the shamanic traditions of the region, before leaving for study further in Moscow (Tuva was, at that time, part of the U.S.S.R.). Her degree completed, she returned to Tuva where she became a member of Sayani, the Tuvan state folk ensemble, before abandoning it to return to Moscow and joining the experimental Tri-O, where her vocal talents and sense of melodic and harmonic adventure could wander freely. That first brought her to the West in 1990, although her first recorded exposure came with the Crammed Discs compilation Out of Tuva. Once the Soviet Union had collapsed, she moved to Vienna, making it her base, although she traveled widely, working in any number of shifting groups and recording a number of discs that revolved around free improvisation ‚Äì not unlike Yoko Ono ‚Äì as well as performing around the globe. It was definitely fringe music, although Namtchylak established herself very firmly as a fixture on that fringe. In 1997 she was the victim of an attack that left her in a coma for several weeks. Initially she thought it was some divine retribution for her creative hubris, and seemed to step back when she recorded 1998's Naked Spirit, which had new age leanings. However, by 2000 she seemed to have overcome that block, releasing Stepmother City, her most accessible work to date, where she seemed to really find her stride, mixing traditional Tuvan instruments and singing with turntables and effects, placing her in a creative firmament between Yoko and Bj√∂rk, but with the je ne sais quoi of Mongolia as part of the bargain. A showcase at the WOMEX Festival in Berlin brought her to the attention of many, and in 2001 a U.S. tour was planned. ==Career== After graduating, Namtchylak worked with several ensembles: the Moscow State Orchestra; the Moscow-based jazz ensemble Tri-O (since 1989); School of Dramatic Art under the direction of Anatoly Vasiliev (Moscow), various orchestras in Kyzyl, the Tuvan 'folkloric orchestra'‚Äîa far less sanitised example of folk baroque than, say, existed in pre-independence Kazakhstan‚Äîthat has housed many of Tuva's other important singers. However, for several years Namtchylak annually invited foreign musicians to Tuva to promote Tuvan culture. Based in Vienna, Namtchylak sculpted Stepmother City to reflect her ambivalent feelings about European metropolis. Calling herself \\"first and foremost a woman from the Steppes,\\" Namtchylak's first musical inspiration came from her nomadic grandmother, who would sing lullabies for hours. She grew up in a culture where people just sing when they feel like it‚Äîsinging when they‚Äôre happy and singing when they‚Äôre sad. Denied professional credentials from a local college where her explorative nature led her toward forbidden male-dominated overtone singing styles, Namtchylak transferred to Moscow where she discovered Russian improvisation and where she also continue to study about vocal techniques of Siberian lamaistic and shamanistic traditions. Audiences are astounded by the diversity of sounds Namtchylak can produce with her voice, from operatic soprano to birdlike squawks, from childlike pleas to soulful crooning; which at various moments elicit comparisons to Zap Mama, Patti Smith, Billie Holiday, and Nina Hagen. In 1997, Namtchylak was horrifically attacked by Tuvinian racketeers which left her in a coma for two weeks. Again, sources regarding this contradict ‚Äì others maintain that she underwent surgery for a severe malignant brain tumor; regardless, 1997 marked an appreciable change in her life. Since then, she has been resident in exile in Vienna, and has also recorded more prolifically as a solo artist ‚Äì although she has released over thirty albums in the past twenty years, only seven have been entirely solo. Namtchylak claims that music and spirituality are related by desire, or the tension that yells to reawaken people. Eager to take part in the process of remembering what has been forgotten, Stepmother City presents itself like a map, proposing routes to connect Western physicality with Eastern spirituality.http://www.ponderosa.it/downloads/0000/0134/SAINKHO_NAMTCHYLAK_BIO_ENG.pdf In 2005, the Italian publishing house Libero di Scrivere released a book of poetry Karmaland.

Most of Yerofeyev's childhood was spent in Kirovsk, Murmansk Oblast. He managed to enter the philology department of the Moscow State University but was expelled from the university after a year and a half because he did not attend compulsory military training. Later he studied in several more institutes in different towns, including Kolomna and Vladimir, but he never managed to graduate from any, usually being expelled due to his \\"amoral behaviour\\". Between 1958 and 1975, Yerofeyev lived without propiska in various towns in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, also spending some time in Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, doing different low-level and underpaid jobs; for a time he lived and worked in the Muromtsev Dacha in Moscow. He started writing at the age of 17; in the 1960s he unsuccessfully submitted several articles on Ibsen and Hamsun to literary magazines. ==Literary legacy== Yerofeyev is best known for his 1969 \\"poem in prose\\" (ironical assignment of the genre) Moscow-Petushki (several English translations exist, including Moscow to the End of the Line and Moscow Stations). It is an account of a journey from Moscow to Petushki (Vladimir Oblast) by electric train, one of many futile attempts to visit his small son: each time such a journey becomes soaked in alcohol and fails. During the trip, the hero becomes involved in philosophical discussions about drinking, recounts some of the fantastic escapades he participated in, including declaring war on Norway, charting the drinking statistics of his colleagues when leader of a cable-laying crew, and obsessing about the woman he loves. Referred to by David Remnick as \\"the comic high-water mark of the Brezhnev era\\", the poem was published for the first time in 1973 in a Russian-language magazine in Jerusalem. It was not published in the Soviet Union until 1989. Of note is his smaller 1988 work My Little Leniniana (–ú–æ—è –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞—è –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∏–∞–Ω–∞, Moya malenkaya Leniniana), which is a collection of quotations from Lenin's works and letters, which shows the unpleasant parts of the character of the \\"leader of the proletariat\\".

In 1966 Yerofeyev's wife, Valentina Zimakova gave birth to a son - Venedikt Venediktovich Yerofeyev. Galina Nosova died three years after Yerofeyev - having thrown herself off the balcony of her 13th floor apartment in Moscow. In 1985 Yerofeyev was diagnosed with throat cancer. Doctors operated on him, after which he could only speak using an electro-larynx. A film was made about Moskva-Petushki in the last years of Yerofeyev's life and he can be seen speaking with the help of this apparatus. (eg. at 7:00) Yerofeyev died five years after he was first diagnosed with the disease, on 11 May 1990, at the Russian Oncological Centre in Moscow.

Local clubs (usually called \\"New Years Associations\\") compete in one of five categories (Comics, Wench Brigades, Fancies, String bands, and Fancy Brigades). They prepare elaborate costumes, performance routines, and movable scenery, which take months to complete. This is done in clubhousesmany of which are on or near 2nd Street (called \\"Two Street\\" by some local residents) in the Pennsport neighborhood of the city's South Philadelphia sectionwhich also serve as social gathering places for members. The parade has been broadcast since 1993 on WPHL-TV, which has live streamed the event on its website since 2011. After a national campaign to get the parade nationally televised, an edited two-hour broadcast of the parade was picked up by WGN America and WGN-TV; the broadcast debuted January 3, 2009. The parade has been critiqued by local residents, academics, and the media for its racist depiction of minority groups, which, despite an official ban on blackface effective in 1964, has continued to include blackface, brownface, or redface caricatures and other racial and ethnic impersonation, as of 2020's parade.DuComb, Christian.

Philadelphia Department of Recreation. The parade is related to the Mummers Play tradition from Britain and Ireland. Revivals of this tradition are still celebrated annually in South Gloucestershire, England on Boxing Day along with other locations in England and in parts of Ireland on St. Stephen's Day and also in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador around Christmas. Swedes and Finns, the first European colonists in the Philadelphia area, brought the custom of visiting neighbors on \\"Second Day Christmas\\" (December 26) with them to Tinicum. This was soon extended through New Year's Day with costumed celebrants loudly parading through the city.\\"The Philadelphia Tradition\\" . Philadelphia Mummers Association. Retrieved November 27, 2007. They appointed a \\"speech director\\", who performed a special dance with a traditional rhyme: The Mummers derive their name from the Mummers' plays performed in Philadelphia in the 18th century as part of a wide variety of working class street celebrations around Christmas. By the early 19th century, these coalesced with earlier Swedish customs, including the Christmas neighbor visits and possibly shooting firearms on New Year's Day (although this was common in other countries as well) as well as the Pennsylvania German custom of \\"belsnickling,\\" where adults in disguise questioned children about their behavior during the previous year. U.S. President George Washington carried on the official custom of New Year's Day calls during the seven years he occupied President's House in Philadelphia. The Mummers continued their traditions of comic verse in exchange for cakes and ale. Small groups of up to twenty mummers, their faces blackened, went door to door, shooting and shouting, and adapting the English Mummer's play by replacing the character of \\"King George\\" with that of \\"General Washington.\\" Through the 19th century, large groups of disguised (often in blackface) working class young men roamed the streets on New Year's Day, organizing \\"riotous\\" processions, firing weapons into the air, and demanding free drinks in taverns, and generally challenging middle and upper-class notions of order and decorum. An 1808 law decreed that \\"masquerades\\" and \\"masquerade halls\\" were \\"common nuisances\\" and that anyone participating would be subject to a fine and imprisonment. It was apparently never successfully enforced and was repealed in 1859.Marion, John Francis (January 1981).

Henry Muhlenberg, writing in 1839, reported, \\"Men met on the roads in Tinicum and Kingsessing, who were disguised as clowns, shouting at the top of their voices and shooting guns. Unable to suppress the custom, by the 1880s the city government began to pursue a policy of co-option, requiring participants to join organized groups with designated leaders who had to apply for permits and were responsible for their groups actions. The earliest documented club, the Chain Gang, had formed in 1840 and Golden Crown first marched in 1876 with cross-town rivals Silver Crown forming soon after. By 1881, a local report said \\"Parties of paraders\\" made the street \\"almost like a masked Ball.\\" By 1900, these groups formed part of an organized, city-sanctioned parade with cash prizes for the best performances. Southern plantation life's contributions include the parade's theme song, James A. Bland's \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\" (introduced in 1903), as well as the 19th-century cakewalk, dubbed the \\"Mummers' Strut\\" or the \\"2 Street Strut\\".

The official parade has been cancelled only twice during its history. The first cancellation happened in 1919 as a result of the aftermath of World War I and the second cancellation occurred in 1934 due to the effects of the Great Depression and a lack of prize money. As they assimilated to Philadelphia, many immigrant groups have joined the tradition. Numerous Irish immigrants and Irish-Americans from South Philadelphia became involved in the Mummers Parade as both Mummers performers and parade goers. Other ethnic groups were soon integrated into the parade through the years. Italian-Americans and Italian immigrants to South Philadelphia began to participate in the Mummers Parade in large numbers after World War II. While South Philadelphia (especially Pennsport) remains one of the most important centers for Mummers traditions and Mummers members, more recent immigrants to the neighborhood from Asia and Latin America generally have fewer ties to the parade and tradition.Hepp, Chris (August 7, 2014). \\"Mummers Parade going south?

The all African American Golden Eagle Club, formed in 1866, had 300 members in the 1906 parade, for example. Judges systematically discriminated against black clubs, however, and the last, the Octavius Catto Club, withdrew after receiving last place in the 1929 parade. The brass bands hired to accompany the Comic Brigades often include black musicians, but do not dress in costume and consider themselves session musicians rather than Mummers. By 1964, only one African American mummer, Willis Fluelling, remained. As of 2007, a few of the less traditional clubs, such as Spiral Q Puppet Theater's West Philadelphia Mummers Brigade, were integrated. The comic \\"wenches\\" and other female roles in most skits are typically performed by men in drag.

After construction was completed, the parade returned to Broad Street from 1996 to 1999. For various reasons, the parade was moved again to Market Street in 2000. In 2004, the parade was moved back to Broad Street. In 1997, the Fancy Brigades were moved to the Pennsylvania Convention Center, allowing for larger sets, but limiting audience size. In 2011, the Fancy Brigades returned to the parade.

On January 1, 2015, the Mummers began their parade route at Philadelphia‚Äôs City Hall and headed south along Broad Street to Washington Avenue. The Mummers used the Benjamin Franklin Parkway as a staging area prior to moving to City Hall to be judged. After the judging, the mummers joined the parade heading south on Broad St. The parade ended at Washington Ave, with some clubs still heading east to Second Street for the unofficial ‚ÄúTwo Street Parade‚Äù. If an all-day postponement is required for foul weather, the parade is usually held the following Saturday (or Sunday, if Saturday is inclement), as the expensive and fancy costumes are easily harmed by precipitation or high winds. Each year, there is a festival leading up to the parade called MummersFest. It allows fans to tour the Pennsylvania Convention Center to watch the Fancy Brigades build their props and practice for their New Year's Day reveal. ==2nd Street== Philadelphia Mummers Museum at 2nd St and Washington Ave Because of the large number of clubhouses there, South 2nd Street (Two Street) often serves as a party location after the parade, with the center of activity being South 2nd Street and Mifflin Street. Local residents and others in the area for the parade crowd the local bars, clubhouses and sidewalks, sometimes joining in the unofficial parade. With the parade they spent months preparing for finished, the Mummers let loose and celebrate. This multi-block party continues well into the night or early morning, with some Mummers not sleeping for twenty-four hours straight. In 2009, the city declined to pay for any post-parade celebrations on Two Street. However, Rep. Bob Brady helped secure funding for the event in the final hours. ==Controversy== The parade has often included hate speech, racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ, and culturally insensitive costumes, makeup, and images.Brennan, Chris.

In 1985, South Philadelphia String Band petitioned to use blackface and was denied. In 1987, the mayor at the time, Wilson Goode had Mummers photos removed from City Hall because the Mummers appeared to be wearing blackface. Saying the Mummers were not in blackface, a petition resulted in the photos being restored, though not near the mayor's office. In 1996, half of the string bands reported having female members. The bands' captains, though, made it clear to reporters that they did not want to let women in the bands, but felt they had to, due to declining membership. In 2003, word spread that Slick Duck Comic Brigade was working on a skit involving priests chasing altar boys. Protests from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Diocese of Camden and the Catholic League and WPHL-TV announcing they would not air the skit led to the group cancelling of the skit and claiming it was just a prank. Goodtimers Comic Brigade's 2003 entry highlighted the Mummers' continued use of blackface, skirting of the rules with brown, red, purple and blue makeup and strong references to minstral shows. Mummers have declared the alternate color choices as a direct protest of the longstanding and frequently flouted ban. The Goodtimers' stand in for Al Jolson wore dark blue makeup with kinky hair, backed by \\"a minstrel in blackface on a large poster with 'Gone Yes ‚Äî Forgotten Never.'\\" 2009's B. Love Strutters Brigade referenced Joey Vento of Geno‚Äôs Steaks 2008 charges of discrimination filed by the city's Commission on Human Relations. In the skit, \\"'Aliens of an Illegal Kind,' Arabs had long beards and turbans, Mexicans wore sombreros, and Asian women were depicted as geishas.\\" In 2013, The Ferko String Band offered \\"Ferko's Bringing Back the Minstrel Days\\" and Venetian NYA club presented \\"Indi-sourcing\\", showing a call center with members dressed as Indians being raided by members dressed as Native Americans and moving the call center to New Jersey. 2015's parade again featured blackface, along with a satire of the Black Lives Matter titled \\"Wench Lives Matter\\". In 2016 a group presented a Mexican-themed skit, with all of the performers wearing brownface. The same year, Finnegan New Years Brigade presented a Caitlyn Jenner skit showing her pre-transition on the cover of Wheaties box and after transitioning on the cover of a Froot Loops box. A male Mummer, dressed as Jenner, appeared, mocking her Vanity Fair cover announcing she was transgender. News reports showed a Mummer with the Wheaties/Froot Loops sign screaming \\"fuck the gays!\\" Social media posts led to two of the Mummers being fired from their day-to-day jobs and ousted from the club. Additional skits that year featured multiple \\"Lives Matter\\" references and appearances of blackface. In 2020, after members of Froggy Car Wench Brigade wore blackface for the parade, mayor Jim Kenney said the city would end the parade \\"if Mummers leadership does not make immediate changes to better control the parade\\". City Councilmember Cindy Bass introduced a bill that would hit Mummers who wore blackface with a $75 fine and a five year ban from the parade. ==See also== *Culture of Philadelphia *List of holiday parades ==References== ==Further reading== * (reviewed with excerpt in Chronicle of Higher Education.

According to adh-Dhahabi, the Buwayhid Sultan Jalal ad-Dawla fled there in 1031 to escape a slave revolt. Famous native sons include: * the great Islamic grammarian, philologist, and religious scholar Abul-Baqa Al-Ukbari (ca. 1143-1219), author of some 60 works, many of them recently reprinted; * Ibn Makula, author of an early dictionary of names, born Sha'ban 5, 421 AH * Sheikh al-Mufid * two notable early Jewish/Karaite \\"heresiarchs\\", leaders of Karaite movements opposed to Anan ben David, Ishmael al-Ukbari and Meshwi al-Ukbari. It is described in many Arabic geographical works, beginning with the famous 9th- century geography of Ibn Khordadhbeh, which mentions it four times, stating that: * it was on the postal road from Samarra to Baghdad, nine stages from Samarra and six from Baghdad; * it was on the road from Baghdad to Mosul, 9 parasangs from Baghdad (5 from the previous stop, al-Bardan, and 3 from the next, Bahimsha); * it was on the westward road from Baghdad, 4 stages from al- Bardan (6 from Baghdad) and 7 from the next stop, Samarra. (The seeming contradiction between points 1 and 3 is found in the text, as provided by http://www.alwaraq.com/ .) However, the tenth-century al-Muqaddasi goes into a little more detail, saying that: : ŸàŸÅŸä Ÿàÿ¨Ÿá ÿ≥ÿßŸÖÿ±ÿß ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿπŸÉÿ®ÿ±ÿß ŸàŸáŸä ŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿπÿßŸÖÿ±ÿ©ÿå ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅŸàÿßŸÉŸá ÿ¨ŸäÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿπŸÜÿßÿ® ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ© : And in front of Samarra is the town of Ukbara, which is large and populous, with abundant fruit and good grapes. (p. 42, al-Waraq online edition) The twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi is briefer, mentioning it twice. The Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela (twelfth century) also mentions it, calling it \\"Okbara, the city which Jeconiah the King built, where there are about 10,000 Jews, and at their head are R. Chanan, R. Jabin and R.

It is home to Trinity College's oldest student societies: the University Philosophical Society (the Phil), the College Historical Society (the Hist) and the College Theological Society (the Theo). ==Construction and design== Campanile before 1899. The Graduates Memorial Building, originally named the Graduates' Tercentenary Memorial Building, was constructed to celebrate three hundred years of Trinity College, Dublin's existence. In May 1897, tenders were invited by Trinity College, Dublin, to design a replacement for the residential buildings known as Rotten Row. These buildings were almost architecturally indistinguishable from The Rubrics, which stood from circa 1700. Designs were submitted by Robert John Stirling, Thomas Newenham Deane and Sir Thomas Drew, with Drew's being selected. The design of the building is such that it is divided into three houses: House 28, and House 30, as student residences, with House 29 in the centre of the building, being used by the societies. In 1899 Rotten Row was demolished and work began on the new building. Its construction was largely financed by subscriptions from graduates, and was opened on 31 May 1902. ==Interior== The building has a vast interior, largely dedicated to debating, scholarly endeavour and use by the three societies who occupy it. It has various rooms spread over its four floors. The central foyer contains a large wooden staircase, which stretches vertically from the ground floor to the second floor. ===Ground Floor=== The ground floor houses its Debating Chamber, frequently used by The Phil and The Hist, specifically designed for oratory purposes, with its two-floor high ceiling, carved balcony and Ionic pilasters. On the chamber's west wall is a bronze relief of George Ferdinand Shaw former Librarian of the Phil and Senior Fellow of the College. The conversation room of the University Philosophical Society is also on the ground floor, and provides its membership with a meeting area to sit, talk, and relax. Its conversation room also plays host to the society's paper reading sub-group, The Bram Stoker Club. Halfway between the ground floor and first floor is the Phil's council room, which has the only access to the debating chamber's balcony. Further up the stairs and facing onto Library Square is a large stained glass window depicting Epaminondas and Demosthenes, the greatest of all the Greek orators. It was dedicated to the memory of Marshall Porter, a university graduate killed in the Boer War. ===First floor=== On the first floor is the College Historical Society's conversation room, used to provide its members with a relaxed meeting place. The society also has its committee room on this floor, which has a higher ceiling and larger windows the one below. Trinity College tradition holds that the rooms of the society's founder Edmund Burke, were in House 28 of Rotten Row, Library square, and as such, part of the location upon which the building stands today. The Hist Conversation Room was used as a location in the film Educating Rita. ===Second floor=== The second floor contains the Bram Stoker room, owned by the University Philosophical Society, which is used as the society's office space as well as small archival library. The society also grants almost full access to this room to the College Theological Society as a gesture of good faith between both societies. Beyond a pair large doors that exit off the foyer are the buildings and two large billiards rooms, jointly owned and operated between both The Phil and The Hist. ===Third floor=== The third floor houses one of the college's computer rooms. Directly opposite to which is a library shared by the Phil and the Hist, which contains part of the societies' large collections of books and records. ==Fire of December 2000== The upper floors of the building were damaged by a fire on Friday 15 December 2000, for a time threatening the societies with bankruptcy. ==References== ==External links== *Irish Arichectural Archive *University Philosophical Society *College Historical Society *College Theological Society Category:Buildings and structures of Trinity College Dublin ","title":"Graduates Memorial Building"},{"id":"1431862","text":"La Colombe may refer to: *La Colombe, Loir-et-Cher, a commune in the Loir-et- Cher d√©partement, France *La Colombe, Manche, a commune in the Manche d√©partement, France *La Colombe (cabaret), a Parisian cabaret in the sixties, France *La colombe, an opera by Charles Gounod (1860) *La Colombe (Picasso), a lithograph of a dove *\\"La Colombe\\" (song), a song by Jacques Brel *La Colombe Coffee Roasters, a coffee company headquartered in Philadelphia ==Related== *Colombe, a commune in the Is√®re d√©partement, France *Colombe-l√®s-Vesoul, a commune in the Haute-Sa√¥ne d√©partement, France *Colombes, a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine d√©partement, France ","title":"La Colombe"},{"id":"1431866","text":"Anim8or is a freeware OpenGL-based 3D modeling and animation program by R.

Anim8or's mascot is a simple red robin, aptly named as Robin, that most users learn to model and animate in Anim8or's \\"A Simple Walk Tutorial\\". Users are often also very familiar with the eggplant, a model first designed by Steven to demonstrate 3D printers at SIGGRAPH. It is likely the first model most Anim8or modellers have ever created, as it is taught in the introductory tutorial to demonstrate the basics of the modeler and the tools available. == Layout == Anim8or's interface is separated into four sections, each with its own tool set: * Object editor - individual objects are stored and edited within the object editor. Objects may be composed of primitives such as spheres, or more complex shapes made by extruding polygons along the z axis and adjusting the vertexes. Materials are then applied, per face if desired. The user also has the option to make morph targets for each object. * Figure editor - in order to animate more complex models, they can be given a skeleton. Users can give each \\"bone\\" the ability to rotate on all 3 axes within certain limits and attach individual objects to each bone. * Sequence editor - this is an extension of the figure editor, allowing the use of key frame animation to animate individual bones with a degree of accuracy of 0.1¬∞. * Scene editor - elements from the three other sections are imported and arranged in the scene editor. The key frames from the sequence editor can be modified, along with other variables, such as a figure's position in 3D space or the state of a morph target. An image can be rendered in any of the four editors, but only in the scene editor can lights and other graphical elements be used. The interface is a mixture of Windows' native interface, for such elements as the right-click context menu, and one specific to Anim8or, such as the graphical icons in the left-hand toolbar. == Features == Although it is not as powerful as high-end commercial programs, it contains many features that are important to a 3D computer graphics package while remaining free. Such features include: * 3D Modeler with primitives such as spheres, cubes, and cylinders * Mesh modification and subdivision * Splines, extrusions, lathing, modifiers, bevelling and warping * TrueType font support allowing for 2D and 3D text * The ability to import .3DS, .LWO and .OBJ files for modification * The ability to export .3DS, .OBJ, .VTX and .C files for use in external programs * Plug-in support, using the Anim8or Scripting Language, also known as ASL for short * 3D object browser to allow the user to view 3D files in a specified directory * Textures in .BMP, .GIF and .JPG formats * Environment maps, bump maps, transparency, specularity amongst others * Character editor with joints * Morph targets * Renderer supporting fog, infinite, local and spot lights, anti-aliasing, alpha channels and depth channels * Printing directly from the program * Volumetric Shadows as well as ray traced hard and soft shadows as well as ambient occlusion support. * A plain text file format, allowing for the development of external tools such as Terranim8or * Hierarchies == System requirements == As far as multimedia standards go, Anim8or has very low system requirements. However, certain features, particularly shadows, anti-aliasing and Anim8or's resident ray tracer quickly become burdens on a computer's resources. While originally designed to work with Windows, users have reported running it successfully on Apple computers with Virtual PC and on Linux with WINE. This may be partially due to Anim8or's stand-alone design. This means that it can be pasted onto a USB memory stick or other removable media and run directly from it on any computer that meets the minimum specification. The minimum requirements are: * 300 MHz Processor * Windows 95 or higher * OpenGL graphics card with full ICD support * 64 MB of RAM (128 MB recommended, 256 MB with Windows XP) * 5 MB of hard drive space (the application is less than 3 MB, but the manual and project/texture files can occupy several times this space). == References Winsite Download Page Category:Windows-only freeware Category:Freeware 3D graphics software Category:3D animation software Category:Portable software Category:1999 software Category:3D graphics software ","title":"Anim8or"},{"id":"1431875","text":"Chiliomodi () is a village in eastern Corinthia, Peloponnese, Greece.

Haupttruppf√ºhrer was mainly used as a rank of the Sturmabteilung (SA), but was also used by the Schutzstaffel (SS) in the early days of that group‚Äôs existence. As an SA rank, Haupttruppf√ºhrer was created from the much older Freikorps title of Truppf√ºhrer. Haupttruppf√ºhrer was considered a senior most paramilitary enlisted rank, below the first officer position of Sturmf√ºhrer. A Haupttruppf√ºhrer typically served as the senior non-commissioned officer of SA regiments, known as Standarten, and the rank was the approximate equivalent to sergeant major. Haupttruppf√ºhrer translated as \\"head troop leader\\" and was considered senior to the rank of Obertruppf√ºhrer. Between 1930 and 1934, Haupttruppf√ºhrer was also used as a rank of the SS and was held by senior SS non-commissioned officers much the same as the position was used within the SA. In 1934, Haupttruppf√ºhrer was abolished as an SS rank and renamed as SS- Sturmscharf√ºhrer. The original insignia for Haupttruppf√ºhrer consisted of two collar pips and a silver stripe, centered on a collar patch. After 1932, due to an expansion of both the SA and SS rank system, the insignia was modified to display two silver stripes.

It occupies a hilly peninsula northwest of downtown. Magnolia has been a part of the city since 1891. A good portion of the peninsula is taken up by Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton. Magnolia is isolated from the rest of Seattle, connected by road to the rest of the city by only three bridges over the tracks of the BNSF Railway: W. Emerson Place in the north, W. Dravus Street in the center, and W. Garfield Street (the Magnolia Bridge) in the south ‚Äî the Salmon Bay Bridge to Ballard is rail-only, no motorized traffic is permitted to cross the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and the W. Fort Street bridge over the railroad tracks only affords access to the W. Commodore Way industrial area (traffic to the rest of the city from that area still needs to take the W. Emerson Place bridge.) ==Boundaries== Magnolia is bounded on the north by Salmon Bay and Shilshole Bay of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, across which is Ballard; on the west by Puget Sound and Elliott Bay; on the south by Elliott Bay and Smith Cove; and on the east by the BNSF Railway and the Port of Seattle's Terminal 91, beyond which is Interbay. Although magnolia trees do line W. McGraw Street in the neighborhood's commercial district, Magnolia's naming was actually a misnomer. It was named by Captain George Davidson of the U.S. Coast Survey in 1856, who reportedly mistook the plentiful madrona trees for magnolias.Meany, Edmond S., Origins of Washington Historical Names, Seattle: Univ of Washington Press, 1923, p. 157; Phillips, James W. Washington State Place Names, Seattle: Univ of Washington Press, 1971 Groups are actively working to save the remaining madronas on the bluff. On Magnolia's south end is Magnolia Park, overlooking Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, and the city skyline. It features a picnic area and tennis courts across the street. Also in Magnolia are Smith Cove and its marina. Discovery Park, in the northwest, encompasses and is Seattle's largest park. The park is home to eagles, herons, falcons, and beavers. Seven miles of trails provide visitors with a wilderness experience and views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Parts of Fort Lawton, such as the officer's homes and other historic buildings, remain in the park. Discovery Park has extensive beaches wrapping around West Point, the westernmost point in Seattle, and West Point hosts a lighthouse which guides ships into Seattle's harbour, Elliott Bay. Adjacent to Discovery Park is West Point, featuring the West Point Lighthouse, which was built in 1881 and is the oldest lighthouse in the area. Walking trails descend from the park to two miles (3 km) of beach and the lighthouse. West Point also contains one of Seattle's sewage treatment facilities, and several archaeological sites. ==Highlights== Another highlight is the local branch of the Seattle Public Library, designed in 1964 by architects Paul Hayden Kirk and Richard Haag, who won top awards for design from the American Library Association. In the children's section is a statue of a young girl titled \\"Girl Holding Doves,\\" designed by Ebba Rapp McLauchlan. Outside hangs a bronze wall sculpture titled \\"Activity of Thought,\\" an abstract piece of art designed especially for the library by Glenn Alps. The library is furnished with solid walnut tables and chairs custom designed by George Nakashima. Magnolia's business district, called \\"the Village\\" by locals, is home to many specialty stores and professional services, some of Seattle's top restaurants, and industrial and marine services. In the summer, there is a farmers market held on Saturdays in the Magnolia Village. There are three Seattle Public Schools in Magnolia: Lawton Elementary, Magnolia Elementary, and Catherine Blaine K-8. ==Neighborhoods== According to the Seattle City Clerk's office, Magnolia comprises three neighborhoods (see map): *Lawton Park ‚Äì The northern half of Magnolia *Briarcliff ‚Äì The southwestern quarter of Magnolia *Southeast Magnolia ‚Äì The southeastern quarter of Magnolia File:Seattle - Magnolia map.jpgMap of Magnolia Image:BNSFtracks-kiwanisravine-seattle.jpgBNSF Railway tracks just north of Kiwanis Ravine File:Magnolia Park, Washington - tree and bench.jpgPark in Magnolia ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 19,156 people, 9,077 households, and 4,828 families residing in the neighborhood.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.3% of the population. There were 9,077 households, out of which 20.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.2% were married couples living together, 5.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.8% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10 and the average family size was 2.73. In the neighborhood the population was spread out, with 17.0% under the age of 18, 7.6% from 18 to 24, 34.8% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

Hamilton, from the point at which it was first colonized by settlers, has benefited from its geographical proximity to major land and water transportation routes along the Niagara Peninsula and Lake Ontario. Its strategic importance has created, by Canadian standards, a rich military history which the city preserves. Tension between maximizing economic growth and minimizing environmental damage was evident, even from the city's early development. The area between Burlington Bay (also known as Hamilton Harbour) and the Niagara Escarpment has been greatly altered for residential, industrial and recreational purposes. Cootes Paradise in Dundas also known as the Dundas Marsh, was a very rich wetland with plenty of fish, birds and other game. Cootes Paradise was named after Captain Thomas Coote, a British army officer of Irish extraction who was stationed in the area at the time of the American revolutionary war in the 18th century. The richness of the valley led to population, and to degradation of the marsh, although its legal protection, starting in the 1880s, and the efforts of civic officials and others, have led to it still being of great environmental importance in the 21st century. For about a century after achieving its status as a city in 1846, Hamilton has seen itself in terms of industrial production. It adopted or acquired such nicknames as the Ambitious City, Steel City and the Birmingham of Canada. However, after this period, other sectors of the economy took over and Hamilton became a post-industrial economy but failed to change its image and self-image to match. Here then follows the growth of the Hamilton until the end of the Second World War. Prior to colonization, Hamilton was occupied by the Chonnonton, or Attiwandaronk, an Iroquois-speaking nation referred to by French explorers as the \\"Neutral\\" people.Nobel, William, \\"The Neutral\\" Historica Canada, Last Edited December 16, 2013 Since then, there have been successive waves of immigration. ==Pre-1811== Statue commemorating the United Empire Loyalists in Downtown Hamilton. Loyalists fleeing from the American Revolutionary War were the first Europeans to settle the area. Like most of the Americas south of the water line, the original inhabitants of the Hamilton area were Native North American Aboriginal peoples. The first European to visit what is now Hamilton was probably √âtienne Br√ªl√© in 1616. Lasalle also visited the area, a fact commemorated at a park in nearby Burlington. In pre- became Upper Canada in 1791 and ultimately Ontario in 1867. These included Brant‚Äôs Ford (now Brantford) on the Grand River in Brant County south of Hamilton, and Brant‚Äôs Block (now Burlington) in Halton County north of Hamilton. The United Empire Loyalists moved into the Hamilton area during and after the American War of Independence as well, dramatically boosting the population and economic development of the region between the original Upper Canadian capital at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) and the new one at York (now Toronto). This was to prove crucial, for the fighting between the United States and Britain was not yet over. Administratively, the whole area was part of the Nassau District, which was renamed the Home District in 1792. Additionally, parts of the area were separately incorporated into the West Riding of York County and First Riding of Lincoln County. In 1798, most of the future Hamilton became part of Niagara District while remaining in Lincoln County. ==1812‚Äì1844== The town of Hamilton was conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hughson, a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. James Durand, the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly, was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly and a new Gore District was established of which the Hamilton town site was a member. As such, Hamilton's future seemed to be shaped by a private collaboration of Hamilton, Hughson and Durand. Initially the Town of Hamilton was not the dominant center of the Gore District. A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832 when a cut-stone design was completed on one of the two squares created in 1816, Prince's Square. Subsequently, the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13 of 1833.Statutes of Upper Canada, 1833 3¬∞ William IV pg. 58-68. Chapter XVII An act to define the Limits of the Town of Hamilton, in the District of Gore, and to establish a Police and Publice Market therein. The Battle of Stoney Creek in 1813. British regulars and Canadian militia defeated invading American forces in eastern Hamilton. After simmering treaty and border disputes finally erupted into the War of 1812, the Hamilton area again became a strategic area. In 1813, the British regulars and Canadian militia defeated invading American troops at the Battle of Stoney Creek which was fought in what is now a park in eastern Hamilton. Burlington Heights, adjacent to the grounds of present-day Dundurn Park and Castle, was also a site commanding the entry to Burlington Bay. George Hamilton, a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion Barton Township after the war in 1815. He kept several east‚Äìwest roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north‚Äìsouth streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated \\"East\\" or \\"West\\" if they crossed James Street or King‚Äôs Highway No. 6. Streets were designated \\"North\\" or \\"South\\" if they crossed King Street or King‚Äôs Highway No. 8. Gore Park, whose western boundary is King and James Streets, formed the public square for the new settlement and has remained the centre of the city ever since. The original plot of land set aside for the courthouse has had four different buildings erected on it. It was only supplanted as the court site by a move across the street in the 1990s as part of an architectural preservation project for the Post Office and Dominion Public Building. Gore District of Upper Canada and Wentworth County were created in 1816, with Mr. Hamilton‚Äôs settlement as the seat for both. The county‚Äôs original constituent townships included the following, the territory of which became part of the amalgamated Hamilton in 2001: Ancaster (later a town), Barton, Binbrook (later one half of Glanbrook), Glanford (later the other half of Glanbrook) and Saltfleet (later the town and city of Stoney Creek). Seneca and Brant Townships were also original constituents of the county but later became part of Haldimand County and Brant County, respectively. During the first half of the 19th century, Mr. Hamilton‚Äôs settlement in Barton Township steadily increased status at the expense of Dundas. Growth was aided in 1810 by a channel cut to link Burlington Bay directly with Lake Ontario, thus improving its marine transportation. George Hamilton‚Äôs settlement was incorporated as a police village in 1833. In comparison, the Desjardins Canal to Dundas was at best an incomplete success. The physical structures, with living interpreters, of these pioneer days are preserved at Westfield Heritage Centre. Gore Park in 1870. The park was a public square for the settlement, and remains the centre of the city. As railway fever raced across North America, Hamilton prematurely got in the act with the promotion of various paper lines in the 1830s. This included Allan Napier MacNab‚Äôs Hamilton and Port Dover Railway which, although chartered in 1835, did not actually lay any track until the mid-1850s under a different corporate name. MacNab completed Dundurn Castle, his stately home, in 1835. A boy soldier in the War of 1812, he led Gore militia to crush insurgents in the Rebellion of 1837 for which he was knighted the following year. ==1845‚Äì1866== Official City status was achieved on June 9, 1846.Provincial Statutes of Canada 1846 9¬∞ vict. pg 981 Chapter LXXIII. An Act to amend the Act incorporating the Town of Hamilton, and to erect the same into a City. As a result of municipal reorganization of Wentworth County, Caistor Township (earlier and later part of West Lincoln) was briefly added in 1845. Hamilton received its city charter in 1846. Seneca, Onondaga and Caistor Townships were removed from the administration of county and replaced with three others from Halton County: Beverly, East Flamborough and West Flamborough (which were amalgamated as the Town of Flamborough 1974-2000). Hamilton City Council was based on a board of control, which effectively meant an executive committee of at-large city councillors controlled the city government. Mayors were short- term figureheads who changed mostly on practically an annual basis. The same year Hamilton became a city, Robert Smiley and a partner began publishing ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Hamilton Spectator and Journal of Commerce\\". Map with the Niagara Escarpment in red. Easy access to limestone from the escarpment helped propel Hamilton into an important iron and steel producing city. As MacNab completed his two years as the premier of the united Province of Canada, the newly renamed Great Western Railway became Hamilton‚Äôs first functioning railway in 1854. Completion of this railway and the Niagara Suspension Bridge transforms Hamilton into a major centre and part of the American immigration route from New York City or Boston to Chicago or Milwaukee. Over two hundred miles of distance was saved travelling through what was then called CANADA WEST. However, because of the different gauge or width between the American and Canadian tracks, passengers had to switch trains at both Niagara Falls, then known as Clifton as well as at Detroit. The GWR‚Äôs maintenance and marshalling yards were located in Hamilton, and the city got its first taste of the steel industry as it re-rolled rails imported from Britain. Unfortunately, in 1857, 57 passengers were killed when a train derailed near the Desjardins Canal. Not content with this relatively minor operation, dozens of small workshops and craftsmen banded together to smelt steel rather than just mill steel. Easy access to limestone from the Niagara Escarpment, coal mined in Appalachia, iron ore mined from the Canadian Shield and export markets through the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system made Hamilton an important iron and steel producing city. Other industrial ventures conducted in the Ambitious City (a phrase adopted by ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Spectator\\" from detractors in Toronto) and Birmingham of Canada included manufactured tobacco, beer and other consumer products. It also became a centre for the textile industry, which did not die out completely until the 1950s. Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3-month-long military course from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Hamilton. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer. The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.Richard Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada' published by the RMC Club by U of Toronto Press. ==1867‚Äì1892== The Orange Order in Gore Park in the 1870s. The Order, made up largely of Northern Irish Protestants, grew in popularity with large scale immigration from the British Isles. When the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, Hamilton was an enthusiastic partner in the bold new political enterprise and preached the joys of the British Empire. The city was represented in the House of Commons by one seat for the city proper and two for the remainder of the county (Wentworth South and Wentworth North). Growing commercial and industrial prosperity prompted large scale emigration from the British Isles. Many Irish immigrants created a Corktown in the general vicinity of John and Hunter Streets. Patriotic Britons and native born Canadians of British stock erected many public monuments downtown to honour John A. Macdonald, Queen Victoria and the United Empire Loyalists. More people meant more demand for services and information. In 1874, the Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) began offering horse-drawn public transportation. 1906 photo of Alexander Graham Bell at his home in nearby Brantford. Hamilton was home to the British Empire's first telephone exchange. Robert Smiley, the founding publisher of The Spectator, sold the newspaper to William Southam in 1877 as the first link in the Southam newspaper chain. A unified and paid Hamilton Fire Department, replaced the numerous volunteer fire companies in 1879, led by fire chief Alexander Aitchison. The Hamilton area was also intimately connected with the early history of the telephone. While staying at his parents‚Äô Brantford home in neighbouring Brant County, Alexander Graham Bell conceived of the idea of the telephone in 1874 and made the first experimental long-distance call to Paris, Ontario in 1876. The following year, retired Baptist minister Thomas Peter Henderson become the first General Agent for the telephone business in Canada. In 1878, the first telephone exchange in the British Empire was opened in Hamilton by Hugh Cossart Baker, Jr. On May 15, 1879, Hugh Cossart Baker Jr. makes Hamilton the site of the first commercial long-distance telephone line in the British Empire. More workers and new immigrants encouraged a nascent trade union movement among skilled craftsmen. Hamilton unionists and other working-class people gave birth in 1872 the Nine Hour Movement, urging the government to limit working hours to nine per day. A more modest but still unstable railway boom marked the last part of the 19th century too. The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway was incorporated in 1884, and by 1892 offered limited cargo service and ultimately passenger service. Electrical railways which sporadically linked Hamilton with Grimsby, Beamsville, Brantford and Oakville were established the following decade. ==1893‚Äì1905== Modernization and business consolidation often went hand in hand with unionization. The HSR converted to electrically powered vehicles in 1892. In keeping with the area‚Äôs reputation, the firefighters unionized in 1896. As it was absorbed by Hamilton Electric Light and Power Company in 1899, HSR workers joined Division (now Local) 107 of the predecessor of the current Amalgamated Transit Union. Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) streetcar in 1909. The HSR transitioned from horse-drawn public transit to electrical-powered vehicles in 1892. But it was definitely not all work and no play for local residents. In 1894, Hamilton Herald newspaper and cigar store owner Billy Carroll established the Around the Bay Road Race. The route circumnavigates Burlington Bay and, although it is not a proper marathon, it is the longest continuously held long distance foot race in North America. It was won by such sporting greats as William \\"Billy\\" Sherring, Tom Longboat and Sam Mellor. Adelaide Hoodless and other founded the first Women‚Äôs Institute in Saltfleet Township (Stoney Creek) in 1897 and began her educational campaign for home economics. A year after she died in 1910, one of Hamilton‚Äôs many new schools was named in her honour. Hamiltonians, like other residents of the colonies, discovered one of the darker sides of British Imperialism when the South African War broke out in 1899. Men from Wentworth County and other Canadians volunteered to serve in the Canadian Mounted Rifles or North-West Mounted Police contingents. Although they excelled at the bitter guerrilla war there against the Boers, its conclusion in 1902 served as an omen for the future. Ernest D‚ÄôIsraeli Smith, after being frustrated by paying to have his fruit transported from the Stoney Creek area, had founded a company in 1882 to market directly to wholesalers and eliminate the middleman. Smith & Sons Ltd. continues operating today, and has since the early 20th century has sold manufactured preserves and jams. Its namesake founder served as the Conservative MP for Wentworth around the start of the 20th century. By the end of the 19th century, symbolically marked by the death of Queen Victoria in the first days of the 20th century, Hamilton expanded to the approximate limits of the Mountain Brow to the south, Chedoke Creek to the west and Gage Avenue to the east. Through natural increase and immigration, the urban Hamilton-rural Wentworth population balance shifted so much that in 1904 the federal ridings were redistributed. While the total number of MPs remained the same, two were now from the city proper (Hamilton East and Hamilton West) and one represented the rest of the county. ==1906‚Äì1918== Hamilton had a momentous year in 1906: local boy Billy Sherring won an Olympic gold medal at Athens for the marathon. The Amalgamated Transit Union struck against the HSR in a bitter labour dispute. The working class voters of Hamilton East, sympathetic to the ATU, elected Allan Studholme as their Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. For years he stood as the lone labour representative in the legislature, championing the eight-hour day, workmen's compensation, the minimum wage and women's suffrage. International Harvester Company buildings by the waterfront, taken in 1907. The beginning of the 20th century saw continued growth for industries in Hamilton. The steel industry continued to grow and finally consolidate through this period, some combining to form the Steel Company of Canada in 1910 and others Dominion Steel Casting Company in 1912. Stelco and Dofasco, as they became colloquially and then legally known, were located in the north end to take advantage of the transportation and cooling opportunities provided by access to the water. Industrial waste from the industries along the waterfront led to Hamilton Harbour becoming heavily polluted with industrial waste. The infant science of aviation found early and enthusiastic supporters in Hamilton. Jack Elliot established an airport in the north end near Stelco which in 1911 hosted the first Canadian Air Meet. Pioneering aviator J.A.D. McCurdy won that contest, sponsored in part by the newly minted Hamilton Automobile Club (now CAA South Central Ontario). Emigration continued from Britain and the United States (chiefly blacks) during this period as local museums show, but also began from other countries such as Italy and Austria-Hungary. Remarkably, thousands of Italian Hamiltonians are descendants of emigrants in this period from a single Sicilian town, commemorated by the dual naming of Murray Street as Corso Raculmuto. Increased population and prosperity prompted a building boom. As a publicity stunt and raffle, workers and contractors built a house in a day in 1913 which was later featured in a Ripley‚Äôs Believe It or Not cartoon. The same year, the Hamilton Public Library opened its new building funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. (The site was renovated and now houses the Family Court.) Hamiltonians participated in the First World War as combatants, but due to Col. Sir Sam Hughes' mobilization plans for the Canadian Expeditionary Force, there were no major battles associated purely with Hamiltonians. The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry later perpetuated the battle honours of four of these consecutively numbered Overseas Battalions of the CEF. Heavy industry boomed as the Canadian and British governments' war driven demands for steel, arms, munitions and textiles increased. Unfortunately, in their quest to expand, the twin steel giants damaged the land by infilling Hamilton Harbour and burying or diverting many creeks which formerly flowed into the bay. War profiteering by manufacturers dampened some of the mood, but generally Hamiltonians pulled together. ==1919‚Äì1938== The Great War was a somber affair, but post-war dream seemed secure in the Roaring Twenties. The United Farmers of Ontario won the most seats in the 1919 provincial election and formed a coalition government with the Independent Labour Party. Walter Rollo, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Hamilton West, became the first Ontario Minister of Labour in this government. The Hamilton Board of Education resumed its ambitious building program for schools. Their names often honoured the memory of war veterans: Memorial School, Allenby School and Earl Kitchener School. The educational building boom was coupled with a residential housing boom in which hundreds of low-rise apartment buildings, of three to four stories and six to ten units, grew up across the city, especially in the east end. University Hall of McMaster University in 2017. The university moved to Hamilton in 1930. Higher education‚Äîdisregarding its normal school or teachers college‚Äîarrived in Hamilton in 1930. McMaster University was founded in Toronto as a Baptist institution of higher learning. Funded by a bequest of Senator William McMaster in 1887, it was in danger of becoming absorbed by the University of Toronto. Hamilton‚Äôs municipal government, civic boosters and ordinary residents lured the university to the city with grants of land and money in 1930. Not only did McMaster preserve its independence, but it began publishing The Silhouette student newspaper, now an award-winning weekly broadsheet. Local boosters also ensured that Hamilton hosted the inaugural Empire Games, now known as the Commonwealth Games in 1930. Amateur athletes from around the British Empire and Commonwealth gathered to compete at Hamilton Civic Stadium, the current site of Ivor Wynne Stadium as a result of the efforts of Melville Marks Robinson. The Great Depression of the 1930s hit Hamilton hard. The simultaneous and prolonged decline in domestic consumption and international trade in finished industrial goods and building supplies put a stop to residential and institutional construction for a decade. It was in this context of privation that Dr. Elizabeth Bagshaw started her illegal birth control clinic in 1931. Emotional relief from the Depression was found in the Washingtons, local brothers who performed as a blues quartet throughout Ontario. Practical relief was found in government works projects designed to prime the economy and which added to the long-term attractiveness of Hamilton. Thomas B. McQuesten, a Hamilton lawyer, alderman, and MLA, served as minister of transportation and chairman Niagara Parks Commission from 1934 to 1943. He spearheaded the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Way, a controlled access highway which links Fort Erie with Toronto via Hamilton, and the Mountain access for Highway 20 in Stoney Creek. He founded Royal Botanical Gardens, seeing the institution through from an early concept in the 1920s to incorporation and staffing in the 1940s. Whitehern, his downtown family home, now serves as a civic museum. ==1939‚Äì1945== As war clouds gathered over Europe, Britain decided to shore up its support in the Dominions by having a royal visit to Canada. When King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth visited Canada in May and June 1939, they stopped in Hamilton and also opened up the QEW. Hamiltonians like others in Canada and the world welcomed the spike of economic demand caused by the Second World War but not its source. Heavy industry again began spewing out its pollutants, and by the end of the war the ecological cost of pollution had taken its toll on Hamilton: heavy metals made fish from the Hamilton Harbour inedible, air pollution made breathing difficult and industrial dumps contaminated land. Unlike the First World War, in this war the Canadian Army mobilized its territorially recruited militia units as a body rather than soliciting individuals to serve in conglomerated units. Men of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (colloquially known as the Rileys) and the rest of the 2nd Canadian Division were mobilized early, but sat on their hands in Britain for two years. The Hamilton area was also active in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF): the city proper sponsored 424 \\"Tiger\\" Squadron by buying bombers to equip it. On the home front, the public not only eagerly followed the progress of the war, but they also got a chance to see airmen in action. In 1940, as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the Royal Canadian Air Force established a station in Glanford Township. Hundreds of Commonwealth pilots and other aircrew were trained at RCAF Station Mount Hope, and some unfortunate ones are still buried there. The army‚Äôs enforced idleness‚Äîdisregarding their unsuccessful foray to France in May 1940 and disastrous defence of Hong Kong in December 1941‚Äîled to discontent in the army, the public and the government. In this atmosphere, the timing was ripe for Lord Louis Mountbatten‚Äôs ill-advised and unauthorized raid-in-force. The Rileys lost hundreds of its young men on a single day in 1942, when they were effectively wiped out as a fighting force at Dieppe. When the war finally ended, Hamilton was a much different place. Women had permanently entered the paid workforce. The lean times of the Great Depression were over‚Äîand veterans were going to make sure that happened. ==Notable people from Hamilton prior to 1946== People associated with Hamilton who became well- known prior to 1946 are listed below in the order of their birth year.

Chicken wire, or poultry netting, is a mesh of wire commonly used to fence in fowl, such as chickens, in a run or coop. It is made of thin, flexible, galvanized steel wire with hexagonal gaps. Available in 1 inch (about 2.5 cm) diameter, 2 inch (about 5 cm) and 1/2 inch (about 1.3 cm), chicken wire is available in various gauges-- usually 19 gauge (about 1 mm wire) to 22 gauge (about 0.7 mm wire). Chicken wire is occasionally used to build inexpensive pens for small animals (or to protect plants and property from animals) though the thinness and zinc content of galvanized wire may be inappropriate for animals prone to gnawing and will not keep out predators. In construction, chicken wire or hardware cloth is used as a metal lath to hold cement or plaster, a process known as stuccoing. Concrete reinforced with chicken wire or hardware cloth yields ferrocement, a versatile construction material. It can also be used to make the armature for a papier-m√¢ch√© sculpture, when relatively high strength is needed. ==History== Charles Barnard, a British ironmonger, built the world's first wire-netting machine in 1844. He based his design on cloth weaving machines. Soon the firm of Barnard, Bishop & Barnard, established in Norwich, was selling wire netting all over the world. Ward, Ken. Victorian Norwich. A History of Norwich, 28 November 2006, p. 6. During World War II, the fine wire used to make chicken wire was used to make large wire ground mats for radar systems, evening out the random reflections from the uneven ground below. The installation of these systems caused a countrywide shortage of chicken wire in the United Kingdom. During World war II it was also commonly put on helmets by German soldiers to cover the helmet and camouflage it with plants and branches. == Other uses == In chemistry, molecules with fused carbon rings are often compared to chicken wire ‚Äî see chicken wire (chemistry). In photonics, the chicken-wire effect is a predominant pattern of low transmission lines between multifiber bundles in a fiberoptic used to couple the intensifier tube to the CCD sensor. The lines have a pattern similar to that of chicken wire. In machine tool design, chicken wire may be used for safety guarding. Chicken wire has also been used as a means of body disposal, most famously by the Colombian Cali Cartel. As the TV series Narcos relates: \\"When Pablo Escobar killed you, he wanted everyone to know about it. But the 'Gentlemen of Cali', they did that differently too: they wrapped your body with chicken wire and dumped you in the Cauca river. When you bloated and your body expanded, the wire cut you into little pieces, for fish food. Not very 'gentlemanly', but it did the trick...\\" Chicken wire commonly used in construction has been found to block or attenuate Wi-Fi, cellular and other radio frequency transmissions by inadvertently creating a Faraday cage. == See also == * Chain-link fencing * Oligodendroglioma, a brain tumor with a microscopic chicken wire capillary pattern * Chicken wire (chemistry) == References == == External links == * Wire gauges (SWG) used in Chicken Wire * - a machine that makes chicken wire. * Higher quality video of a Gabion machine Category:Fences Category:Wire ","title":"Chicken wire"},{"id":"1431965","text":"L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat (translated from French into English as The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat (US) and The Arrival of the Mail Train, and in the United Kingdom the film is known as Train Pulling into a Station) is an 1895 French short documentary film directed and produced by Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re. Contrary to myth, it was not shown at the Lumi√®res' first public film screening on 28 December 1895 in Paris, France: the programme of ten films shown that day makes no mention of it. Its first public showing took place in January 1896. It is indexed as Lumi√®re No. 653.Landmarks of Early Film, The Blackhawk Films Collection, 2016 ¬© Flicker Alley ==Content== The train moving directly towards the camera was said to have terrified spectators at the first screening, a claim that has been called an urban legend. This 50-second silent film shows the entry of a train pulled by a steam locomotive into the gare de La Ciotat, the train station of the French southern coastal town of La Ciotat, near Marseille. Like most of the early Lumi√®re films, L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat consists of a single, unedited view illustrating an aspect of everyday life, a style of filmmaking known as actuality. There is no apparent intentional camera movement, and the film consists of one continuous real-time shot. ==Production== This 50-second movie was filmed in La Ciotat, Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne, France. It was filmed by means of the Cin√©matographe, an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a printer and film projector. As with all early Lumi√®re movies, this film was made in a 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. ==Contemporary reaction== L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de la Ciotat, 1896 The film is associated with a myth well known in the world of cinema. The story goes that when the film was first shown, the audience was so overwhelmed by the moving image of a life-sized train coming directly at them that people screamed and ran to the back of the room. Hellmuth Karasek in the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote that the film \\"had a particularly lasting impact; yes, it caused fear, terror, even panic.\\" However, some have doubted the veracity of this incident such as film scholar and historian in his essay, \\"Lumiere's Arrival of the Train: Cinema's Founding Myth\\".The Moving Image: Volume 4, Number 1, Spring 2004, pp. 89‚Äì118) Others such as theorist Benjamin H. Bratton have speculated that the alleged reaction may have been caused by the projection being mistaken for a camera obscura by the audience which at the time would have been the only other technique to produce a naturalistic moving image. Whether or not it actually happened, the film undoubtedly astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images. ==Cinematic techniques== This film contains the first example of several common cinematic techniques: camera angle, long shot, medium shot, close-up, and forced perspective. It is evident from their films, taken as a whole, that the Lumi√®re brothers knew what the effect of their choice of camera placement would be. They placed the camera on the platform to produce a dramatic increase in the size of the arriving train. The train arrives from a distant point and bears down on the viewer, finally crossing the lower edge of the screen. A significant aspect of the film is that it illustrates the use of the long shot to establish the setting of the film, followed by a medium shot, and then a close-up. As the camera is static for the entire film, the effect of these various \\"shots\\" is achieved by the movement of the subject alone. Nonetheless, these different types of shots are clearly illustrated here. Later filmmakers moved their cameras to achieve these shots. ==3D and other versions== What most film histories leave out is that the Lumi√®re Brothers were trying to achieve a 3D image even prior to this first-ever public exhibition of motion pictures. Louis Lumi√®re eventually re-shot L'Arriv√©e d‚Äôun Train with a stereoscopic film camera and exhibited it (along with a series of other 3D shorts) at a 1934 meeting of the French Academy of Science. Given the contradictory accounts that plague early cinema and pre-cinema accounts, it is plausible that early cinema historians conflated the audience reactions at these separate screenings of L'Arriv√©e d‚Äôun Train. The intense audience reaction fits better with the latter exhibition, when the train apparently was actually coming out of the screen at the audience. But due to the fact that the 3D film never took off commercially as the conventional 2D version did, including such details would not make for a compelling myth. Additionally, Loiperdinger notes that \\"three versions ofL'Arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat are known to have existed\\".Patrick Keiller, ‚ÄúPhantom Rides: The Railway and Early Film‚Äù in The Railway and Modernity: Time, Space, and the Machine Ensemble, Beaumont, M. and Freeman, M.J. eds., (Bern: Peter Lang, 2007), p 72 According to L‚Äô≈ìuvre cin√©matographique des fr√®res Lumi√®re, the Lumi√®re catalogue website, the version most found online is of an 1897 reshot which prominently features women and children boarding the train.L‚Äô≈ìuvre cin√©matographique des fr√®res Lumi√®re (The Lumi√®re Film Catalogue) ==Current status== La Ciotat train station (shown here in 2010) commemorates the film. The short has been featured in a number of film collections including Landmarks of Early Film volume 1. A screening of the film was depicted in the 2011 film Hugo, and in the intro sequence for the 2013 video game Civilization V: Brave New World. The scene of the train pulling in was placed at #100 on Channel 4's two-part documentary The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. ==References== ==External links== * *Original film (Lumi√®re No. 653) on The Internet Archive *L'Arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat - Relief 3D a stereoscopic/3D film of the 1934 Lumi√®re reshot. *The Lumiere Institute, Lyon, France * L'Arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat: an interpretation at the Cinemaven blog.

He was a railroad engineer and railroad president before the Civil War, Florida Comptroller in 1863 and a civil engineer after the Civil War. ==Early life== Gwynn was born in Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), the grandson of Humphrey Gwynn, a descendant of Colonel Hugh Gwynn, who settled in Virginia before 1640. Walter Gwynn was the son of Thomas Peyton Gwynn, born April 19, 1762, and Ann. Thomas Peyton Gwynn died in 1810, the same year his daughter, Frances Ann Gwynn, married William Branch Giles, Senator and later Governor of Virginia. William B. Giles and Frances were Walter Gwynn's guardians in 1818 when he entered West Point, according to the records. ==United States Military== He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in the Class of 1822 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery, later transferring to the 4th U.S. Artillery. In 1827, while still an artillery lieutenant, he helped survey the route for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;). ==Civil Engineer== He resigned his army commission in February 1832. From 1833 to 1836, he worked as chief engineer in charge of the construction of the Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad. He was Superintendent and Chief Engineer of the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad in North Carolina from 1836 to 1840; also during this period, he conducted surveys for several other railroad and canal projects in Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. From 1842 to 1846 he was president of the Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad, and in 1846, he became president of the James River and Kanawha Canal Company, a position which he held until 1853, when he moved from Richmond, Virginia, to Raleigh, North Carolina. In 1850, Gwynn was hired by the North Carolina Rail Road Company as Chief Engineer \\"Employed on the Surveys and Location of the North Carolina Rail Road, from the commencement of operations to the completion of the location.\\" Gwynn supervised construction of the North Carolina Railroad until it was completed in early 1856. Between 1853 and 1855, he conducted surveys for the Atlantic & North Carolina Railroad and the Western North Carolina Railroad; and from 1848 to 1855 he was the chief engineer of the Wilmington & Manchester Railroad. He was also chief engineer of the Blue Ridge Rail Road Company in South Carolina in the 1850s. Gwynn's concurrent positions with multiple railroads was considered controversial and was criticized at times, but his qualifications and accomplishments overshadowed such criticism. But by the late 1850s, he had established an international reputation as a railroad engineer and as a founder of the southeastern railroad network. A colleague said that Gwynn \\"made for himself a reputation among his fellow engineers that will last for all time.\\" In 1857, he retired from railroad work and moved to South Carolina. ==Confederate States Military== At the start of the Civil War, Gwynn was a major in the engineers of the South Carolina Militia. At the request of the governor, he had accepted the commission and was instrumental in the planning of the attack on Fort Sumter in early 1861 as a member of the Ordnance Board. He was later charged with constructing batteries at various strategic points in Charleston Harbor, facing Fort Sumter. On April 10, 1861, he accepted a commission as major general of the Virginia Militia and was directed by Virginia governor John Letcher to assume command of the defenses around Norfolk and Portsmouth until mid-May. Working with Gwynn at Norfolk was William Mahone, who was the president of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad. Working under Gwynn's authority, Mahone (who was still a civilian) helped bluff the Federal troops into abandoning the Gosport Shipyard in Portsmouth by running a single passenger train into Norfolk with great noise and whistle- blowing, then much more quietly, sending it back west, and then returning the same train again, creating the illusion of large numbers of arriving troops to the Federals listening in Portsmouth across the Elizabeth River (and just barely out of sight). The ruse worked, and not a single Confederate soldier was lost as the Union authorities abandoned the area, and retreated to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. In 1861, Gwynn oversaw construction of defensive fortifications at Sewell's Point, which was across the mouth of Hampton Roads from Fort Monroe at Old Point Comfort. He also participated in the Battle of Big Bethel during the Blockade of the Chesapeake Bay. Gwynn also served as a brigadier general in the Virginia Provisional Army and then brigadier general in the North Carolina Militia, commanding the Northern Coast Defenses of North Carolina. All of these general-officer assignments were in the spring and summer of 1861. By August he joined the Confederate States Army as a major of engineers and was promoted to colonel on October 9, 1862. (Fellow railroader Mahone also joined the Confederate Army, eventually achieving the rank of major general after becoming the so-called 'Hero of the Battle of the Crater,' which took place near Petersburg in 1864.) ==Later life== In 1863, he resigned his commission and was named Florida Comptroller. After the war, Gwynn returned to civil engineering in North Carolina. He died in 1882 at Baltimore, Maryland, and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. ==External links== * History of Blue Ridge railroad where Gwynn was chief engineer ==References== Sources * Allardice, Bruce S., More Generals in Gray, Louisiana State University Press, 1995, . *Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Stanford University Press, 2001, . * North Carolina Railroad Company.

The game was created by Jordan Weisman and designed by Mike Mulvihill, Ethan Pasternack, James Ernest, and Mike Selinker. It was released in early July 2004. There was also an online computer game based on Pirates of the Spanish Main by Sony Online Entertainment called Pirates CSG Online, which ended on 1/31/2011. The game won the Origins Vanguard Award 2005. On September 14, 2009, collectible maker National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced the purchase of the Wizkids name and properties from Topps, specifically including the Pirates line, which was canceled. On March 9, 2012, Wizkids announced that they plan to release a card-only version of the game, called \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck.\\"http://wizkidsgames.com/blog/2012/03/09/necawizkids- announces-the-re-launch-of-the-pirates-of-the-spanish-main-property/ Other games have since followed in their \\"Shuffling the Deck\\" line of card games. == Description == The general goal of Pirates is to collect more gold than your opponents, or with variants, to achieve a given objective or destroy all enemy ships (numerous scenarios written by WizKids and others have vastly extended the playability of the game). The game's pieces include ships, forts, sea monsters, crew, islands and other terrain markers, events, gold and other treasure tokens. An innovative feature of Pirates is the 'constructible' element of the game; each game piece (except for terrain) is created by popping out the small polystyrene pieces from placeholder cards and assembling them. As the ship, fort or sea monster is damaged by enemies during the course of game play, pieces of it are removed to record how much damage it has sustained, giving the game piece itself the appearance of slowly being destroyed. The elements removed from the piece - for example, a ship's masts - can no longer be used in the game unless another game element allows it to be replaced later. Each game piece has a point value that is related to its overall power. The more powerful a piece, the higher its point value. Players assemble fleets of ships, monsters, forts, and crew based an agreed-upon point total, similar to the manner in which many miniature war games are played. This helps balance each player's fleet, and means that the construction of a fleet can be as strategically important as the gameplay itself. The action takes place on a tabletop or similar flat surface rather than a game board; before play begins, players take turns populating the play area with various pieces of terrain like islands, fog banks, and sargasso seas. Face-down gold or treasure tokens are then placed on each island. After creating the play area, players then place their fleets and gameplay begins. Players take turns moving their ships around the play area, landing on islands and exploring them, which reveals the value of the gold and treasure tokens on that island. Ships then collect treasure and attempt to return it to their home islands before their opponents. Since the game's victory conditions include both gold collection and the destruction of all enemy fleets, there are several different strategies that can lead to victory: trying to destroy an opponent before he or she can gather gold; building a fast and strong enough fleet to avoid being destroyed; or, most common, a mix of both. The game is packaged so that one person may play the game with only one game pack, but several more packs are required to play using the full rules. Additionally, the game is far more enjoyable and balanced when each player has a larger selection of game pieces from which to choose when assembling their fleets. The recommended \\"sweet spot\\" for playability appears to be three to five players on a 90 cm by 90 cm (3 foot by 3 foot) 'ocean'. ==Configurations== The game is primarily sold in \\"game packs\\", foil-wrapped packs of randomized styrene cards and other game components roughly the same size as a pack of baseball cards or other trading card game packs such as Magic: The Gathering. Each pack includes a randomized combination of two constructible game pieces: ships (including forts and sea monsters), and various crew, treasure and terrain. These game pieces are numbered and collectible, and come in multiple levels of rarity designated by a color-coded triangle on each card's corner - the most common rarities for standard booster pack items are : Common (white for generic crew, red for ships), Uncommon (silver-grey), Rare (yellow), or Super Rare (black). Other rarity designations for non-pack ships include \\"Special Edition\\" (green), a one-off Promo (purple), and \\"Limited Edition\\" (copper) for tournament prize ships. Unlike most trading card games, due to the limited number of game pieces in each pack, some packs do not contain any Rare or Super Rare game pieces, or may contain multiple Rares. Any given set's Super- Rares will always come all together in the same pack. Each pack also contains a cardboard island (the reverse side in later sets has printed terrain such as a fog bank, sargasso sea, or reef), a checklist and set of rules, a crew/treasure card (which may include gold pieces for use in the game), and a mini-die. Each pack generally costs $4 US. WizKids released other game configurations as well, mostly into mass market channels such as Toys \\"R\\" Us, Target and Wal-Mart. These include but are not limited to: *Promotional pieces and packs: Various ships since the game's inception have been sent to retailers to be given away, usually in a clear plastic wrappers. Some of these are Limited Edition items, and some are duplicates of items found in common booster packs. *Tins: A small tin box decorated with Pirates artwork which contains multiple Pirates booster packs. With Ocean's Edge, some Special Edition tin exclusive card packs were also included in the tins. Also released were \\"Mega Tins\\" - slightly larger tins containing Ocean's Edge booster packs, and a special plastic wrapped pack containing faction-specific junk ships and crew. Two of the factions were only available in Tins exclusive to specific US retailers, Wal-Mart and Target. Finally, Rise of the Fiends \\"Treasure Chest Tins\\" contained one of four Megacards. *Value Boxes: A small cardboard box with a window in it, typically containing one of four possible Special Edition prebuilt ship, crew, standard gold treasure, islands, and occasionally a full- sized die. The prebuilt ships have a green corner rarity indicator which is referred to as \\"Special Edition\\". These have been released for a number of sets since Revolution. *Megapacks: A booster pack twice the size of normal packs, containing four ships or monsters, a megacard (double-sized card), one mini-die, and several terrain. Released so far only for Oceans' Edge. On October 25, 2006, WizKids released \\"Pirates: Quest For Davy Jones' Gold\\", a non-collectible board game version of the Pirates game that uses gameplay elements and game pieces from the constructible strategy game, but is designed to be simplified, self-contained and sold in the board game section of retail stores. == Factions == Ships, forts, sea monsters and crew are members of various factions. The factions exist largely for fictional purposes, but there are certain game mechanics that use the factions as well. * The Pirates, representing the popular view of Pirates around the \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\". They are absent in Pirates of the Barbary Coast. * The English, representing England and later the British Empire. * The Spanish, representing Spain and its empire in the new world. * The French, introduced in \\"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\\", representing first the French empire and then the Napoleonic empire in later expansions. * The Americans, introduced in \\"Pirates of the Revolution\\", who represent the American colonies during and after the American Revolution and the War of 1812. * The Barbary Corsairs, who represent the pirates that operated in the Mediterranean Sea during this time period. They only appear in \\"Pirates of the Barbary Coast\\". * The Jade Rebellion, a fictional group representing a confederation of 'Asian' pirate-revolutionaries in the South China Sea. They only appear in \\"Pirates of the South China Seas\\", with the exception of a super-rare \\"intro\\" pack from PotBC. * The Cursed, a label encompassing various evil supernatural characters, ships and sea monsters. * The Mercenaries, introduced in \\"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\\" are a collection of steampunk-like scientists, revolutionaries and ships, including submarines. * The Vikings introduced in \\"Pirates of the Frozen North\\" are not historical Vikings, but Norse sailors who use Viking mythology, symbols and names for their ships. == Releases == ===Pirates of the Spanish Main=== \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\\" was the first release, and hit stores on July 28, 2004. It quickly sold out in many places, resulting in a second \\"limited\\" print run which featured noticeably higher quality printing than the first print run (the first run cards appear extremely 'faded'). This set was printed in a number of languages: English, German, French and Spanish. The only other sets printed in a foreign language (German) were \\"Crimson Coast\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Davy Jones' Curse\\", \\"Mysterious Islands\\", and \\"Ocean's Edge\\". The set introduced the Pirate, English, and Spanish factions, with ships for each faction ranging in size from one to five masts. Twelve named crew members, along with the generic crew of Captain, Helmsman, Musketeer, Shipwright, Oarsman, Cannoneer, and Explorer were also present for each faction. A number of generic treasure, in the form of gold pieces ranging in value from 1 to 7, as well as nine pieces of named unique treasure were included, along with an assortment of cardboard islands with blank backs. At the 2004 Origins Awards Pirates of the Spanish Main was one of the winners of the Vanguard Awards. ===Pirates of the Crimson Coast=== The first expansion was released on March 2, 2005, and added the French faction, as well as the unit type of Forts, which were placed on islands to defend them. It expanded the rules with the Ghost Ship and Schooner ship types; the Broadsides Attack, Limit, and Ransom keywords; and two new generic crew types, the Stinkpot and Chainshot Specialists. Fog Banks, Reefs, and Sargasso Seas were added to the back of the islands as special terrain. The set also previewed the forthcoming American faction with the ship Roanoke. ===Pirates of the Spanish Main - Unlimited Edition=== This edition was released on March 15, 2005, as a second reprint of the cards from the original \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\\". The numbering scheme on the cards was updated to conform with the \\"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\\" numbering and rarity colors. A checklist of the cards was also added. In Europe, the expansion removed the island cards and in their place issued new rules for ship movement and a playmat. ===Pirates of the Revolution=== Released in June 2005, \\"Revolution\\" added the new American faction, and special Event cards (Divers, Raft, Mermaids, Foul Winds and Becalmed). In addition, the Marine keyword and Galley ship type debuted, along with the new generic crew Firepot Specialist. ===Pirates of the Barbary Coast=== Released on October 26, 2005, this set added the Barbary Corsair faction, and a new generic crew type, the Smokepot Specialist. Four super-rare cards (two ships and two crew) previewed the forthcoming Jade Rebellion faction. It is the only set to lack the Pirate faction. ===Pirates of the South China Seas=== This expansion was released on February 22, 2006, and added the Jade Rebellion's Junk and Turtle Ship types, as well as the Fear keyword and game mechanic. Six new Events (Hidden Cove, Favor of the Gods, Rolling Fog, False Treasure, Duel, Cursed Zone) were included, as well as the first six-masted ships. The super-rares for this set previewed the new Cursed faction (two ships and two unique treasures). WizKids offered a mail-in promotion for the first 10-master, a junk treasure ship called the Baochuan and her captain Admiral Zheng He. ====Notable ships==== *Glorious Treasure - Jade Rebellion, 1-mast, 2 armor, 6 points. This ship can deal up to 2 masts of damage and kill one crew when it rams an enemy ship making this ship worth far above 6 points. The armor and its turtle ship ability enable it to take twice as many hits as a normal 1-mast ship. Its cannon is decent and the ship is of average speed. This ship can even destroy a 3-mast ship with only minor damage unlike most 1-mast ships. It is very vulnerable to being hit with a firepot specialist. *Grand Path - Jade Rebellion, 6-mast, 17 points, with 6 2S cannons and a special ability to add +1 to boarding rolls. *Feathered Hat - Pirate, 4-mast, 12 points. The Feathered Hat has average cannons (2S 3S 3S 3S) and good speed (S+L) but her ability is powerful‚Äîthe Feathered Hat can be crewed by any nationality. Her 3 cargo preclude her from being very useful as a treasure runner but taking on three crew from any nation could make her downright lethal. *USS New Orleans - America, 2-mast, 12 points. This ship can hide behind something and then pop out to steal a derelict ship. Both of the ships become \\"teleported\\" to the home island removing both from danger. In a large battle, this ship has a high value for recovery. *Santa Ana - Spain, 4-mast, 15 points. Santa Ana could be considered a weaker version of the powerful HMS Titan, as it can receive an extra action on a 5 or a 6. It has slightly above average cannons, sporting 2 rank 2 S range cannons, and 2 rank 3 L range cannons. Its 5 cargo allows it to become a powerful flagship. ====Notable crew==== *Pirate - The Headhunter (sacrifice a crew for extra action; +1 to cannon rolls vs. non-Pirates). The Headhunter was named by a winner of the world's first Pirates of the Spanish Main event and subsequent auction at Gen Con Indy 2004. *French - Princess Arii Auraa (0pts, crew cost 0 on this ship) *American - Commodore Matthew Perry (0LR, +5 fleet points) *Jade Rebellion **Zheng Li Kwan (sacrifice a crew for extra action; treasure switcher) **Ms. Cheng (0LR reroll 1 die per turn) **Dragon Eyes (10 points, may capture enemy crew for gold when boarding) **Li Quin (0LR +5 fleet points) **The Nameless (1+ to boarding rolls) ===Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse=== \\"Davy Jones' Curse\\" was released on May 31, 2006, featuring the new Cursed faction, and the Sea Monster unit type, which acted as ship but could not carry crew. A mail-in promotion offered a 10-masted Cursed ship, the Guichuan, and her captain Headhunter. Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse is an expansion set for the constructible strategy game Pirates of the Spanish Main produced by WizKids. It expanded on The Cursed Faction and was released on May 31, 2006. Set details *The expansion includes cards for the following factions: ** American ** Cursed ** Pirate ** English ** French ** Spanish *The die color in this set is red (d6). *The set introduced Sea Monsters, The Cursed faction, and a new keyword - the Black Mark. *The Black Mark - This crew may start as if it belonged to the Cursed faction, play it face up if so. The ship that the crew is part of is now considered to belong to the Cursed Nation. If played face up in this way, the crew's point cost is increased by 1. *Four super rare cards (Mist Walker, Behemoth, Screaming Mimi and The Red Skull) may be found in a single pack which is indistinguishable from a normal card pack. Super Rare packs appear approximately 1 in 100 packs. In a first for this game line, these cards are printed on a semi-translucent plastic stock, giving them a 'ghostly' appearance. *Value Box Sets: This is the first (and so far only) set to feature 'two runs' of Value Box sets, 8 altogether. Each value box contains 6 ships and/or sea monsters, 3 crew and/or treasure, as well as 2 islands, and 1 full size (d6) die. Initially, four special edition ships were issued (Boneyard, Electric Eel, Drowned Man, and Fool's Gold). A further four \\"special edition\\" boxes with new ships (The Black Diamond, Broken Key, Nightmare and HMS Richard) was released later, in October 2006. **Value Box Trivia: a packaging 'exploit' led to buyers being able to see into any value box without opening it, and because the Davey Jones Super Rares have a translucent appearance, tell if the Super Rare pack was a part of that particular Value Box or not before purchase. This was corrected in following sets by adding an opaque insert to block the view. * This set consists of 144 pieces in the base set, with an additional 18 Limited Edition Ships given as Tournament Prizes, and one convention exclusive ship for a grand total of 160 cards (Not including the different versions of islands). Game pieces are numbered 001-145, 200-217 and 300. * 18 Limited Edition, one & two masted ships are available as tournament prize LE's, which were distributed to the public in a new fashion for this set: one package of three different LE ships is included in each 36-count retail Booster Box (apparently with the idea that the game store will remove the package before selling the box or packs and give the LE ships to winning tournament players). In practice, many of these packs ended up thrown away or auctioned on eBay. Additional prize packages of these cards were apparently mailed later on to a few tournament Envoys as well, but this new distribution method for tournament prize cards led to these particular cards being much harder to collect, and they still command large prices when they appear at auction. * The Guichuan - a 10-masted ghost junk, was part of a special giveaway - twelve pack wrappers, receipt from the store the packs were purchased at, and a shipping and handling fee were required for the giveaway. It also included a crew called The Headhunter on the ship card. Sea Monsters The concept of Sea Monsters was introduced in this set, with ten sea monster pieces (8 are rare, 2* are super rare): Leviathan, Calim, Calypsos, Mist Walker*, Behemoth*, Tiamat, Tsuro, Slarge Gubbit, Jormungandr, and Gog-Clocthoth. Controllers decide whether the Monster is submerged (movement only), or surfaced (move or attack). Two of the monsters have breath weapons, Tiamat has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. Leviathan has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. The others have game- changing abilities such as moving in and out of fog banks (Mist Walker) - this ability is commonly called a 'fog hopper' - and eliminating masts or crew in boarding actions. Behemoth can copy another ability. Tsuro may move an opponents ship, (with proper dice roll). Later sets fiddled with keywords such as 'Kraken', 'Titan', 'Octopus', 'Sea Dragon' and others, but for this set, the keyword was simply \\"Sea Monster\\" regardless of the creature type. Notable ships *The Flying Dutchman - A famous ghost ship with five 2+ to hit cannons. *Harbinger - A ship captained by the pirate Jack Hawkins that can board other ships without having to ram them if the ship is in short distance away from her. *The Pequod - Famous ship from the novel Moby-Dick. *El Raton - an error in printing shows this ship as a common (red color corner) card, it is actually a rare as shown on both the checklist and the WizKids card gallery. Notable crew *Davy Jones - The Cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones is a separate legend, but was linked by Wizkids to the Dutchman. (This was done to tie it in with the films, The Pirates of the Caribbean.) The Dutchman was either the name of the ship, or a nickname for her Captain. Depending on which myth you hear. *The Inquisitor - (Black Mark) A mysterious figure around which many Spanish ships are linked, he can remove all crew on a ship if a boarding action is won. ===Pirates of the Mysterious Islands=== Released on November 15, 2006, \\"Mysterious Islands\\" added the new Mercenary faction, along with Jules Verne inspired Nautilus-style submarines. The titular \\"Mysterious Islands\\" were added as special islands with effects decided by dice rolls. ===Pirates of the Frozen North=== \\"Frozen North\\", released on February 14, 2007, added the Norse Vikings faction and the Iceberg terrain type, as well as the Icebreaker and Longship ship types. Islands were numbered for the first time in this set. A mail-in promotion offered the \\"Nordic Raiders Pack\\" with the Serpent's Fang and Polaris ships and the Odin's Revenge unique treasure. ===Pirates at Ocean's Edge=== Released on April 18, 2007, \\"Ocean's Edge\\" added Whirlpools as a terrain type, Windcatchers and Catamarans as new ship types, and Sea Dragons and Titans (giant crabs) as new monster types. A 10-masted ship called the Zeus and her captain Emperor Blackheart were available as a mail-in promotion. ===Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels=== This expansion was released on November 6, 2007, featuring crew and ships from the three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, plus some other Disney pirate ships. The new keywords Parley and Eternal were included from the films, along with the new unit type Kraken (an eight-segmented version of the five-segmented Sea Monster) with considerably different effects. ===Rise of the Fiends=== Released January 30, 2008, Fiends added the Flotilla ship type, and an action ship called Scorpion. The Loyal and Hostile keywords were added, and the Kraken keyword changed to Octopus. In addition to the standard checklist and rules sheet, numbered collectible stories were also included in the booster packs; the mail-in offer was for the Specter, which was a glow-in- the-dark ship. The Octopus Ochobrazo was to appear in this release, but was pulled; this unit does not exist. ===Fire and Steel=== \\"Fire and Steel\\" was released April 9, 2008, adding new \\"Action\\" unit types, Bombardiers and Switchblades, and special Equipment items. More numbered, collectible stories were distributed in packs; a mail-away offer was given for the Chum Maker Scorpion ship. ===Savage Shores=== \\"Savage Shores\\" was the final expansion, released on November 5, 2008, and was the first release to be unavailable in booster packs. It added the new generic crew types Navigator and Cargo Master, the new action ship type Hoist, and the new terrain type Trade Current. In addition, several new island types with special effects were added, as well as the new keywords Dories, Secret Hold, Born Leader and Chieftain. Two new 10-mast ships, the Shui-Xian and the Celtic Fury, were also released. ===Return to Savage Shores=== \\"Return To Savage Shores\\" was scheduled to be released sometime in early 2009 - the design phase was supposedly complete and the set was ready to send to the printers when WizKids was shut down by Topps. While some information on the units that were to appear in this set is available, the set has not been released and probably never will be. ==Fiction== The Pirates Constructible Strategy Game and its expansions feature flavor text on the styrene cards that hold each ship, fort, and unique crew game pieces. The flavor text forms a roughly connected story that centers on several recurring characters: Jack Hawkins, the cursed pirate El Fantasma, the femme fatale known as the Calico Cat, and others. Although the Pirates expansions span several hundred years (Admiral Zheng He sailed in the 14th century, and \\"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\\" is set roughly in the Victorian age), the recurring characters never seem to age, but they do develop. As such, continuity in the Pirates universe is difficult to establish. Many pieces of flavor text in later expansions reference events, ships, or characters in previous expansions, so there is a coherent - if factually and historically unlikely - plot that continues to develop with each new release. Jack Hawkins is a typical roguish pirate type, similar to Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. He can often be found stealing ships and gambling them away. El Fantasma's ghostly status was left ambiguous in \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\\"; in later expansions, he received his own ghost ship and became a member of the Cursed faction, cementing his role as an actual undead pirate. The Calico Cat is a strong female character who provides a dramatic balance to Jack Hawkins; she is often depicted as a plucky adventurer who uses both brains and brawn to further some unknown quest for revenge. The Cat also mentors a girl by the name of Bonny Peel. It has been hinted that \\"the Cat\\" has a personal grudge against Hawkins, and is rumored to be the missing Gunn in the Pirate stories. Several additional recurring characters appear in Pirates fiction, including Blackheart, a pirate similar to the historical Blackbeard; the Crimson Angel, another mysterious female pirate; and even non-pirates such as Charles Southwyn, a weaponmaster who helped create several ships in the \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\\" release. Other notable characters include: Capitan Alarico Castro, a Moor who, despite a grudge against Spain, becomes an Admiral ; Davy Jones, captain of the cursed ship the Flying Dutchman; Genny Gallows whose father was killed by the English; and many others. In addition to the flavor text on styrene cards, several pieces of fiction collectively called Tales of the Spanish Main by Noah Dudley and Nancy Berman appeared on WizKids' website before and after the launch of Pirates of the Spanish Main in 2004. While some ships are historical and contain accurate historical descriptions of real events, others are either original fiction, fiction in the public domain (the Pequod from Moby Dick), mythological creatures, or are homages to fictional ships or characters. For example, some of the Sea Monsters in the Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse expansion are obvious homages to creatures from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. ===References and homages in Pirates fiction=== A good deal of Pirates flavor text contains references to historical events or people, other fictional characters or events, or are simply references to the game's writers and designers. Pirates fiction also contains homages to other pirate fiction. Some ship names are references to other games created by Jordan Weisman. The Pandora (from \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\\") is a reference to the zeppelin of the same name owned by Nathan Zachary, the main character in Weisman's Crimson Skies game. The Black Swan is a reference to a character from Crimson Skies or possibly to the Pirate movie of the same name. A very incomplete list of other references for the \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main (the 1st Set)\\" alone includes: * Revenge (PP376/PS007) - Homage to the Dread Pirate Roberts' ship Revenge in The Princess Bride or the real pirate Black Bart Roberts' ship Revenge. * Wesley - Another homage to The Princess Bride, the name of the main hero. Also appears in film version * Scrye the Explorer (PP375) - Reference to Scrye magazine, in which the promotional piece appeared as an insert. * Pandora (PS006) - Reference to the zeppelin of the same name from the Crimson Skies universe, also created by Weisman, along with the legend of \\"Pandora's Box\\". * Tsuro (PP009) - Reference to WizKid's board game Tsuro * \\"Jack Hawkins\\" - Reference to PotC's Jack Sparrow (in name and looks) and Jim Hawkins (Jim and Jack are interchangeable names) who was once in the British navy and turned to piracy. * \\"Sea monkey\\"- reference to the Lucasarts adventure game Secret of Monkey Island the flavor text tells the story of it from the game. ==RPG== In 2007 Pinnacle Entertainment Group released The Pirates of the Spanish Main, a source book for their Savage Worlds role playing game, set in the same world as the CSG. ==Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck card game== Announced March 7, 2012, \\"Pirates of the Spanish Main‚Ñ¢ Shuffling the Deck\\" is reportedly a non-collectable, stand alone card game for the entire family set in the Pirates of the Spanish Main universe. It has a tentative release date of July 18, 2012. It is not expected to be usable in any way with the collectable miniatures game. ==Cross-promotional (i.e., advertising related) game pieces== *2004 - Scrye the Explorer (SM card # PP735) - Exclusive Explorer crew packed in the Sept. 2004 Scrye magazine (issue 75) along with the ship Bloody Throne. *2004 - The Bloody Throne (SM card # PP375) - Exclusive three-masted ship packed in the Sept. 2004 Scrye magazine (issue 75) with the crew card \\"Scrye the Explorer\\". *2006 - Gale Force Nine (SCS card # 301) - A four-masted Pirate ship LE, free by mail with proof-of-purchase when you buy either one of two island terrain sets from the Gale Force Nine game company. *2006 - Two Home islands released with the \\"Donald Duck & Co. #26\\" (Kalle Anka) comic magazine only in Scandinavia on 7/20/06 - these packs contained two ships (El Cazadora & Glorious Treasure, both identical to their English releases), a paper slip of treasure coins to cut out, rules, and two cardboard islands which are labelled \\"Home\\" on one side. Due to their limited distribution, these two islands are highly prized by completist collectors and quite hard to come by. *2007 - USS Denver (Ocean's Edge card # SOE 07) - four- masted American ship available with a $25.00 purchase from the cross-promoted Sony Online Entertainment online version of this game. *2007 - Flying Dutchman (DPOTC card # 300) - Special Edition Promo ship with advertising text, tied into the Disney related Pirates of the Caribbean set.

Also given away in a drawing for members of WizKids online Pirates community. The Sleigh and Captain Whitebeard can be used any day of the year, however on Christmas Eve they gain special bonuses. *2006 - Value Boxes (Davy Jones Curse) - Wave 1 had new ships (Boneyard, Fool's Gold, Electric Eel, and Drowned Man) and Wave 2 included new ships (Broken Key, Black Diamond, Nightmare and HMS Richard).

Some have made their way out on the resellers market as well. About 30 are known to exist, but more are assumed to have been printed. As such, this is the rarest 'produced ship' in the series, and highly sought after by collectors, though thoroughly unspectacular in game-play. ==Other collectible elements, tins and other unusual releases== *2004 - Set of eight mini-busts (statuettes) of Pirates of the Spanish Main characters, including: Calico Cat PP388, Captain Blackheart PP389, Jack Hawkins PP390, Christopher Myngs PP391, El Fantasma PP392, Diana Doone PP393, Luys de Alva PP394 and Skyme the Monkey PP395. *2004 - A series of Pirate-themed temporary tattoos were given out at conventions.

A packing error made these stories very hard to collect as they do not appear in every pack as advertised - more like one in ten packs. *2008 - Fire & Steel \\"stories\\", one of ten possible paper inserts which appear randomly in every booster pack. *2008 - A \\"treasure chest\\" shaped tin containing various packs and one of four exclusive Rise of the Fiends megacards (USS Mercury, Polaris, Terrox and Grinder). *2008 - a \\"Scavenger Pack\\" box containing three packs worth of Savage Shores items, one pack each of Rise of the Fiends and Fire & Steel, and one of six exclusive pre-assembled Megasized ships (visible in a window on the box).

After studying film theory in London in the mid 1990s, Irshad moved to Tokyo to teach English while finding time to make short films and take photographs. The BBC film network quotes Irshad as saying \\"My first film happened when I moved to Tokyo for a couple of years in 1997 to teach English. The insidious traingrind of Ridley Scott's grey drizzled dystopia encroached deep inside my head, nag nag nagging away. I realised the power of dreams and, using a friend's camcorder and VCR for editing, made a film about the sensory avalanche that is Tokyo.\\" Influenced by the work of Terence Malick and Alan Resnais, Irshad's films offset journalistic content with esoteric visual language as reflected in the ITV documentary The Muslim Jesus narrated by Melvyn Bragg which scored eerie images of urban London landscapes with haunting Arabic recitation, and was positively reviewed by critics in the Daily Express, The Observer, The Evening Standard, The Scotsman and The Guardian. He states his greatest influence is fellow documentary maker Bob Brear, a man Irshad describes as \\"visually visionary, literally brimming over with ideas and joy\\". He sees the seminal ITV show Bouncers as Brear's greatest work. A series many described as \\"surreal to the point of genius\\". Irshad's work with Melvyn Bragg has included directing The South Bank Show. His film about Peter Kosminsky was described by Richard Rogers in The Observer as \\"an examination of the art rather than the artist and that again makes it unique.\\" Rogers also praised the opening of the film in the article \\"There is also no other TV show that Melvyn Bragg (or anyone else) can confidently open by asserting the philosophical theories of Jean Baudrillard. He doesn't even link such theorising to the evening's subject. You have to work it out yourself, which means thinking while you watch\\" Ashraf's next South Bank Show was about the rock band Elbow which aired in November 2009 and was awarded critic's choice features by The Sunday Mirror, The Guardian and The Independent. Irshad's past work includes a BBC documentary about Pakistan's entertainment industry, a documentary about rock band Elbow's tour of Cuba in 2004, a Channel 4 documentary about American film director Richard Linklater with presenter Ben Lewis, of which Henrietta Roussoulis of Time Out wrote: \\"his moments with the man himself are really worth watching. By constantly questioning his questions and doubting his doubts, Lewis attempts to add a Linklater touch to his documentary, a device that gets him nowhere - \\"I know it's your job to make sense of what I do,\\" the director says, \\"but ... I don't think it's that interesting\\" Irshad also made a film about collectors of contemporary art in New York, with Ben Lewis which was positively reviewed by Peter Chapman in The Independent. Irshad has also featured in front of camera in documentaries. The 2008 BBC 2 film The Funny Thing About Ramadan saw Irshad easing comedian Ayesha Hazarika into the month of Ramadan to comic effect. Irshad cut his directing teeth in the late 1990s making short films for BBC and ITV. He pioneered the \\"psychic detective\\" style of Derek Acorah, making over 25 shorts with the psychic before going on to make shorts for the BBC flagship travel show Holiday. As a producer he has made Bollywood for Beginners for Channel 4 and developed The Islamic History of Europe for the BBC. ==Selected credits== The South Bank Show Elbow Profile of the cult alternative rock band.

The use of chartreuse fire engines began when New York ophthalmologist Stephen Solomon produced research claiming that sparkling bright lime-green paint would boost the night time visibility of emergency vehicles compared to those painted the traditional fire engine red. The reason for this is the Purkinje effect, i.e., the cones do not function as efficiently in dim light, so red objects appear to be black. In Australia and New Zealand this form of chartreuse yellow is also known as \\"ACT yellow\\" as this is the color of the fire engines in the Australian Capital Territory. ===Literature=== * In 2012, Chelsea Handler began to author a spoof on the popular book series Fifty Shades of Grey called 50 Shades of Chartreuse: This Time It's Personal.\\"Chelsea Handler to write '50 Shades of Chartreuse (Sep 18, 2012) USA Today ===Music=== * Jazz and jump blues saxophonist, singer, and bandleader Louis Jordan recorded the song \\"(You Dyed Your Hair) Chartreuse\\" in 1950.

The show focused on two lifelong friends, Sanford and Del, and their adventures at the fictional Barder College. With the exception of their roommate Joe, nearly everyone at Barder is stupid and inept. Nonetheless, the idiotic, irresponsible, and thoughtless Sanford and Del are portrayed as the series' heroes, whereas the responsible, intelligent Joe is the de facto villain in most episodes. The series was created by Family Guy veteran writers Mark Hentemann, loosely based on Mark's college days at Miami University. It is the only animated series produced for MTV by Warner Bros. Animation. Creator Mark Hentemann would later go on to create Bordertown for Fox, which also ran for just one season. The show's theme song is The Flaming Lips' song \\"Fight Test\\" from the album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. ==Main characters== * Sanford Reilly ‚Äì voiced by Brian Dunkleman. Sanford is a fat, oafish, highly insensitive loudmouth who shows little consideration for others. He has a very crude sense of humor, believing in the value of scatophilia and stupid pranks. As Del's best friend, he often takes the lead in their pointless adventures. In Fraternity, he is revealed to be diabetic and has to take insulin for it. * Del Swanson ‚Äì voiced by Brian Posehn. Del is Sanford's lifelong friend, similarly stupid, but more reserved and considerate. While Sanford is hopelessly dumb, Del shows a few glimpses of intelligence to his own surprise. He is extremely short and tends to have slightly better luck with women than Sanford ever does. Actor Brian Posehn gives Del a distinct low, droning voice, similar to the one used for Jim Kuback on the short-lived adult animated series Mission Hill. * Joe Tate ‚Äì voiced by Mark Hentemann. The most intelligent and miserable student at Barder, Joe is forced to attend Barder College because he was not accepted to Harvard (due to the fact that Harvard filled their quota of white male students). He has dreams of being a doctor, but is constantly at odds with idiotic students and the school's poor facilities, including an extremely inept medical center. As Del and Sanford's roommate, he endures their rudeness and stupidity on a daily basis. * Todd Wolfschmidtmansternowitz ‚Äì voiced by Brian Posehn. The R.A. of Del and Sanford's floor, Todd is a grotesque loser with a high, croaking voice and several medical conditions, including albinism. Todd has been pathetic his whole life, often mentioning his loud alcoholic father and inability to cope with ordinary problems. He is constantly ignored by the students on his floor despite his good intentions, and has a tendency to blindly follow rules and regulations. * Ed Bickel ‚Äì voiced by Mark Hentemann. A hillbilly who lives on Todd's floor. Ed often hangs out with Del and Sanford and displays many stereotypical redneck habits, including a distinctly stupid laugh. Although just as dumb as everyone else, he sometimes provides helpful information and always has a cheerful demeanor. * Dean Earhart ‚Äì voiced by Jeffrey Tambor. A Barder graduate, Dean Earheart deals with the school's many failings on a daily basis. He is neurotic, dishonest, and terrible at his job. He has a blonde female assistant named Linda, who serves as his voice-of-reason. * Felicity ‚Äì voiced by Lori Alan. Felicity has an over the top obsession over Del since high school, and only enrolled in Barder in hopes to always be with him. Her dorm room is filled with photos of Del all over the place. At one point, Del had to file a restraining order against her only for her to injunct it thinking it was all a misunderstanding. She constantly rips off her own hair to make clothing for Del, in hopes that one day she'll marry Del and bear children with him. She constantly bickers with Sanford. *Cindy Reilly- voiced by Kathleen Wilhoite. Is Sanford's ditzy, unattractive, alcoholic older sister, who's a junior at Barder. In the first episode, she spent the summer sobering up, only for one of her friends to give her a beer to celebrate, which gets her drunk all over again. A common running gag in the show is her getting hit by a car, as well as flashing her breasts. She has also been banned from eating in the cafeteria for her antics. * Dr. Heminger ‚Äì Barder College's doctor. He is not very helpful when it comes to helping the students on campus, and doesn't seem to know anything about his profession. He also abuses medication. == Episodes == ==References== == External links == * Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2003 American television series endings Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American college television series Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:MTV cartoons Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

HRHD is an unofficial standard of encoding video, meaning that the video signal was ripped directly from a HDTV broadcast, then downsampled to approximately 960 √ó 540, and usually encoded with Xvid. While the horizontal resolution of 960 remains constant the vertical resolution can fluctuate up to 5% to provide clean cropping. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as Half- Resolution High-Definition. Encoding for a 40‚Äì55-minute HRHD TV show should be approximately 700 MB, the size of a compact disc. It contains the original AC3 sound, which is often 5.1 channels, instead of the re-encoded stereo MP3 stream found in 350MB releases. ==History== The HRHD format began in late 2003 when the TV capture group FUA began distributing what they termed \\"HRHDTV rips\\" on the private FTP sites of The Scene. The group defined what HRHDTV is in their .nfo, a small text file included with releases to give information specific to the release. There has often been a misconception about the name.

She designs for her namesake brand Alberta Ferretti, and designed for Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti until 2014. Her showroom is in Milan, Italy but her studio is in her native village of Cattolica, near Rimini, Italy. She was among a group of Italian designers who were invited to a reception for 200 designers and retailers held by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street, in October 1988.For a Chief of State, No Wrinkles, Please, The New York Times, October 11, 1988, pg. B6. == Early life == In 1968, Alberta Ferretti opened her first boutique, called Jolly, in Cattolica. She designed a first collection in 1973 and co-founded (a publicly traded clothing manufacturer and distributor) in 1976. She began showing seasonal collections on the runways of Milan in 1981. She launched Ferretti Jeans Philosophy in 1989, renamed Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti in 1994. In 1994 she renovated a 13th-century castle into the Palazzo Viviani hotel in Montegridolfo. In October 1993 Ferretti presented clothes reminiscent of The Great Gatsby for the Milan ready-to-wear shows. One of her designs was a long and trim gingham dress, in pale blue. A flapper showed a beige crocheted dress styled just above the knee. Her renditions of the toga for the production were diverse. They were simple gowns, some of them short, others long and draped.Real Clothes Look Radical, The New York Times, October 7, 1993, pg. C10. Ferretti extended her the breadth of her company outside of Italy beginning with the acquisition of a building at 30 West 56th Street in New York City. She started Aeffe U.S.A., which produced and distributed clothing by Moschino, Rifat Ozbek, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Narcisco Rodriguez. Aeffe is owned by Ferretti and her brother, Massimo.Patterns, A Designer Joins Aeffe, The New York Times, July 1, 1997, pg. B6. The locale also became the hub for marketing her own collections. By 1998 she opened in-store boutiques for selling her signature and Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti lines at Bergdorf Goodman. Next she obtained her initial American freestanding store in SoHo. This business, near Prince Street, is exclusively for her Philosophy collection. It is a lower priced edition of Ferretti's signature line, intended for younger women. In contrast to most designers, she started boutiques for her secondary lines prior to opening a flagship store for her signature collection. Ferretti's West Broadway building is located next door to a Rizzoli bookstore. It is a Federal style architecture townhouse built in the late 19th century. It was renovated with a three-story glass front and skylights, so that the interior was filled with natural light.Patterns, Ferretti To Open In Soho, The New York Times, June 2, 1998, pg. B9. The store was designed by Manhattan architect David Ling. It is a pristinely white shop. Ferretti signed a licensing deal with Procter & Gamble for a fragrance line in 2000. ==Fashion career== Ferretti is known for her designs featuring twisting, tucking, and draping techniques. Her style employs a subtle layered look, sometimes showing a hint of hand-beaded gauze which extends slightly beneath the hem of a wool dress.Architectural Philosophy, The New York Times, August 30, 1998, pg. ST3. The erotic qualities of the chiffon and jersey fashions she introduced for her spring 2008 fashion collection is evident in the look of her dresses. Many of them are cut high in the front and draped low in the back. Her target customer is the cocktail crowd. Specifically the dresses are party frocks, above the knee, and enhanced by rhinestone rosettes and armour- like chain mail. Feretti's collection includes pleated bubbled coats, toga- like minidresses and skirts, and a sparse number of gowns of soft mint green and white hues. The minidresses and skirts were shown with ethereal models wearing metallic gladiator flats.Buttoned-Up or Bombshell, Women's Wear Daily, Friday, September 28, 2007, pg. 8. In July 2011 her collection was presented at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.The Brandery, Catwalk, TV Fashion Runway Show She received the America Award of the Italy- USA Foundation in 2018. ==ReferencesCategory:Italian fashion designers Category:Living people Category:1950 births ","title":"Alberta Ferretti"},{"id":"1432032","text":"Rohr im Gebirge is a village in the Wiener Neustadt-Land district of Lower Austria in Austria. ==Geography== Rohr im Gebirge is located in the Industrieviertel, the first industrialised part of Lower Austria. Of its 80.58 square kilometers, 89.95% is woodland. There are no other cadastral communities than Rohr im Gebirge. Rohr im Gebirge ==History== Before the Common Era, the area was part of the Celtic kingdom of Noricum and was within the area of influence of the oppidum of Burg in Schwarzenbach on the Burgberg, which was the main settlement of the northeast part of the kingdom. Later, under the Romans, it was within the province of Pannonia. Because of its inaccessibility, the location was settled late. The Lords of Traisma are recorded as the first owners of the forests around Rohr im Gebirge. In 1194, the area passed to the Duchy of Steyr. After the construction of Burg Gutenstein (first mentioned in 1220), Rohr came under its influence; Gutenstein remained the centre of government for the region until 1848. The first recorded mention of Rohr by name dates to 1427. In 1470 the local church, previously part of the parish of Schwarzau im Gebirge, became an independent parish. In the 16th century, the village was affected by the Protestant Reformation: Count Sigismund of Herberstein installed a Protestant minister. However, by 1569 there was once more a Catholic priest. In 1595, Gutenstein passed to the Barons von Hoyos (a family of Spanish origins), and in 1622 the parish was officially revived. The church was enlarged in 1716 and acquired a tower with onion dome in 1761. In the second half of the 18th century a village school was founded, initially in a farmhouse; the first school building was built in 1782. In 1848 the feudal dependency was dissolved and the first mayor was elected. In 1877 a post office opened and a post coach route to Gutenstein was inaugurated. Between 1884 and 1894, roads were built to Gutenstein and over the Ochsattel into the valley of the River Traisen, ending the village's isolation. A further road to Gutenstein via the Haselrast was constructed in 1910. The old church was demolished and replaced in 1878/79 and a new school built in 1886-88\\\\. ===Population=== ==Economy== In 2001 the settlement had 24 non-agricultural workplaces.

It is also called the Book of Former Han. The work was composed by Ban Gu (32-92 CE), an Eastern Han court official, with the help of his sister Ban Zhao, continuing the work of their father, Ban Biao. They modeled their work on the Records of the Grand Historian, a universal history, but theirs was the first in this annals- biography form to cover a single dynasty. It is the best source, sometimes the only one, for many topics in this period. A second work, the Book of the Later Han covers the Eastern Han period from 25 to 220, and was composed in the fifth century by Fan Ye (398‚Äì445). ==Contents== This history developed from a continuation of Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, initiated by Ban Gu's father, Ban Biao, at the beginning of the Later Han dynasty. This work is usually referred to as Later Traditions (ÂæåÂÇ≥), which indicates that the elder Ban's work was meant to be a continuation. Other scholars of the time, including Liu Xin and Yang Xiong also worked on continuations of Sima's history. After Ban Biao's death, his eldest son Ban Gu was dissatisfied with what his father had completed, and he began a new history that started with the beginning of the Han dynasty. This distinguished it from Sima Qian's history, which had begun with China's earliest legendary rulers. In this way, Ban Gu initiated the Jizhuanti () format for dynastic histories that was to remain the model for the official histories until modern times. For the periods where they overlapped, Ban Gu adopted nearly verbatim much of Sima Qian's material, though in some cases he also expanded it. He also incorporated at least some of what his father had written, though it is difficult to know how much. The completed work ran to a total of 100 fascicles Âç∑, and included essays on law, science, geography, and literature. Ban Gu's younger sister Ban Zhao finished writing the book in 111, 19 years after Ban Gu had died in prison. An outstanding scholar in her own right, she is thought to have written volumes 13‚Äì20 (eight chronological tables) and 26 (treatise on astronomy), the latter with the help of Ma Xu. As with the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Qian, a notable Chinese general who travelled to the west, was a key source for the cultural and socio-economic data on the Western Regions contained in the 96th fascicle. The \\"Annals\\" section and the three chapters covering the reign of Wang Mang were translated into English by Homer H. Dubs.Homer H. Dubs. (trans.) The History of the Former Han Dynasty. 3 vols. Baltimore: Waverly, 1938‚Äì55. Other chapters have been rendered into English by A. F. P. Hulsew√©, Clyde B. Sargent, Nancy Lee Swann, and Burton Watson. The text includes a description of the Triple Concordance Calendar System ‰∏âÁµ±ÊõÜ developed by Liu Xin in fascicle 21. This is translated to English by Cullen. Ban Gu's history set the standard for the writings of later Chinese dynasties, and today it is a reference used to study the Han period. It is regarded as one of the \\"Four Histories\\" ÂõõÂè≤ of the Twenty-Four Histories canon, together with the Records of the Grand Historian, Records of the Three Kingdoms and History of the Later Han. ===Annals=== Ji (Á¥Ä, annal), 12 volumes.

It is often referred to as the first real motion picture ever made, although Louis Le Prince's 1888 Roundhay Garden Scene pre- dated it by six and a half years. ==Plot== Three separate versions of this film exist, which differ from one another in numerous ways-‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äåthe clothing style changes demonstrating the different seasons in which they were filmed. They are often referred to as the \\"one horse\\", \\"two horses\\", and \\"no horse\\" versions, in reference to a horse-drawn carriage that appears in the first two versions (pulled by one horse in the original and two horses in the first remake). Another film with the same theme was made in 1896, that features another factory (or another entrance to the same factory) with different people. ==Production== This film was made in the 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and at a speed of 16 frames per second.

She first appeared in Mister Miracle #4 (October 1971), and was created by Jack Kirby. Jack Kirby based Barda's physical appearance on Lainie Kazan, who had recently appeared topless in Playboy. Mark Evanier, Kirby's assistant on the Fourth World comics, has explained the genesis of the character: \\"Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news... the characterization between Scott 'Mister Miracle' Free and Barda was based largely‚Äîthough with tongue in cheek‚Äîon the interplay between Kirby and his wife Roz\\". In 2011, Big Barda was ranked 75th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. ==Fictional character biography== Barda is a member of the race known as the New Gods, and was born on Apokolips about 250 years ago. Her mother was Big Breeda, whom Barda was taken away from at an early age to be trained as a warrior at Granny Goodness' Home for Orphaned Youth. Granny grooms Barda to one day lead the Female Fury Battalion, a ferocious pack of warrior women. However, during a raid, Barda meets Scott Free, Darkseid's adopted son, and, sensing a peace about him, falls in love. Barda risks her own safety to work with the rebel cell led by the New God Himon. This comes directly after the murder of most of Himon's cell by the local authority, Wonderful Williki. This includes one of Barda's people, Auralie, who is tortured to death for dancing, a crime on Apokolips. Moments later, Himon kills Willik with a bomb. Barda, her Furies, Himon and Metron help Scott escape Apokolips. Darkseid himself calls for Scott to return but doesn't actually stop him, as Scott's escape can reignite his war with New Genesis. Barda, not emotionally prepared to escape herself, stays behind.Mister Miracle #9 (September 1972) Eventually, Barda turns her back on Granny Goodness and comes to Earth.Mister Miracle #4 (September/October 1971) Once there, she finds that Scott has taken up the mantel of the escape artist Thaddeus Brown, AKA Mister Miracle, and has teamed with his diminutive manager Oberon. Oberon and Barda become close friends. For a while, Barda's Furies assist Scott in his showmanship effortsMister Miracle #14 (July 1, 1973) but they return to Apokolips by themselves. Scott and Barda are married by Scott's birth father, the Highfather of New Genesis.Mister Miracle #18 (February/March 1974) For a number of years Barda follows Scott and Oberon on tour. Eventually they retire from superheroing and move to Bailey, New Hampshire.Mister Miracle vol. 2, #1 (January 1989) However, despite their best attempts, a normal life eludes them. Disasters plague them and eventually Barda, Scott, and Oberon leave Bailey to move into a loft in Greenwich Village. Barda forms a defense- training program for women called the New Female Furies. ===Justice League=== Though na√Øve regarding Earth customs, Barda relishes her roles of wife and housekeeper, but when duty calls she never hesitates to assume the posture of a warrior; and when Scott joins the Justice League, Barda participates in several missions.Justice League International #7 (November 1987); Justice League America #28 (July 1989) In one instance, while training Fire, her weapon, the Mega-Rod, is stolen from her car. With the assistance of her husband and the Huntress, she gets it back, but not before many innocent people are killed by its wielder, who was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the Apokoliptian technology. Barda also led a JLA mission to rescue her husband after he was lost in space. The mission was a result of Manga Khan selling Scott to Granny Goodness. Her teammates included Martian Manhunter, Rocket Red, and G'nort. In an attempt to dissuade their successful pursuit, Manga Khan hired Lobo, paying him in dolphin feed, to kill them. He almost does, before Barda teleports him to a random location, that being ten feet behind Guy Gardner's skull. The repercussions of that literal meeting of the minds would last for years. For a time, Barda mourns Scott, believing him slain in a battle with Despero, but it was a robot double that was destroyed, as part of a plan by Manga Khan.Justice League America vol. 2, #37-40 (April‚ÄìJuly 1990) After their time with the JLI, the two leave Earth for New Genesis,Mister Miracle vol. 2, #28 (June 1991) but, they soon returnMister Miracle vol. 3, #1-2 (April‚ÄìMay 1996) and take up temporary residence aboard the Justice League Refuge. During this period, the couple separate briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings. Barda perishes, but is reborn via Scott's temporary access to great cosmic power.Mister Miracle vol. 3, #4-5 (June‚ÄìJuly 1996) Barda has served as a member of the JLA in her own right as well. At Takion's order, she and fellow New God Orion were sent as agents of New Genesis to serve on the team. Takion predicted that the Earth faced a grave threat.JLA #17 (April 1998) Their mission is to help mobilize Earth's heroes against the omnipotent Mageddon. Over time, they become involved with several other JLA missions. Adam Strange, needing help with an alien invasion, enslaves the JLA as part of a bluff. The League works for days, turning the planet into a giant teleportation beam. The aliens are sent off to the prison planet of Takron-Galtos, which Barda had mentioned several times during the ordeal. In another instance, Barda is badly wounded fighting the Queen Bee, a member of the newly reformed Injustice League. Once Mageddon is defeated, Barda and Orion resign from the JLA.JLA #41 (May 2000) ===After the League=== Barda and Scott then reside in the suburbs of Connecticut and are active adventurers.Orion #25 (June 2002) Barda never hesitates to lend a hand to her friends when her power and expertise are needed. Barda accompanies Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman to Apokolips to rescue Supergirl from Darkseid's clutches,Superman/Batman #11-12 (August‚ÄìSeptember 2004) and accepts an invitation from Oracle to become the heavy-hitter on the Birds of Prey.Birds of Prey #100 (January 2007) A similar-looking character named Little Barda appeared as a member of the Teen Titans in 52 #21; the character leaves the group in the same issue. Her relationship to Big Barda is unknown, though she escaped from Apokolips with Power Boy. In a confrontation with the Secret Six, she engaged Knockout, another ex-Fury, in hand-to-hand combat. Although the fight is long and continues in the midst of other larger concerns for her team, it ends in a draw. Big Barda is killed in the first issue of Death of the New Gods; her funeral occurs in the second issue of the series. Infinity-Man is later revealed as the killer. He had been slaughtering all the 'New Gods' in the name of restarting a new age of deities. Final Crisis #7 depicts Barda standing alongside Lightray and Highfather in front of a reincarnated New Genesis.Final Crisis #7 (March 2009) ===The New 52=== In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Universe), Big Barda and Scott are seen on Earth 2.Earth 2 #11 They are later seen with many of the comrades in Supertown.\\"The Multiversity Guidebook\\" (Jan. 2015) Big Barda and Mister Miracle are recruited by Batman to assist Los Angeles when flooding sea waters threaten all coasts. Justice League: Aquaman: Flooded #1 (2018) ==Powers and abilities== Barda is a New God, a race of genetically-enhanced beings who evolved godly abilities from their proximity to the Source. This gives Barda a level of strength roughly parallel to Wonder Woman as well as a high resistance to injury approaching invulnerability. She is similarly resistant to disease and most toxins. As a former Female Fury trained by Granny Goodness, Barda is a master combatant in terms of swordsmanship and raw brawling, which - in conjunction with her raw strength and grit - make her an immediate match for Wonder Woman. In combat, Barda wears Apokoliptian battle armor, which enhances her already impressive durability. In addition, Barda manages a high-tech weapon, called the \\"Mega-Rod\\". This weapon can create boom tubes for teleportation over long distances, propel her high into the air and release energy blast capable of bringing down such powerful beings as Superman. For a limited time the Mega-Rod can also increase the gravity force of an individual. ==Other versions== ===Kingdom Come=== Barda appears in the limited series Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, which is set in an alternate future timeline of DC continuity. Orion has overthrown Darkseid and is the reluctant ruler of Apokolips. Barda (now sporting an eye-patch) and Scott Free work to teach the \\"lowlies\\" to think for themselves, with Orion's approval. The two have a daughter, Avia, who deploys a mega-rod and wears an outfit that combines elements of those of her parents. ===Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again=== In Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again, as America descends into anarchy and chaos, a former porn star called Hot Gates (a reference to Miller's 300 comic) takes up the mantle of \\"Big Barda\\" in order to declare herself dictator of Columbus, Ohio. ===Superman/Batman=== Superman/Batman #24 depicts \\"Big Bard\\", the male version of Big Barda from a reverse gender universe, who is married to Miss Miracle. ===JLA: Another Nail=== In JLA: Another Nail, Barda becomes a Green Lantern Corps member, although her power ring having fused to her Mother Box has made her a rather unusual Green Lantern. Mister Miracle's consciousness also inhabits the ring (Mister Miracle having 'escaped' being tortured to death by Desaad by transferring his consciousness into the control circuitry of Barda's Mother Box) and he can project himself as a spectral green figure. ===Batman Beyond=== Barda appears in DC's Batman Beyond comics that were loosely based on the animated series: Justice League Beyond and Superman Beyond: Man of Tomorrow, where, as in the animated series, she belongs to the Justice League during the tenure of Terry McGinnis as Batman. Justice League Beyond contains a separate section at the end titled \\"Beyond: Origins\\" that briefly summarized the origins of Warhawk (Chapter 1), Aquagirl (Chapter 2), and Barda (Chapter 3). Chapter 3 gives an origin story for Barda similar to her canonical mainstream comic book continuity storyline, but sets the events later so that in the Beyond universe she was born later and didn't join the Justice League until Superman had already visibly aged and begun wearing the black and white costume he sports in the Beyond stories. ===DC Bombshells=== In the DC Comics Bombshells continuity, \\"Big\\" Barda Free is a member of Amanda Waller's Bombshells project. She is also in a romantic relationship with Kimiyo Hoshi.DC Comics Bombshells #32 Barda's backstory is later revealed in the Bombshells United follow-up, where it is shown that she was once a member of the Female Furies on Apokolips. While on a mission to find new worlds to conquer, Barda encountered Kimiyo and fell in love with her, which eventually led to her defecting and becoming one of Earth's protectors.Bombshells United #31 Barda also appears alongside a gender-bent version of Mr.Miracle in the comic book series Ame-Comi Girls. ==In other media== ===Television=== Big Barda in Superman: The Animated Series (left) and Batman Beyond (right). Both appearances were used in Justice League Unlimited. * Big Barda makes a cameo at the end of the second part of the Superman: The Animated Series episode, \\"Apokolips...Now!\\". When Orion appears to declare Earth under the protection of New Genesis, she can be seen in the background as part of the defensive army in her trademark battle armor. * In the two-part episode titled \\"The Call\\" of the animated series Batman Beyond, Barda (voiced by Farrah Forke) is a member of the Justice League fifty years in the future, along with Warhawk, Superman, a new Green Lantern, Aquagirl, and others. At Superman's request, Batman investigates the members of the Justice League to find a traitor who has been trying to kill off the members one at a time.

It was caused by the resignation of Ian Welsh who had been elected at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. Welsh resigned to spend more time with his family. The by-election came amidst the Keep the Clause campaign. The Scottish parliament seat of Ayr shared its boundaries with the Westminster seat, which had until 1997 been held by the Conservatives for almost a hundred years. In the 1999 Scottish parliamentary election the seat had been the most marginal in Scotland, with Labour winning over the Conservatives by a mere 25 votes. The Keep the Clause Campaign sought to influence the outcome of the election, campaigning in the area and buying up billboard space. Souter later claimed to have successfully influenced the by-election, with the by-election being won by the Conservative candidate, who had opposed repeal of Section 28. Labour's George Foulkes attacked the Keep the Clause Campaign, claiming there had been a \\"distortion of democracy\\" and that the Keep the Clause Campaign had outspent all the candidates combined. The result was a poor one for the Labour Party, which had won the seat in the previous year, albeit with a majority of just 25. Labour fell into third place behind the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Conservative Party. The Scottish Socialist Party had a relatively strong performance for a constituency which did not seem like its natural terrain, although it did win significant support in the former mining village of Tarbolton. This by-election showed a strange effect in the Scottish AMS electoral system. The Labour Party in the South of Scotland region had won 7 seats, all as first past the post constituencies and none on the list system through proportional representation, whilst the Conservative and Unionists had won 4 seats in South of Scotland through the proportional representation system. By winning the Ayr seat at the by-election the Conservatives had technically greater representation than their 1999 results would have proportionally given them. This is an anomaly that the Scotland Act 1998 does not cater for. ==Result== ==Scottish Parliament Election result, 1999== ==See also== * Ayr (Scottish Parliament constituency) * Ayr (UK Parliament constituency) * Elections in Scotland * List of by-elections to the Scottish Parliament ==References== ==External links== *Scottish Election Results 1997 - present Ayr by-election Ayr by-election Category:2000s elections in Scotland Ayr 2000 Category:Politics of South Ayrshire Category:20th century in South Ayrshire Ayr by-election ","title":"2000 Ayr by-election"},{"id":"1432054","text":"A sich (), or sech, was an administrative and military centre of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.

Elrod (1905‚Äì1941), a Marine aviator who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in the defense of Wake Island in World War II. The ship was originally home ported in Charleston, SC and shifted to Norfolk, VA in March 1995. Elrod has completed five deployments to the Persian Gulf, three to the Mediterranean Sea, and one to the Adriatic Sea, and has participated in numerous operations in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Caribbean Sea. ==Built in Bath, Maine== Elrod was laid down on 21 November 1983 at Bath, Maine, by Bath Iron Works; launched on 12 May 1984; sponsored by Mrs. Norma J. McDonald, wife of Admiral Wesley L. McDonald, Commander Atlantic Fleet and Commander Atlantic Command; and commissioned on 18 May 1985, Commander Richard W. Moore in command. ==Service history== During her maiden Middle East Force (MEF) deployment, Elrod's primary duties were oil tanker escort in support of Operation Earnest Will and providing additional protection for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. Elrod participated in numerous Earnest Will escort missions whereby U.S. surface combatants provided security to U.S. flagged tankers from the Gulf of Oman (\\"Goo\\"), through the Strait of Hormuz, to Kuwaiti ports. The U.S. escorts provided surface and air protection while Kuwaiti flagged tugs, with minesweeping gear, provided mine protection. In the NAG, Elrod's protective envelope, as well as logistics support, included mobile sea bases \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Wimbrown VII.\\" Hercules and Wimbrown VII were Special Operating Force (SOF) barges whose personnel were assigned to protect a 100 nm stretch of the NAG from mine laying by Iranian forces station at Farsi Island. During this cruise, Elrod set the record for the number of flight hours achieved for a two-plane detachment during a six-month deployment. An Iranian speedboat attacked South Korean tanker Hyundai No. 7 with rocket propelled grenades near Ab≈´ M≈´s√°, 20 miles southwest of Sharjar, on 25 December 1987. Elrod, patrolling the Persian Gulf, launched Magnum 442, an SH-60B manned by pilot Lt. Neil W. T. Hogg, copilot Lt. Gregory P. Curth, and aircrewmen Aviation Antisubmarine Warfare Operator 2nd Class Charles Crissman and Aviation Antisubmarine Warfare Operator Airman Robert Bauch of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) (HSL) 44 Detachment 3. Magnum 442 rescued 11 of the 20 crewmembers and flew them to British frigate . A Westland Lynx HAS.3 from Scylla recovered the remaining nine people. Elrods third Persian Gulf deployment followed Operation Desert Storm and supported aggressive air and surface surveillance operations. Elrod conducted naval exercises with units of Gulf Cooperation Council nations to strengthen and further develop the bonds that were forged during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The ship participated in TEAMWORK '92, NATO's Arctic Ocean anti-submarine exercise, and Operation Sharp Guard, in support of multi-national enforcement of United Nations sanctions and embargoing war materials to the Balkans. Elrod demonstrated America's commitment to her NATO allies by providing a presence among the Standing Naval Forces Mediterranean (SNFM) and Standing Naval Forces Atlantic (SNFL) during Operation Enduring Freedom. Recently, Elrod completed another NATO deployment in 2004 in support of Operation Active Endeavor, and helped protect the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, in Operation Distinguished Games. Elrod deployed again in 2008, 2010, and 2012. Pakistani fishing vessel Al An Wari sank in the Gulf of Aden on 2 July 2010. On 5 July, a Lockheed P-3C Orion of Patrol Squadron VP-16, forward-deployed to Djibouti, spotted the 16 survivors in a life raft about 144 miles west of Socotra Island. The \\"Orion\\" directed an SH-60B flying from Elrod to the area. The \\"Seahawk\\" rescued 12 of the mariners and the frigate reached the area and saved the remaining four men. Her 2012 Caribbean deployment resulted in the confiscation of record amounts of illegal narcotics. The ship made her final deployment during a voyage to the Sixth Fleet in 2014, during which she steamed in the central Mediterranean as part of NATO's Operation Active Endeavour, patrols in support of the Global War on Terrorism, with the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout. Three armed Libyans seized commercial tanker , which Rear Admiral John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary, called a ‚Äústateless vessel,‚Äù early in March 2014. The ship carried oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Corporation, but illicitly obtained from that country's port of As-Sidra. The Libyan and Cypriot governments requested assistance. In addition to Elrod, the destroyers and , deployed as part of Carrier Strike Group 2, were tasked to assist. A Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, attached to Special Operations Command Europe, was also deployed to Roosevelt. Just after 1500 on 16 March, the SEALs boarded and took control of Morning Glory in international waters just southeast of Cyprus, capturing the hijackers and freeing the crewmembers. Stout dispatched a team of sailors that boarded the tanker and relieved the SEALs, and which then helped sail the ship to Libyan waters. Elrod relieved Stout on 19 March. Elrod turned Morning Glory over to the Libyan authorities in international waters outside Libya, and they brought the ship into Zawiya, Libya, on 22 March. Elrod was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia (USA), on 30 January 2015. The ship is slated to be offered in foreign military sales.http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=85397 ==Awards== In addition to a reputation for operational readiness and fighting skills, Elrod had earned a reputation for community support and participation in charitable projects. The ship has been recognized for the crew's contributions by designation as a Presidential \\"Point of Light\\". Elrod had also earned numerous awards during her commissioned service, including the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, several Battle Efficiency Excellence Awards, Secretary of the Navy Energy Conservation Award, Armed Forces Recreation Society Award and various departmental and mission-specific awards for excellence. ==Gallery== Image:USS Elrod FFG55.jpgElrod underway, January 2004 File:USSElrod VA.jpgElrod about to pass through the George P.

The hole is approximately 2.65 millimeters deep. The Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) is a grinding and brushing installation on NASA‚Äôs twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit (MER-A) and Opportunity (MER-B), which landed on Mars in January 2004. It was designed, developed and continues to be operated by Honeybee Robotics LTD, a developer of specialized robots, automated technologies and related systems. The RAT was the first machine to gain access to the interior of rocks on another planet. The RAT has a mass of , is in diameter and long, about the size of a soda can. It uses a diamond dust and resin wheel spinning at 3000 rpm to drill a 45 mm diameter by 5 mm deep bore hole in martian rocks. The RAT then uses two brushes to sweep dust from the bore holes for closer scientific inspection. Its average power consumption is 30 watts. There are five other instruments aboard both rovers, these are the Pancam (a camera), Mini-TES (an infrared spectrometer) for sensing targets at a distance, a microscopic imager, a M√∂ssbauer spectrometer and an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer. The RAT provides these instruments with a smooth, clean surface from which they make more accurate observations. The RAT was first used by Spirit on its 34th sol (February 6, 2004). It was held up to the rock Adirondack, whereby it scraped to a depth of over the course of three hours. Since then it has been used on numerous Martian rocks by both MER rovers.

It was founded around 1330 by a Tatar convert, Prince Chet, whose male-line descendants include Solomonia Saburova and Tsar Boris Godunov, and is dedicated to St. Hypatios of Gangra. ==History== === Foundation === The main theory considers Tatar Murza Chet, baptized as Zachary, to be the founder of the Ipatievsky Monastery. The legend says that he was miraculously cured from a disease by a vision of the Virgin Mary and St. Philip and St. Hypatius, and decided to build the monastery as a sign of gratitude. Some historians state that the monastery was founded in 1275 by Yaroslavich, but declined together with the Kostroma Principality after his death. In this case, the monastery could be not entirely built but only revived by Murza Chet. === XIII-XV centuries === In 1435, Vasily II concluded a peace with his cousin Vasily Kosoy there. At that time, the cloister was a notable centre of learning. It was here that Nikolay Karamzin discovered a set of three 14th-century chronicles, including the Primary Chronicle, now known as the Hypatian Codex. === XVII-XVIII centuries === During the Time of Troubles in Russia, the Ipatiev Monastery was occupied by the supporters of False Dmitriy II in the spring of 1609. In September of that same year, the monastery was captured by the Muscovite army after a long siege. On March 14, 1613, the Zemsky Sobor announced that Mikhail Romanov, who was in this monastery at the time, would be the Russian tsar. Most of the monastery buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The Trinity Cathedral is famous for its elaborately painted interior. The church of the Nativity of the Mother of God was rebuilt by the celebrated Konstantin Thon at the request of Tsar Nicholas I to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the House of Romanov. The Soviet authorities demolished it in 1932, but it was rebuilt in 2013. The main entrance from the riverside was also designed by Konstantin Thon.

He is known for contributing to the organization of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and to the formation of the American Colonization Society in 1817. The latter was intended to establish a colony in West Africa as a destination for free American blacks. ==Biography== Samuel John Mills, Jr. was born in 1783 at Torringford (now part of Torrington), Connecticut, where his father Samuel John Mills (1768‚Äì1833) was a Congregational minister; his mother Esther Robbins was a homemaker and supported the ministry. Mills attended Williams College in Massachusetts, where he organized a prayer group that held the Haystack prayer meeting. He entered Andover Theological Seminary in 1810, and was licensed to preach in 1812. While one of the group that helped form the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Mills served as a missionary in the Mississippi valley. It was being newly settled by European Americans in the early 19th century, before Indian Removal. Mills suggested formation of a national Bible society as part of the evangelical effort in the South. In May 1816, thirty-five different bible societies met at New York and organized the American Bible Society. Mills also played a leading role in the formation of the American Colonization Society in 1817, along with Dr. Robert Finley, a clergyman from New Jersey who founded the National Colonization Society and died in 1817. In 1818, following a brief stay in England, Mills sailed to the west coast of Africa to purchase land for the American Colonization Society. He embarked for the United States on May 22, and died at sea. Mills's niece, Julia Sherman Mills (1817‚Äì1890) married missionary Samuel C. Damon (1815‚Äì1885).

It produces spacecraft, launch vehicles (rockets), liquid-propellant rockets, landing gears, castings, forgings, tractors, tools, and industrial products. The company is headquartered in Dnipro, and reports to the State Space Agency of Ukraine. It works with international aerospace partners in 23 countries. ==History== Yuzhmash operated initially as \\"plant 586\\" in the Soviet Union. In 1954 Russian aviation engineer Mikhail Yangel established the autonomous design bureau designated OKB-586, from the former chief designer's division of plant 586. Yangel had previously headed OKB-1 (today RKK Energiya) and was primarily a supporter of liquid fuel technology ‚Äì unlike Sergei Korolev at OKB-1, who was a supporter of missiles using cryogenic fuels. To pursue development of ballistic missiles using storable liquid fuels, Mikhail Yangel had received authorization to convert the chief designer's division of the plant into an autonomous design bureau. Following this, OKB-586 was designated Southern Design Bureau (better known as Pivdenne) and plant 586 was renamed Southern Machine-Building Plant in 1966, with a focus on the design and production of ballistic missiles. The plant was later renamed Southern Machine-Building Production Union, or Yuzhmash. Missiles produced at Yuzhmash included the first nuclear armed Soviet rocket R-5M (SS-3 'Shyster'), the R-12 Dvina (SS-4 'Sandal'), the R-14 Chusovaya (SS-5 'Skean'), the first widely deployed Soviet ICBM R-16 (SS-7 'Saddler'), the R-36 (SS-9 'Scarp'), the MR- UR-100 Sotka (SS-17 'Spanker'), and the R-36M (SS-18 'Satan'). During the Soviet era, the plant was capable of producing of up to 120 ICBMs a year. In the late 1980s, Yuzhmash was selected to be the main production facility of the RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM (SS-27 \\"Sickle B\\"). After the beginning of perestroika, demand for military production declined significantly, and the Yuzhmash product line was expanded to include non-military uses such as civilian machinery. One line of products added after 1992 are trolleybuses. Models include the articulated YuMZ T1 (1992‚Äì2008), its non-articulated brother YuMZ T2 (1993‚Äì2008) and more modern YuMZ E-186 (2005‚Äì2006) which features a low floor cabin. Leonid Kuchma, long-time chief manager (1986‚Äì1992) of the company, became the Prime Minister in 1992, and later President of Ukraine in 1994. Yuzhmash' \\"Antares II\\" rocket designed for NASA to deliver commercial cargo to the International Space Station In addition to production facilities in Dnipro, Pivdenne Production Association includes the Pavlohrad Mechanical Plant, which specializes in producing solid-fuel missiles. Pivdenmash's importance was further bolstered by its links to Ukraine's former President Leonid Kuchma, who worked at Pivdenmash between 1975 and 1992. He was the plant's general manager from 1986 to 1991. In February 2015, following a year of strained relations, Russia announced that it would sever its \\"joint program with Ukraine to launch Dnepr rockets and [was] no longer interested in buying Ukrainian Zenit boosters, deepening problems for [Ukraine's] space program and its struggling Yuzhmash factory.\\" With the loss of Russian business some thought that the only hope for the company was increased international business which seemed unlikely in the time frame available. Bankruptcy seemed certain as of February 2015, but was averted. ==Today== On August 14, 2017, the Institute of International Strategic Studies issued a report presenting evidence that \\"North Korea has acquired a high-performance liquid-propellant engine from illicit networks in Russia and Ukraine\\", likely produced by Yuzhmash facilities. Both the company and the Ukrainian government denied the allegation. An Antares rocket using a Yuzhmash core was launched from Wallops Island in October 2016 to deliver supplies to the ISS. A Zenit rocket was launched in December 2017, after a two-year hiatus, to deliver AngoSat 1. In March February 2018 Yuzhmash announced plans to develop a testing platform for Hyperloop that was scheduled for completion in 2019 in Dnipro. In September 2019 the (new) Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine, Vladyslav Krykliy, cancelled this (according to him \\"absurd\\") project. ==Structure== * Factory of missile and aviation aggregates (created in 2010 through organization) * Pavlohrad Mechanical Factory (located in Pavlohrad) * Dnipro Tractor Factory * Factory of Technological Equipment * Production Complex \\"Metalurhiya\\" * Production Complex \\"Yuzhmashenergo\\" * Construction and Installation Complex * Sports Complex Meteor * Social and domestic administration **Sanatoriums \\"Dubrava\\" (Bila Tserkva) and \\"Druzhba\\" (Alushta), Hotel Pivdennyi, Mashynobudivnykiv Palace of Culture * Airline Yuzhmashavia ==Military and space industry== Yuzhmash is known for its military and space industry products, and earned the city of Dnipro the nickname of \\"Rocket City\\". ===Missiles=== The company had been the key missile producer for Soviet ICBM and space exploration programs.

His maternal grandparents were William Bourchier, Count of Eu and Anne of Gloucester. In 1451 the earldom of Surrey was revived for him. Mowbray was descended from a sister of the last earl of the previous creation. In 1461 he succeeded his father as 4th Duke of Norfolk and hereditary Earl Marshal. He continued his father's efforts to possess Caister Castle, finally taking it in September 1469 after a siege. John Paston had inherited Caister from John Fastolf in 1459 and was in charge of defending it. Although Paston had been in Mowbray's service for several years, Mowbray showed a notable ruthlessness in his conduct of the siege, in which one Daubenay, a long-standing Paston servant, was killed. Under pressure from the Church, Norfolk did at least grant the other defenders a safe conduct. In 1476, within a day of Norfolk's death, the Paston family took Caister back again. Norfolk was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1472. He died very suddenly, having apparently been in good health the day before. He married Elizabeth Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and his second wife Lady Margaret Beauchamp. They had only one child, Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, and so the 1397 creation of the dukedom became extinct upon his death. Anne, who was only 3 years old when her father died, inherited the earldom and his extensive lands and wealth. The dukedom would be recreated in 1481 and again in 1483.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 301 (US 301) and SR 35 in Templeton north to US 360 Business in Mechanicsville. SR 156 follows a circuitous route through the eastern part of the Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan area. South of the James River, the state highway connects Templeton in Prince George County with Hopewell, which is directly served by SR 156 Business. SR 156 crosses the James River on the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge and briefly passes through Charles City County. For most of its length in Henrico and Hanover, the state highway is a rural road that provides access to several units of Richmond National Battlefield Park. However, SR 156 provides access to Richmond International Airport, Interstate 64, and I-295 as it passes through the Richmond suburbs of Sandston and Highland Springs as a major highway. ==Route description== View south along SR 156 at SR 106 in Prince George SR 156 begins at a four-way intersection with US 301 and SR 35 (Courtland Road) in Templeton. The south leg of the intersection is an exit ramp from northbound I-95. US 301 and SR 35 head west along Courtland Road to provide access to the remaining ramps of the highways' diamond interchange with I-95. SR 35 heads east along Courtland Road toward Courtland. SR 156 and US 301 run concurrently north along Prince George Drive before US 301 splits northwest to follow Crater Road toward Petersburg. SR 156 continues northeast along two-lane Prince George Drive toward its junction with US 460 (County Drive) northwest of Disputanta, which occurs just after the state highway crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Norfolk District. The state highway continues north to the community of Prince George, the county seat of Prince George County, where the highway has a four-way intersection with SR 106 (Courthouse Road) and SR 156 Business (Prince George Drive). SR 106 heads southwest toward the county office complex, SR 156 Business heads north to serve Hopewell, and SR 156 and SR 106 head northeast along Ruffin Road to bypass Hopewell. SR 156 and SR 106 follow Ruffin Road to SR 10 (James River Drive); this intersection is also the northern end of SR 156 Business. The two highways turn east to run concurrently with the four-lane divided highway to its next intersection with Jordan Point Road. SR 156 and SR 106 turn north onto two-lane Jordan Point Road, which leads to Jordan Point. The two highways cross the James River on the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge that is named for Benjamin Harrison V, the father of William Henry Harrison and great-grandfather of Benjamin Harrison. The two highways enter Charles City County as Roxbury Road, which they follow north to SR 5 (John Tyler Memorial Highway) at Kimages. SR 5 heads east toward Charles City, SR 106 continues north along Roxbury Road toward Roxbury, and SR 156 turns west to join SR 5 in a concurrency. SR 156 and SR 5 initially head west but curve north and pass by Shirley Plantation, one of the James River plantations. The two highways pass through the hamlet of Granville, which lies on the James River opposite Turkey Island, which is formed by a bend in the river that encloses Presquile National Wildlife Refuge. Just north of Granville, SR 156 and SR 5 cross Turkey Island Creek into Henrico County, where the highways follow New Market Road until SR 156 turns northeast onto Willis Church Road. At Carters Mill Road, SR 156 makes a right-angle turn north just before passing through the Malvern Hill unit of Richmond National Battlefield Park. The state highway passes Glendale National Cemetery and the Glendale unit of the battlefield park before reaching a four-way intersection with Charles City Road and Darbytown Road, where SR 156 makes a right-angle turn to the east onto Charles City Road. SR 156 follows Charles City Road to Elko Road, onto which the highway turns north to cross the White Oak Swamp and intersect CSX's Peninsula Subdivision in the hamlet of Elko. The state highway passes scattered residential subdivisions as it follows the eastern edge of the Elko Tract, part of which is an industrial park accessed via SR 380 (Elko Tract Road). North of the Elko Tract, SR 156 turns west and joins US 60 and SR 33 on Williamsburg Road, a four-lane divided highway. The three highways meet I-295 at a cloverleaf interchange and enter the community of Sandston, through which the highways pass as a two-lane road. SR 33 turns north onto Nine Mile Road next to Seven Pines National Cemetery. SR 156 and US 60 expand to a four- lane divided highway again as they begin to follow the northern edge of the Richmond International Airport property. SR 156 and US 60 diverge at Airport Drive, which heads south into the airport and north as part of SR 156. The four-lane divided highway has a cloverleaf interchange with I-64 and, just to the north, intersects Norfolk Southern Railway's Richmond District at grade. SR 156 continues northeast through the community of Highland Springs, where it intersects SR 33 (Nine Mile Road) again. SR 156 has another cloverleaf interchange with I-295. East of the Interstate at Old Hanover Road, the state highway reduces to two lanes and briefly becomes Hanover Road before crossing the Chickahominy River into Hanover County. SR 156 continues north as Cold Harbor Road, which makes a right-angle turn west at SR 619 (Rockhill Road) to pass by the Gaines' Mill and Cold Harbor units of Richmond National Battlefield Park. After intersecting SR 615 (Creighton Road), which provides access to I-295, the state highway enters a suburban area where the highway makes another right-angle turn west at SR 636 (Walnut Grove Road) and SR 643 (Lee Davis Road). SR 156 crosses over I-295 with no access and passes by the Beaver Dam Creek unit of the battlefield park before entering Mechanicsville. The state highway has a three-quarter diamond interchange with US 360 (Mechanicsville Bypass) just before reaching its northern terminus at US 360 Business (Mechanicsville Turnpike), which completes the missing westbound US 360 to SR 156 movement of the interchange. The road continues northwest as SR 638 (Atlee Road). ==Major intersections== ==Bannered route== ===Hopewell business route=== View north along SR 156 Bus. at SR 109 in Prince George Virginia State Route 156 Business (SR 156 Business) is a business route of SR 156 through the independent city of Hopewell. The highway runs from SR 156 and SR 106 in Prince George north to SR 156, SR 10, and SR 106 near Jordan Point. SR 156 Business begins as Prince George Drive, which heads northwest as a two- lane road from the SR 156-SR 106 junction and enters the city of Hopewell by crossing Bailey Creek. The highway enters the city as Arlington Road, which immediately expands to four lanes. When Arlington Road splits to the north, SR 156 Business continues on High Street to SR 36 (Winston Churchill Drive). The business route turns northeast onto the four-lane divided highway and runs concurrently with SR 36 until that highway turns onto Arlington Road to head toward downtown Hopewell. SR 156 Business intersects several rail spurs as the highway enters an industrial area. Within the industrial area, the business route intersects SR 10 (Randolph Road). SR 156 Business and SR 10 run concurrently east out of the industrial area. The highways leave the city of Hopewell by crossing Bailey Creek again before the business route reaches its northern terminus at the intersection between SR 156, SR 10, and SR 106. ==References== ==External links== *Virginia Highways Project: VA 156 156 State Route 156 State Route 156 State Route 156 State Route 156 State Route 156 ","title":"Virginia State Route 156"},{"id":"1432123","text":"Gloria Naylor (January 25, 1950 ‚Äì September 28, 2016) was an American novelist, known for novels including The Women of Brewster Place (1982), Linden Hills (1985) and Mama Day (1988). ==Early life and education== Naylor was born in New York on January 25, 1950, the oldest child of Roosevelt Naylor and Alberta McAlpin.

An outstanding student who read voraciously, Naylor was placed into advanced classes in high school, where she immersed herself in the work of nineteenth century British novelists. Her educational aspirations, however, were delayed by the shock of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in her senior year.

She began to avidly read the work of Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, and other black women novelists, none of which she had been exposed to previously. She went on to earn an M.A. in African-American studies at Yale University; her thesis eventually became her second published novel, Linden Hills. Naylor earned her bachelor's degree in English at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York in 1981. She obtained a master's degree in African American Studies from Yale University in 1983. She was an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. ==Career== Naylor's debut novel, The Women of Brewster Place, was published in 1982 and won the 1983 National Book Award in the category First Novel.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1983\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-28. (With acceptance speech by Naylor and essays by Rachel Helgeson and Felicia Pride from the Awards' 60-year anniversary blog.) ‚Ä¢ First novels or first works of fiction were recognized from 1980 to 1985. It was adapted as a 1989 television miniseries of the same name by Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions. Naylor's work is featured in such anthologies as Breaking Ice: An Anthology of Contemporary African-American Fiction (ed. Terry McMillan, 1990), Calling the Wind: Twentieth-Century African-American Short Stories (ed. Clarence Major, 1992) and Daughters of Africa (ed. Margaret Busby, 1992). During her career as a professor, Naylor taught writing and literature at several universities, including George Washington University, New York University, Boston University, University of Kent, University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University. In 2009, Naylor donated her archives to Sacred Heart University. The collection is currently on loan at Lehigh University for digitization. Naylor died of a heart attack on September 28, 2016, while visiting St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands.

In that book, as in her successive novels, including Linden Hills, Mama Day, and The Men of Brewster Place, Naylor gave an intense and vivid depiction of many social issues, including poverty, racism, homophobia, discrimination against women, and the social stratification of African Americans. Vashti Crutcher Lewis, a contributor to the Dictionary of Literary Biography, commented on the \\"brilliance\\" of Naylor's first novel, derived from \\"her rich prose, her lyrical portrayals of African Americans, and her illumination of the meaning of being a black woman in America.\\" In The Women of Brewster Place and her other novels, Naylor focuses on \\"themes of deferred dreams of love (familial and sexual), marriage, respectability, and economic stability, while observing the recurring messages that poverty breeds violence, that true friendship and affection are not dependent on gender, and that women in the black ghettos of America bear their burdens with grace and courage,\\" stated Lewis. ==Awards== *National Book Award for first novel, 1983 *National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, 1985 *Candace Award, National Coalition of 100 Black Women, 1986 *Guggenheim Fellowship, 1988 *Lillian Smith Award, 1989. ==References== ==Further reading== * Prahlad, Sw.

During his 15-year career, Thon spent two seasons with the Angels (1979‚Äì1980), seven seasons with the Houston Astros (1981‚Äì1987), one season with the San Diego Padres (1988), three seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies (1989‚Äì1991), one season with the Texas Rangers (1992), and finished his career with the Milwaukee Brewers (1993). == Potential and beaning == By 1984, Thon was drawing excitement about his potential. \\"He's already the best shortstop in the league,\\" said Craig Reynolds, whom Thon had replaced as the Astro shortstop. Al Rosen, Thon's general manager, said, \\"when I see Dickie Thon, I see a future Hall of Famer.\\" His career was permanently altered on April 8, 1984, when he was hit in the face by Mike Torrez's fastball. Bill James thinks Thon might have been a Hall of Famer had the injury not occurred. The pitch broke the orbital bone around his left eye and ended his 1984 season. He returned in 1985, but suffered from problems with depth perception that permanently hampered his potential. In 1991, Thon received the Tony Conigliaro Award in recognition of his recovery from this severe injury. In 2013, Thon said, \\"I couldn't see the ball very well after I got hit in my left eye. I had to make adjustments, and open up a little bit and see the ball better. It's tough to do that in the big leagues, but I did manage to play 10 [more] years.\\"Thon reflects on injury after Stassi, Heyward are hit: Once-promising Astros shortstop suffered vision problems after fastball hit face, MLB, Brian McTaggart, Aug. 22, 2013. He viewed the injury as just one bad moment in a life filled mostly with blessings: \\"I've had a lot of good things happen to me. I try to think about it that way.\\" == Personal life == Thon is a third- generation baseball player. He is the grandson of Freddie Thon Sr., a native Puerto Rican who played and managed in the Puerto Rican Baseball League during World War II. His father Freddie Thon Jr., who signed a major-league contract but injured his arm before reporting to training, played semi-pro baseball while finishing college at Notre Dame, and coached all of his sons throughout their Little League and teenage years. Dickie's brother Frankie Thon is also affiliated with major league baseball in both the U.S. and Puerto Rico having been a player, a manager and a current major-league scout, as well as the general manager of the Criollos de Caguas in the Puerto Rican League. Thon's son, Dickie Joe Thon, was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 5th round, 156th overall in the June 2010 baseball draft and played the 2016 season for the Dunedin Blue Jays. Thon was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on September 13, 2003. As of 2013, Thon owned a Puerto Rican Winter League team in Santurce. He is a devout Catholic. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players#Third-generation families * List of Puerto Ricans ==References== ==External links== *Prospectus Hit and RunI Saw 'em When, Part 2, article by Jay Jaffe Category:1958 births Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:California Angels players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Sportspeople from South Bend, Indiana Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Puerto Rican baseball players Category:Salinas Angels players Category:Salt Lake City Gulls players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:Quad Cities Angels players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Tucson Toros players Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Sportspeople with a vision impairment ","title":"Dickie Thon"},{"id":"1432131","text":"Robert Benjamin Leighton (; September 10, 1919 - March 9, 1997) was a prominent American experimental physicist who spent his professional career at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His work over the years spanned solid state physics, cosmic ray physics, the beginnings of modern particle physics, solar physics, the planets, infrared astronomy, and millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy. In the latter four fields, his pioneering work opened up entirely new areas of research that subsequently developed into vigorous scientific communities. == Early life == Leighton was born in Detroit, where his father made precision dies for an automobile company. After moving to Seattle the family broke up, and his father returned to Detroit. His mother moved to downtown Los Angeles, where she worked as a maid in a hotel. Leighton grew up in Los Angeles and attended Los Angeles City College. He was accepted to Caltech as a junior in 1939 but lived at home, helping support his mother and himself with a job building X-ray equipment for the Kellogg Laboratory. == Education and Caltech == Leighton received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech in 1941. He then switched to physics and went on to obtain his M.S. in 1944, and his Ph.D. in 1947 with a thesis on the specific heat of face-centered cubic crystals.Leighton, Robert B. (1947). The vibrational spectrum of a mon-atomic face-centered cubic crystal lattice (Doctoral dissertation, California Institute of Technology). He joined the faculty in 1949 and later served as Division Chair of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy from 1970 to 1975. Leighton was a renowned teacher at Caltech. His Principles of Modern Physics, published in 1959, was a standard and influential textbook.Leighton, Robert B. (1959). Principles of Modern Physics. New York: McGraw-Hill. == Relationships == Leighton and Richard Feynman were close personal friends. After Richard's Lectures in Physics course, in the early 1960s, Leighton spent over two years reworking the tape-recorded text into publishable form: The Feynman Lectures on Physics, which were published in 1964 and 1966, and which have enjoyed perennial success ever since.Feynman, R. P., Leighton, R. B., & Sands, M. (2013). The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Desktop Edition Volume I (Vol. 1). Basic Books.Feynman, R. P., Leighton, R. B., & Sands, M. (2011). The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Mainly mechanics, radiation, and heat (Vol. 1). Basic Books.Feynman, R. P. (1965). Feynman lectures on physics. Volume 3: Quantum mechancis. Reading, Ma.: Addison- Wesley, 1965, edited by Feynman, Richard P.; Leighton, Robert B.; Sands, Matthew. In addition, he co-authored, with Robbie Vogt, a set of problems to accompany the Feynman Lectures. One of Leighton's sons, Ralph, also collaborated with Feynman on several books. == Scientific achievements == Leighton was known as a remarkably ingenious physicist and astrophysicist during his 58 years at Caltech. He found no instrumentation problem too difficult, especially if it might open a new part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observation. If he found an inexpensive solution, he would build the apparatus in his spare time, for use by others and by himself. Leighton built, improved, and used cloud chambers to identify and measure new products of cosmic ray collisions. He explored the decay modes of mu-mesons and recognized several of the strange particles when particle physics was at its beginning. Leighton played a key role in 1949 in showing that the mu-meson decay products are two neutrinos and an electron, and he made the first measurement of the energy spectrum of the decay electron (at the time, low statistics experiments suggested that only one neutrino was involved). In 1950 he made the first observation of strange particle decays after the initial discovery of two cases in England in 1947. Over the next seven years, he elucidated many of the properties, e.g., mass, lifetime, decay-modes and energies, of several of the new strange particles, in particular, the lambda, the xi, and what were then called the theta particles (K-mesons). His subject matter evolved from physics to astrophysics as he helped astronomy take on its modern shape. About 1956, Leighton became interested in the physics of the outer layers of the Sun. With characteristic imagination and insight, he devised Doppler shift and Zeeman effect solar cameras. They were applied with striking success to the investigation of magnetic and velocity fields on the sun. With the Zeeman camera, Leighton mapped complicated patterns of the sun's magnetic field with excellent resolution. Even more striking were his discoveries of a remarkable five-minute oscillation in local surface velocities and of a \\"super-granulation pattern\\" of horizontal convection currents in large cells of moving material. These solar oscillations have subsequently been recognized as internally trapped acoustic waves, opening up the whole new fields of helioseismology and solar magneto convection. Leighton himself soon realized that solar magneto-convection cells would lead to an effective diffusion of flux on the solar surface (now called Leighton diffusion), and he included it in a dynamo model of the solar cycle.Neugebauer, Gerry; Peck, Charles W.; Sheeley, Neil; Trimble, Virginia (1997). \\"Robert B. Leighton (1919 - 1997)\\" [obituary]. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 29:1477. DOI: 10.3847/BAASOBIT1997014 In the early 1960s, Leighton developed and fabricated a novel, inexpensive infrared telescope, which included a simple array of eight lead-sulfide photocells. These cells were surplus from the defense industry; they had been developed for the Sidewinder missile‚Äôs heat-seeking guidance system. Starting in 1965, he and Gerry Neugebauer used the new telescope to sweep the roughly 70 percent of the sky visible from Mt. Wilson Observatory, collecting the data as squiggles on a strip-chart recorder. This began a new area of infrared astronomy. The resulting Two- Micron Sky Survey, published in 1969, contained 5,612 infrared sources, the vast majority of which had been previously uncataloged. Some of these have been found to be new stars still surrounded by their dusty pre-stellar shells, while others are supergiant stars in the last stages of their evolution, embedded in expanding dusty shells of matter ejected by the stars themselves. Leighton's development of photographic equipment during the mid-1950s had allowed him to obtain the best pictures of the planets ever attained anywhere to that time, from the 60 and 100-inch telescopes, and led to his work as Team Leader at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the Imaging Science Investigations on the Mariner 4, 6, and 7 missions to Mars during the middle 1960s. As Team Leader and an experienced experimental physicist, Leighton played a key role in forming and guiding the development of JPL's first digital television system for use in deep space: the Mariner 4 flyby of Mars in 1964.Sinnot, Roger (2015). \\"75, 50, & 25 Years Ago Today,\\" Sky & Telescope 130 (3):8: \\"The ... grainy Mariner 4 images, which showed craters among bleak landscapes, ... forever changed our perception of Mars.\\" He also contributed to the first efforts at image processing and enhancement techniques made possible by the digital form of the imaging data. He received the Space Science Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for the Mariner television experiments in 1967 and the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1971. In the 1970s, Leighton's interest shifted to the development of large, inexpensive dish antenna which could be used to pursue millimeter-wave interferometry and submillimeter-wave astronomy. Once again, his remarkable experimental abilities opened a new field of science at Caltech which continues to be vigorously pursued at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii using the \\"Leighton Dishes\\". Leighton was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and served on its Space Science Board. Leighton shared the Rumford Prize in 1986 for advancements in Infrared Astronomy, and won the James Craig Watson Medal in 1988, for his work as creator and exploiter of new instruments and techniques that opened whole new areas of astronomy ‚Äî solar oscillations, infrared surveys, spun telescopes, and large millimeter-wave reflectors. == Late years == Leighton retired from teaching in 1985 and from research in 1990 as the William L. Valentine professor of physics, emeritus. The New York Times published Leighton's obituary on 14 March 1997, five days after his death. The downtown Los Angeles Library, where Leighton read mathematics and astronomy after school as a child, also presented a symposium and exhibit in Leighton's honor soon after his death. In 2009, a 66 km- diameter crater in the Syrtis Major region of Mars was named after him. ==References== ==External links== * National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoirs V.75 (1998) - Robert B.

The Presbyterian Reformed Church holds to the belief that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the infallible Word of God. The office-bearers must adopt and hold the original 1646 edition of the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Larger Catechism and the Westminster Shorter Catechism as standards subordinate to the Bible. The office-bearers also accept the Westminster Directory of Public Worship as a scriptural and suitable guide in the conduct of public worship. Therefore, psalms are sung in public worship solely and without instrumental accompaniment, and the Scottish Metrical Psalter of 1650 is used solely in the public singing of psalms. The Authorized King James Version of the Bible is the stated text for public reading. ==History== ===Chesley=== The beginnings of Presbyterian Reformed Church can be located at Chesley, Ontario, Canada. In 1873, Rev. Thomas Hannah led a congregation near Williamsford and created the United Presbyterian Church. The church was received in 1912 by the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which provided a pastor. By this time, the Presbyterian church in North America had spread to several locations including Lochalsh, in Huron County, Ontario, Kincardine, Ontario, as well as East Williams and Brucefield, Ontario. In 1918, the scattered congregations were recognized as the Ontario congregation of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland sent pastor William Matheson. Matheson grew up in Lochalsh, Ontario but went to Scotland to train and study ministry through the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. During his stay in Scotland, Matheson befriended John Murray, who began to attend Princeton Seminary in 1924. During this time, a controversy broke out in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The church's Synod decided that the use of public transportation to attend service went against the Sabbath. Matheson and Murray claimed otherwise and were cut off from the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. As a result, Murray was denied ordination by the Church and instead chose to accept a call to teach at Princeton. In 1937, he was ordained through the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Matheson became involved with the congregations at Chesley and Lochalsh, as well as the congregations in Bruce, Huron, and Elgin countries Ontario until his death in 1957. The Chesley congregation eventually began the Presbyterian Reformed Church under the guidance of Murray. Murray conducted Matheson's funeral and later retired in 1968. He returned to Scotland and died in 1975. ==Growth== In 1976 Dr. William Young, an acquaintance of John Murray, joined the presbytery and began serving a congregation at Seekonk, Massachusetts. This congregation became the Presbyterian Reformed Church in 1978. After the death of John Murray, Dr. David Freeman took over preaching duties in Chesley. In 1979, the presbytery organized a congregation under pastor Harry Grimes which no longer exists. In 1992, the presbytery received Trinity Reformed Church from Des Moines, Iowa. In 2001, Michael J. Ericson was installed as the pastor. In 1996, a congregation was organized in Portland, Oregon with D. Douglas Gebbie as the pastor. In 1998, a congregation was organized in Charlotte, North Carolina, led by pastor Timothy J. Worrell until 2013 . After initiating Bible studies in 2012, a congregation was organized in Jasper, Indiana in 2015. The Jasper congregation is led by pastor Brad Freeman. https://presbyterianreformed.org/prc-of-jasper-in/ There are also congregations in Rhode Island and Columbus, IN. ==References== ==External links== * *Stockton Presbyterian Reformed Church in England Category:Christian organizations established in 1965 Category:Presbyterian denominations in the United States Category:Presbyterian denominations in Canada Category:Presbyterian denominations established in the 20th century Category:Evangelical denominations in North America ","title":"Presbyterian Reformed Church (North America)"},{"id":"1432147","text":"The Audi S4 is the high performance variant of Audi's compact executive car A4. The original Audi S4, built from 1991 until 1994, was a performance- oriented version of Audi's 100 saloon/sedan. All subsequent S4s since 1997 have been based on the Audi A4; and as the A4 has evolved from one generation to the next, so has the S4. A more powerful internal combustion engine, larger upgraded brakes, firmer suspension, larger wheels, and distinctive sheetmetal, styling clues and badging have always been amongst the many upgrades the S4 receives over its mainstream 100 and A4 siblings. In markets where the even higher-performance Audi RS4 is not offered, the S4 is the top-of-the-line trim of the A4 family.AudiWorld.com North American S4 Model Guide - historical S4 specifications, prices, and options Like its regular A4 counterpart, all S4 variants have had longitudinally oriented, front-mounted engines. A single turbocharged 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder powered the original C4 version, and a 2.7-litre twin turbocharged V6 engine was found in the B5 generation. The B6 and B7 versions shared a common 4.2-litre V8 engine, the first time that a V8 engine was placed in a compact executive car, placing it in direct competition with the BMW M3 which at the time had a 3.2 L inline 6. The B8 generation uses a supercharged 3.0-litre V6 TFSI engine and competes with the BMW 335i. The recently introduced B9 generation is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 TFSI engine, as opposed to a supercharger like in the previous iteration.https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-s4http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/2018-audi-s4-s5-first- drive-review/ All versions of the S4 have their transmission mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and like all Audi \\"S\\" cars, are only available as standard with Audi's quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, using a Torsen- based centre differential system.ETKA official factory data All versions of the S4 have been manufactured at Audi's plant in Ingolstadt, Germany; they are, or have been available as a four-door five-seat saloon and a five-door five-seat Avant (Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon) body styles since the model's inception in 1991. A two-door four-seat Cabriolet (convertible) S4 variant was introduced as part of the B6 and B7 generation A4 lineups. The B8 Cabriolet has now been built off the A5 coupe body style and the \\"S\\" variant is marketed under the Audi S5 nameplate. ==C4 (Type 4A, 1991‚Äì1994)== Factory production of the original Audi S4 (Typ 4A), usually known as Audi 100 S4, began in August 1991 to serve as the performance version of the newly updated C4 platform 100 four-door, five-seat saloon. It was designed to replace the outgoing C3 based Audi 200 quattro turbo, which had been Audi's first true sports-saloon and had been discontinued at the end of 1990. Being the first S4 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the , derived from the augmentive word (meaning: original). Audi S4 Avant (C4) Audi mildly updated the C4-based model line in 1994 and dropped the 100 nomenclature; all variants of the former Audi 100 line were now re-badged as the Audi A6. In line with the switch in model name, Audi temporarily discontinued the use of the S4 name and began selling an updated but fundamentally identical version of the car, based on the \\"new\\" A6 and badged as S6. Despite the change in name, differences between the outgoing S4 and incoming S6 were primarily cosmetic. A more powerful, more expensive and more exclusive variant known first as the S4 Plus and later as the S6 Plus was available from October 1992 through to July 1994. Built in very small numbers, the \\"Plus\\" models featured numerous performance enhancing upgrades; including the use of Audi's 4.2-litre V8 engine in place of the then current inline-five engine. An all-new C5-based Audi A6 debuted for 1997, after which the S4 and S6 became distinctly separate models based on very different platforms. The C4 variant S4 ended factory production after less than three years in July 1994. One of its most renowned owners was Ayrton Senna who owned a silver Avant, not least because he was the Audi distributor for Brazil. ===C4 powertrain=== In standard form, the powertrain detail of the C4-based S4 was available with only one engine, a single turbocharged and intercooled version of Audi's 2.2-litre 20-valve inline five-cylinder engine This displaced and was equipped with an advanced Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU). This engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN), developed a motive power output of at 5,900 revolutions per minute (rpm) and of torque 1,950 rpm. This powerplant made it rather powerful by contemporary standards, and the vehicle with five-speed manual transmission was able to accelerate from standstill to in 6.2 seconds. Both five- and six-speed manual transmissions (parts code prefix: 01E, identification codes: five-speed: CBD, CET, six- speed: CBL, CMG) were offered to European customers, but a five-speed manual was the only transmission available in North America; a four-speed automatic transmission (parts code prefix: 01F, identification code: CBF) was available as an option worldwide. Front and rear axle final drive ratio is either 4.111 or 3.889 (dependent on transmission type), and the rear axle (parts code prefix: 017, identification codes: AAT, AET) uses a driver-selectable electro- pneumatic-mechanical switchable diff lock. Audi's quattro four-wheel-drive system was standard on the C4 S4/S6; a first-generation Torsen-based system which used the \\"T-1\\" automatically biasing centre differential (ATB) was used on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, while a transfer box based system was used on vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission. S4/S6 \\"Plus\\" models equipped with a 4.2-litre all-aluminium alloy V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: ABH) became available to European customers as an option from October 1992, only with the six-speed manual gearbox, in either saloon or Avant body styles. ===C4 steering, brakes, wheels & tires=== All C4 S4s' came equipped as standard with a conventional fixed- assistance rack and pinion power assisted steering (PAS) system. An electronically controlled 'servotronic' system, which varied the level of assistance in accordance with the road speed, was available as an option. There were two different types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. All S4s' initially had diameter by thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding caliper inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at by - with a conventionally mounted Lucas- Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller discs. The rear brakes, by and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three- channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load sensing valve for the rear brakes was standard throughout production. For wheel options, the standard five-arm \\"Fuchs\\" forged alloy wheels were 8.0Jx16H2 ET40, and were shod with 225/50 R16 sized tyres. Several other tyre and wheel designs were optionally available: a 7.5Jx15H2 ET40 six- spoke with 215/60 R15 tyres, an 8.0Jx16H2 ET40 five-double-spoke, a 7.5Jx16H2 ET35 six spoke \\"Avus\\", and an 8.0Jx17H2 ET40 ten-spoke. ==B5 (Type 8D, 1997‚Äì2002)== Audi B5 S4 Avant Audi B5 S4 sedan The second generation S4 (Type 8D), now correctly titled Audi S4 quattro debuted in 1997, with factory production commencing October 1997, as part of the facelifted B5 platform Audi A4 line-up, although it wasn't available in North America until late 1999. In addition to the saloon (sedan), an estate version (wagon)‚Äìthe Audi S4 Avant‚Äìwas introduced into the lineup from 1998. Production of the B5 S4 ceased in September 2001, although it was still sold together with the next B6 platform generation through 2002 in North America. Examples produced July 2001 to end of production are 2002 Model Year cars, the 10th digit of the VIN being the number \\"2\\". Several years after it was sold new, the B5 S4 remains a potent enthusiast car, and as featured in the December 2007 issue of Sport Compact Car magazine, a Torque Factory tuned S4 won a comparison test against several other extreme performance cars.Sport Compact Car magazine 2007 Ultimate Street Car Challenge \\"The Audi S4 ... showed its capability with consistently strong finishes in the acceleration, dyno, braking and driveability tests\\" ===B5 powertrain=== The powertrain details of the B5 S4 feature a 2.7-litre twin-turbo ('biturbo') 90¬∞ third-generation V6 engine (parts code prefix: 078, identification codes: AGB, AZB, APB). Details of the powerplant include a cast iron cylinder block with two lightweight aluminium alloy cylinder heads. The valvetrain includes 30 valves (five valves per cylinder),Audi Self-Study Programme SSP198 - The 2.7-litre V6 biturboAudi.com - Glossary five valves per cylinder twin hybrid-driven (timing belt and roller chain) double overhead camshafts and variable valve timing for the inlet valves. The intake air is pressurized by two parallel water-cooled BorgWarner K03-series turbochargers; the charged air is cooled by two side-mounted air- to-air intercoolers (SMICs). It displaces , and is rated to produce a motive power output of at 5,800 rpm, and generates of torque at 1,850 rpm. Engine management was by way of a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1 (7.0 in North America) electronic engine control unit (ECU), and helped it meet the European EU-3D emissions standard. In all US-market cars, the engine was detuned to meet US emissions regulations; output was reduced to and (identification code: APB). As in the previous S4, a six-speed C90 manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DSY, gear ratios: 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.231, 4th: 0.967, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684) was standard equipment, as was the Torsen T-2 quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. Final drive (parts code prefix: 01H, identification code: DQA) ratio is 4.111. A five-speed ZF 5HP19 tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code prefix:01V) became available for the first time as an option. The B5 S4 claims acceleration from in 5.6 seconds, and has an electronically limited top speed of , making it both the quickest saloon/sedan in the Audi model line, and among the quickest saloon/sedans in the world at that time. ===B5 suspension, brakes, wheels & tires=== The B5 S4 is fitted with 4-wheel independent suspension. The front suspension is a multi-link design with four individual control arms per wheel. The rear suspension is an unequal length double wishbone design; the lower control arms are mounted to a subframe which also carries the differential housing. Shock absorbers, coil springs, and anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The B5 S4 brake system consisted of radially ventilated discs, in diameter by thick up front, and by at the rear. Two-piston Lucas HP2 brake calipers at the front (with four pads per caliper), with Lucas single-piston sliding brake calipers at the rear. A Bosch ABS 5.3 four-channel Anti-lock Braking System (with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) - and later with ESP or Electronic Stability Programme), coupled with a vacuum servo completed the system. Standard wheels were Audi's die-cast aluminium alloy six-arm 'Avus' 7.5Jx17H2 ET45 wheels, shod with 225/45 ZR17 performance tyres. ===B5 colors & optional equipment=== Available exterior colors included Brilliant Black, Laser Red, Light Silver, Cactus Green, Santorin Blue, Hibiscus Red, Casablanca White, Pearlescent White, Imola Yellow, and Nogaro Blue. The last two colors were exclusive to the S4 model. Interior leather was available in Onyx or Silver. Available options included: * Bose premium sound system * Audi Navigation System * 6-disc CD changer * Hands free Motorola cellular telephone * Premium Package: Sunroof, HomeLink transmitter, Auto dimming mirrors * Cold Weather Package: Heated front seats, Heated outside mirrors, Expandable ski sack * Enhanced Sport Package: Alcantara seat inserts, Silver aluminum belt line trim or Carbon Fibre trim (on late 2000-2001 models), Aluminum mirror housings (on 2001 & 2002 models) The Sport Package replaced the wood-grain belt line trim with silver aluminum trim, and the wood grain finish around the shifter with black plastic. The Alcantara seat inserts were silver (on Onyx leather). With the black, white, or blue exteriors, the inserts were also available in blue Alcantara. On the early 2000 models, the Alcantara inserts in the rear seats did not fully extend forward to the front edge of the seat. ===B5 motorsport=== A motor racing version of the car achieved great success in the SpeedVision World Challenge with Michael Galati taking the 2001 SpeedVision GT title in a Champion Racing S4, winning four races, and helping Audi to its first Manufacturers' Championship. The Audi Sport specification Champion A4 chassis included a B5 RS4 engine, and Alcon racing brake calipers (4 piston front and 2 piston rear calipers). Don Istook, with Istook's Motorsports, built and campaigned several B5 S4's in first the Motorola Cup, and then the Grand Am Cup. The S4's were even raced by Istook's Motorsports in the Rolex GT category for several races to help fill the field. Of note, one of the S4's, racing against true GT cars, even ran as high as second place (in the rain) at Barber Motorsports Park. These S4's were built using existing S4, not RS4 engines, but used the B5 Audi RS4 K04 turbochargers. ==B6 (Typ 8E/8H, 2003‚Äì2005)== 2003‚Äì2005 S4 (B6) saloon (US) MY2003‚Äì2005 Audi S4 (B6) Avant (Canada) Audi S4 Cabriolet (UK) The third generation Audi S4 quattro (Typ 8E ‚Äî saloon: 8E2, Avant: 8E5, and Cabriolet: 8H7) debuted its saloon and Avant bodystyles in Europe in March 2003, and appeared in North America slightly later. This was based on the latest Volkswagen Group B6 (PL46) platform used by the then current Audi B6 A4. Despite having moved to an entirely new platform, one of the S4's most publicised new features was its new engine - a 4.2-litre V8 engine. Following its initial launch of either a four-door five- seat saloon (sedan), or a five-door five-seat Avant (estate/wagon), it eventually became available in three bodystyles - and for the first time in the Audi 'S' car range, from February 2004, a two-door four-seat Cabriolet (convertible), Typ 8H, was included in the model range.Audi Technical Data sheets - 2003 S4 quattro - saloon, Avant, and Cabriolet Official performance figures for standard discipline of sprinting from standstill to in the saloon with manual transmission are 5.6 seconds (Avant 5.8 s, Cabriolet 5.9 s), however, a road test conducted by the American automotive magazine Motor Trend indicated that it could go from a standstill to in less than 5 seconds, and make it to in slightly over 20 seconds, although doing this led to fuel consumption dipping into single digits. This was considerably worse than the earlier V6 models, leading to the addition of a $1,700 gas guzzler tax (combined ) for the six-speed manual sedan in the United States. Top speed is electronically limited to . The B6 S4 saloon and Avant variants ceased factory production in December 2004, with the Cabriolet ending twelve months later at December 2005. ===B6 powertrain=== Replacing the 2.7-litre 'biturbo' V6 engine of the previous generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 powertrain gained an all- aluminium alloy 4.2-litre, 40 valve (five valves per cylinder) V8 engine (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: BBK), with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, roller-finger rocker arm cam followers, and included variable inlet camshaft timing. It also used a strengthened alloy crankshaft bedplate for the five main bearings, and a two-part baffled oil sump, and a light-alloy variable intake manifold (VIM), containing the fractionally sequentially actuated fuel injectors. This petrol engine, based on the unit from the Audi A8, displaces , and it produces a motive power output of at 7,000 rpm, and generates torque of at 3,500 rpm, making it more powerful than the RS2 Avant, and nearly as powerful as the B5 RS4. Engine management was by way of a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas' drive by wire electronic throttle, and powering eight individual spark coils with longlife quad-electrode Bosch spark plugs. Ignition timing is a mapped direct ignition, with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors. The exhaust system includes vacuum-operated valves in the twin rear silencers (mufflers), finished with chrome plated tail-pipes. Like its predecessors, the B6 S4 was standard with a Getrag six-speed (M6S) manual transmission (parts code prefix: 0A3, identification codes: FVD, HEP) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.667, 2nd: 2.050, 3rd: 1.462, 4th: 1.133, 5th: 0.919, 6th: 0.778), with a single plate dry clutch, and Torsen T-2 quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Final drive (parts code prefix: 01R, identification code: EXZ) ratios are 3.889, giving a top gear road speed to engine revs ratio of per 1000 rpm. From July 2003, the ZF 6HP19 tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code prefix: 09L, identification codes: GUR, HHU) (ratios - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691, with a final drive (identification code: GDF) ratio of 3.539) was included as an option. An unusual sight in the engine compartment was the addition of water cooling for the 190 amp alternator, along with two additional thermostatically-controlled side-mounted radiators. ===B6 steering, brakes, wheels & tyres=== The B6 S4 came equipped with electronically controlled, variable assisted 'servotronic' rack and pinion power assisted steering (PAS) as standard. B6 S4 brakes consisted of radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The front discs are sized at in diameter by thick, and are clamped by Continental Teves-ATE FNRG-60 single-piston sliding brake calipers. The rears are by , and again use single-piston sliding calipers, with an integrated cable-operated hand brake mechanism. A Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme system, complete with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Emergency Brake Assist (EBA), Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) and Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) - also known as traction control system, coupled with a dual- rate tandem vacuum servo provided the brake actuation. Standard wheels were 'Avus-III die-cast aluminium alloy, 8.0Jx18H2 ET45 in size, and shod with (eXtra Load) high performance tyres, with factory supplies being either Continental SportContact2 or Michelin PilotSport PS2. ===B6 body & interior=== Discrete lower door trims, along with the now trademark Audi 'S' model vertical-emphasis line grille, and solid aluminium (later replaced with plastic covered by aluminium) exterior door mirrors, and S4 badging front and rear are all that visually distinguish the S4 from its related A4 brethren. In the interior, front and rear Recaro seats (fronts fully electric with the option of heated seats), as well as S4 logos in the instrument panel and door sills complete the detail. ==B7 (Typ 8E/8H, 2005‚Äì2009)== Audi S4 Sedan quattro (8EC, North America) Audi S4 Cabriolet with optional 7-spoke alloy wheels (8HE, U.S.) Audi S4 Avant quattro (8ED, Europe) The Audi B7 platform Audi S4 quattro, based on the Audi B7 A4, debuted in late 2004. Although Audi classifies it as a new car, the differences between it and the outgoing B6 S4 casually appear to be primarily cosmetic, and is still classified by the internal designation: Typ 8E (although with revised sub-designations - saloon: 8EC, Avant: 8ED, and Cabriolet: 8HE). It has the same 4.2-litre V8 engine (identification code: BBK) as the B6 S4, producing a power output of at 7,000 rpm, and torque at 3,500 rpm. There are a few mechanical changes, such as revised springs and dampers and, from model year 2007, an updated Torsen T-3 automatically biasing centre differential, featuring a 'default' asymmetric 40:60 front-rear torque split on manual transmission models, along with the later Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme and gloss black painted brake calipers. The 'Avus-III' wheels now became an option, and were replaced by a standard offering 8.0Jx18 inch 'S-design' 7-spoke forged alloy wheel. Bose sound system is now standard, whereas it was optional on the B6 S4, and an enhanced optional DVD-ROM-based RNS-E satellite navigation system replaces the previous CD-ROM-based RNS-D option. The new trapezoidal single-frame grille, Bi-Xenon high-intensity discharge lamp (HID) headlamps, L-shaped tail- lamps, quad exhaust tail pipes, and discrete V8 badging below the side repeater indicators help distinguish the B7 from the previous B6 model. ===Audi S4 25quattro=== Audi \\"S4 25quattro\\" special edition (8EC) In June 2005, Audi announced a limited edition run of 250 special edition S4 saloon cars, celebrating 25 years of quattro four wheel drive. This exclusive model was called the Audi S4 25quattro. Available only in the United States, the exterior has unique front and rear bumpers, a carbon fibre boot lip spoiler and lower front splitter, a rear functional red tow hook, and a high gloss Phantom Black painted grille with the \\"quattro\\" emblem. 15-spoke DTM alloy wheels, along with optional dealer-fitted 'Audi four-rings' decals for the front doors complete the exterior makeover. Black and grey contrasting interior leathers, along with \\"quattro\\" embossed into the Recaro seats, together with a \\"1 of 250\\" exclusive quattro gear shift knob for the manual- only gearbox define the interior changes and act as a subtle reminder of the exclusivity that the limited numbers command. On the mechanical side, the S4 25quattro was the second Audi, after the B7 RS4 to be fitted with the latest Torsen T-3 asymmetric ATB centre differential for its quattro permanent four- wheel drive system. Under normal grip conditions, this is set with a default rearwards torque distribution bias of 40:60 front to rear, and a maximum of 100% torque can automatically be apportioned to the rear axle (and up to 80% to the front) as conditions warrant. The final drive ratios are 3.889. ==B8 (Typ 8K, 2009‚Äì2016)== Audi S4 Sedan quattro (B8/8K, Australia) Audi S4 Avant (B8/8K, South Africa) From November 2008, the latest generation of the 'Audi S4 quattro'Audi.co.uk Audi S4 (Typ 8K) entered factory production. It is based on the current Audi B8 A4,AudiWorld.com News Performance Preview: exclusive look at the B8 S4 18 November 2007 built on the Volkswagen Group MLB/MLP platform. Unlike the previous B6 and B7 models, the new B8 version will only be available as a four-door five-seat saloon (sedan), or a five-door five-seat Avant (estate/wagon). The sport-performance two-door four-seat Cabriolet (convertible) mantle is now taken by the current Audi S5 Cabriolet and new Coupe. Unlike previous generations of the S4, only the sedan will be imported to the United States and Canada. Compared to the previous B6/B7 S4 which used a 4.2-litre V8 engine, this latest B8 S4 uses a smaller displacement 3.0-litre TFSI V6 engine, but now with the addition of forced induction via an Eaton mechanical supercharger. The previous B6/B7 S4s were the top-of-the-line models in North America, ahead of the 3.2L V6 and 4-cylinder 2.0T A4s, and competed with the BMW E46 330 and E90 335 respectively. The 3.0 TFSI V6 engine replaces the 3.2-litre FSI V6 as the upgrade engine in the A4 and A6 lineups starting for 2009; both the 3.2-litre FSI and 3.0 TFSI were offered together until the end of the 2010 model year. The 3.2L V6 engine is no longer offered in the A4 lineup from the 2011 model year onwards, so the recently introduced B8 S4 is now priced 9% lower than its V8 predecessors, and slots directly above the 4-cylinder 2.0T base model. The S4 now compares more closely with the BMW 335i. Previously unavailable enthusiast driver aids are now optional, such as Audi's Sport Rear Differential, active steering and adaptive damping suspension (part of the Audi Drive Select Package). The front axle was moved by 6.1 inches to the front, which improved the weight distribution of the B8 Platform. Combined with the Sport Rear Differential Audi was able to greatly improve the weight balance and dynamics of the S4 over previous models. A new designed wheel is included on the B8 S4, an 8.5Jx18\\" '5-double-spoke S' design alloy wheel with 245/40 ZR18 high performance tyres. Optional 19 inch wheel and tyre packages are also available, sized at 8.5Jx19\\" alloy wheels with 255/35 ZR19 tyres. LED tail lights are standard fitment, along with Audi's now-trademark LED daytime running lights at the front. The S4 along with the other B8 models received a facelift in early 2012. This included a revised front-end with new headlights and grille, an updated interior, and upgraded MMI options. Mechanically, the facelift B8 (known colloquially as the B8.5) was upgraded with electromagnetic steering and a lighter crown gear center differential. ===B8 powertrain=== At the heart of the B8 S4 powertrain is an all-new, all aluminium-alloy 3.0-litre TFSI Supercharged (TFSI) V6 engine (parts code prefix: 06E, identification code: CAKA), and like the rest of the B8 model range, now with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI). This petrol engine displaces , and it is rated by Audi to a power output of from 5,500 to 7,000 rpm. Torque is rated at from 2,900 to 5,300 rpm. This high power output is achieved by using forced induction ‚Äì and specifically, an all-new Eaton 'Twin Vortices Series' (TVS) Roots-type positive displacement compressor. This new supercharger features twin four- lobe rotors, which are axially twisted 160 degrees. It is mounted on top of the engine, within the 'Vee', pumping air directly into the inlet manifold, and incorporates two separate water-cooled intercoolers. This new design of supercharger is said to reduce the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of the engine. This engine is mated to either a six-speed manual transmission (identification code: KMR) or a seven-speed 'S tronic' DL501 dual clutch transmissionPaulTan.org blog B8 Audi S4 Sedan and Avant unveiled! (identification code: LHK), the latter with steering wheel mounted paddle- shifters for tiptronic gear selection, which replaces the Tiptronic automatic transmissions found in the B6/B7 iterations. The 'Audi quattro Sports differential' fitted in the rear axle final drive unit is available as an option. Acceleration from a standstill to takes 5.1 seconds for the saloon with manual gearbox, the Avant one tenth of a second slower at 5.2 seconds. The same dash to 100 km/h in the saloon with S tronic takes 5.3 seconds, and the Avant at 5.4 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to . However, a comparison in the American automotive magazine Road & Track showed the sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds for the 6-speed manual transmission. With figures like these, the B8 S4 accelerates more quickly than its V8-engined predecessors. Audi of America claims that the version of the S4 achieves 28 highway miles per gallon, and a 0 to acceleration time of 4.9 seconds with the manual transmission and 5.1 seconds with the S tronic. Fuel consumption is rated at a combined . Therefore, the B8 S4, unlike the V8-powered B6/7 models, avoids the US gas guzzler tax. The B8 S4's 3.0 TFSI engine also gets only 1 m.p.g. less than the base 2.0 TFSI engine. This is one of the most important reasons for Audi to downsize their engines, while keeping the output equivalent better, by using forced-induction such as supercharging or turbocharging. The same engine is shared with the Audi S5 Cabriolet (though the 7-speed S Tronic is the sole transmission) and the 2013 Audi S5 Coupe. Detuned versions of this engine making are found in the 2009-11 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI (C6) mated to a 6-speed TipTronic automatic transmission, the 2012 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI (C7) and 2012 Audi A7 3.0 TFSI, the latter two which are paired with an 8-speed TipTronic automatic. ===Motorsport=== In motor racing, APR Motorsport has currently entered a B8 S4 in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge Grand Sport (GS) class.Grand-Am.com Fresh From Florida 200, entry list ==B9 (Type 8W, 2017‚Äìpresent)== Audi announced the B9 S4 in 2015, with the official unveiling of the European-spec model at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. Noticeable changes to the B9 included a modern, more angular exterior, newly designed wheels, and a new turbocharged V6 engine. Unlike the pre-facelift B8 S4, the announced European-spec model is only available with an eight-speed torque converter automatic (ZF 8HP55a). Audi S4 Avant quattro 3.0 TFSI (UK) Audi S4 Avant facelift (Germany) The new model uses LED main-beam and LED daytime running lights as standard, alongside dynamic turn signals and LED tail-lights. Like other Audi models, the notable feature in the new S4 is Virtual Cockpit which has Classic Layout and Sports Layout in displaying speedometer and tachometer. The B9 S4 features standard 18-inch 5 double-spoke wheels with summer tires, or optional 19-inch 5 V-spoke wheels. The B9's brakes use multi-piston calipers, replacing the single-piston sliding calipers of earlier models. LED headlights are standard while a flat- bottomed steering wheel, \\"S\\" embossed seats, and quad tailpipes differentiate the S4 from the B9 A4. ===B9 powertrain=== The current generation S4 is powered by a 3.0 L V6 with petrol direct injection and a single twin-scroll turbo powering the EA839 engine with and . The engine uses an hot inside V layout, which places the cylinder head exhaust ports, exhaust manifolds, and turbocharger inside the V of the engine; this is a similar arrangement to the twin-turbo V8 engines used in Audi's S6 and S7. As a result of the powertrain upgrades in the new S4, it now can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.2 seconds. It is electronically limited to a top speed of . In European markets, the facelifted B9 S4 - launched in 2019 - is now powered by a 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel V6 with and , mated to an eight-speed torque converter automatic gearbox and all-wheel-drive. For outside of European markets, however, it still retains the 3.0-litre petrol turbo V6. ==See also== *Audi Ur-S4 / Ur-S6 *Audi S and RS models ==References== ==External links== *Audi.com - international corporate portal *Audi UK - S and RS models *Audi USA - S4 S4 Category:Euro NCAP large family cars Category:Compact executive cars Category:Sports cars Category:Sports sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Convertibles Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1991 Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars ","title":"Audi S4"},{"id":"1432150","text":"Baruj Benacerraf (; October 29, 1920 ‚Äì August 2, 2011) was a Venezuelan- American immunologist, who shared the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the \\"discovery of the major histocompatibility complex genes which encode cell surface protein molecules important for the immune system's distinction between self and non-self.\\"Baruj Benacerraf ‚Äì Biographical. nobelprize.org His colleagues and shared recipients were Jean Dausset and George Davis Snell. ==Early life and education== Benacerraf was born in Caracas, Venezuela on October 29, 1920, to Moroccan Jewish parents. His father was a textile merchant. His brother is the well-known philosopher Paul Benacerraf. Benacerraf moved to Paris from Venezuela with his family in 1925. After going back to Venezuela, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1940. That same year, Benacerraf attended Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de New York, where he earned a Baccalaur√©at (an academic qualification French students achieve after high school and a diploma necessary to begin university studies). In 1942 he earned his B.S. at Columbia University School of General Studies. He then went on to obtain his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the Medical College of Virginia, the only school to which he was accepted due to his Jewish background. Shortly after beginning medical school, Benacerraf became a naturalized U.S. citizen. From his Nobel autobiography: \\"By that time, I had elected to study biology and medicine, instead of going into the family business, as my father would have wanted. I did not realize, however, that admission to Medical School was a formidable undertaking for someone with my ethnic and foreign background in the United States of 1942. In spite of an excellent academic record at Columbia, I was refused admission by the numerous medical schools I applied to and would have found it impossible to study medicine except for the kindness and support of George W. Bakeman, father of a close friend, who was then Assistant to the President of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. Learning of my difficulties, Mr. Bakeman arranged for me to be interviewed and considered for one of the two remaining places in the Freshman class.\\" ==Career== After his medical internship US Army service (1945‚Äì48), and working at the military hospital of Nancy, France, he became a researcher at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1948‚Äì50). He performed research in Paris (1950‚Äì56), relocated to New York University (1956‚Äì68), moved to the National Institutes of Health (1968‚Äì70), then joined Harvard University medical school in Boston (1970‚Äì91) where he became the Fabyan Professor of comparative Pathology, concurrently serving the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (1980). He began studying allergies in 1948, and discovered the Ir (immune response) genes that govern transplant rejection in the 1960s. Including a variety of different editions, Benacerraf is an author of over 300 books and articles. At Columbia, Benacerraf got his start in Immunology with Elvin A. Kabat. He spent two years there working on experimental hypersensitivity mechanisms. He then moved to Paris because of family issues and accepted a position in Bernard Halpern's laboratory at the H√¥pital Broussais. Here he also formed a close relationship with a young Italian scientist, Guido Biozzi. For six years he worked on the reticuloendothelial function in relation to immunity. The reticuloendothelia function is the white blood cells inside of a barrier tissue. While there they discovered techniques to study the clearance of particulate matter from the blood by the RES (reticuloendothelial system), and devised equations that govern this process in mammals. After six years Baruj returned to the United States because he could not make his own independent laboratory in France. In the U.S. he developed his own laboratory in New York City and returned to study on hypersensitivity. In New York, Baruj worked with several other immunologists on different fields of hypersensitivity. After working in his New York lab, Baruj turned his attention towards the training of new scientists. Also in this time frame Baruj made the decision to devote himself to his laboratory practices, instead of the family business. At this time Baruj also made the discovery that would go on to win him the Nobel Prize. He noticed that if antigens (something that causes a reaction with the immune system) were injected into animals with a similar heredity, two groups emerged: responders and non-responders. He then conducted further study and found that the dominant autosomal genes, termed the immune response genes, determined the response to certain antigens. This complex process would lead to the understanding of how these genes would determine immune responses. His discovery still holds true, and more has been discovered over the last century. More than 30 genes have been discovered in a gene complex called the major histocompatibility complex. The histocompatibility complex is a complex part of DNA that controls the immune response. This research has also led to clarify autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. ==Awards== He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. Other notable awards include: *Rous-Whipple Award of the American Association of Pathologists 1985 *National Medal of Science 1990 *Gold-Headed Cane Award of the American Association for Investigative Pathology 1996 *Charles A.

It was created in 1979 by Jochen Liedtke at the University of Bielefeld. EUMEL initially ran on the 8-bit Z80 processor, and was later ported to many different architectures. EUMEL is based on a virtual machine using a bitcode and achieves remarkable performance and functionality. Z80-based EUMEL systems provide full multi-user multi-tasking operation with virtual memory management and complete isolation of one process against all others. These systems usually execute ELAN programs faster than equivalent programs written in languages such as BASIC, Pascal, or Cobol and compiled into Z80 machine language on other operating systems. One of the main features of EUMEL is that it is persistent, using a fixpoint/restart logic. This means that if the power fails the user only loses a couple of minutes of work: upon restart they continue working from the previous fixpoint with all program state fully intact. This is also known as orthogonal persistence. EUMEL was followed by L3 and later L4.

It runs for 32 miles (51 km) from Redditch, and Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, its two southern termini, to Lichfield, Staffordshire, its northern terminus, via Birmingham New Street, connecting the suburbs of Birmingham in between. Services are operated by West Midlands Trains. Cross- City Line services began in 1978, as a project of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) to improve local rail services. It made use of pre-existing railways lines, which previously did not have any through services. Services were extended to in 1980, and to in 1988. The route was electrified in 1993. In 2018 services were extended to , which was added as a second southern terminus. ==History== ===Constituent railways=== What is now the Cross-City Line was not built as a single route; it is a combination of lines opened by different companies at different times, between 1837 and 1885. On the northern half of the route (Birmingham-Lichfield): *The oldest section is between (originally named Vauxhall) and , which was part of the Grand Junction Railway from Birmingham to , opened in 1837. This was extended towards the centre of Birmingham, at Curzon Street, the following year, and into Birmingham New Street in 1854. *The line from Aston to was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1862, and extended to in 1884, where it connected with the South Staffordshire Line between and , which had opened in 1849. On the southern half of the route (Birmingham-Redditch): *The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had opened in 1840, following what is now the Cross- City Line between and , although this line ran to Curzon Street (later New Street) via what is now the Camp Hill Line. *The single-track branch line from Barnt Green to followed in 1859, as part of the Midland Railway's Gloucester Loop Line, which was closed south of Redditch in 1964. *The Birmingham West Suburban Railway, taking the route of the Cross-City Line between and central Birmingham via , opened to its original terminus at in 1876, it was extended into Birmingham New Street in 1885, and the Granville Street terminus closed. These lines from Birmingham to Barnt Green and Redditch were operated by the Midland Railway and the line to Lichfield was operated by the London and North Western Railway, so there were no through services. This continued despite the Grouping of the LNW and Midland Railways to form the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1921, and subsequent nationalisation to form British Railways. Prior to the creation of the Cross-City Line, the northern half of the route from New Street to Sutton Coldfield and Lichfield had a well used regular suburban service, which had been switched from steam to diesel multiple unit (DMU) operation in 1956, leading to a large increase in usage. However, the southern half of the route from New Street to Redditch was a different matter: In 1964, the closure of all the stations between New Street and (along with the branch to Redditch) was proposed by the Beeching Axe. They were reprieved from closure in 1967, however the service was cut back to a handful of trains at peak times for commuters. Diagrammatic map of Cross-City Line, including which was added as a second southern terminus in 2018. ===1978: consolidated route=== In the early-1970s the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) gained responsibility for managing and planning the local railway network in the West Midlands, and they set about looking for ways it could be improved: The WMPTE Passenger Transport Plan of 1972 recognised the need for a cross-city rail service, and especially an improved service to the south of Birmingham with new stations to serve the growth areas in the south of the city. The Cross City Line project was sanctioned by the WMPTE in May 1975 and launched on 8 May 1978. Costing ¬£7.4 million (), it involved joining the services into Birmingham from north and south into a single through service, along with the re-opening of Five Ways station (the original had closed in the 1944 as an wartime economy measure) and new stations to serve the University of Birmingham and Longbridge (the former station at Longbridge was on the branch line to Halesowen and Old Hill). Most of the other stations on the southern half of the route were rebuilt at the same time, and improvements were made to signalling and junctions. Of the new stations, the only one to be officially opened was University, which the then Secretary of State for Transport Bill Rodgers MP formally opened on 8 May 1978. There is a plaque on platform 2 marking this occasion. Services initially ran on a 15-minute frequency between Longbridge and Four Oaks via Birmingham New Street, with an hourly extension to Lichfield City, using refurbished Class 116 Diesel Multiple Units. The new service was an instant success, and by the end of the first year was carrying 30,000 passengers daily. ===1980s developments=== Services were extended to Redditch in 1980, initially on an hourly frequency, increased to half-hourly in 1989. The service to Lichfield City was increased to half hourly in 1986, and on 28 November 1988, some services were extended to terminate at the re-opened high level platforms of Lichfield Trent Valley. ===1990s: Electrification=== By the late-1980s, the elderly diesels operating the service were becoming increasingly unreliable, and the WMPTE (now re-branded as Centro) pressed for electrification. The decision to electrify the line was made on 7 February 1990 by the then Transport Minister Cecil Parkinson during the campaign for a by-election in the Mid Staffordshire constituency. Work started on electrifying the route with the 25 kV AC overhead line system in May 1990, and it was completed on 6 June 1993. Redditch, Alvechurch, and Blake Street stations were rebuilt at this time, and several other stations including Barnt Green were extensively modified to accommodate the new longer electric trains. The signalling was also modernised at the same time as the electrification, as part of a parallel scheme. A new fleet of Class 323 Electric Multiple Units were introduced to work the electrified line, and replace the elderly diesels. Full service with the Class 323s did not begin until 1994, due to initial reliability problems with the new units. Some elderly , and EMUs were drafted in to operate services in the interim, along with some of the original diesel units. The cost of the electrification scheme was estimated at ¬£64.5 million (), of which around 70% was funded by Centro, and the remainder by the Regional Railways sector of British Rail. ===21st century developments=== Aerial view of the new railway bridge (nearest to camera) and Ariel Aqueduct, over the diverted A38, taken in January 2013 At Selly Oak, a new bridge was constructed in 2011 to carry the canal over a new section of the A38. The single track between Barnt Green and Redditch restricted the number of trains that could run to Redditch to two per hour. In November 2013 a scheme was approved to construct a new passing loop at to allow the service to be increased to three trains per hour. The line between Barnt Green and Redditch was closed for eight weeks for the works to be carried out, and was reopened on 1 September 2014. The improved service began in December 2014. Electrification was also extended from Barnt Green to Bromsgrove station, which was rebuilt in 2016 and was added as a second southern terminus once electrification was completed in August 2018.First Cross City line trains arrive at Bromsgrove Collis, Emily Bromsgrove Advertiser news article 30 July 2018; Retrieved 3 August 2018 These changes allow three trains per hour to run to both Redditch and Bromsgrove. Three of the ten new Class 350 trains that London Midland introduced in 2014 have displaced Class 323s on other routes in the West Midlands to enable an increase in service frequency and capacity between Longbridge and Redditch, and the extension of all remaining Longbridge trains to Bromsgrove once electrification is complete. Class 350s are not currently authorised to be used on the Cross City Line. ==Current services== During Monday to Saturday daytimes, on the core section of the line between and , six trains per-hour operate each way, giving a ten-minute frequency of service. Of these, four northbound trains per hour continue from Four Oaks to , and two of these continue to . Southbound three trains per hour continue from Longbridge to . In detail the service consists of: *2tph from Lichfield Trent Valley to either Bromsgrove (1tph) or Redditch (1tph) ‚Äì This service also calls at which other services pass through *2tph from Lichfield City to Bromsgrove (1tph) or Redditch (1tph) *2tph from Four Oaks to Bromsgrove (1tph) or Redditch (1tph) ‚Äì This service also calls at which other services pass through The southern half of the Cross-City line also forms part of the Cross Country Route, and some longer distance services stop at University station, including CrossCountry trains to Cardiff and West Midland Railway services to . ==Future== There are long-standing proposals for the re-introduction of local trains on the Camp Hill Line (effectively a loop between Birmingham New Street and King's Norton). As part of the new West Midlands Trains franchise, the Class 323 units will be replaced by Aventras. In October 2018, as part of a 30-year strategy of Transport in the West Midlands several proposals were put forward. By 2034, there would be longer trains, electrification of the line from to allowing 2 services per hour to be extended to via a newly reopened . Beyond 2034, it was proposed that new semi-fast service could serve more larger stations. There is also a single tracked mothballed line to the former Angelsea Sidings which was in use until 2001. The line remains in situ but rusty beyond repair. There is a possibility that the line which connected to Walsall from Lichfield via Brownhills and Pelsall could reopen as Birmingham Mayor Andy Street promised to look and make the reopening of the line feasible. West Midlands Combined Authority also released a plan for the line as part of a 10-year transport plan called the 2026 Delivery for Transport. ==Passenger volume== In 2016-17 the Cross-City Line's 24 stations (excluding New Street) had combined passenger numbers of 22.59 million, a substantial increase on the 2015 figure of 19.95 million and the 2006 figure of 8.5 million. The busiest station on the route besides Birmingham New Street is University, with nearly three million passenger entries and exits, and the least busy station is with around 145,000 passenger entries and exits. ==Route description== The railway stations and cities, towns and villages served by the line are listed below. *Lichfield, Trent Valley ‚Äì on the outskirts of Lichfield, with connections to London Northwestern services along the Trent Valley line between London Euston and Crewe *Lichfield City railway station ‚Äì in central Lichfield *Shenstone railway station in Shenstone, Staffordshire *Blake Street railway station in Hill Hook, Sutton Coldfield *Butlers Lane railway station in northern Four Oaks *Four Oaks railway station in Four Oaks, Sutton Coldfield *Sutton Coldfield railway station in Sutton Coldfield *Wylde Green railway station serving Wylde Green and Boldmere *Chester Road railway station serving Pype Hayes and northern Erdington *Erdington railway station in Erdington *Gravelly Hill railway station in Gravelly Hill *Aston railway station in Aston ‚Äì the Walsall Line diverges here *Duddeston railway station in Duddeston *Birmingham New Street railway station in Birmingham City Centre *Five Ways railway station in Five Ways, Birmingham *University (Birmingham) railway station in the University of Birmingham *Selly Oak railway station in Selly Oak *Bournville railway station in Bournville *Kings Norton railway station in Kings Norton and Cotteridge *Northfield railway station in Northfield, Birmingham *Longbridge railway station in Longbridge *Barnt Green railway station in Barnt Green ‚Äì branches off the main line to Cheltenham here. *Alvechurch railway station in Alvechurch *Redditch railway station in Redditch *Bromsgrove railway station in Bromsgrove A large stretch of the northern part of the line closely follows the A5127 road. ==Media== *In 1990, Railscene produced a driver's eye view of the then-diesel line, featuring the elderly rolling stock still in operation. Many features of the line have since been changed, for example, the rebuilding of Alvechurch and Redditch stations, the abolition of Lichfield City's goods sidings and closure of the Brownhills Line and the removal of the fourth platform of Lichfield Trent Valley. *There was a highly publicised opening ceremony to celebrate the electrification and service enhancement at Redditch in 1993. *In 1995, Video 125 released a video of a driver's eye view of the recently electrified line, narrated by Kay Alexander.

He was appointed Stuart Professor of Philosophy in 1974, and retired in 2007 as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy. ==Life and career== Benacerraf was born in Paris to parents who were Sephardi Jews from Morocco and Algeria. In 1939 the family moved to Caracas and then to New York City. When the family returned to Caracas, Benacerraf remained in the United States, boarding at the Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ. He attended Princeton University for both his undergraduate and graduate studies. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998. His brother was the Venezuelan Nobel Prize-winning immunologist Baruj Benacerraf. ==Philosophical work== Benacerraf is perhaps best known for his two papers \\"What Numbers Could Not Be\\" (1965) and \\"Mathematical Truth\\" (1973), and for his anthology on the philosophy of mathematics, co-edited with Hilary Putnam. In \\"What Numbers Could Not Be\\" (1965), Benacerraf argues against a Platonist view of mathematics, and for structuralism, on the ground that what is important about numbers is the abstract structures they represent rather than the objects that number words ostensibly refer to. In particular, this argument is based on the point that Ernst Zermelo and John von Neumann give distinct, and completely adequate, identifications of natural numbers with sets (see Zermelo ordinals and von Neumann ordinals). This argument is called Benacerraf's identification problem. In \\"Mathematical Truth\\" (1973), he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics; it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntactico-semantical treatment of truth in non-mathematical language, and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology, but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously (this argument is called Benacerraf's epistemological problem). He argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects, but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception. On the other hand, an adequate epistemology of mathematics, say one that ties truth-conditions to proof in some way, precludes understanding how and why the truth-conditions have any bearing on truth. == Sexual harassment allegation == Elisabeth Lloyd has alleged that while she was a PhD student at Princeton, Benacerraf \\"petted and touched\\" her every day. She said, \\"It was just an extra price I had to pay, that the men did not have to pay, in order to get my Ph.D.\\" Benacerraf has denied the allegations, stating in an email to The Chronicle, Mr. Benacerraf said he was ‚Äúgenuinely puzzled‚Äù by the accusations and does not know what prompted them. ‚ÄúI am not the sort of person that she describes in her interview,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYet I do not doubt her sincerity or the depth of the feelings that she reports,‚Äù he added. == Publications == *Benacerraf, Paul (1960) Logicism, Some Considerations, Princeton, Ph.D. Dissertation, University Microfilms. *Benacerraf, Paul (1965) \\"What Numbers Could Not Be\\", The Philosophical Review, 74:47‚Äì73. *Benacerraf, Paul (1967) \\"God, the Devil, and G√∂del\\", The Monist, 5l: 9‚Äì33. *Benacerraf, Paul (1973) \\"Mathematical Truth\\", The Journal of Philosophy, 70: 661‚Äì679. *Benacerraf, Paul (1981) \\"Frege: The Last Logicist\\", The Foundations of Analytic Philosophy, Midwest Studies in Philosophy, 6: l7‚Äì35. *Benacerraf, Paul (1985) \\"Skolem and the Skeptic\\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume 56: 85‚Äìll5. *Benacerraf, Paul and Putnam, Hilary (eds.)

While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs. In these cases, symptoms may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion and seizures. This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection. JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes, specifically those of the Culex type. Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus. The disease mostly occurs outside of cities. Diagnosis is based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing. Prevention is generally with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which is both safe and effective. Other measures include avoiding mosquito bites. Once infected, there is no specific treatment, with care being supportive. This is generally carried out in hospital. Permanent problems occur in up to half of people who recover from JE. The disease occurs in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. About 3 billion people live in areas where the disease occurs. About 68,000 symptomatic cases occur a year, with about 17,000 deaths. Often, cases occur in outbreaks. The disease was first described in Japan in 1871. Despite its name, the disease is now relatively rare in Japan as a result of large-scale immunisation efforts.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/japanese- encephalitis/causes/ ==Signs and symptoms== The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has an incubation period of 2 to 26 days. The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic: only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis. Severe rigors may mark the onset of this disease in humans. Fever, headache and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between 1 and 6 days. Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, hemiparesis, convulsions and a raised body temperature between . Mental retardation is usually developed.Mortality of this disease varies but is generally higher in children. Transplacental spread has been noted. Lifelong neurological defects such as deafness, emotional lability and hemiparesis may occur in those who have had central nervous system involvement. In known cases, some effects also include nausea, headache, fever, and vomiting. Increased microglial activation following Japanese Encephalitis infection has been found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and have a critical role in host defense against invading microorganisms. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microglia. In a murine model of JE, it was found that in the hippocampus and the striatum, the number of activated microglia was more than anywhere else in the brain closely followed by that in the thalamus. In the cortex, the number of activated microglia was significantly less when compared with other regions of the mouse brain. An overall induction of differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from different brain regions during a progressive Japanese Encephalitis infection was also observed. Although the net effect of the proinflammatory mediators is to kill infectious organisms and infected cells as well as to stimulate the production of molecules that amplify the mounting response to damage, it is also evident that in a nonregenerating organ such as the brain, a dysregulated innate immune response would be deleterious. In JE the tight regulation of microglial activation appears to be disturbed, resulting in an autotoxic loop of microglial activation that possibly leads to bystander neuronal damage. In animals, key signs include infertility and abortion in pigs, neurological disease in horses and systemic signs including fever, lethargy and anorexia.Japanese Encephalitis Virus reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 11 October 2011. ==Cause== It is a disease caused by the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). ===Virology=== JEV is a virus from the family Flaviviridae, part of the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The enveloped virus is closely related to the West Nile virus and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins. Based on the envelope gene, there are five genotypes (I‚ÄìV). The Muar strain, isolated from a patient in Malaya in 1952, is the prototype strain of genotype V. Genotype IV appears to be the ancestral strain, and the virus appears to have evolved in the Indonesian‚ÄìMalaysian region. The first clinical reports date from 1870, but the virus appears to have evolved in the mid-16th century. Over sixty complete genomes of this virus had been sequenced by 2010. ==Diagnosis== Japanese encephalitis is diagnosed by commercially available tests detecting JE virus-specific IgM antibodies in serum and /or cerebrospinal fluid, for example by IgM capture ELISA. JE virus IgM antibodies are usually detectable 3 to 8 days after onset of illness and persist for 30 to 90 days, but longer persistence has been documented. Therefore, positive IgM antibodies occasionally may reflect a past infection or vaccination. Serum collected within 10 days of illness onset may not have detectable IgM, and the test should be repeated on a convalescent sample. For patients with JE virus IgM antibodies, confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing should be performed. Confirmatory testing in the US is only available at CDC and a few specialized reference laboratories. In fatal cases, nucleic acid amplification, and virus culture of autopsy tissues can be useful. Viral antigen can be shown in tissues by indirect fluorescent antibody staining. ==Prevention== Japanese encephalitis vaccine \\"ENCEVAC\\" Infection with Japanese encephalitis confers lifelong immunity. There are currently three vaccines available: SA14-14-2, IXIARO (IC51, also marketed in Australia, New Zealand as JESPECT and India as JEEV) and ChimeriVax-JE (marketed as IMOJEV). All current vaccines are based on the genotype III virus. A formalin-inactivated mouse- brain derived vaccine was first produced in Japan in the 1930s and was validated for use in Taiwan in the 1960s and in Thailand in the 1980s. The widespread use of vaccine and urbanization has led to control of the disease in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. The high cost of this vaccine, which is grown in live mice, means that poorer countries have not been able to afford to give it as part of a routine immunization program. The most common adverse effects are redness and pain at the injection site. Uncommonly, an urticarial reaction can develop about four days after injection. Vaccines produced from mouse brain have a risk of autoimmune neurological complications of around 1 per million vaccinations. However where the vaccine is not produced in mouse brains but in vitro using cell culture there is little adverse effects compared to placebo, the main side effects are headache and myalgia.EMEA Approval of Vaccine http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/opinion/Ixiaro_66231608en.pdf The neutralizing antibody persists in the circulation for at least two to three years, and perhaps longer. The total duration of protection is unknown, but because there is no firm evidence for protection beyond three years, boosters are recommended every three years for people who remain at risk. Furthermore, there is also no data available regarding the interchangeability of other JE vaccines and IXIARO. ==Treatment== There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis and treatment is supportive, with assistance given for feeding, breathing or seizure control as required. Raised intracranial pressure may be managed with mannitol. There is no transmission from person to person and therefore patients do not need to be isolated. A breakthrough in the field of Japanese encephalitis therapeutics is the identification of macrophage receptor involvement in the disease severity. A recent report of an Indian group demonstrates the involvement of monocyte and macrophage receptor CLEC5A in severe inflammatory response in Japanese Encephalitis infection of the brain. This transcriptomic study provides a hypothesis of neuroinflammation and a new lead in development of appropriate therapeutic against Japanese encephalitis. The effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the management of encephalitis is unclear due to a lack of evidence. Intravenous immunoglobulin for Japanese encephalitis appeared to have no benefit. == Epidemiology == Disability-adjusted life year for Japanese encephalitis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002 Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with up to 70,000 cases reported annually. Case-fatality rates range from 0.3% to 60% and depend on the population and age. Rare outbreaks in U.S. territories in the Western Pacific have also occurred. Residents of rural areas in endemic locations are at highest risk; Japanese encephalitis does not usually occur in urban areas. Countries which have had major epidemics in the past, but which have controlled the disease primarily by vaccination, include China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. Other countries that still have periodic epidemics include Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Malaysia. Japanese encephalitis has been reported in the Torres Strait Islands and two fatal cases were reported in mainland northern Australia in 1998. There were reported cases in Kachin State, Myanmar in 2013. The spread of the virus in Australia is of particular concern to Australian health officials due to the unplanned introduction of Culex gelidus, a potential vector of the virus, from Asia. However, the current presence on mainland Australia is minimal. There had been 116 deaths reported in Odisha's backward Malkangiri district of India in 2016. Human, cattle, and horses are dead-end hosts as the disease manifests as fatal encephalitis. Pigs act as an amplifying host and have a very important role in the epidemiology of the disease. Infection in swine is asymptomatic, except in pregnant sows, when abortion and fetal abnormalities are common sequelae. The most important vector is Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which feeds on cattle in preference to humans. The natural hosts of the Japanese encephalitis virus are birds, not humans, and many believe the virus will therefore never be completely eliminated. In November 2011, the Japanese encephalitis virus was reported in Culex bitaeniorhynchus in South Korea. Recently whole genome microarray research of neurons infected with the Japanese Encephalitis virus has shown that neurons play an important role in their own defense against Japanese Encephalitis infection. Although this challenges the long-held belief that neurons are immunologically quiescent, an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immune-mediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during Japanese Encephalitis infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease. A number of drugs have been investigated to either reduce viral replication or provide neuroprotection in cell lines or studies upon mice. None are currently advocated in treating human patients. * The use of rosmarinic acid, arctigenin, and oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization 6 from Gracilaria sp. or Monostroma nitidum have been shown to be effective in a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis. * Curcumin has been shown to impart neuroprotection against Japanese Encephalitis infection in an in vitro study. Curcumin possibly acts by decreasing cellular reactive oxygen species level, restoration of cellular membrane integrity, decreasing pro- apoptotic signaling molecules, and modulating cellular levels of stress- related proteins. It has also been shown that the production of infective viral particles from previously infected neuroblastoma cells are reduced, which is achieved by the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system. * Minocycline in mice resulted in marked decreases in the levels of several markers, viral titer, and the level of proinflammatory mediators and also prevents blood brain barrier damage. ==Evolution== The virus appears to have originated from its ancestral virus in the mid-1500s in the Indonesia-Malaysia region and evolved there into five different genotypes and spread across Asia. The mean evolutionary rate has been estimated to be 4.35 (range: 3.4906 to 5.303) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. ==References== == External links == * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Questions and Answers About Japanese Encephalitis * Australian government Department of Health and Aging, Japanese Encephalitis, 2012 * UK Department of Health.
