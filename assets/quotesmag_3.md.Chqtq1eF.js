It was released by Pony Canyon as the album's lead single on February 3, 1993. \\"D≈çkoku\\" is the theme song of the CX getsuku television series Ano Hi ni Kaeritai, starring Momoko Kikuchi and Kudo herself as two sisters who fall in love with the same man. Kudo performed the song on the 44th K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, marking her sixth consecutive appearance on the annual show. With over a million copies sold, \\"D≈çkoku\\" remains Kudo's best-selling single to date. In 2015, DAM asked their users to select their favorite Shizuka Kudo songs to sing karaoke to and compiled a top ten list; \\"D≈çkoku\\" came in at number two. ==Background== \\"D≈çkoku\\" is a mid tempo track written by Miyuki Nakajima, composed by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç and arranged by Got≈ç and Naoki Takao. It is the first single since \\"Watashi ni Tsuite\\" to be co-written by Nakajima and Got≈ç. Lyrically, the song deals with the theme of unrequited love. Nakajima writes from the perspective of a woman coming to the realization that her feelings for a male friend have progressed beyond friendship, after \\"crying all night\\". She laments the fact that her friend is oblivious to her predicament by imploring him to \\"stop patronizing me\\". Upon reading the lyrics for the first time, Kudo's initial response was to ask for help with pronouncing the title from Y≈´z≈ç Watanabe, her executive producer at the time. \\"How do you read this character?\\", the kanji for \\"d≈çkoku\\" (ÊÖüÂì≠) being uncommon, Kudo remembers having to look it up in the dictionary. \\"Let's make it a cheerful song, to balance out the heavy lyrics,\\" Kudo explained about her approach with recording the track, \\"this happened, but now I can laugh about it, let's make it that kind of song\\". ==Critical reception== Nakajima received acclaim for the storytelling abilities she demonstrates on \\"D≈çkoku\\", and for weaving a story that is relatable to both women and men. Got≈ç was praised for returning to form with a gentle but catchy melody that incorporated various sounds. Kudo was also praised for her interpretation of Nakajima's lyrics and for her clever vocal delivery. ==Cover versions== Nakajima recorded a self- cover for her album, Jidai: Time Goes Around, released the same year as Kudo's single. In 2012, Miliyah Kato recorded a cover of the song that was released as a B-side on her single \\"Aiaiai\\". In an interview with Excite, Kato praised the power of Nakajima's lyrics, stating \\"I really felt, by singing the song, that I had become the protagonist\\". In 2013, Kato performed the song, backed by Got≈ç, on the CX music show FNS Uta no Natsu Matsuri. She also performed the song in duet with Kudo on Music Fair in 2014. In 2015, Japanese singer Ms. Ooja recorded a cover of the song for her cover album, The Hits: No. 1 Song Covers. ==Chart performance== \\"D≈çkoku\\" debuted at number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart with 242,000 copies sold in its first week, scoring Kudo her best first-week single sales.

Lurs does not have many depictions but the ones that have been found show the deity as a male. He has been noted to be associated with a prophetic nature, while also bearing oracular and martial characteristics. He has been linked to another deity by the name of Laran, which suggest is where Lur derives his name from. The context of the name has been associated with darkness and the underworld. A fifth century vase found near a sanctuary in Sans Giovenale reads an inscription that translates: \\"I am Lurs, that of Laran.\\" Another inscription has been found with the spelling of his name as lartla, noting relations to a Lar, which gives a label to Lur that describes features of protection. == Archaeological Evidence == Piece of shard found during an excavation in Cetamura There is not much information about Lur except from the various evidence found in differing areas. In Corchiano, a candelabrum dating around 400-350 BCE was found with an inscription in dedication to Lur. A bucchero chalice founded by a small shrine near a bridge in San Giovenale does not specifically have inscribed but laruniŒ∏la, again, relating Lur to other gods with similar name epithets. A bronze sheet from Perugia reads a translation \\"dedicated to Lvrmita\\", suggesting the gods' oracular characteristic. In addition, a bronze statuette possibly from Orvieto features a man, perhaps Vel Matunas, given the inscription on the cloak. The statuette has another votive inscription that translates to \\"precious/sacred gift to Lur\\", also contributing to his oracular nature. Bronze Mirror of Tinia, Lur and another unknown young man found in Vulci. Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow. Ca, 350 BCE Lur has also been mentioned on two lead tablets, one from Magliano and another from Santa Marinella. The latter shows a connection to Tinia and reinforces this relation with other findings in Bolsena inscribed with lurs near two Tinia altars. However, the most prominent evidence discovered concerning Lur is a bronze mirror from Vulci. The mirror is an extension of Lurs relationship with Tinia. In the Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae, H.L Stoltenberg describes the scene present with three figures, Tinia, Lur, and an unknown young man. Tinia is in the middle, identifiable by the lightning bolt. He is wearing a chiton and looking to his right with his right arm raised. The unknown young man sits, appearing to be listening to whatever Tinia might be saying. To the left of the mirror, and Tinias right, sits Lur. He is naked except for a cloak, which is only noticeable from the seal around his neck. His head is thrown back, hair frizzled, and mouth partially open. He carries a sword in his right hand and his left is gesturing towards Tinia. A head coming from the clouds is also seen and has been implied to be delivering a message to Lur. With the combinations of Lurs behavior and gestures, the mirror amplifies a prophetic deity. == Cult == The numerous candelabra founded with Lur inscriptions suggest the object was notable as an offering to the god. An excavation at a sanctuary in Cetamura where a shard with an inscribed Lurs was found, likewise pieces of iron founded fit together to indicate potentially a candelabrum. The bronze Vel Matunas statuette again enforces the cult of Lur. In Gravisca, by the Sacellum Alpha, a miniature shrine, an impasto bowl inscribed with Lur was found. Additionally, a bronze strip from Perugia, as well as a small altar in Vulci both including dedications to lurmitla. The gods name furthermore, is including on the Piacenza liver twice. Scholars have debated with the evidence at hand what exactly the deity Lur oversees. Archaeologist Giovanni Colonna asserts a dark and underworld type of god, while D.F Maras thought of him as more of a warlike and prophetic god. Contrastingly, L. Bouke Van der Meer labels Lur as having the combined qualities. == References ==  Notes   Bibliography  : : : : : ==External links== * Category:Etruscan religion Category:Etruscan gods ","title":"Lur (deity)"},{"id":"56076528","text":"Francesco Leonetti (27 January 1924http://www.calabriansmostfamous.com/francesco-leonetti/ ‚Äì 17 December 2017) was an Italian poet, novelist, art critic, teacher and political activist. ==Biography== Leonetti was born in Cosenza in Calabria.

The case involved a re-argument of the High Court's decision in Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975),. in which the High Court had held legislation providing for Senate representation for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be constitutionally valid. The High Court again found the legislation to be constitutional and, additionally, that legislation providing for territory representation in the House of Representatives was also valid. == Background == In 1974, the Whitlam Government passed laws granting Senate representation to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, as well as representation for the Australian Capital Territory in the House of Representatives. The Northern Territory had been represented in the lower chamber since 1922, with voting rights for its member since 1936. In Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975), the High Court upheld the constitutional validity of the law for Senate representation. The decision was a divided one, with McTiernan, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ upholding the law and Barwick CJ, Gibbs and Stephen JJ finding that the law was unconstitutional. In 1976, a change occurred in the Court's membership, with McTiernan J resigning and being replaced by Aickin J. The State of Queensland, which had been a plaintiff in the 1975 case, again challenged the validity of the law allowing Senate representation. The State of Western Australia, which had also been a plaintiff in the 1975 case, brought an action challenging the constitutional validity of the laws providing for territory representation in the House of Representatives. == Arguments == The plaintiff States argued that the 1975 case had been wrongly decided and should be overruled. The Commonwealth argued that 1975 case had been correctly decided or, if it was wrong, that stare decisis required that it be followed. It also argued that Queensland was estopped from raising the Senate representation case again and that the Court had no jurisdiction to decide to case because the Houses of Parliament had the power to exclusively determine their membership. == Decision == Each member of the Court again wrote a separate opinion. The remaining members of the majority in the 1975 case - Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ - wrote opinions affirming their continued view of the correctness of their earlier judgments. pages 606-12 Mason J further supported his conclusion by referring to the inclusion, earlier that year, of the territories in Constitutional referendum. page 607 Gibbs and Stephen JJ, who had been in the minority in the 1975 cases, re-stated their views that the laws for territory representation were invalid and that the earlier case had been wrongly decided. Although Gibbs J concluded that the Court was not bound by its previous decision and should be slow to apply stare decisis in Constitutional cases, he followed the decision in Western Australia v Commonwealth because the only relevant circumstance justifying a reconsideration of the earlier case had been a change in the Court's membership and that the legislation had been acted upon and Senators from the territories had been elected. page 600 Stephen J found that the recency of the decision, the fact that it was a decision on which reasonable minds could differ and the impact upon the territories now that the law had been given effect, required the previous decision to be followed. pages 603-4 The effect of the decision was that although a majority of the Court considered the legislation to be unconstitutional, the laws were upheld by an increased majority compared to the 1975 case. == References == Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1977 in Australian law Category:1977 in case law Category:Australian constitutional law ","title":"Queensland v Commonwealth"},{"id":"56076593","text":"Helcomeria is a genus of coreid bug found in Asia.

It is a practice which emerged due to the popularization of smartphones and the desire of content-providers to reach an increasingly busy and mobile population. The Korean Times wrote in 2014 that snack culture' is becoming representative of the Korean cultural scene.\\" It has been called \\"a hot topic\\" in the media- content industry in 2014. == Definition == Modern people pursuing snack culture. The term snack culture comes from consuming media in a short time, like a snack that can be enjoyed anytime and anywhere. Snack culture is consumed in brief periods, between 30 seconds and 15 minutes, and is characterized by a light and compact format. In contrast, binge-watching, which became a popular term at about the same time, involves consuming media for hours at a time. == Background == Snack culture developed organically alongside the use of smartphones. According to statistics published by the Ministry of Science, Information and Communication Technology and Future Planning, the number of smartphone users in South Korea exceeds 40 million. A survey by the Korea Communications Commission showed that 76.9 percent of South Koreans use smartphones, particularly when commuting. Mobile-device users typically consume online cultural content for an average period of 10 minutes. Mainly on the move, they become accustomed to the short segments. Snack culture such as webtoons, web dramas or web fiction books have continued to increase in popularity. To meet the increasing demand by smartphone users, content that is suitable and can be quickly accessed is under constant development. Advertisers joined the trend with ads that mimic web drama and music video formats, so that users don't reject the advertisement. == Characterization and criticisms == By using mobile device, snack culture has Good accessibility. There is a tendency among snack-culture consumers to search for simplified content which is easier to consume. Snack culture is mainly focused on simple interest-oriented content. The short and simple content means that users do not have to invest a great deal of time or attention. They can enjoy it for a brief time or abandon it midway through. An increasing proportion of media content is becoming snack culture according to public consumption patterns. Some fear that it threatens the place of a deeper and more-engaging culture with a depth of thought. The nature of snack culture with its compression and simplification can undermine the essence of a greater and more-meaningful culture. == Content providers == Naver produces webtoons and web dramas. Kakao connects to mobile-specific snack culture. Pikicast and moncast. are popular snack culture apps. Card news is a mobile-only news service which allows users to view only the stories they wish, edited to be interesting. == References == Category:South Korean society ","title":"Snack culture"},{"id":"56076804","text":"The 2017-18 Big Bash League season is the seventh season of the Big Bash League, the premier Twenty20 cricket competition in Australia.

Since the 1990s, in response to growing labor shortages, foreign workers may be hired as industrial trainees for a limited period, and are covered by health and safety regulations and insurance systems. The current Employment Permit System for workers from specified countries was introduced in 2004, despite opposition from employers, and since then the system has been extended to more types of enterprise and the periods of validity have been increased. == Industrial Technology Training System == In 1987, the Seoul Olympic Games accelerated economic development, particularly the shortage of manpower in the manufacturing industry. In response to the growing labor shortage, the government referred to the technology trainee system in Japan, and introduced an industrial technology training system. Since 1993, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have expanded their system to allow foreigners to be hired as trainees for a period of one-year extension to the initial one year employment for SMEs employing 10 to 300 workers. After the implementation of the industrial technology training system, wages were low and safety measures on site were not sufficient, causing many industrial accidents. In order to solve these problems, the government enacted the \\"Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees\\" in order to solve the problems, and trainees' industrial accident insurance and national health insurance were introduced. In 1998, trainees received training for two years, received a recommendation from a company that received training, and a training employment system that gave them the qualification to work for one year if they passed the prescribed test. In 2002, the original training period was shortened to one year, and on the contrary, the period of employment after training was extended to two years.Áî∞Â∑ªÊùæÈõÑ(2011)„ÄÅ„ÄéÂ§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫Âä¥ÂÉçËÄÖÂïèÈ°å„ÅÆÊó•ÈüìÊØîËºÉ„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„Çã„Éé„Éº„Éà„Äè„ÄÅÂÆáÈÉΩÂÆÆÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂõΩÈöõÂ≠¶ÈÉ®Á†îÁ©∂Ë´ñÈõÜ„ÄÅÁ¨¨32Âè∑„ÄÅ87-88, 90-91 == Employment Permit System == In the mid-1990s, there was a move to abolish the trainee system and implement an 'Employment Permit System' to officially introduce foreign workers in low-skilled fields. But the move was not realized due to opposition by industry. The largest beneficiary of the industrial trainee system and the largest opposition to the introduction of the Employment Permit System was the Small and Medium Business Administration. In addition to being able to hire trainees at low cost, companies affiliated with the Federation of Small and Medium Businesses also had problems with the recruitment, recruitment, training, and follow-up management of trainees, as well as the National Federation of Small and Medium Business. There was a view that the expenses required for entry such as rain, departure fee, return deposit, and the like were charged unfairly. In addition, it was pointed out that the deposit that was held when the trainees left the training site is the benefit of the Federation of Small Businesses. However, in order to solve the problems of the mid- to long-term population decrease and the potential growth rate, the serious labor shortage of SMEs and the problem of serious training system, the necessity of introduction of Employment Permit System was raised. The Employment Permit System was enacted on August 17, 2004. The existing industrial trainee system was implemented in parallel with the Employment Permit System until 2006, and was incorporated into the Employment Permit System from January 1, 2007. It is possible to extend the employment permit system up to three years with the principle of one year. These regulations are set in terms of preventing the settlement of foreign workers and ensuring that foreign workers have sufficient time to achieve their economic objectives. In addition, the trainee system has caused various problems such as unfair claim of brokerage fees due to involvement of private institutions in the process of introduction of trainees. In the Employment Permit System, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the countries that send foreign workers and Korea, Intervention was excluded. The Employment Permit System has been extended to 15 countries at the time of the enforcement of the Employment Permit System in 2004. The industry also started in 2004 in the manufacturing, construction and enrichment industries, and expanded to include fisheries and some services as of 2014. Also, in the early stage of the stay, the short-term circulation change was strictly observed based on the three-year stay period, but it was gradually extended due to the skilled manpower of foreign manpower. If a company applies for a re-entry permit for a foreign worker who meets the requirements of the foreign worker whose stay of 1 year and 10 months expires in the past three years after the establishment of the Special Rebuplicent Exemption System for Seniors in February 2012, Later, they allowed re-entry and employment. In this case, they may stay for another 4 years and 10 months only once, and as a result they may stay for a total of 9 years and 8 months.Ï†ïÎ¥âÏàò.

Her parents were Jacob Forsell and Mette, nee Grut, and they were not golfers. She started out golf in 1958 as a caddie at Liding√∂ Golf Club close to their house. With few girls playing the game in those days, she usually played with boys. Her elder brother Joachim (called \\"Kim\\") and Swedish elite amateur Gustav Adolf Bielke were both role models for her while learning the game at young age. She always preferred to develop her golfing abilities by playing on the course instead of practicing a lot on the driving range. Her swing technique was characterized by a short and quick backswing, just like the one of G. A. Bielke. Other sports she practiced, was curling, bowling, table tennis and squash. By saving the money, she received from her father, who was a medical doctor, for not smoking before 18 years of age, she financed a Volkswagen Beetle car, to travel with between golf tournaments in Sweden in the early 1960s, often with best golfing friend Cecilia Perslow (who 1967 married French golfer Ga√´tan Mourgue d'Algue). Wollin and Perslow in 1966 came to meet in the final of the Swedish Match-play Championship when Perslow was the defending champion. Wollin won the match, played at Perslow's home course √ñrebro Golf Club. ==Amateur career== She became the first Swedish golfer with international success and had a long amateur career. Despite playing mostly in Scandinavia, she several times proved to be among the best female amateur golfers in the world. She represented Liding√∂ Golf Club until 1971 and, after moving to the very south-west end of Sweden, Falsterbo Golf Club since 1972. In 1963, 18 years old, she won two of three major amateur championships in Sweden at that time and won individually at the qualification competition at the European Ladies' Team Championship. The same year, she advanced to the third round of the British Ladies Amateur, a feat she repeated in 1965 at St Andrews. Wollin reached the final of the Swedish closed championship eleven times and won ten of them. Winning the title for the eight time in 1973 at Halmstad Golf Club, she had to play 39 holes in the final against Anna Skanse. Wollin was pregnant in her sixth month, six holes down after 21 holes and never leading the final until the end after the third extra hole. In 1980, Wollin became the first Swedish golfer to reach the final of the British Ladies Amateur at Woodhall Spa Golf Club, where she lost 3 and 1 to Anne Sander, United States. 12 years earlier, in 1968, Wollin reached the semi-finals. Wollin also won the open amateur championships of Sweden, Morocco and Portugal. Wollin represented Sweden in ten consecutive World Amateur Team Golf Championships, the Espirito Santo Trophy, between 1964 and 1982, a record beaten only by Marina Ragher from Italy. In 1966, Wollin finished fourth individually. In 1972 in Buenos Aires, Wollin, together with Christina Westerberg and Birgit Forsman, conquered the first ever Swedish medal in the amateur worlds, men or women, when the Swedish team finished third, while Wollin finished tied third with Laura Baugh in the individual competition. In the 1976 event, Wollin again finished tied third, this time with Debbie Massey, after winner Nancy Lopez and runner-up Catherine Lacoste. At the 1975 European Ladies' Team Championship at Golf de St Cloud, outside Paris, France, Wollin again won individually at the qualification competition, as she did 12 years earlier. In the quarter-final between Sweden and, champions to be France, Wollin defeated former U.S. Women's Open champion Catherine Lacoste 3 and 2 on her home soil. In 1981, she was a member of the winning Swedish team at the European Ladies' Team Championship in Portugal, together with Hillewi Hagstr√∂m, Viveca Hoff, Gisela Linn√©r, Charlotte Montgomery and Pia Nilsson. When she finally turned professional in 1983, she was 38 years old and her long and successful career was almost coming to its end. Up and coming Swedish stars K√§rstin Ehrnlund and Liselotte Neumann, at that period of time, turned professional as teenagers. ==Awards, honors== Wollin was twice awarded Swedish Golfer of the Year, male and female, 1966 and 1968. (Until 1976, there was a rule stating that a player not could receive the award more than two times.) In 1966, she was awarded Swedish Sportswomen of the Year. In 1984, she received The golden club (\\"Guldklubban\\") by the Swedish Golf Federation for contributions to Swedish golf. ==Personal life== During her amateur career, she worked as a school teacher. She won the Swedish Championship in curling in 1964. Her brother Jacob Forsell, born 1942, was a well-known Swedish photographer. She was married to Paul Wollin (1946‚Äì1990) from 1972 to 1987. In 1985, the two of them won the Swedish Championship for married couples, played as foursome. Their daughter Anna was born in 1973. She was a member of the board of the Swedish Golf Federation from 1994 to 1997. She is an honorary member of Falsterbo Golf Club and The Swedish Golf Historical Society. ==Amateur wins== *1962 Swedish Junior Match-play Championship *1963 Swedish Match-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship *1964 Swedish Match-play Championship, Swedish International Stroke-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship *1965 Scandinavian International Matchplay Championship *1966 Swedish Match-play Championship, Swedish International Stroke-play Championship, Swedish Junior Match-play Championship *1967 Swedish Match-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship, Portuguese International Ladies Amateur Championship *1968 Swedish Match-play Championship *1969 Swedish Match-play Championship, Swedish International Stroke-play Championship *1970 Swedish International Stroke-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship *1971 Swedish International Stroke-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship *1972 Swedish Match-play Championship, Swedish International Stroke-play Championship, Scandinavian International Match-play Championship, Morocco Ladies Open Amateur Championship *1973 Swedish Match-play Championship, Morocco Ladies Open Amateur Championship *1976 Swedish Match- play Championship *1977 Swedish International Stroke-play Championship *1979 Swedish International Stroke-play Championship *1980 Swedish Match-play Championship Source: ==Team appearances== Amateur *European Ladies' Team Championship (representing Sweden): 1963, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981 (winners)Swedish Golf Federation: European Ladies' Team Championship *Vagliano Trophy (representing the Continent of Europe): 1963, 1965 (winners), 1967 (winners), 1969 (winners), 1971, 1975, 1977, 1981 (winners) *Espirito Santo Trophy (representing Sweden): 1964, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982Swedish Golf Federation: Espirito Santo Trophy ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Swedish female golfers Category:Amateur golfers Category:Sportspeople from Stockholm Category:1945 births Category:Living people ","title":"Liv Wollin"},{"id":"56076946","text":"The following is the list of hosts and members of the Philippine noontime variety show It's Showtime. ==Hosts and other cast members== The following are the primary hosts of It's Showtime.

His pioneering work revealed the biological diversity of Malaysia and made him a strong advocate for the conservation of the country's natural heritage. Lim was the first Southeast Asian to be awarded Honorary Membership to the American Society of Mammalogists. == Early years == Lim Boo Liat was born 21 August 1926 in Klang, Selangor. Nature lessons in school inspired a love for the outdoors, and he spent time in his youth collecting plants and insects. Lim was sixteen years old when World War II came to Malaya, disrupting his studies; he worked odd jobs to support his family. He traveled to Carey Island and set up machinery to harvest salt from sea water. During his time on the island, he learned to identify animals from the indigenous people, the Orang Asli. == Career == Although lacking formal education, the zoological knowledge Lim learned on Carey Island provided the opportunity to take a temporary lab assistant position at the Institute for Medical Research (IMR) in Kuala Lumpur. His first assignment was studying scrub typhus, carried from mites to rats. Further studies also focused on small mammals and parasites, and involved travel throughout Southeast Asia under the auspices of the Bishop Museum. During this time, he also helped found the National Zoo of Malaysia and helped reestablish the Malaysian Nature Society after a hiatus caused by World War II. After a three-year break to earn his masters degree, Lim returned to the IMR as a zoologist in 1972, heading the IMR's Medical Ecology Division. In 1977, Lim became the head of the Vector Biology Control Research Unit of the World Health Organisation in Jakarta, Indonesia. His work there included research on plague, malaria control, and rodent control. He worked at the WHO until his retirement in 1987. After his retirement, Lim became the honorary consultant on zoology for the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia, helping to establish a research laboratory for small animals. Throughout his career, he was an author on over 300 scientific papers and wrote multiple books, including Poisonous Snakes of Peninsula Malaysia (1979), Orang Asli Animal Tales (1981), and Turtles of Borneo (1999). == Education == In 1959 Lim received a Sino-British Fellowship Trust Award and spent a year and a half studying animal ecology and the taxonomy of mammals under Charles S. Elton at Oxford University and George Dunnet at Aberdeen University. Lim received a Medical Research Council Fellowship in 1969 to complete his masters degree in science from the University of Aberdeen. He was the first person to be awarded a Ph.D. from Universiti Sains Malaysia in 1977. == Death and legacy == Lim died at his home in Cheras on 11 July 2020. He was the fourth Asian and first Southeast Asian to be awarded honorary membership to the American Society of Mammalogists, \\"conferred in recognition of a distinguished career in service to mammalogy\\". Lim had multiple species named after him, including snake Oligodon booliati, protozoa Sarcocytis booliati, frog Kalophrynus limbooliati, flea Medwayellia limi, chigger Babiangia booliati, and parasitic worms Helimonella limbooliati, Plasmodium booliati, and Brienlia booliati. He was particularly well-respected for his dedication to supporting the careers of biologists and conservationists at the beginning of their careers, providing mentorship and ensuring younger scientists had opportunities to publish. == Awards and recognition == * 1959 Sino-British Fellowship Trust Award from the British Council * 1978 Sandosham Gold Medal from the Malaysian Society of Parasitology and Tropical Medicine * 1995 Science and Technology Award from the Malaysia Toray Science Foundation * 2003 Honorary Member of the American Society of Mammalogists * 2007 Elected Fellow of the Akademi Sains Malaysia * 2007 Spallanzani Award from the North American Society for Bat Research * 2013 Merdeka Award, environment category == External links == * 2014 interview with Dr. Lim Boo Liat == References == Category:Zoologists Category:1926 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th- century zoologists Category:Malaysian scientists ","title":"Lim Boo Liat"},{"id":"56077066","text":"K≈çr≈ç, Koro or Kourou (written: ÂÖâÈÉé, ÂÖâÊúó, ËÄïÈÉé or Êµ©ÈÉé) is a masculine Japanese given name.

However, guitarist Jeff Pogan would leave the band shortly after its release.

On club level he plays for the Daejeon Samsung Fire Bluefangs. ==Career== Hwang first garnered attention in 2004 when he won the gold medal at the Asian Junior Volleyball Championship as part of the South Korean junior national team. While attending Kyonggi University in 2005, Hwang was called-up to the South Korean U21 national team for the 2005 Junior World Volleyball Championship where his team finished sixth. As a sophomore at Kyonggi University in June 2006, Hwang got called up to the South Korean senior national team and debuted with the national team at the 2006 Asia Challenge Cup, which South Korea won. Hwang was selected fourth overall by the Woori Capital Dream Six in the 2008 V-League Draft and traded to the LIG Greaters in ten days. Hwang became the starting setter for the Greaters in his rookie season, and was named Rookie of the Year after the 2008‚Äì09 season. In the beginning of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Hwang was traded to the Korean Air Jumbos but served as the backup to starting setter Han Sun-soo for the Jumbos between 2011 and 2014. In 2014, Hwang was once again traded to the Samsung Fire Bluefangs. He was mostly on the bench to serve as a backup setter to You Kwang-woo or to play as the opposite spiker sporadically before franchise setter You Kwang-woo left the Bluefangs as a free agent to sign with the Woori Card Wibee after the 2016‚Äì17 season. The following season, Hwang returned as the Bluefangs' starting setter under new coach Shin Jin-sik. ==External links== * Profile at FIVB.org Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean men's volleyball players ","title":"Hwang Dong-il"},{"id":"56077156","text":"The relationships between fire, vegetation, and climate create what is known as a fire regime. Within a fire regime, fire ecologists study the relationship between diverse ecosystems and fire; not only how fire affects vegetation, but also how vegetation affects the behavior of fire. The study of neighboring vegetation types that may be highly flammable and less flammable has provided insight into how these vegetation types can exist side by side, and are maintained by the presence or absence of fire events. Ecologists have studied these boundaries between different vegetation types, such as a closed canopy forest and a grassland, and hypothesized about how climate and soil fertility create these boundaries in vegetation types. Research in the field of pyrogeography shows how fire also plays an important role in the maintenance of dominant vegetation types, and how different vegetation types with distinct relationships to fire can exist side by side in the same climate conditions. These relationships can be described in conceptual models called fire‚Äìvegetation feedbacks, and alternative stable states. == Fire‚Äìvegetation feedbacks == 380x380px Vegetation can be understood as highly flammable (pyrophilic) and less flammable (pyrophobic). A fire‚Äìvegetation feedback describes the relationship between fire and the dominant vegetation type. An example of a highly flammable vegetation type is a grassland. Frequent fire will maintain grassland as the dominant vegetation in a positive feedback loop. This happens because frequent fire will kill trees trying to establish in the area, yet the intervals between each fire will allow for new grasses to establish, grow into fuel, and burn again. Therefore, frequent fire on a grassland area will maintain grass as the dominant vegetation and not permit the encroachment of trees. In contrast, fire will occur less frequently and less severely in closed canopy forests because the fuels are more dense, shaded, and therefore more humid thereby not igniting as easily. The closed canopy of the dominant forest vegetation will also limit the growth of certain species, and permit the growth of shade-tolerant plants. == Alternative stable states and fire == The ecological theory of alternative stable states describes how different ecosystems can exist side-by-side, and how they can shift as a result of disturbance. Applied to fire ecology, the theory describes how flammable and less-flammable vegetation types can exist side-by- side, and are maintained by different relationships with fire. If the frequency and intensity of fire in each vegetation type is not disturbed, then the dominant vegetation type will be maintained, and considered stable. This theory also describes how dominant vegetation can rapidly shift to another vegetation type via fire suppression, an increase in fire severity, introduction of invasive species, and other management disturbances. These effects, which can cause a vegetation type to shift, are described as destabilizing transitions. The theory of fire and alternative stable states has been researched in many places across the globe in recent decades. The study of fire regimes and alternative stable states requires inquiry on many levels; paleoecological research into vegetation patterns, evidence of fire, and climate over millennia; research on anthropogenic burning; and research on the impacts of management such as fire suppression, grazing, and forestry. == Alternative stable states and fire across the globe == Mixed conifer forest near Klamath National Forest  Klamath Mountains  Douglas fir plantation example An example of alternative stable states and fire can be found in the Klamath Mountains, in northwestern California. The fire regime of this area before European settlement burned in intervals of 5‚Äì75 years, and Native Americans, including the Karuk Tribe, used, and continue to use, fire to manage the landscapes. Three dominant vegetation types are common and neighboring in this region; scleropyhll shrub land, conifer forests, and plantation conifer forests. Sclerophyllous vegetation is medium to tall shrubs and trees, and are considered pyrogenic and recover quickly after fire due to a number of fire adaptations, such as re-sprouting lignotubers and seeds that survive fire. Closed conifer forests contain a medium to tall overstory of conifers and a shade-tolerant understory. Conifer-dominated forests burn less frequently, and can have low to high severity fire events. High severity events can be stand-replacing events that kill all dominant vegetation. Plantations in this area grow the commercially valuable Douglas fir, are densely and uniformly spaced, do not usually have hardwoods, and have grass and shrubs in the understory. These plantations are more flammable than neighboring mixed conifer forests. Conceptual model of alternative stable states in Klamath Mountains, after Odion et al., 2010 When patches of mixed conifer forest are killed by high severity fire events, sclerophyll vegetation can establish first and create a new alternative stable state with its own self-reinforcing feedback with fire. Therefore, a high severity fire event is considered a destabilizing transition between mixed conifer forest and a sclerophyll shrub land. Conversely, if a long period of time between fires occurs in sclerophyll vegetation, conifers can establish and the state can switch to a less flammable mixed conifer forest, which will be maintained by lower severity and less frequent fires. Therefore, fire suppression in a sclerophyll shrub land is considered a destabilizing transition, as it causes the fire dependent sclerophyll shrub land to switch to a mixed conifer forest. The establishment of a conifer plantation creates an alternative stable state that has higher pyrogenicity than a mixed confer forest, creating the potential for more frequent and higher severity fire that can affect neighboring mixed conifer forests. The establishment of a conifer plantation in a previous sclerophyll shrubland or mixed conifer forest and the related effects of increased fire severity also create destabilizing transitions in this alternative stable states model.  Tasmania  moorland in southwest Tasmania Recent studies of alternative stable states in southwestern Tasmania include the role of soil fertility and topography in relationship to fire, vegetation, and reinforcing feedbacks. Four vegetation types exist in the studied area of southwestern Tasmania; moorland, shrubland, wet sclerophyll, and rainforest. Patches of rainforest are surrounded by a patchwork of more flammable vegetation types. Rainforests were found to be located in valleys and south-facing slopes, areas which were found to be less likely to burn. Both topography and fire play a role in maintaining these alternative stable states. Soil nutrients were reduced in areas of higher flammability, and were found to accumulate in the forested areas that burnt less frequently. == Management implications == As demonstrated by alternative stable states theories and research, fire exclusion and other management practices impact neighboring vegetation types via destabilizing transitions. Land managers and the public will need to consider the destabilizing effects of management practices such as prolonged fire suppression, and plantation establishment after fires, on neighboring fire dependent ecosystems. == References == Category:Feedback Category:Wildfire ecology Category:Ecology terminology ","title":"Fire‚Äìvegetation feedbacks and alternative stable states"},{"id":"56077160","text":"Patulibacter is a genus of bacteria from the family of Patulibacteraceae. ==References Further reading == * * * Category:Actinobacteria Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Patulibacter"},{"id":"56077161","text":"Amita Berthier (born 15 December 2000) is a Singaporean fencer based in US.

Like today, some commentators demanded longer prison sentences and even flogging while others called for better education and more youth clubs.\\" ==History== Late 20th century In the early 1980s Liverpool was tagged by the media as 'Smack City' or 'Skag City' after it experienced an explosion in organised gang crime and heroin abuse, especially within the city's more deprived areas. www.druglibrary.org www.drugtext.org At the same time several criminal gangs began developing into drug dealing cartels in the city, including the Liverpool Mafia, which was the first such cartel to develop in the UK. As drugs became increasingly valuable, large distribution networks were developed with cocaine producers in South America, including the Cali cartel. Over time, several Liverpool gangsters became increasingly wealthy, including Colin 'Smigger' Smith, who had an estimated fortune of ¬£200m Christopher 'little Ghost' Warren and Curtis 'Cocky' Warren, whose estimated wealth once saw him listed on the Sunday Times Rich List. A report in the Observer newspaper written by journalist Peter Beaumont entitled Gangsters put Liverpool top of gun league (28 May 1995), observed that turf wars had erupted within Liverpool. The high levels of violence in the city came to a head in 1996 when, following the shooting of gangster David Ungi, six shootings occurred in seven days, prompting Merseyside Police to become one of the first police forces in the country to openly carry weapons in the fight against gun crime. Official Home Office statistics revealed a total of 3,387 offences involving firearms had occurred in the Merseyside region during a four-year period between 1997 and 2001. www.criminal-information-agency.com It was revealed that Liverpool was the main centre for organised crime in the North of England.icLiverpool ‚Äì Liverpool revealed as centre for organised crime in North In 1999, a prominent \\"turf war killing\\" occurred when Warren Selkirk was shot five times and a bag of dog excrement placed in his hand, while his children waited in a nearby car: Glaswegian Ian McAteer was convicted of the murder in 2001. ==Notable gangs== The Whitney gang were a notorious family gang from the Anfield district of Liverpool.

Born in Westminster, he was convicted for burglary and sentenced to penal transportation for life. He arrived on the Andromeda in 1833 at Sydney. In 1842 he was sentenced in Sydney and sent to Port Arthur. ==Cash and Co.== On 26 December 1842 Martin Cash, George Jones and Lawrence Kavenagh absconded from a work party. Hiding in dense scrub land and with little food they made their way to The Neck. Swimming with their clothes tied in bundles above their heads, they made the other side, but all three lost their bundles. Naked, the trio robbed a road gang's hut for clothing, and began a seven month spree of bushranging, robbing mail coaches, homesteads and inns. The three became known as Cash and Co and their reputation grew. In July 1843, the Government offered 'one hundred acres of land or one hundred sovereigns, in addition to the reward of fifty sovereigns, free pardon, and passage from the colony, for the apprehension of' Cash, Jones and Kavenagh. Shortly afterwards, on 10 July 1843, Kavenagh tripped over and the charge in his gun exploded. He said he had to give himself up or he would have bled to death in the bush. On 29 August 1843, Cash made his way to Hobart, wanting to confront his partner Bessie after hearing she was with another man. Cash was spotted in Brisbane Street, and a gunfight ensued resulting in Cash's capture. ==Capture, trial and sentencing== Jones remained at large, recruiting other outlaws, James Platt and Frederick Moore, and continuing to rob settlers and travellers for another six months. On 10 April 1844 the three bushrangers, Jones, Platt, and Moore, having recently committed several robberies in the Brighton district, were tracked by the Chief District Constable of Brighton and a posse of five to a hut situated on a cross-road between Brighton and Richmond.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/92672900?searchTerm=george%20jones%20platt&searchLimits;=l-decade=184 Knowing that the gang was well-armed, the posse decided to burn them out. The hut was set on fire, and when the bushrangers rushed outside a gunfight ensued with Jones being shot in the face by buckshot; Moore was mortally wounded. Jones and Platt were put on trial for armed robbery, found guilty and sentenced to death. Jones revealed during his trial that he was now blind.

Despite contesting only two races as a juvenile he was rated the best horse of his generation after a five-length win in the Group 1 National Stakes. In the following spring he maintained his unbeaten record with a victory in the Harp Lager 2000 Guineas Trial but was narrowly beaten by his stablemate Prince of Birds in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He went on to win the Irish International Stakes and was placed in the St James's Palace Stakes, Vernons Sprint Cup and Prix de l'Abbaye. He was retired to stud at the end of his second but made little impact as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Caerwent was a dark-coated bay horse with no white markings bred by his owner, Edmund Loder, at the family's Eyresfield Stud near the Curragh in County Kildare. The colt was scheduled to be auctioned at the Tattersalls Highlyer sale in 1986 but was withdrawn from the sale after he \\"threw a splint\\". He was sent into training with the veteran Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. His sire, Caerleon, won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup in 1983 and went on to become an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù breeding stallion, siring the winners of more than 700 races including Generous, Marienbard, Moonax and Warrsan. Caerwent was the first foal of his dam Marwell, an exceptionally fast filly who won the Cheveley Park Stakes, King's Stand Stakes, July Cup and Prix de l'Abbaye and was rated the best female of her generation in Europe. Marwell's dam, Lady Seymour, was undefeated in two races, including the Phoenix Stakes in 1974. As a daughter of My Game, Lady Seymour was also closely related to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Paean and the Oaks winner Unite. Marwell herself went on to produce the outstanding filly Marling. ==Racing career== 1987: two-year-old season Caerwent made his racecourse debut at Phoenix Park Racecourse in August when he started odds-on favourite in a five-runner field for the Charles Heidsieck Champagne Stakes over six furlongs. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew away from his rivals to win by three lengths from Demon Magic. The form of the race was franked when the runner-up won the Futurity Stakes in September. Caerwent was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at the Curragh on 12 September and was made the 9/10 favourite. His five opponents were Acajou and Gerrnas from England, Wagon Load (winner of the Orby Stakes), Project Manager (Tyros Stakes) and the 25/1 outsider Ballygarry Prince. Ridden by the American jockey Cash Asmussen, Caerwent went to the front approaching the final furlong and \\"stormed clear\\" to win by five lengths from Acajou. In the official International Classification of European two- year-olds for 1987, Caerwent was rated the joint fifth best colt of the year and the best juvenile trained in Ireland. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123p (the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual progress) making him six pounds inferior to Warning, who was their top-rated two-year-old. 1987: three-year-old season Caerwent began his second campaign in the Listed Harp Lager 2000 Guineas Trial over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park on 2 April. Ridden by John Reid he started at odds of 4/9 and won by a length from Saxon Cottage. Four weeks later the still unbeaten colt was sent to England and started the 4/1 second favourite for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket Racecourse but came home fifth of the nine runners behind Doyoun, Charmer, Bellefella and Aiglefin. In the Irish 2000 Guineas on 14 May, Caerwent was made the 6/1 third choice in the betting and looked likely to win after taking the lead inside the final furlong only to be caught on the line and beaten a neck by his stablemate Prince of Birds. In June Caerwent was sent to England for the second time to contest the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished third to Persian Heights and Raykour, with Blushing John and Prince of Birds in fourth and fifth. On 2 July the colt was dropped in class and matched against older horses in the Group 2 Lanes End International Stakes over one mile at Phoenix Park. With Reid in the saddle he started the 4/6 favourite and won by one and a half lengths from the British-trained four- year-old Just A Flutter. He was back in England later that month for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, but after reaching third place in the straight he came home sixth of the nine runners behind Warning. For his last two races of the year, Caerwent was dropped back in distance to compete in sprint races. In the Vernons Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park on 3 September he finished third behind Dowsing and Silver Fling despite hanging badly to the left in the closing stages. The colt ended his racing career in the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. He finished third behind Cadeaux Genereux and Handsome Sailor but was promoted to second place when Cadeaux Genereux was disqualified for causing interference early in the race. ==Stud record== Caerwent was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. He later stood in France and Germany before moving to Sweden, where his last foals were born in 2001. He was not a great success as a sire, with the best of his offspring being the Listed race winners Linoise, Green Wind and Passport. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1985 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 14-c ","title":"Caerwent (horse)"},{"id":"56077505","text":"Asuman √ñzdaƒülar (born 16 December 1974) is a Turkish academic.

Food products, including fresh and processed foods, account for an overwhelming 50 percent of the sales, followed by household goods and appliances. While the narrow concept of large marts includes E-Mart, Homeplus, and LotteMart, the broader concept includes warehouse discount such as Costco, Traders, and Big Market.  History of wholesale marts  emart, one of wholesale marts, in Korea It was in 1993 when a wholesale mart was introduced to Korea. Shinsegae opened its first E-Mart store in Changdong-gu. The first large retail store was a warehouse, with a minimal amount of service and an uncluttered interior of the store centered on box sales. In the late 1990s, early wholesale marts turned to ' large Korean marts ' in a direction that include luxury of interior design, high level of service, and various auxiliary facilities in order to match the buying habits of Koreans. With the opening of the distribution market in 1996, Korean companies and global retailers of foreign companies such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour compete fiercely. Wal-Mart and Carrefour withdrew from the South Korean market between 2006 and 2007. When Homeplus acquired 35 Homevers of E.Land Retail in 2008, three main retailers „Ö° emart (1993), Lotte Mart (1998), and Home Plus (1999) „Ö° took over the market.  Market condition of Wholesale Mart  As of 2013, the sales of large stores were about $3.4 billion, and there were 483 stores nationwide. Korea's total retail market in 2013 was $310 billion, with wholesale marts accounting for about 10.8 percent of the total retail market. This is the highest percentage of major retail outlets such as department stores, supermarkets and convenience stores. As of 2013, South Korea's big 3 wholesale marts „Ö° E-Mart (1993), Lotte Mart (1998), and Home Plus (1999)„Ö° has 395 stores. E-Mart has 148 stores (37.5%), Home plus has 139 stores (35.2%), and Lotte mart has 108 stores (27.3%). For E-Mart and Lotte Mart, the number of stores includes warehouse discount stores.  Department stores  Department Store refers to a retail store with a wide range of stores. Department store is distinguished from a chain system that wants self-service from customers. And department store covers a wide range of goods, ranging from moderate to high- end. Although of different scales, department stores are scattered throughout the downtown and rural areas of Korea. Lotte Department Store in Jung District, Busan In Korea, department stores are defined by the Distribution Industry Development Act as retail stores that meet the criteria of more than 3,000 square meters of floor space, and treat diverse items and customer- friendly facilities. Under the same law, the stores are registered and managed by local governments as large stores.

It was a proposed administrative unit of a Philippines under a federal form of government. ==History== Panay revolt A revolutionary group, the Comit√© Conspirador (Conspirators Committee), was organized in the town of Molo in Panay island in March 1898. The group, which planned an uprising against the Spanish colonial government, regularly held meetings at the residence of Francisco Villanueva. The organization later became the Comit√© Central Revolucionario de Visayas (Central Revolutionary Committee of the Visayas) as support for the group grew. They commenced a revolution in Panay in August 1898 and established a temporary revolutionary government in November 1898, which would later be known as the Gobierno Provisional del Distrito de Visayas (Provisional Government of the District of Visayas). The rebels were led by Col. Adriano Hernandez. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War which sparked in Cuba reached the Philippines. On May 1, 1898, US Commodore George Dewey defeated the Spanish Navy in Manila. The Spanish designated Iloilo City as the colonial government's capital after Manila fell to the Americans on August 13, 1898, and later installed Roque L√≥pez as president of the provisional government in Santa Barbara town in Iloilo. Diego de los R√≠os was named Governor General over the Philippines. The Spanish armed the Iloilo Voluntarios (Iloilo Volunteers), a battalion composed mainly of Ilonggos believing that they are loyal to the Spanish crown. However, Ilonggo revolutionaries, calling themselves the \\"Ej√©rcito Libertador\\" (Liberation Army), started a revolt gaining control of all of Panay within days, except for Iloilo City, Jaro, La Paz and Molo. Malolos Congress The Panay government, along with the two cantonal governments and other governments in Leyte and Samar were represented in the Malolos Congress which ratified the declaration of Philippine Independence although they had reservations in regards to the Malolos-based government by President Emilio Aguinaldo. Within the month when the congress was convened, these governments recognized the authority of the Malolos Government but retained governance over its jurisdiction. The Visayas governments still had the ability to exercise taxation and maintain their own armies. Provisional government A convention was held at Santa Barbara town on November 17, 1898 which saw the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government with Roque Lopez elected as president. The Philippine flag was raised on a bamboo hoist at the Bermejo house at the town plaza. At least two other governments were established in the Visayas; The Cantonal Government of Bohol in August 1898 and the Cantonal Government of Negros in November 1898. Formation Predecessor governments of the federal state: Visayas-based leaders proposed that an independent Philippine nation be a federation. To promote this ideal, the Cantonal governments of Bohol and Negros, as well as the Provisional Government in the Visayas which exercised powers over Panay and Romblon formed the Federal State of the Visayas on December 2, 1898. The governance of the federal state was patterned after the United States federalism and the Swiss confederacy. The government was reportedly created following consultations with Emilio Aguinaldo. Roque Lopez who was the president of the provisional government in Panay became the federal state's president and Iloilo City was designated as the Visayas capital. Visayas officials made the draft of the terms of surrender of Spanish Governor General Diego de los Rios in December 1898. De los Rios left Iloilo on December 24 and Vicente Gay was installed as mayor of Iloilo City. The city was turned over to the Visayas government. A triumphal parade to Iloilo City was made on Christmas Day which ended in the hoisting of the Philippine flag in Plaza Alfonso XII (now Plaza Libertad) in front of the city hall. A junta was appointed by the Federal State of Visayas and officials expressed the need to establish a federal republican state over Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao and maintained allegiance to Aguinaldo. Elections were planned as soon as peace was established. Dissolution The dissolution of the federal state is disputed by various sources. The federal state was abolished by Central government in Malolos by Emilio Aguinaldo on April 27, 1899. Historian Gregorio Zaide says that Jovito Yusay, the last president of the federal state, dissolved the Visayas government on September 23, 1899 by decree. The instigation of the Consejo de Luzon, a Tagalog faction, was the cause of the state's demise at an undetermined date according to the Philippine Revolutionary Records. General Martin Delgado agreed to form a politico- military government after discussing with local military leaders without seeking consent from the civilian federal government on September 21, 1899 and dissolved the federal state on October 5, 1899 by issuing a decree citing Aguinaldo's earlier decree. A politico-military government was installed in Iloilo with Martin Delgado as governor. The Negros Republic, a component state, later became an American protectorate before it was absorbed into a U.S. administered Philippines. ==Government== {  - cccccc\\" ! # !! President !!

Amongst his librettos were those for Macagni's L'amico Fritz and Giordano's Mala vita. Several of his librettos were written under the anagramatic pseudonym P. Suardon.Romano, Angelo (1987). \\"Daspuro, Nicola\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 33. Treccani. Online version retrieved 18 December 2017 . ==Life and career== Daspuro was born in Lecce, the son of Domenico and Almerinda n√©e Portoluzzo. He began his writing career in Lecce where two of his narrative pieces were published in 1881. He then settled in Naples where he was a correspondent for Il Secolo, Teatro illustrato, Gazzetta del Popolo, Commedia umana and Le Figaro, writing primarily on the theatrical and operatic life of the city. In 1884 Daspuro had written a biography of the Neapolitan revolutionary Masaniello published by Edoardo Sonzogno. He went on to form a close friendship with Sonzogno, whose chief business was music publishing, and acted as his agent and advisor for Naples and the south of Italy. Between 1891 and 1910 Daspuro also became known for his opera librettos, two of which had been commissioned by Sonzogno‚ÄîL'amico Fritz and Mala vita. Daspuro managed the Teatro Mercadante in Naples on Sonzogno's behalf for three years starting in December 1893. Prior to the December re-opening the theatre had been renovated and given a new facade paid for by Sonzogno and supervised by Daspuro. For the Sonzogno seasons at the Mercadante Daspuro had assembled a company of the most prominent singers of the day including Roberto Stagno, Francesco Tamagno, Gemma Bellincioni, and Adelina Stehle. The first seasons were so successful that they took business away from the grander Teatro San Carlo. Anna Stolzmann, who had the concession to produce operas and ballets at the San Carlo, was forced to declare bankruptcy in January 1895, and the theatre went dark. It re-opened three months later after the city of Naples accepted a proposal from Daspuro and Sonzogno to stage a season there which would include Mascagni's Ratcliff and Silvano.s.n.

Le M√©nestrel, p. 86 In the autumn of 1894, Guglielmo Vergine, the teacher and agent of the young Enrico Caruso had asked Daspuro to audition his pupil for a role in the coming season at the Mercadante. Although the casts had been fully booked Daspuro gave Caruso an audition and was sufficiently impressed to offer him the chance to sing the tenor lead in one of the matinee performances of Mignon. However, overcome by nerves at the piano rehearsal, Caruso kept forgetting the words, could not keep to the tempi, and his voice repeatedly cracked on the high notes. Daspuro and the conductor Giovanni Zuccani cancelled his debut. Caruso and Vergine left the theatre in tears. Three years later, after Caruso was having considerable success performing in Salerno, Vergine contacted Daspuro again asking him to come hear how much his pupil had improved. Reluctantly, Daspuro consented to the journey from Naples to Salerno but wrote to Vergine, \\"Very well, Maestro, but if I find, instead of a divo, a dog, then poor you!\\" To avoid a similar debacle to the one at the Teatro Mercadante, Daspuro agreed sit in the audience at a performance of La Gioconda instead of making his presence known to Caruso. After the performance, Daspuro offered Caruso a contract for the upcoming season at the Teatro Lirico in Milan, which he was helping Sonzogno to manage. Despite Sonzogno's initial doubts, Caruso had great success there, appearing in the leading tenor roles of five operas, including Federico, in the world premiere of L'arlesiana in November 1897 and Loris in the world premiere of Fedora in November 1898.Van Rensselaer, Pierre (1922), Enrico Caruso: A Biography, pp. 43‚Äì45; 77‚Äì78; 82‚Äì84. Little, Brown Daspuro remained in contact with Caruso throughout the singer's life and wrote an illustrated biography of him published by Sonzogno in 1938. In the later years of his career, Daspuro moved away from the life of a theatrical impresario and journalist and became involved in a number of construction and urban development projects with the architect and engineer . The most notable of these was the Central Funicular railway in Naples which opened in 1928. Daspuro died a wealthy man at his villa in the Campi Flegrei in 1941.Manzo, Elena (2012).

It was established in 1920 when the Gunnery and Torpedo Division was separated into an independent Gunnery Division and Torpedo Division it existed until 1964 when the Department of Admiralty was abolished and replaced by a new Ministry of Defence. ==History== Prior to 1918 responsibility for naval ordnance and gunnery training lay with Naval Ordnance Department. In 1918 the Naval Artillery and Torpedoes Division was established in June 1920 that department was split up to create two new Naval Staff directorates of which the Gunnery Division was one and Torpedo division the other. It was created as new directorate of the Admiralty Naval Staff in primarily to deal with questions of the tactical use of these weapons and the training of personnel and to facilitate the clear connection between the use of the weapon and operations. The training and the tactical aspects of weapons constitute a sphere common to the naval staff, the admiralty technical departments and the fleet. Following on from the lessons learnt during World War One on 19 April 1920 the Gunnery and Torpedo Division was split up and according to author Norman Friedman responsibility for Gunnery initially concerned with fire control was specifically created for a new Director of the Gunnery Division, Naval Staff, Captain Frederic C. Dreyer who was Admiral Jellicoe's chief fleet gunnery officer. In 1928 the Gunnery Division was disbanded from the Naval Staff until the advent of World War Two when in 1941 it was re-established as the Gunnery and Anti-Aircraft Division it remained a naval staff division until 1964. ==Directors duties== Instructions issued for the Gunnery Division as part of the Naval Staff re-organisation as of 1921 and held by the National Archives (U.K.) included: A) The Director of the Gunnery Division (D. of. G.D.) will advise on the following: *Practical gunnery and gunnery exercises. **The use of gas and smoke in warfare and counter-measures. **The methods of instruction in the Training establishments for carrying out training in the use of: ***Gunnery weapons, ***Smoke, gas, anti-gas apparatus. He is responsible for keeping the Naval Staff in touch with progress and general development of the Fleet in gunnery and chemical warfare and with the method of conducting gunnery and chemical warfare at sea. B) He will advise on: *Gunnery policy, both offensive & defensive as affecting design. *Quantity and distribution of gunnery material so far as tactical requirements are concerned. *Effect on gunnery policy of technical development and scientific research and progress. *Air co-operation in gunnery matters. Note.‚ÄîTechnical advice on the design of gunnery material, chemical warfare material, and material for counter measures is the function of the D.N.O. C) He is responsible for scrutinising all reports of gunnery practices submitted to the Admiralty for review by Senior Officers and Cs.-in-C., and will advise as to the action necessary:‚Äî *To control the lines on which the various commands are working, and to co- ordinate their work. *To keep each command in touch with the progress made by others. *To standardise methods. D) In matters of material arising from reports of practices, he is responsible for co-ordinating suggestions from various commands and for advising on them from the point of view of practical use and Training, before they are dealt with by the appropriate Department under the Controller. E) He is responsible for the compilation of records and summaries of Fleet gunnery practices, and for the preparation and periodical revision of the Firing Manual and any other handbook relating to his duties. He is responsible that these embody all general orders for carrying out practices necessary for the acquisition and maintenance of efficiency, and all lessons learnt from action experience and peace practices. Notes: The responsibility for progress and development in gunnery matters in the Fleets under their command rests entirely with the various Commanders-in-Chief. F) In conjunction with the Director of Training and Staff Duties, who is responsible for advice on policy and principles of training, he is responsible to the A.C.N.S. for the formulation of requirements of technical gunnery training. G) He is responsible to the A.C.N.S. for advice on training in the use of gunnery weapons, smoke, gas and counter measures carried out at the Training establishments. H) With regard to paragraphs 6 and 7, he will keep in close touch with the D.N.O, who is responsible to the Second Sea Lord for advice on complements and Quarter Bills, training in so far as it affects safe working and maintenance of material, and training in diving, and who is responsible to the Controller for advice on material. Note.‚ÄîThe D. of G.D. is concerned with the use of weapons whilst the D.N.O. is concerned with their preparation for use. These respective spheres of activity meet in the drill which is required to finally prepare the weapon for use. Drill, having the double purpose of producing the best result from the weapon and also of preventing damage or accident due to improper handling of material, is common ground to both D. of G.D. and D.N.O.., to whom it is therefore a joint responsibility. Whilst therefore close co-operation between the D. of G.D. and D.N.O,. is always necessary, it is especially so in the domain of drill. I) He will be responsible for recommending the type and allocation of targets to meet the requirements of the Fleet. Note.‚ÄîDesigns, repairs, and provision of targets are administered by the Controller's Department. J). He will at all times maintain close touch with the Director of Torpedo Division respecting suggestions for the employment of new weapons, and with Director of Plans respecting the strategical aspect of all questions referred to him. K). He will be at liberty to communicate directly with the Commanding Officers of the Gunnery schools on all questions of Training in the use of weapons lying in his sphere as defined by these instructions. L). He will conform with paragraph 3 of the Instructions for Plans Division. ==Directors of the Division== Directors Gunnery Division :Post holders included: * Captain Frederic C.

He begun his career playing for his local junior side Cronulla Caringbah at the age of sixteen. He was subsequently scouted and signed as a junior to the Cronulla Sharks. ==Playing career== Cronulla coach Jack Gibson gave Coleman his first grade debut against the Illawarra Steelers in round 22 of the 1986 season. In 1987, Coleman finished the season as the Sharks' top try scorer with 10 tries. In the 1988 season, the Sharks won the minor premiership for the first time in the club's history, Coleman played a starring role in his sides' success, playing in all 24 games, and scoring 8 tries. The Sharks narrowly missed out on Grand Final qualification that year when they lost 9-2 in the preliminary final to the Balmain Tigers at the Sydney Football Stadium.Middleton, David; Rugby League 1988/1989; p. 46. In the 1989 season, the Sharks finished fifth after surviving a playoff for fifth with the Brisbane Broncos. Coleman once again played in all 24 games, and scored 6 tries in the 1989 season.Middleton, David Rugby League 1989/1990; p. 110. Injuries in the 1990 and 1991 seasons prevented him from making much of an impact, but Coleman returned to top form in the 1992 season when he scored 8 tries from 21 appearances. Coleman's stint with the Sharks ended at the conclusion of the 1994 season and subsequently retired from playing. ==Post playing== After the 2005 Cronulla riots, Coleman was selected along with fellow sports stars Susie Maroney, Nick Davis, Mark Ella and former Sharks teammate Andrew Ettingshausen to head the $250,000 NSW government campaign to promote Sydney's beach suburbs as safe for everyone. In 2006, Coleman narrowly missed out on selection in the Cronulla Sharks Dream Team. Mat Rogers and Ray Corcoran were instead chosen as the wingers. In 2013, Coleman briefly became the chairman of the Cronulla Sharks, but resigned from the position after only two months in the job. He was subsequently replaced by former Olympic basketballer Damian Keogh. Coleman now has a successful digital printing company Coleman Group as well as being a property developer. Coleman Group has been designing, printing and installing signage for over 60 years.

The Szeged index, introduced by Iv√°n Gutman, . generalizes the concept of the Wiener index introduced by Harry Wiener. The Szeged index of a connected graph G is defined as : Sz(G)=\\\\sum_{e\\\\in E(G)} n_1(e\\\\mid G)n_2(e\\\\mid G), If e is an edge of G connecting vertices u and v, then we write e = uv or e = vu. For e=uv\\\\in E(G), let n_1(e\\\\mid G) and n_2(e\\\\mid G) be respectively the number of vertices of G lying closer to vertex u than to vertex v and the number of vertices of G lying closer to vertex v than to vertex u. Szeged index plays an important role in information theory. One way to measure a network structure is through the so-called topological indices. Szeged index has been shown to correlate well with numerous biological and physicochemical properties. ==Examples== The Szeged index of Dendrimer Nanostar of the following figure can be calculated by. : Sz(T_n) = 1620n\\\\cdot4^n - 2376\\\\cdot4^n + 2862\\\\cdot2^n-432, \\\\quad n \\\\geq 0. thumb ==References== Category:Mathematical chemistry Category:Cheminformatics Category:Graph invariants ","title":"Szeged index"},{"id":"56077858","text":"Geoffrey Klempner may refer to: *Geoffrey Stephen Klempner, Canadian engineer *Geoffrey Klempner, British philosopher, editor of Philosophy Pathways ","title":"Geoffrey Klempner"},{"id":"56077921","text":"The Friend OS or the Friend Unifying Platform is the first open source cloud operating system that aims to unify web applications and deliver an ecosystem for them to be used across all devices. Friend OS offers users a device agnostic computing environment accessible via the Friend Workspace, an HTML5 and JavaScript based user interface where file management and applications can be run. or The project was started in 2014 by Friend Software Labs and they delivered their first open source version on GitHub in June 2017. They announced a partnership with the Golem project in November 2017. Friend will integrate their operating system environment into Golem‚Äôs distributed computing platform. == Overview == Friend OS is a multi-user meta operating system. Based on the Friend Core kernel, it is designed to be a complete operating system which will evolve and adapt with information and communication technologies. It employs a Blockchain based database structure for security, and is developed with decentralised flows of information in mind. Friend OS is designed to fit the Liquid Computing workflow concept by using a desktop environment and applications that can be accessed via a web browser without the need for any additional plugins, meaning it can run on any device, from a smartphone, to a high end workstation. It also fits the Web 4.0 outline of being a middleware where the Internet functions like an operating system. Where Friend OS enables more intuitive forms of resource management, or can be used between devices more easily. The term Web 4.0 itself is used to indicate another phase of the internet and World Wide Web ‚Äî where humans and machines have a more symbiotic relationship. Friend OS fits within its framework, as well as future iterations of the Web, because it supports efficient and intelligent information flows. == Components ==  Friend Core  Friend Core is Friend‚Äôs kernel. It behaves like a web server and operates as an operating system kernel for Friend applications. It also handles user sessions and resources that are available on the remote server. Friend Core is primarily written in C for speed, which allows it to handle requests on high bandwidth networks with 2ms response times.  Features  * Friend Core is our super-smart, super-small and super-fast webserver with an OS inside of it. * Friend Core is written mainly in C and provides low-level system calls to our native applications. * It integrates with various file systems, provides clustering with other core instances via Friend Network and ensures secure user data storage, and much more‚Ä¶  Friend Workspace  The Friend Workspace is the desktop and mobile environment of the Friend OS. It adapts to your device ‚Äì whether it is a desktop computer, a tablet or a smart phone. It is highly collaborative ‚Äì with a built-in chat, and an audio and video conferencing solution that‚Äôs just a click away. The Friend Workspace allows you to share files and collaboratively edit office documents. And if you‚Äôre away from the office ‚Äì it will kindly send you push notifications when you have an important message  Libraries  Some of Friend Core's functionality is implemented as runtime linked libraries. This allows for the exchanging of pluggable libraries while Friend Core is running. This provides advantages when sand-boxing and handling decentralised data flows.  Modules (Node.js/PHP/Python)  Friend Core is modular. The modules extend the system with any functionality required by applications on the server side. The modules can be written using many programming languages like Node/JavaScript, PHP, Python, Perl or Java. The modules are user and group permission sensitive, allowing for various degrees of access control. Using a highly optimised core, time to first byte (TTFB) round trips are kept to a minimum.  File System Drivers  Friend Core provides a file system driver API that allows developers to build support for any file system or standards-based web resource using several programming languages. A DOS driver implements basic functions for reading and writing to various remote and cloud service disks such as Dropbox, Google Drive, SAMBA, and others.  Friend Network  Friend Core servers form a network between them for increased scalability, access to computing power, additional services and resources. Friend Network can also provide an open client-side/server-side decentralised and distributed supercomputing network which allows users to share resources and form workgroups. This one is owned, run and governed by token holders, and can act as auxiliary infrastructure for businesses and organisations.  Frnd Token  A global network needs an immutable bookkeeping system. The FRND Token uses Blockchain technology to trace all transactions in the Friend Network. And it adds a logic layer that can be utilised to form contractual relationships between users and vendors. It allows for decentralisation of the Friend Sky Computing network. Friend runs a variety of applications both natively and via remote sessions. == Applications ==  Web Suite  Friend provides you with a Workspace and full office suite and connectivity to MS- office, GSuite and other comparable cloud services. It gives you complete freedom to choose where your data is processed and where it is stored. Easily drag and drop between all applications ‚Äì it‚Äôs never been simpler to multitask online. Our Document, Presentation and Spreadsheet apps run on any device while letting you choose where you want to store your documents. Friend comes with a flexible suite of file systems that lets you store data both on-premise and using your preferred storage provider. Easy user and storage administration make your everyday life easier while keeping your documents safely under your control.  Web Applications  Friend OS is compatible with web applications. As the OS is built using web technologies, applications hosted on the web can easily be executed inside the Friend Workspace.  Friend Applications  The Friend Workspace has its own set of APIs and protocols. Native Friend applications are fully integrated into the operating system and allow features such as pull down menus, managed windows and a range of GUI controls. They are localized therefore they operate much quicker than web hosted or Windows apps. Friend comes bundled with several applications including a native video, audio and text conferencing suite called Friend Chat.  Windows Applications  By routing through the Liberator application stack, a user can run Windows applications directly in the Friend Workspace, alongside Web and Friend applications. By integrating through the RDP protocol, the Windows applications act like they are native web applications. Users can perform functions such as transferring files from Friend disk drives directly into their your Windows applications as well as and copy and paste text from within the Friend Workspace. == Friend Hydrogen  Release history == V.1.0.0 - First public open source release.

Edwards was born in Swansea on 7 March 1890, the elder son of William Edwards and his wife Mary Griffith Thomas. He was educated at Mill Hill School, London, St John's College, Cambridge and at Middlesex Hospital, London, where he qualified as a doctor in 1913. He was appointed house surgeon and surgical registrar at the Middlesex Hospital, and obtained the higher degrees of M.Ch. and FRCS in 1915. Edwards was commissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War I, rising to the rank of major. He was the first Director of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at the London Hospital. He was also responsible for the training of notable surgeons including Dwight Harken, Sir Clement Price Thomas and Sir Russell Brock. == Early life == Born in Swansea on 7 March 1890, the elder son of William Edwards of Langlands, Glamorgan, Chairman of Edwards Limited and Mary Griffith Thomas, Edwards attended Mill Hill school in London. Following studies at St John's College, Cambridge, he achieved a place in medical training at the Middlesex Hospital, was awarded a university scholarship and was appointed as a dresser (assistant) and house-surgeon to Sir Gordon Gordon-Taylor. Sir John Bland-Sutton was also senior surgeon at the Middlesex at this time. == Surgical career ==  World war I  At the outbreak of World War I Edwards was assigned to the Royal Army Medical Corps where he worked and reached the rank of major in France, at No 6 casualty clearing station at Barlin under Sir Cuthbert Sidney Wallace, and at Wimereux under Major Meurice Sinclair. His evolving new surgical practices in war victims left a vast impression on military medicine. Later, his obituary commented that \\"the gods gave him good teachers and the casualties of a crippling war extensive experience\\".  Interwar years  On return, he took post as assistant surgeon to Gordon-taylor at the Westminster Hospital and surgeon to the Brompton Hospital for diseases of the chest where he was assisted by Price Thomas. The interwar years were occupied with pioneering intense surgery. The treatment of war injuries, taught by surgeons Pierre Delbet and G E Gask, were applied to peacetime diseases. He investigated sequentially the surgery of pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis and lung tumours, and within 10-years, with the backing of his colleague physician R. A. Young and his anaesthetist Ivan MagillI, became renowned in the establishment of thoracic surgery. He was also for many years surgeon to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton where many war pensioners were treated. Here, he operated on gastro-jejunal ulceration and gastro-oesopgaeal fistulae. On resuming work in London, he became assistant surgeon to Westminster Hospital, and to the Brompton Hospital. In 1936, he stood appointed as first director of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at the London Hospital. This meant giving up general surgery at the Westminster Hospital. He remained a consulting surgeon to King Edward VII's Sanatorium at Midhurst and to Queen Alexandra's Hospital, Millbank. As surgeon under the Ministry of Pensions to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton he accomplished valuable work in the restoration of the aftermath of war-time gastric operations. He also oversaw the London County Council's Thoracic Clinic at St Mary Abbott's Hospital, Kensington.  World War II  Between 1938 and 1939, Edwards suffered two severe illnesses, following which he continued as a civilian consultant with the Royal Air Force, adviser for thoracic casualties to the Ministry of Health, and civilian adviser to the War Office throughout WW2. He structured the response facilities for thoracic casualties under the Emergency Medical Service. Instituting a school of thoracic surgeons in Great Britain, he became a leading mentor. During the years of war he provided intensive courses of instruction for service thoracic units, and was attentive in visiting these units all over the country. Despite serving numerous hospitals, the Brompton hospital was distinctly Edward's most desirable place to operate. Here, in one day, he would complete an outpatient clinic, an extensive ward, round followed by up to eight major lung and heart operations. Described as \\"a tiger for work, seemingly untiring and unaware that he might be tiring others\\", he was assisted at the Brompton by Price Thomas and anaesthetist Ivan Magill. The number of heart and lung operations at the Brompton rose from 49 in 1908 to 252 in 1928 and 1054 in 1938.  Post World War II  He was elected to the council of the college in 1943, but died before he had completed three years as a councillor. On the international platform in his forties, Edwards became an honorary fellow of the American Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and president of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons at home. In the ultimate years of his life, he was nominated the first president of the new Association for the Study of Diseases of the Chest and contributed a survey of one thousand operations for bronchial carcinoma to the first number of its journal Thorax. == Family == Edwards married Evelyn Imelda Chichester Hoskin, daughter of Theophilus Hoskin, MRCS, of London and Cornwall on 13 April 1920. They did not have children. == Personality == A shy and private person, sometimes seen as cold and arrogant, Edwards was feared amongst juniors. Brock had declared himself to be \\"much junior to him so could not necessarily expect a warm friendliness but it was rare to see him warm and friendly although he could be so\\". == Later life == On 25 August 1946, Edwards was spending his holiday in St Enodoc, Cornwall. Known to be recurrently unwell, his sudden death was still felt as a surprise. He was 56 years old. He was buried at St Enodoc's Church. Lord Horder delivered an obituary oration at a memorial service in London. Mrs Edwards died five years later on 13 May 1951, and left ¬£5,000 to the College for the promotion of surgical science. == Legacy == Numerous students and trainees have trained under Edwards. Dwight Harken from the USA, took up a visiting fellows post with Tudor Edwards in 1942 later, ironically competing with another trainee, Sir Russell Brock. Edwards was the inspiration for Clement Price Thomas, the surgeon who performed the thoracotomy on King George VI in 1951. He was known as the \\"operator of supreme skill and beautiful technique\\". In 1948, his colleagues organised a memorial fund to endow a lecture in his memory. Administered by both the Royal College of physicians and Royal College of Surgeons, the lecture is an honour to give. Past speakers have included Geoffrey Marshall, Sir Clement Price Thomas and Sir Russell Brock. ==References== Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons Category:1890 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People educated at Mill Hill School Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:People from Swansea Category:Welsh surgeons Category:History of surgery Category:Physicians of the Westminster Hospital Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Tudor Edwards"},{"id":"56078018","text":"Mandew is a town and union council in Bannu District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Union councils of Bannu District Category:Populated places in Bannu District ","title":"Mandew"},{"id":"56078032","text":"Dagai is a village and town in Buner District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Populated places in Buner District ","title":"Dagai, Buner"},{"id":"56078059","text":"The 2018 Thailand motorcycle Grand Prix was the fifteenth round of the 2018 MotoGP season.

Cannabis cultivation dates back at least 3000 years in Taiwan. The history of cannabis and its usage by humans dates back to at least the third millennium BC in written history, and possibly further back by archaeological evidence. For millennia, the plant has been valued for its use for fiber and rope, as food and medicine, and for its psychoactive properties for religious and recreational use. The earliest restrictions on cannabis were reported in the Islamic world by the 14th century. In the 19th century, it began to be restricted in colonial countries, often associated with racial and class stresses. In the middle of the 20th century, international coordination led to sweeping restrictions on cannabis throughout most of the globe. Entering the 21st century, some nations began to change their approaches to cannabis, with measures taken to decriminalize cannabis; the Netherlands became the first nation to legalize cannabis, and in 2015 Uruguay became the first to legalize recreational cannabis with Canada following in 2018 and South Africa for personal home use only. ==Ancient uses== Bhang eaters from India c. 1790. Bhang is an edible preparation of cannabis native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by Hindus in ancient India. Cannabis is indigenous to Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\\"Marijuana and the Cannabinoids\\", ElSohly (p. 8). Hemp is possibly one of the earliest plants to be cultivated. Cannabis has been cultivated in Japan since the pre-Neolithic period for its fibres and as a food source and possibly as a psychoactive material. An archeological site in the Oki Islands near Japan contained cannabis achenes from about 8000 BC, probably signifying use of the plant. Hemp use archaeologically dates back to the Neolithic Age in China, with hemp fiber imprints found on Yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium BC.Barber, E. J. W. (1992). Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean. Princeton University Press. p. 17. The Chinese later used hemp to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. Cannabis was an important crop in ancient Korea, with samples of hempen fabric discovered dating back as early as 3000 BCE. Hemp is called ganja (, IAST: ) in Sanskrit and other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Some scholars suggest that the ancient drug soma, mentioned in the Vedas, was cannabis, although this theory is disputed. Bhanga is mentioned in several Indian texts dated before 1000 CE. However, there is philological debate among Sanskrit scholars as to whether this bhanga can be identified with modern bhang or cannabis. Cannabis was also known to the ancient Assyrians, who discovered its psychoactive properties through the Aryans. Using it in some religious ceremonies, they called it qunubu (meaning \\"way to produce smoke\\"), a probable origin of the modern word \\"cannabis\\". The Aryans also introduced cannabis to the Scythians, Thracians and Dacians, whose shamans (the kapnobatai‚Äî\\"those who walk on smoke/clouds\\") burned cannabis flowers to induce trance. The classical Greek historian Herodotus (ca. 480 BC) reported that the inhabitants of Scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke, both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation. Cannabis sativa from Vienna Dioscurides, AD 512 Cannabis residues have been found on two altars in Tel Arad, dated to the Kingdom of Judah in the 8th century BCE. Its discoverers believe that the evidence points to the use of cannabis for ritualistic psychoactive use in Judah. Cannabis has an ancient history of ritual use and is found in pharmacological cults around the world. Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at Pazyryk suggest early ceremonial practices like eating by the Scythians occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BC confirming previous historical reports by Herodotus. In China, the psychoactive uses of cannabis is described in the Shennong Bencaojing, written around the 3rd century AD. Daoists mixed cannabis with other ingredients, then placed them in incense burners and inhaled the smoke. ==Global spread== Around the turn of the millennium, the use of hashish (cannabis resin) began to spill over from the Persian world into the Arab world. Cannabis was allegedly introduced to Iraq in 1230 CE, during the reign of Caliph Al-Mustansir Bi'llah, by the entourage of Bahraini rulers visiting Iraq. Hashish was introduced to Egypt by \\"mystic Islamic travelers\\" from Syria sometime during the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th century CE. Hashish consumption by Egyptian Sufis has been documented as occurrent in the thirteenth century CE, and a unique type of cannabis referred to as Indian hemp was also documented during this time. Smoking did not become common in the Old World until after the introduction of tobacco, so up until the 1500s hashish in the Muslim world was consumed as an edible. Cannabis is thought to have been introduced to Africa by early Arab or Indian Hindu travelers, which Bantu settlers subsequently introduced to southern Africa when they migrated southward. Smoking pipes uncovered in Ethiopia and carbon- dated to around 1320 CE were found to have traces of cannabis. It was already in popular use in South Africa by the indigenous Khoisan and Bantu peoples prior to European settlement in the Cape in 1652. By the 1850s, Swahili traders had carried cannabis from the east coast of Africa, to the Congo Basin in the west. The Spaniards brought industrial hemp to the Western Hemisphere and cultivated it in Chile starting about 1545. In 1607, \\"hempe\\" was among the crops Gabriel Archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main Powhatan village, where Richmond, Virginia is now situated;Gabriel Archer, A Relatyon of the Discoverie of Our River..., printed in Archaeologia Americana 1860, p. 44. William Strachey (1612) records a native (Powhatan) name for hemp (weihkippeis). and in 1613, Samuell Argall reported wild hemp \\"better than that in England\\" growing along the shores of the upper Potomac. As early as 1619, the first Virginia House of Burgesses passed an Act requiring all planters in Virginia to sow \\"both English and Indian\\" hemp on their plantations.Proceedings of the Virginia Assembly, 1619 , cf. the 1633 Act: Hening's Statutes at Large, p. 218 During Napol√©on Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt in 1798, alcohol was not available per Egypt being an Islamic country. In lieu of alcohol, Bonaparte's troops resorted to trying hashish, which they found to their liking. Following an 1836‚Äì1840 travel in North Africa and the Middle East, French physician Jacques-Joseph Moreau wrote on the psychological effects of cannabis use; Moreau was a member of Paris' Club des Hashischins (founded in 1844). In 1842, Irish physician William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, who had studied the drug while working as a medical officer in Bengal with the East India company, brought a quantity of cannabis with him on his return to Britain, provoking renewed interest in the West. Examples of classic literature of the period featuring cannabis include Les paradis artificiels (1860) by Charles Baudelaire and The Hasheesh Eater (1857) by Fitz Hugh Ludlow. ==Early restrictions== Jurisdictions around the world banned cannabis at various times. Perhaps the earliest was Soudoun Sheikouni, the emir of the Joneima in Arabia who prohibited use in the 1300s. In 1787 Madagascar's King Andrianampoinimerina took the throne, and soon after banned cannabis throughout the Merina Kingdom, implementing capital punishment as the penalty for its use. As European colonial powers absorbed or came into contact with cannabis-consuming regions, the cannabis habit began to spread to new areas under the colonial umbrella, causing some alarm among authorities. After his invasion of Egypt Syria (1798-1801), Napoleon banned cannabis use among his soldiers.Booth, M. (2015). Cannabis: A History. St. Martin's Press. pp. 76‚Äì77. . Cannabis was introduced to Brazil either by the Portuguese colonists or by African slaves in the early 1800s. Their intent may have been to cultivate hemp fiber, but the slaves the Portuguese imported from Africa were familiar with cannabis and used it psychoactively, leading the Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro in 1830 to prohibit bringing cannabis into the city, and punishing its use by any slave. Similarly, the British practice of transporting Indian indentured workers throughout the empire had the result of spreading the longstanding cannabis practices. Concerns about use of gandia by laborers led to a ban in British Mauritius in 1840, and use of ganja by Indian laborers in British Singapore led to its banning there in 1870. In 1870, Natal (now in South Africa) passed the Coolie Law Consolidation prohibiting \\"the smoking, use, or possession by and the sale, barter, or gift to, any Coolies [Indian indentured workers] whatsoever, of any portion of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa)...\\" Attempts at criminalising cannabis in British India were made, and mooted, in 1838, 1871, and 1877. In 1894, the British Indian government completed a wide-ranging study of cannabis in India. The report's findings stated: Cannabis indica fluid extract, American Druggists Syndicate, pre-1937 In the late 1800s, several countries in the Islamic world and its periphery banned cannabis, with the Khedivate of Egypt banning the importation of cannabis in 1879, Morocco strictly regulating cannabis cultivation and trade (while allowing several Rif tribe to continue to produce) in 1890, and Greece's ban on hashish in 1890. At the start of the 20th century, more countries continued to ban cannabis. In the United States, the first restrictions on sale of cannabis came in 1906 (in District of Columbia). It was outlawed by the Ganja Law in Jamaica (then a British colony) in 1913, in South Africa in 1922, and in the United Kingdom and New Zealand in the 1920s. Canada criminalized cannabis in The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, before any reports of the use of the drug in Canada. ==International regulation== In 1925 a compromise was made at an international conference in The Hague about the International Opium Convention that banned exportation of \\"Indian hemp\\" to countries that had prohibited its use, and requiring importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required \\"exclusively for medical or scientific purposes\\". It also required parties to \\"exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin\\". In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and prohibited the production of hemp in addition to cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed‚Äîseveral scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, Shortly thereafter the United States was forced back to promoting rather than discouraging hemp cultivation; hemp was used extensively by the United States during World War II to make uniforms, canvas, and rope. Much of the hemp used was cultivated in Kentucky and the Midwest. During World War II, the U.S. produced a short 1942 film, Hemp for Victory, promoting hemp as a necessary crop to win the war. In Western Europe, the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s, but the commercial cultivation stopped by then, due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers. In the early 1940s, world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes, Russia was the biggest producer. ==Popularization and the War on Drugs== In the mid-20th century, cannabis began to expand to new populations, first at the margins of Western societies, but then increasingly into the mainstream. Cannabis remained a fringe issue in the British public consciousness through the Interwar years and beyond, associated with society's margins: \\"coloured seamen of the East End and clubs frequented by Negro theatrical performers\\". This perception was strained by a 1950 police raid on Club Eleven in Soho which recovered cannabis and cocaine, and led to the arrest of several young British men. In the United States during the same Interwar period, cannabis was heavily associated with jazz musicians. Cannabis made further inroads with white Americans in the 1950s and the appearance of the beatnik subculture. In the 1960s, the United States saw a dramatic increase in cannabis usage, particularly among young people and college students, bringing cannabis into the middle-class cultural mainstream. The internationalization of popular and youth culture touched off similar increases in other Anglo countries, with an upsurge of cannabis use by youth and college students in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,Jiggens, J (2005). The Cost of Drug Prohibition in Australia. Paper presented to the Social Change in the 21st Century Conference, Centre for Social Change Research, Queensland University of Technology. and New Zealand. United Nations conventions on drug control include the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, amended by the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1972; the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971; and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. As part of its War on Drugs, the United States applied foreign policy pressure to cannabis producing and trafficking countries in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1973, the US pressured Nepal to close down its legal cannabis distribution and stores, In the same year, the US provided US$47 million to Afghanistan for cannabis and opium eradication. Similarly, in 1985 the US began cannabis eradication in Belize (then the fourth-largest cannabis exporter to the US), eventually decreasing production there to \\"negligible levels.\\" ==Liberalizing and legalizing== In 1972, the Dutch government divided drugs into more- and less-dangerous categories, with cannabis being in the lesser category. Accordingly, possession of 30 grams or less was made a misdemeanor. Cannabis has been available for recreational use in coffee shops since 1976. Cannabis products are only sold openly in certain local \\"coffeeshops\\" and possession of up to 5 grams for personal use is decriminalised, however: the police may still confiscate it, which often happens in car checks near the border. Other types of sales and transportation are not permitted, although the general approach toward cannabis was lenient even before official decriminalisation. Cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular due to its use by cancer and AIDS patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and wasting syndrome. In 1996, California became the first U.S. state to legalize medical cannabis in defiance of federal law. In 2001, Canada became the first country to adopt a system regulating the medical use of cannabis. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized all drugs, maintaining the prohibition on production and sale, but changing personal possession and use from a criminal offense to an administrative one. Subsequently, a number of European and Latin American countries decriminalized cannabis, such as Belgium (2003), Chile (2005), Brazil (2006), and Czech Republic (2010). In Uruguay, President Jose Mujica signed legislation to legalize recreational cannabis in December 2013, making Uruguay the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis. In August 2014, Uruguay legalized growing up to six plants at home, as well as the formation of growing clubs, a state-controlled marijuana dispensary regime. In Canada, following the 2015 election of Justin Trudeau and formation of a Liberal government, in 2017 the House of Commons passed a bill to legalize cannabis on 17 October 2018. The United Nations' World Drug Report stated that cannabis \\"was the world's most widely produced, trafficked, and consumed drug in the world in 2010\\", identifying that between 128 million and 238 million users globally in 2015. ==See also== * History of medical cannabis * Timeline of cannabis law ==Further reading== *Mills, James H.

The foundation stone stated the building's purpose was \\"to promote the social, moral and spiritual welfare of the working classes of Eastbourne\\". The hall's facilities included a coffee room, lending library and reading room, smoking room, skittle yard and a lecture room capable of seating 200 people.

It was situated in Trinquetaille on the right bank of the River Rh√¥ne across from Arles. The second church was built in the eleventh or twelfth century, near the remains of an older Roman church, and was destroyed at the end of the eighteenth century. ==History== The first monastery of Arles was established on the Isle of Gall√®gue in the time of the Dominate. It was likely founded by Hilary of Arles at the beginning of the 5th century, \\"in insula suburbana civitatis\\" defining the Isle of Gall√®gue as the location.Paul Masson, Fernand Beno√Æt - Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne (Les) : T.14 : encyclop√©die d√©partementale : Monographies communales, Marseille- Aix- Arles ‚Äì Some historians now believe it to have been the Island of Cappe, which has since disappeared and was about two kilometres to the south-west of Arles. At the site of the monastery two churches are mentioned: the priory \\"Notre-Dame-la- Capella\\", or chapel \\"Notre-Dame-en-Gall√®gue\\", which was perhaps the old chapel for the Ch√¢teau des Baux, of which there remains no trace, and the church \\"Saint-Pierre-de-Gall√®gue\\".Jean et Maurice Molinier - Les Amis du Vieil Arles, ‚Äì The church of Saint-Pierre-de-Gall√®gue abandoned in 1660 ; the Roman bridge is on the left of the village at the point of Trinquetaille. This church was probably ruined by the conflict around the years 470-508, and was transferred a century later, in 546 or 547, to the left bank of the Rh√¥ne, in the Vieux- Bourg, in the reign of Childebert I and the archbishop Aurelianus of Arles.Fernand Benoit - La basilique St-Pierre et St-Paul √† Arles - , here During the Middle Ages, except possibly at the beginning of the ninth century, this area was totally abandoned and there is no evidence of a church. A second church was built in the quarter of \\"la Pointe\\" (to the north of Trinquetaille, where the Rh√¥ne separates into two streams), probably during the twelfth century. The House of Baux possessed a strong castle at Trinquetaille at the beginning of the twelfth century and this may have included the church. The church was pillaged during the siege of Arles in 1240.Martin Aurell ‚Äì Une famille de la noblesse proven√ßale au Moyen √Çge : les Porcelet ‚Äì Aubanel, Archives du sud, 1986 ‚Äì : : Notably the troops of Barral sacked Saint-Pierre en Gall√®gue and burned Malmissane. The church was abandoned around 1618 because the local inhabitants thought it was too far from the villageL. Bonnemant ‚Äì Paroisses ‚Äì Biblioth√®que d'Arles, ms.151, because it had been moved upstream when the boat bridge was moved. The church was still known under the name of \\"Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux\\".Jean et Maurice Molinier - Les Amis du Vieil Arles, ‚Äì It was then demolished in 1786Annie Tuloup-Smith - Rues d'Arles qui √™tes-vous ?, page 264Site du patrimoine here and razed entirely in 1872; its stones were used to build an enclosure around the cemetery which marks its site.

In a volcanic arc setting, hot, molten material from the mantle may intrude the lower crust. This hot material generates a new, more evolved melt in this area of the crust, which may collect and migrate upwards towards the upper crust. Here, it would collect in a magma chamber and later erupt. The upper crust consists mainly of evolved, intermediate to silicic magmatic rocks.G√≥mez-Tuena, A. Straub, S. M., Zellmer, G. F.. Orogenic Andesites and Crustal Growth, pages 8-276, Geological Society of London, 2014, These rocks may form from either differentiation of primary, mantle-derived magma, or from partial melting of older crustal rocks. The DCHZ is a place where such evolved magmas may form.Bianchini, Gianluca. Jean-Louis Bodinier. Crust-Mantle and Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundaries: Insights from Xenoliths, Orogenic Deep Sections, and Geophysical Studies, pages 1-22, Geological Society of America, 2017, == Dynamics == The hot mantle material is intruded in the form of a mafic sill. Sills of molten material are emplaced in the much cooler crust, so it quickly cools down and solidifies. Differentiation of the sill occurs, since the more felsic components stay molten for longer. Furthermore, as in the Torres del Paine Sill Complex, the differentiation probably already occurs when the magma is ascending towards the sill and not within the sill itself. At the same time, the crust heats up and starts partially melting. A composite melt is formed, with parts from crustal partial melting and from differentiation of mantle material.Dosseto, Anthony. Turner, Simon. Van-Orman, James. Timescales of Magmatic Processes, 207-251, John Wiley & Sons, 2011, To migrate upwards, enough melt needs to accumulate so it becomes mobile. Whenever there is not enough melt, the rock is more a crystalline mush, where melt is formed around grain boundaries. Once the melt fraction, the part of the rock which consists of liquid, reaches a certain value, the melt will be mobile enough to migrate upwards. This value is called the Solid-to-Liquid Transition (SLT) and has a value between 0.4 and 0.6. Melt forms an interconnected network along grain boundaries at melt fractions larger than 0.01. This means that at this point, melt can start to slowly move upwards. It collects in layers on the top of the mantle intrusions or just above it. It forms layers here since the overlying portion of the crust is much cooler than the hot zone where hot mantle material is continuously intruded. Thus, the melt cools down on the top of the layer until it approaches its solidus. Once it comes close enough, it cannot move upwards any more and forms a stagnant layer. Melt keeps gathering in these layers until the solid-to-liquid transition is reached and the melt migrates upwards again. The melt uses local features like dikes and faults to migrate towards the surface.Heather, K.B., Percival, J. A., Moser, D., Bleeker, W. Geological Survey of Canada, Open File 3141, page 93, 1995. From numerical models, it is found that formation of magma which can migrate towards the upper crust occurs at a depth of about 30 km. It takes between 10,000 years and 1 million years to form the magma, depending on the emplacement rate of the mantle material. The emplacement rates in volcanic arc settings can vary between 2 and 20 mm/year. == Chemistry == The melt that is formed will consist partly of crustal material and partly of mantle material. It will have the chemical signatures of both crustal and mantle material. Because the melt consists of reworked mantle material and remolten crustal material, it will be more evolved than the mantle material that intruded. The material that will migrate upwards is expected to be mostly rhyolitic. == References == Category:Geology ","title":"Deep crustal hot zone"},{"id":"56078432","text":"The 2018 Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix was the second round of the 2018 MotoGP season. It was held at the Aut√≥dromo Termas de R√≠o Hondo in Santiago del Estero on 8 April 2018. In the MotoGP class, Jack Miller scored his first MotoGP pole position. The race started on wet tyres, and drivers were obliged to swap bikes to slick tyres mid-race in the flag-to-flag rule. Cal Crutchlow took Honda's 750th victory and became the first non-factory rider to lead the championship since Sete Gibernau in the 2004 Catalan Grand Prix, as well as the first British rider to lead the championship since Barry Sheene in 1979. Repsol Honda failed to score for the first time since the previous year's event. Marc M√°rquez and Valentino Rossi collided in the closing stages, with M√°rquez receiving a 30-second time penalty for his incident with Rossi after the race. ==Classification== MotoGP {  style=\\"font- size: 95%;\\" !

The film was released on 21 August 1964, and became a commercial success. It was later remade in Tamil as Avan Pithana? (1966) and in Hindi as Jwaar Bhata (1973). ==Plot== Vishwasundara Rao is an affluent, but ailing gentleman. He deserts his son who marries without the former's consent. By the time Vishwasundara Rao realises what he did, he loses his son and daughter-in-law. The couple's son Sundarayya is raised as an orphan despite being the grandson of a rich family. He earns his living by establishing a coffee hotel in the same town as his grandfather. Vishwasundara Rao's distant relatives, Bhushanam and Sooramma, plot to usurp his wealth while under the guise of serving him. Bhushanam supports Sooramma's plan to make Viswasundara Rao adopt her son Paparao on the condition that she perform his daughter Ammadu's marriage with Paparao. Subbulu, a young woman, escapes from her house to avoid an unwanted wedding. She takes shelter in Sundarayya's house, and both fall in love. After some days, Subbulu gets a job to take care of Vishwasundarayya in his bungalow. She finds photos of Sundarayya's parents in the bedroom and realises that Sundarayya is the grandson of Vishwasundara Rao. She brings the grandfather-grandson together. Vishwasundara Rao sadly dies after looking at his grandson. With their plans having been botched, Bhushanam decides to frame Sundarayya as a lunatic. However, the truth soon comes out, and Sooramma, Bhushanam and his aide Siddhanthi are convicted for their actions. Sundarayya marries Subbulu, and Paparao marries Ammadu. ==Cast== *N. T.

Gummadi was cast as Sundarayya's grandfather Vishwasundara Rao, Ramana Reddy and Suryakantam as his distant relatives Bhushanam and Sooramma respectively, Allu Ramalingaiah as Bhushanam's aide Siddhanthi, Padmanabham as Sooramma's son Paparao, and Sharada as Bhushanam's daughter Ammadu. Radha Kumari played Bhushanam's demure wife, and Raavi Kondala Rao played the family doctor, thereby making his entry as a professional actor.  Filming  During the shoot, Saroja Devi had a ligament tear; because of this, the sets which were constructed for filming the songs \\"Mella Mella Mellaga\\" and \\"Adagaka Icchina Manase\\" in Vauhini Studios had to be dismantled, leading to escalated costs and production delays. Distraught, Adurti rushed to Saroja Devi's Bangalore home, and was ready to replace her with Krishna Kumari, but realised her condition was worse than they had imagined. The songs were eventually filmed around Lal Bagh, Ulsoor Lake and Cubbon Park. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan. == Release and reception == Dagudu Moothalu was released on 21 August 1964, with Navayuga Films acquiring the distribution rights.

(1966) and in Hindi as Jwaar Bhata (1973). ==References External links == * * Category:Films directed by Adurthi Subba Rao Category:Indian comedy films Category:Indian films Category:1960s Telugu-language films Category:Telugu film scores by K.

It is a compound word of Guk (nation) and Philopon (Japanese trade name of Methamphetamine) meaning \\"Korea is the best of all the countries\\". As a result of extreme nationalism, it becomes negative for other people's. With 'Guk-ppong' syndrome, the word 'Guk- kka' (Íµ≠Íπå) was born against the word 'Guk-ppong'. It is a compound word of nations and actions talking behind nation's back. == Concept == The term \\"Guk- ppong\\" was first used in the field of \\"Korean history\\". In \\"the Internet history gallery\\" of \\"DC inside\\" Korean community, there were those who glorified Korean history without any grounds. \\"The Korean race founded, before 'Dangun', the Sumerian Kingdom of Mesopotamia, the world's four largest civilisations\\" or even the Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang was afraid of the military power of Joseon.\\" These people were called \\"Guk-ppong\\". Some have pointed out the fact that the series of \\"Do you know?\\" became widely known. For example, \\"Do you know Psy?\\", \\"Do you know kimchi?\\", \\"Do you know Yuna Kim?\\". And here is also a saying that the word 'Guk-ppong' was born in an attempt to watch that excessive behaviour for the pride of nation. In addition, the term 'Guk-kka' began to appear, as well as ‚ÄòDdong song hap ni da‚Äô, meaning ‚ÄúI am sorry that I am Asian‚Äù. It reflects a sense of self- destructiveness among young people who believe 'Westerners are more likely to be born than Asians'. == Effects ==  Social effects  \\"Guk-ppong's\\" social effects show an act of emphasising and encouraging unconditional patriotism. On the contrary, there are tendencies to criticise and discredit these patriotic elements. In fact, Park Geun-hye, former president's speech in 2016's independence day was also criticised that drunk with patriotism speech 'Guk-ppong' The Japanese media Nikkei reported that intellectuals and media let young people warn new internet phrase criticising homeland are increasing. Sociologists say \\"Guk-ppong\\" is not a pride, but an exaggeration that to conceal the sense of inferiority and anxiety. Director Ryu-Seung-wan by <Íµ∞Ìï®ÎèÑ>, related \\"Guk-ppong\\" said that ‚ÄúI wanted to be judged only by the movie, but I couldn't do it with Korean sentiment. In the movie, it is possible that the two sides are simultaneously engaged in \\"Guk-ppong\\", pro-Japanese. \\"  Cultural influences  A film based on history can not avoid controversy over the \\"Guk-ppong\\" and distortion of national. Became \\"Stalled war galley\\" with the \\"Hell-Chosun gallery\\" in \\"DC inside\\", the \\"Guk-ppong gallery\\" was opened on September 4, 2015, following the establishment of a \\"gallery of Hell- chosun\\". Guk-ppong Content is consumed entirely in the form of people enjoying culture. Modern and contemporary history is shunned by the younger generation as Guk-ppong deprives nationalism and patriotism. Additionally, the South Korean famous history instructor, such as Seol Min-seok and Choi Jin-ki, have stirred up in broadcasting and education circles, under the criticism of the \\"Guk-ppong\\" missionaries. == Criticism == Some criticise that excessive nationalism is causing excessive national attention that is the enlargement of Korean culture patriotism crying out \\"Aunt, Please give me a plate of skate!\\" speaking with a broad accent in front of the camera. Also in the golden age of history, Some point out that the desire for great ancient history is blatant without distinct of conservatism and progressivism, ruling party and opposition party. Because the reality surrounding us is so hot, everyone is going to leave the country in history. Junggi Song said, \\"Actually, I don't think the meaning of the word Guk-ppong is accurately established. Many people were confused with the words of appealing to pity. Don't blindly follow what is unrighteous, but I don't know why they shouldn't love South Korea. I think it could be connected to that. If I get the right criticism, I'll be able to talk, but I'm not afraid if I have right thinking.\\" Besides, There is sorriness because Park's government exerted political pressure on the cultural and artistic circles for gate of choi. == Related work == * ÌÉúÍ∑πÍ∏∞ ÌúòÎÇ†Î¶¨Î©∞ Released on February 6, 2004. * Ìè¨Ìôî ÏÜçÏúºÎ°ú Released on June 16, 2010. * Íµ∞Ìï®ÎèÑ Released on July 26, 2017. * Ïù∏Ï≤úÏÉÅÎ•ôÏûëÏ†Ñ Released on July 27, 2016. * Íµ≠Ï†úÏãúÏû• Released on December 17, 2014. * ÏûêÏ†ÑÏ∞®Ïôï ÏóÑÎ≥µÎèô Released on February 27, 2019. * Ïû•ÏÇ¨Î¶¨: ÏûäÌòÄÏßÑ ÏòÅÏõÖÎì§ Released on September 25, 2019 == References == Category:South Korean culture ","title":"Gukppong"},{"id":"56078687","text":"is an American violinist and musicologist. == Biography == Ray Iwazumi was born in Seattle, Washington.

It is used by Higher Education Institutions and employers who need a fast, accurate way to check the English language skills of students and employees. The test is modular so institutions and employers can choose the combination of language skills they want to assess. The Linguaskill Reading and Listening module is a computer-adaptive test. The test finishes when a candidate has answered enough questions for Linguaskill to identify their level accurately. Answers are marked automatically to provide fast, accurate results. ==History== The development of the first computer-adaptive English language test by Cambridge Assessment English dates back to the early 1990s. The employment agency Manpower approached Cambridge Assessment English in 1994 with a request for a language proficiency test to be used to place staff in temporary employment. The test requirements were as follows: * it could be administered at any office * it could be available on demand * it did not require specially qualified staff to mark it * it had to be short, yet as reliable as possible * it had to accurately identify candidates‚Äô practical language ability in a general business setting. Given these requirements, computer-adaptive testing was identified as the most suitable approach. It satisfied the need for a relatively short test, which would measure accurately over a wide range of levels, and it would be convenient to administer. The original Linguaskill ran under DOS. By 1996, it had been replaced by a Windows multimedia version. It was trialled in a number of countries mostly in Europe, but also in Mexico and Japan.Jones, N (2014) Multilingual Frameworks: the construction and use of multilingual proficiency frameworks, Studies in Language Testing, Issue 40, Cambridge University Press. Having successfully demonstrated the use of computer-adaptive testing, a number of further testing projects were undertaken. These have included: CommuniCAT (winner of the 2000 European Academic Software Award), computer-based BULATS Online and the Cambridge English Placement Test.Walczak, A (2015) Computer-adaptive testing, Research Notes 59, UCLES. In 2016, the new version of Linguaskill was launched. It has been trialled by speakers of over 40 languages, from 50 countries around the world, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results. ==Format== Linguaskill is a computer-based test. It requires a computer, internet connection and a set of headphones (no specialist software is required). It is a modular assessment which tests Reading and Listening (combined) and Writing. Reading and Listening (60‚Äì85 minutes) The Reading and Listening module is an adaptive test. There is not a fixed number of questions. The test finishes when the candidate has answered enough questions for Linguaskill to identify the candidate‚Äôs level accurately. Writing (45 minutes) The Writing test has two parts (each worth half of the final Writing mark). Part 1: the candidate needs to write an email (minimum of 50 words). Part 2: the candidate needs to write a longer text (minimum of 180 words). Example writing topics include: future plans; free time and hobbies; using and learning English; family and friends; travel and holidays; places and sights; studying and working; shopping; sport; music; home life; technology. Candidates input their answers using a computer keyboard. ==Timing and results== Linguaskill does not have any set test dates or venues. It is designed for organisations that wish to run and invigilate the test at their own site, according to their own timescales. Results for the Reading and Listening module are provided immediately. Writing answers are marked automatically by the computer and results are available within 12 hours. Linguaskill has a computer-generated Test Report Form. This means there is no waiting for printed certificates/documents. The Test Report Form has the following information about the candidate‚Äôs performance: * a CEFR level for each skill tested (writing, reading and listening) * a score on the Cambridge English Scale for each skill tested (writing, reading and listening) * an average CEFR score (if more than one skill is tested) * an average Cambridge English Scale score (if more than one skill is tested) * an explanation of what each score means in terms of English language ability. The following scores are used to report results: {  - ! Cambridge English Scale score !! CEFR Level -  180+  C1 or above -  160‚Äì179  B2 -  140‚Äì159  B1 -  120‚Äì139  A2 -  100‚Äì119  A1 -  82‚Äì99  Below A1 } Test reports can be produced for individuals or for groups. It is possible to break down scores by group and language level. This is designed to allow for easy comparison of language ability across a whole organisation. ==Usage== Linguaskill is used by Higher Education Institutions to assess language levels on admissions, monitor progress, and check that students meet graduation language requirements. Linguaskill is used by employers in recruitment to check applicants have the right language skills for a role. It is also used to measure the effectiveness of staff language training. The test is modular. Each organisation chooses the combination of language skills to be tested. Linguaskill has a flexible structure, so that organisations can administer it however, wherever and whenever is convenient for their exact needs. ==Preparation== Free preparation materials, such as sample tests, are available online. ==See also== Cambridge Assessment English ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official website Category:Standardized tests for English language Category:English language tests Category:English-language education Category:University of Cambridge examinations ","title":"Linguaskill"},{"id":"56078785","text":"The Liga Nacional de Handebol 2017 (2017 National Handball League) was the 21st season of the top tier Brazilian handball national competitions for clubs, it is organized by the Brazilian Handball Confederation.

He went on to become a boxing trainer. ==Career== Born in Newport, Wales, and raised in Holloway, London, Lake took up boxing at the age of 8 at the Blythe Mansions Boxing Club, having his first fight at the age of 10. At the age of 15 he became an apprentice jockey at Newmarket. In five years he won 7 of 28 races. He then decided to pursue a career as a professional boxer. Lake made his professional boxing debut in October 1963, stopping Don McCrea in five rounds. He won his first seven fights before losing on points in May 1964 to Arnold Bell. In June 1964, his opponent Lyn James died after collapsing in the sixth round due to a brain injury. By May 1968 he had built up a record of 19 wins from 23 fights, before two points defeats at the hands of Jimmy Revie, and a third round disqualification for a low blow against South African bantamweight champion Arnold Taylor in Johannesburg. Managed at the time by Terry Downes, in January 1969, Lake beat British super-featherweight champion Jimmy Anderson in a non-title fight at the York Hall, Bethnal Green, Anderson being disqualified in the sixth round for kidney punching. The victory earned Lake a shot at Anderson's title, and the two met again four weeks later at the Royal Albert Hall, Anderson retaining the title with a seventh round stoppage and winning the ¬£500 gold championship belt outright. Lake had two further fights, defeats to Antonio Puddu and Brian Hudson, before retiring from the sport. His professional record included 20 wins, 9 losses, and 1 draw. He subsequently became a boxing trainer, working with boxers such as Ivor Jones, Colin Dunne, and John Ryder, as well as many amateurs at the Angel ABC in Islington. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from London Category:British male boxers Category:Super- featherweight boxers ","title":"Colin Lake"},{"id":"56078831","text":"Zhao Yan (171 ‚Äì July or August 245), courtesy name Boran, was a government official and military general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

The figurehead emperor and the Han central government thus came under Cao Cao's control.

He then started a crackdown on crime by arresting several high-profile criminals, putting them on trial, and sentencing them to death accordingly.

At the time, as Li Tong's appointment was higher than Zhao Yan's, he had the authority to overturn Zhao Yan's decision and spare his wife's uncle. Li Tong's wife knew that, so she tearfully pleaded with her husband to intervene and save her uncle.

Suggesting a tax exemption Around the year 200, when the Battle of Guandu broke out between Cao Cao and his rival Yuan Shao, Yuan Shao sent spies to infiltrate the various commanderies in Yu Province, then under Cao Cao's control, and induce their peoples to turn against Cao Cao and defect to his side.

Rewarding goodness is a form of motivation to the righteous; those who excel in the art of governance know that it is best to let the people keep their wealth.

After the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao's forces broke into Yuan Shao's office and found several documents detailing exchanges between Yuan Shao and spies/defectors from Cao Cao's side. When Cao Cao looked through the documents, he saw that Li Tong was not among those who had secret contact with Yuan Shao, and deduced that Zhao Yan must have stopped Li Tong.

As all three of them were headstrong and strong- willed, they had difficulties working with each other. Cao Cao thus appointed Zhao Yan as an army adviser to assist the three of them in managing their relations with each other and persuade them to cooperate.

When the remaining reinforcements showed up, they combined forces with Xu Huang's army and Cao Ren's defenders to launch an attack on Guan Yu and succeeded in lifting the siege on Fancheng.(Ë´∏Â∞áÁöÜÂñúÔºå‰æø‰ΩúÂú∞ÈÅìÔºåÁÆ≠È£õÊõ∏Ëàá‰ªÅÔºåÊ∂àÊÅØÊï∏ÈÄöÔºåÂåóËªç‰∫¶Ëá≥ÔºåÂπ∂Âã¢Â§ßÊà∞„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 23. Although Guan Yu retreated after his defeat, his ships were still blocking the Mian River () and preventing Cao Cao's forces in Fancheng from making contact with Cao Cao's other forces in Xiangyang. During this time, Liu Bei's ally Sun Quan broke their alliance and used the opportunity to launch a stealth invasion of Guan Yu's base. When Guan Yu learnt that his base was lost, he immediately turned around and retreated back to southern Jing Province.(ÁæΩËªçÊó£ÈÄÄÔºåËàüËàπÁå∂ÊìöÊ≤îÊ∞¥ÔºåË•ÑÈôΩÈöîÁµï‰∏çÈÄöÔºåËÄåÂ≠´Ê¨äË•≤ÂèñÁæΩËºúÈáçÔºåÁæΩËÅû‰πãÔºåÂç≥Ëµ∞ÂçóÈÇÑ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 23.

Zhao Yan, however, disapproved and said: \\"When Sun Quan saw that Guan Yu was occupied with the siege at Fancheng, he wanted to secretly invade and capture Guan Yu's base but he was worried that Guan Yu would turn back to save his base. He was also worried that we would take advantage of their conflict to attack him. That was why he agreed to cooperate with us and pledge allegiance (to Cao Cao). However, he was actually sitting on the fence and waiting to see what happens before making his final decision. Now that Guan Yu and his remaining troops have become an isolated force, all the more we should leave him alive so that he will pose a threat to Sun Quan. If we attack Guan Yu, Sun Quan will become worried that we will attack him after defeating Guan Yu, and will thus turn hostile towards us.

Cao Ren agreed with Zhao Yan's view and aborted his plan to attack Guan Yu.

Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from the figurehead Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei (or Wei) with himself as the new emperor. From the time between Cao Cao's death to the year 222 (the third year of Cao Pi's reign), Zhao Yan consecutively held the following positions: Chief Commandant of Escorting Cavalry (), Administrator () of Hedong Commandery (Ê≤≥Êù±ÈÉ°; around present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi), and General of the Household for Agriculture ().(È†É‰πãÔºåÊãúÈßôÈ¶¨ÈÉΩÂ∞âÔºåÈ†òÊ≤≥Êù±Â§™ÂÆàÔºåÂÖ∏Ëæ≤‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 23. The Weilue recorded that when Du Ji was serving as the Administrator of Hedong Commandery before Zhao Yan replaced him, the Wei government issued an order to all commandery administrators to gather all the widows in their respective jurisdictions and send them to places where the female population was low, so as to allow the widows to remarry and hence promote population growth. Some corrupt commandery administrators cheated by forcefully separating women from their husbands, falsely registering them as widows, and sending them away. As Du Ji went by the book, the records indicated that Hedong Commandery sent a very low number of widows. Later, after Zhao Yan replaced Du Ji as the Administrator of Hedong Commandery, the records showed a significant increase in the number of widows sent from the commandery. When Cao Pi asked Du Ji to explain the difference, the latter replied, \\"The women I sent were the wives of dead men. The women Zhao Yan sent are the wives of living men.\\" Cao Pi and his other subjects were taken aback by Du Ji's response.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÂàùÁïøÂú®ÈÉ°ÔºåË¢´Êõ∏ÈåÑÂØ°Â©¶„ÄÇÊòØÊôÇ‰ªñÈÉ°ÊàñÊúâÂ∑≤Ëá™Áõ∏ÈÖçÂ´ÅÔºå‰æùÊõ∏ÁöÜÈåÑÂ•™ÔºåÂïºÂì≠ÈÅìË∑Ø„ÄÇÁïø‰ΩÜÂèñÂØ°ËÄÖÔºåÊïÖÊâÄÈÄÅÂ∞ëÔºõÂèäË∂ôÂÑº‰ª£ÁïøËÄåÊâÄÈÄÅÂ§ö„ÄÇÊñáÂ∏ùÂïèÁïøÔºö„ÄåÂâçÂêõÊâÄÈÄÅ‰ΩïÂ∞ëÔºå‰ªä‰ΩïÂ§ö‰πüÔºü„ÄçÁïøÂ∞çÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËá£ÂâçÊâÄÈåÑÁöÜ‰∫°ËÄÖÂ¶ªÔºå‰ªäÂÑºÈÄÅÁîü‰∫∫Â©¶‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùÂèäÂ∑¶Âè≥È°ßËÄåÂ§±Ëâ≤„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 16.

The temple structure is considered the best of all temples in Mount Wutai. ==History== The legend says that Manjushri revealed himself and preached at the summit of Mount Wutai, hence the name \\"Bodhisattva Summit Temple\\" (). It is also known as \\"Spiritual Black Eagle Peak\\" () due to its geographical position similar to the Lingjiu Peak described by Sakyamuni in the city of Rajgir northeast of the Kingdom of Magadha. Northern Wei dynasty Pusading was first established in the reign of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei (467-499) in the Northern Wei (386-534) dynasty and initially called \\"Great Temple of Manjushri\\" (). Tang dynasty In 631, in the 5th year of the Zhenguan period of the Tang dynasty (618-907), Buddhist monk Fayun () rebuilt the temple and renamed it \\"Zhenrong Temple\\" (). Song dynasty During the Jingde period (1004-1007) of the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), Emperor Zhenzong (997-1022) bestowed a plaque with \\"Fengzhen Pavilion\\" () on the temple. Ming dynasty In the Yongle period (1403-1424) of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the Yongle Emperor changed the name to \\"Great Temple of Manjushri\\" (). In 1581, in the 9th year of the Wanli period, the temple was renovated by the government. Qing dynasty In 1656, in the 13th year of the Shunzhi period (1644-1661) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the temple converted to Tibetan Buddhism. In 1683, in the 22nd year of the Kangxi period (1662-1722), with the Kangxi Emperor's permission, the roof of Pusading was tiled with yellow glazed tiles. In June 1908, United States Ambassador to China William Woodville Rockhill and the 13th Dalai Lama talked about strengthening cooperation on the Government of British India and Government of Tibet issue in the temple. Republic of China In the spring of 1948, Chen Yi went to Xibaipo via Mount Wutai. He wrote a poem in praise of the beautiful scenery. People's Republic of China In 1983, the temple was classified as a \\"National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area\\". ==Architecture== The Great Manjushri Hall A walkway of 108 stone steps A walkway of 108 stone steps leads to the summit as if it was a ladder to heaven from the temples below.

She is initially introduced in the 2017 Claudia Gray novel Star Wars: Leia, Princess of Alderaan as the childhood best friend of Princess Leia Organa. Holdo and Leia first meet as teenagers when they are both enrolled in Coruscant's Apprentice Legislature, with Holdo subsequently becoming an important member of the Rebel Alliance. Holdo reappears in the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi, in which she is portrayed by Laura Dern as a member of Organa's Resistance, as well as a number of Star Wars comics. Claudia Gray's version of the character has received high acclaim from critics and fans alike, with many comparing her to the character of Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter series. Rian Johnson's version in The Last Jedi has been generally well-received, particularly praising Laura Dern's performance as an older Holdo; however, some have criticized her characterization for being too different from her younger book counterpart. ==Character== In Claudia Gray's novel and comic stories, Amilyn Holdo is depicted as an eccentric yet highly intelligent and competent member of the Rebel Alliance who is often underestimated because of her quirks. She is knowledgeable of the esoteric and spiritual practices of her home planet Gatalenta, such as astrology and skyfaring (a type of meditation), and often speaks in riddles and strange metaphors (Leia refers to her distinctive speech patterns as \\"Holdo speak\\"). In terms of appearance, Holdo dyes her hair exotic colors, habitually going barefoot,Age of Resistance Special 1 and often dressing in flamboyant clothing. Gray said: Initially, the movie version of Holdo was intended to be very close to her description in the book, described by Johnson as \\"hippy- dippy\\"; Laura Dern also compared Holdo to a hippie. However, the director thought that Dern's portrayal was \\"too spacy\\", so her character's eccentricities were significantly toned down in the final version of the script. In a 2018 interview, Dern revealed that Holdo is Force-sensitive. ==Appearances== Leia, Princess of Alderaan  Holdo makes her first appearance as a teenage student of the Apprentice Legislature who befriends Leia during a Pathfinding class. Subsequently, she learns about Leia's involvement in the Rebel Alliance, and aids her in her missions. Most notably, Holdo helps Organa safely navigate to the Paucris system to warn the rebels about an impending attack by the Empire. Comic series Holdo appears in a number of Star Wars comic stories. The Star Wars Adventures 25 story \\"The Right Wrong Turn\\" revisits Holdo and Organa's teenage friendship, with Amilyn asking Leia to teach her to drive a speeder as a pretext for visiting the dangerous lower levels of Coruscant. In Age of Resistance Special 1 story \\"The Bridge\\", she assumes command of a Rebel Alliance starship after the captain is killed by an attacking Imperial warship, and saves the crew by making her \\"Holdo maneuver\\". In Star Wars: Age of Resistance ‚Äì Poe Dameron #1, Holdo runs a Resistance spy operation to steal the head of a protocol droid belonging to the New Republic. She is confronted by Poe Dameron, who is at that time a New Republic pilot, but her identity as the thief is never revealed to him, which is why he doesn‚Äôt recognize her in The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi By The Last Jedi, Holdo is the Vice-Admiral of the Resistance who temporarily assumes the position of the Supreme Commander while Princess Leia is in a coma after an attack by the First Order. There is distrust and tension between her and her subordinate Poe Dameron, which eventually culminates in Dameron starting a mutiny against Holdo. After Leia recovers from her injuries, she suppresses the mutiny, but Holdo eventually decides to sacrifice herself to defeat the First Order fleet in a suicide attack dubbed as ‚Äúthe Holdo maneuver‚Äù by the time of The Rise of Skywalker. ==Reception== The book version of Holdo received critical acclaim, and readers compared her to Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter series. Her character was analyzed from a feminist perspective, with Valerie Estelle Frankel noting that Holdo possesses \\"a very different nonlinear [feminine] type of strength\\". In regards to the movie version of Holdo, Arkady Martine wrote that \\"women who look like Holdo ‚Äî femme fatales, even in their middle age, women who‚Ä¶ like frivolous things, jewels and bright hair and makeup even in the darkest moments ‚Äî we are primed to read women like that as women who will betray\\", and that this \\"old trope\\" is eventually subverted when Holdo turns out to be a skilled strategist with \\"impeccable military credentials\\" who sacrifices herself for the Resistance. Caitlyn Busch described Dern's character as \\"a stern, beautiful female character who audiences have never seen before; she swoops in, takes control of the situation, and shames a favorite male character like he‚Äôs an insolent child\\". However, critics also noted that the movie depiction of Holdo appears very dissimilar from the quirky book character created by Claudia Gray, and basically seems \\"like a different person\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Amilyn Holdo on IMDb Category:Female characters in film Category:Film characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional characters who have mental powers Category:Fictional commanders Category:Fictional diplomats Category:Fictional eccentrics Category:Fictional feminist characters Category:Fictional female admirals Category:Fictional military strategists Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Star Wars comics characters Category:Star Wars literary characters ","title":"Vice-Admiral Holdo"},{"id":"56079139","text":"A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018.

These vessels fought against the Soviet Navy during most of the war, the last one being decommissioned in 1988. ==Destroyers== MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti class NMS MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti The two destroyers of the MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti class, previously known as the Vifor class, were ordered in 1913 by Romania from the Pattison Shipyard in Italy, together with two more ships that would not be delivered. According to the Romanian specifications, the four vessels were to be large destroyers armed with three 120 mm guns, four 75 mm guns and five torpedo tubes. However, when Italy joined the war in June 1915, the four ships were requisitioned by the Italian Navy and completed as scout cruisers (esploratori), armed with three 152 mm guns, four 76 mm guns, two machine guns and two twin 457 mm torpedo tubes. Each ship measured 94.7 meters in length, with a beam of 9.5 meters and a draught of 3.6 meters. Power plant consisted of Tosi turbines and five Thornycroft boilers, generating a designed output of 40,000 hp powering two shafts, which gave each warship a designed top speed of 34 knots. However, this actually oscillated between 35 and 38 knots, depending on the vessel. Each ship had a complement of 146, with ranges of 1,700 nautical miles at 15 knots and 380 nautical miles at 34 knots.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 266 Wartime standard displacement amounted to 1,410 tons with a full load displacement of 1,723 tons.M. J. Whitley, Destroyers of World War Two: An International Encyclopedia, Naval Institute Press, 1988, p. 223 After a brief career in the Italian Navy, two of these warships were ultimately received by Romania in 1920, with the names MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti. Despite retaining their cruiser- typical firepower, the two ships were officially rated as destroyers by the Romanian Navy.Revista istoricƒÉ, Volumul 15, Edi»õiile 1‚Äì2, Institutul, 2004, p. 221 (in Romanian) MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti were refitted at the Gala»õi shipyard in Romania in 1925, and sent back to Naples for rearming in 1926.Frederick Thomas Jane, Jane's Fighting Ships, S. Low, Marston, 1962, p. 204 The two rearmed warships are also known as the MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti-class. As of 1939, when the Second World War started, their artillery approached cruiser standards, amounting to nine heavy naval guns (five of 120 mm and four of 76 mm). In addition, they retained their two twin 457 mm torpedo tubes as well as two machine guns, plus the capacity to carry up to 50 mines. They thus became the most heavily-armed warships in the history of the Royal Romanian Navy, apart from the battleship Potemkin, which was de facto under Romanian control for a brief time in July 1905. All these guns increased their standard displacement to 1,460 tons.Brassey's Annual: The Armed Forces Year-book, Praeger Publishers, 1939, p. 276 Three of these heavy guns (one 120 mm and two 76 mm) were removed in order to make room for two 37 mm and four 20 mm anti-aircraft guns plus two depth charge throwers (one of 900 mm and one of 330 mm).Janusz Pieka≈Çkiewicz, Sea War, 1939‚Äì1945, Historical Times, 1987, p. 350–ï. –ï. –®–≤–µ–¥–µ, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç—ã 1939‚Äì1940 –≥–≥., –†–∏–ø–æ–ª –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫, 2013, p. 119 (in Russian) Despite having their heavy armament reduced to destroyer standards, the two warships still presented some cruiser characteristics, such as retaining their torpedo tubes mounted on the broadsides instead of the centerline. Regele Ferdinand class The two destroyers of this class were also built in Italy for the Romanian Navy. They were laid down in 1927, launched in 1928 and commissioned in 1930. The design was based on the British Shakespeare-class destroyer leaders. However, they differed in that the turbines were in echelon layout. The guns were supplied by Bofors and the fire control equipment by Siemens. The Romanians wished to order two more vessels but could not afford to do so due to economic problems.

(registration & fee required) Barbour began his footballing career at Queen of the South Wanderers in 1887. Fans of the club were angry when he left to join Accrington in September 1888, and this led to the club being suspended by the Scottish Football Association for professionalism. Billy Barbour had received groceries in lieu of payment. Billy Barbour, playing at centre‚Äìforward, made his Accrington and League debut on 22 September 1888 at the County Ground, the then home of Derby County. The match ended as a 1‚Äì1 draw. Barbour scored his debut League goal on 29 September 1888 at Victoria Ground, the then home of Stoke. Billy Barbour put Accrington 3‚Äì0 ahead of the home side early in the second‚Äìhalf. Accrington defeated Stoke 4‚Äì2. Barbour appeared in 19 of the 22 League matches played by Accrington in season 1888‚Äì89 scoring 13 League goals. Barbour, playing at centre‚Äìforward (18 appearances), was part of the Accrington forward‚Äìline that scored three‚ÄìLeague‚Äìgoals‚Äìor‚Äìmore on seven separate occasions. Barbour top scored for Accrington in 1888‚Äì89 with 13 goals with eight of those goals coming in just four matches.

Barbour got both Accrington goals in a 2‚Äì2 draw; 10 November 1888 at Trent Bridge, the then home of Notts County. Barbour got two of Accrington' goals in a 3‚Äì3 draw; 1 December 1888 at Thorneyholme Road, with Barbour getting two Accrington goals in a 5‚Äì1 victory over Burnley. Barbour continued to score regularly for Accrington making 34 League appearances and scoring 20 League goals from 1889‚Äì91. He also played in four FA Cup ties and scored two goals in the same period. When he returned to Scotland in 1891 he had made 59 League and Cup appearances and scored 35 goals. In 1891 he returned to Scotland to play for Annan. In 1894 he joined Bury scoring 11 goals in 101 appearances over four seasons (109 appearances when you include the FA Cup). In 1898 he joined Gravesend United, and left to join Millwall Athletic later the same year. He rejoined Gravesend in 1899. Barbour worked as a dock labourer and played for Grays in 1900, which was sadly his last season, as in June 1900 he died suddenly due to failure of the heart caused by chronic alcoholism. ==References== Category:Scottish footballers Category:Accrington F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Sunderland Albion F.C. players Category:Gravesend United F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:1865 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Billy Barbour"},{"id":"56079219","text":"Eliza Adams Lifeboat Memorial The Eliza Adams Lifeboat Memorial is a grade II listed memorial in Wells-next-the-Sea in Norfolk.

Its identity as an impact crater is suspected due to the impact deposits present in the Stac Fada Member 50 km to the west. However, this has been disputed, with other studies suggesting that an impact in The Minch is more likely. ==Description== Relative to the residual gravity field, at the centre it is 23 mGal lower than the surrounding terrain. The gravity anomaly is approximately 40 km across, and somewhat irregularly shaped towards the edges. It is quite similar to that of the Ries impact crater. A detailed analysis of the gravity data found that the anomaly has no central uplift as would be expected of a crater of this size, though it possessed anomalies that was suggested represented a peak ring. The authors proposed that the anomaly was an eroded remnant of a larger (~ 100 km diameter) crater, which would explain the anomalies. The authors also suggested that the impact originally took place further east, but had been moved westward by subsequent tectonic movements. ==Correlation to the Stac Fada Member== It is suspected that the Lairg site is the source of the ejecta deposits in the Stac Fada Member for a number of reasons. The palaeocurrent direction data across the N-S extent of the member changes and always points away from the site of the gravity low. The upper levels of target sediment were unconsolidated sand and basement felsic gneiss, according to the lithic fragments in the member. However a 2019 study disputed this based on the fact that the matrix of the Stac Fada Member had been derived from local Stoer Group sediments and the regional variation in the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, direction of compression and striations from the Stac Fada Member suggested that an impact somewhere in The Minch was more probable. ==References== Category:Geology of Scotland Category:Mesoproterozoic Category:Proterozoic impact craters Category:Sutherland ","title":"Lairg Gravity Low"},{"id":"56079257","text":"Sweet Girl may refer to: ==Film== *Sweet Girl, upcoming American action thriller film directed by Brian Andrew Mendoza *The Sweet Girl (German:Das s√º√üe M√§del) 1926 German silent film directed by Manfred Noa *Sweet Girl, 1953 Cantonese music film starring Yam Kim-fai ==Music== *\\"Sweet Girl\\", song by Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac from The Dance, 1997 *Sweet Girl (EP), by Korean boy group B1A4, 2015 **\\"Sweet Girl\\", the Korean-language title track from the EP, 2015 *\\"Sweet Girl\\", song by Beware of Darkness from Orthodox, 2013 ==Other== *Sweet Girl, horse ridden by Roger Moeremans d'Ema√ºs 1920 *Sweet Girl, horse, winner of the Prix Thomas Bryon 1960 ","title":"Sweet Girl"},{"id":"56079266","text":"The Gereja Santa Perawan Maria Ratu Paroki Blok Q (Indonesian for \\"Church of the Queen Saint Mary the Virgin Parish of Block Q\\"), abbreviated as Gereja SPMR Blok Q,Gereja Santa ‚Äì Gereja SPMR Blok Q (in Indonesian) or also known as the Gereja Santa is a Catholic church in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Planned to be held at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone on 26 August 2018, the race was cancelled due to heavy rain. This is the first cancelled MotoGP race since the cancellation of the MotoGP class race during the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix due to Marco Simoncelli's fatal accident, and also marks for the first time since the 1980 Austrian Grand Prix that racing for all classes was cancelled. ==Qualifying== Qualifying was conducted on 25 August 2018, with Jorge Lorenzo on a Ducati taking the MotoGP pole with a time of 2:10.155. Francesco Bagnaia scored the Moto2 pole at 2:08.153, and Jorge Mart√≠n in a Honda claimed the Moto3 pole at 2:13.292, all with inclement weather involved. ==Track surface issues== On 9 February 2018, Silverstone Circuit announced the track would be repaved in its entirety for the first time since 1996. Shortly after the track was repaved and opened for testing, Cal Crutchlow said the new surface was perfect to Dorna officials. Five months later, during the Formula One round at Silverstone in early July, Lewis Hamilton blasted the repaving as \\"wasted money,\\" calling it the \\"worst job ever,\\" saying the rough surface was worse than the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife. Carlos Sainz, Jr. said the roughness of the surface, especially bumps, were worse after the repaving. Shortly after the cancellation, MotoGP officials blamed the track's newly repaved surface as the problem. Media reports from various motorsport sites noted the problems since the F1 race and the new tarmac was to blame. On 8 May 2019, Silverstone announced as part of extending its MotoGP contract to 2021 that the circuit will be repaved again in June, two months before the MotoGP race. ==Championship standings after the race== MotoGP {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! !

In 1887, she became the first Danish woman to receive a law diploma. From 1894, she assisted her husband, J.P. Kristensen-Randers, in running Ollerup H√∏jskole on the island of Funen. ==Early life and education== Born on 3 November 1864 on the island of Bog√∏, Nanna Berg was the daughter of the politician Chresten Poulsen Berg (1829‚Äì91) and the publisher Maren Bertelsen (1836‚Äì1906). She was brought up in a Grundtvegian milieu, her father being the founder of Bog√∏'s Navigation School. In 1876, she moved with her family to Hiller√∏d where he mother looked after her while her father became involved in publishing and politics. When the family settled in Copenhagen in 1884, she attended N. Zahle's School where she was said to have been extraordinarily hard-working and gifted. ==Career== Berg was the first woman in Denmark to receive a legal qualification from the University of Copenhagen. In 1887, she successfully completed the course introduced under the political reforms to solve the problem of inadequate manning of the lower courts of law. She worked for the established lawyer Svend H√∏gsbro (1855‚Äì1910) who allowed her to represent him in court. Despite his efforts, as a woman she was however not permitted to work in high courts such as √òstre Landsret and H√∏jesteret. This state of affairs continued until 1909 when Henny Magnussen was permitted to follow the full university law course leading to the degree cand.jur. Following in her father's footsteps, Nanna Berg worked for a time as his secretary. She became an active member of the Danish Women's Society, lecturing at various folk high schools and colleges, including the one at Ollerup. There she met J.P. Kristensen-Randers whom she married in 1890. The couple acquired the school in 1894 and expanded it. Kristensen-Randers became the matron for some 150 borders and handled the school accounts. The school became one of the most popular colleges in Denmark. In the mid-1890s, she began to suffer from asthma. Nanna Kristensen- Randers died in Ollerup on 15 April 1908. She is buried in Ollerup Cemetery. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century Danish lawyers Category:20th-century Danish lawyers Category:Danish women lawyers Category:Danish schoolteachers Category:19th-century lawyers Category:19th-century Danish educators Category:20th-century lawyers Category:20th-century women lawyers Category:19th-century women lawyers Category:19th-century women educators ","title":"Nanna Kristensen-Randers"},{"id":"56079545","text":"The 2018 San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was the thirteenth round of the 2018 MotoGP season.

The series premiered on ABS-CBN's Primetime Bida evening block and worldwide on The Filipino Channel from February 12, 2018 to August 17, 2018, replacing Wildflower. ==Plot== This fictional story follows the lives of triplets, separated as infants, and the complex events that bring them together. The main story line revolves around Erika Castillo, an exotic dancer in a club in Davao City. Her work as an entertainer helps provide for her son's medical bills, but her job exposes her to the seedy darkness and dangers of the business, and that is what happened one evening when she witnesses a waitress murder a syndicate member in the club's private dancing room. The killer, known only as Ana Cruz quickly disappears and the syndicate is eager to retrieve a ledger they think Erika took. They send assassins to silence her. With her life and her son's safety at risk, Erika leaves him with her friend Bruce (Ogie Diaz) and escapes to Manila. With the help of her best friend Tonio (Ejay Falcon), she searches for ‚ÄúAna‚Äù and the ledger. The assassins catch up with her in Manila, but she manages to escape and Fate hurls another woman along their path. The woman, Carrie Almeda, is a dead ringer for Erica, and the killers mistake her for Erika. They shoot and abduct her. Meanwhile, Erika finds herself assuming her double's identity, hiding under the safety net of Carrie Almeda's world for a brief time. 27 years ago, a childless couple, Debbie and Norman Almeda (Dina Bonnevie and Jestoni Alarcon) hire Adele (Cherry Pie Picache), their housekeeper, to serve as surrogate mother to carry their fertilized eggs in her womb. What originally started as a Surrogacy Agreement between Adele and the couple falls through when Adele suffers a miscarriage. With no viable fertilized eggs left for another In vitro fertilisation and desperate for a child, Norman seduces Adele and gets her pregnant again. They continue the surrogacy charade, with Debbie none the wiser, but Adele changes her mind shortly before she delivers and escapes from the Almedas. Unaware that Adele gives birth to triplets, Norman hires men to get their child back as he undertakes a search himself. Norman tracks Adele in Davao City and takes the infant Agnes away from her arms. By a cruel twist of fate, Almeda's men snatch the other infant, Almira, from Adele's mother at the wet market nearby. Norman assumes his men made a mistake and notifies them that he already has the infant, so the kidnappers leave Almira in an empty carton in a garbage dump. For the next 26 years the triplets Almira, Agnes and Agatha (all played by Erich Gonzales) live separate lives with no idea about each other. Agnes is renamed Carrie, and raised by the wealthy Almedas in Santa Rosa, Laguna and grows up in affluence. She is a sophisticated, highly educated and accomplished professional with a medical degree in obstetrics and gynecology from Sweden. On the other hand, Almira's life is diametrically different because the infant is abandoned in the streets, is fostered by a Tanod (a Barangay or Barrio Police Enforcer) in Davao City and grows up in extreme poverty. Almira is renamed Erika, simple and kind, but having not gone past high school, is not able to get out of the poverty she grew up in. To augment her income to meet her son's medical needs, she works as a stripper and lives in the seedy world of criminals. On the opposite side of their family spectrum, the third infant grows up as lost as her other siblings. While many would invariably assume that Agatha, the only infant left with Adele, was the most fortunate of the triplet, the truth is far from everyone's assumptions. After the kidnapping, Adele moves to Benguet with her mother and the remaining baby. Although Agatha is raised be her grandmother in middle class comfort, she resents her absent mother, who works as an OFW in Dubai for the past 26 years. Agatha grows up never lacking for material needs. She is private school educated, but she was constantly bullied by her upper class, rich classmates who looked down at her and her mother's job as a maid. The bullying drives her sociopathic personality to achieve a much higher status in life. Her anger increases when she meets her sisters, living in the upper echelon of society, a status she feels she was deprived. In contrast to her two sisters, Agatha is narcissistic, mean spirited, entitled, and takes her comfortable life in Baguio for granted and desires to escape to Manila for a more glamorous, upscale life. Back in the Bermudez- Almeda mansion in Santa Rosa, Erika ends the charade when she learns that Carrie is getting married in two weeks to Dr. Samuel Hechanova, and that Carrie is an obstetrician for the Bermudez Medical Center, a large Medical and Infertility facility owned by her family. The idea that she can pretend to be an Obstetrician and gynecologist appalls her. The siblings' lives collide when Erika leaves the safety of Carrie's life and runs away. That same night, in a heavily guarded location in Tanay, Rizal, Carrie wakes up from a coma and using her skills as a physician, sutures her gunshot wound and escapes her captors. Fate brings the sisters together and Carrie utilizes their medical facility to determine if they are related. A DNA test using a blood sample from Erika's scarf confirms they are twins. The twins return to their respective families, agreeing to keep their relationship secret while Carrie figures out the truth. Using Carrie's private condo as their meeting place, they spend time getting acquainted and discover that despite their contrasting lives, they both share an unexplained sadness and emptiness. Erika points out Carrie's controlling mother and cold grandmother pales in comparison to Erika's life in the streets, a baby left in the dump without any birth certificate as she passed through the hands of several foster parents. Meanwhile, Erika's search for Anna Cruz leads to the morgue and a dead end, and the syndicate focuses on Erika. Carrie, on the other hand, seeks answers from her mother who finally admits to the surrogacy but knows nothing about a Multiple birth. Carrie reveals Erika's existence to the Almedas, who are shocked but overjoyed that they have twins. Learning that Erika's life is in danger, she moves into the Almeda mansion with her son Jolo and friend Bruce. But life in a significantly more comfortable surrounding is not as easy as she expected. Grandmother Rosemarie and cousin Andrea are suspicious of her. Unknown to Deborah and Norman, in a secluded estate in Batangas owned by Deborah's family, exists a sinister secret, a luxurious facility covering for a baby farm called Paraiso. The farm's secret operations is run by Dr. Rosemarie Bermudez and the Solomon syndicate, the same syndicate looking for Erika and the ledger that would threaten to blow up their entire operations. Paraiso hides beneath their fertility centre, which when discovered, will complicate and imperil the triplets' lives. While the twins are curious to meet the woman who carried them, that project takes a back seat to Norman's and Deborah's desire for Erika's immediate integration into the Bermudez- Almeda family, legally adopting Erika and her son Jolo. It is at this time that Fate hurls yet another thunderbolt. The twins discover they have a third sibling. Adele's world in Baguio shatters when Agatha discovers she is one of triplet siblings. Angry at her mother for keeping this information from her, Agatha escapes to Manila and finds her lost siblings but their reunion is far from happy. Despite being welcomed into the Almeda family, Agatha is not content. She desires to own their wealthy life, a lifestyle she feels robbed of, a life she feels entitled to. Agatha's sociopathic personality turns her against the people who love her, as she undermines her siblings and sets out to take the Almedas' and Bermudez' fortune and destroy them completely. The Bermudez-Almeda family relationships disintegrate as Agatha stirs up conflict and division, when she teams up with Rocco, Fabian's bastard. They successfully expose the Solomon syndicate and shut down Paraiso. The exposure and capture of the Solomons exposes Rosemarie's connection with their illegal activities, effectively stripping her of her medical license, and her status in the medical industry. While Rosemarie loses her medical license and the Solomons are in prison serving time, Agatha and Rocco take over the syndicate's leadership. The lucrative baby farming is replaced with Child trafficking for Organ harvesting, selling children as organ donors. They recruit an unlikely ally, Dr. Rosemarie Bermudez, who is eager to get her hands on the fortune she lost. With the growing demand for organ harvesting, the pair use Rosemarie's doctor skills to medically screen the captive children and provide certification of their viable human organs for their international clientele. Jolo, Erika's son, is kidnapped by Rocco's syndicate and then later sold to a foreigner organ buyer for his dying son. The transaction and exchange was successful and Jolo woild have been lost forever. But Erika does not give up. She fights the organ buyer with all her ferocity, uses all her street smarts, finds him, and rescues him from the syndicate. While Jolo recovers from the trauma of his kidnapping, Erika and her family recognize the significance of Jolo's testimony. She agrees for him to becomes a material witness against the syndicate. Erika is able to piece together the information she has gathered and connects the dots to Rocco and Agatha. Rocco convinces Agatha to assassinate her Sister and nephew, but she loses her nerve. Rocco attempts to do it himself but shoots Carrie instead as she spots him in the window, taking the bullet meant for her sister as she tries to warn and block Carrie. While Carrie fights for her life, Agatha is conflicted after seeing Carrie in the hospital and overhears Rocco tell Sahara he is merely playing Agatha. In retaliation, Agatha steals all their money. Meanwhile, Jolo's testimony on the woman doctor who tends to the kidnapped children and a girl with a tattoo on her ankle leads Authorities to Dr. Rosemarie and Agatha, and both are captured and incarcerated. He also positively identifies Rocco, who is fighting another war with the escaped convicts Solomons. All are bent on their revenges against one another, and after the money Agatha hid. They capture Agatha and torture her. Soon after Carrie wakes up from her coma and reveals a masked man attempted to shoot Erika. Greg Solomon decides to go abroad with Ginny to keep her away from danger, leaving Fabian with his bastard son, Rocco. Samuel finds and confronts Fabian about his father's death and attempts to shoot him but did not have the stomach to kill. However, he tricked Patron into admitting the truth about Manuel's death, secretly videotaped their conversation. As he escapes with Erika, he, along with Agatha are seriously wounded. During the violent shootout, Erica runs over Sahara and kills her. Rocco mourns his sister's death. Worrying about Agatha's survival under Rocco's hands, Adele finds the money Agatha hid and arranges for an exchange. Adele brings a portion of the money and offers herself as hostage for Agatha's release. Agatha has to retrieve the rest of the money to save her mother. Meanwhile, as Samuel lays dying in the hospital, Erika accepts his proposal to marry him. He passes away shortly. Erika, Vida and Tessa mourn his untimely death. On the other hand, Agatha asks help from Dante (Thou Reyes) to sneak into their house to get the remaining money. The three sisters are finally reunited and on the same team. Agatha is touched by the concern and love everyone has towards her as they raised money to meet Rocco's ransom demand, and realizes how much they loved her despite her mistakes. This was the key that turned her around. Determined to return to Rocco to retrieve her mother who was left hostage in her place, the three sisters plan to work together. They all dress in Agatha's persona to intentionally confuse Rocco and his father and discover both were bent on taking the money and run alone. The two men shoot each other during the crossfire. Rocco survives, but his half brother Greg arrives in time to see Rocco mourning his father, and the two half brothers get into a fight, and Rocco kills him. After a metal beam collapses on him, Rocco is apprehended. In the finale, the triplets celebrate their birthday in Agatha and Rosemarie's prison cell, with Adele, Debbie, Norman, Tonyo, and Agatha's friends. Tonyo and Carrie also announce their engagement. ==Cast and characters== In The Blood Sisters, the story revolves around nine characters who appear in almost every scene.

However, the production unit decided to go with entertainment head Deo Endrinal's idea of recreating the 1999 hit TV series, and rehashing the subplot of Saan Ka Man Naroroon where Claudine Barretto played triplets with distinct contrasting characteristics. As a result of the concept's drastic change, Erich Gonzales was retained to play the role of the triplets while Louise delos Reyes joined Asintado. The first teaser, launched in December 2017, caught the attention of the public due to the obvious similarity with Claudine's previous show, including casting Cherry Pie Picache, who in both series played the biological mother of the triplets. Jojo Saguin, the director of the series, clarified that while the inspiration of the show is similar, the series will have an additional twist: tackle the issue of surrogacy. ==See also== *List of ABS-CBN drama series *List of programs aired by Jeepney TV ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Philippine telenovelas Category:ABS-CBN drama series Category:Philippine action television series Category:Philippine crime television series Category:Television series by Dreamscape Entertainment Television Category:ABS-CBN television drama filmed in high definition Category:2018 Philippine television series debuts Category:2018 Philippine television series endings Category:Espionage television series Category:Television series about revenge Category:Filipino-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Manila Category:Television shows set in Baguio Category:Television shows set in Davao City Category:Television series about organized crime Category:Works about organized crime in the Philippines ","title":"The Blood Sisters (TV series)"},{"id":"56079571","text":"The 2018 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix was the eighteenth round of the 2018 MotoGP season.

It was held at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia on 18 November 2018. In the Moto3 race, Red Bull KTM Ajo wildcard Can √ñnc√º made history by winning on his debut, becoming the youngest ever Grand Prix winner at the age of 15 years, 115 days. In the MotoGP class, no Yamaha or Honda rider finished on the podium for the first time since the 2007 San Marino Grand Prix. In the Moto2 class, this was the final race for the Honda CBR600RR inline-4 engine package and also the final race for the Tech 3 Mistral 610 and Suter MMX2 chassis packages that d√©buted at the 2010 Qatar Grand Prix, since a new 765cc (46.7 cu in) inline-3 engine supplied by Triumph Motorcycles was introduced and Tech 3 and Forward Racing switched manufacturers to KTM and MV Agusta respectively in 2019. ==Classification== MotoGP The race, scheduled to be run for 27 laps, was red-flagged after 13 full laps, as heavy rain had caused multiple riders to crash and racing conditions were deemed too dangerous.

He is most noted for his service during the training of Marine units during World War II. He finished his career as commanding general of Troop Training Unit, Amphibious Training Command, Pacific Fleet. ==Early years== Harry K. Pickett was born on January 9, 1888, in Ridgeway, a town in South Carolina, the son of James Cason and Wilhelmina (Heins) Pickett. Following high school, Pickett enrolled in The Citadel in Charleston. While there, he served as first drum major of the Regimental Band, when it was organized in 1909. Pickett graduated in 1911 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on March 15, 1912. Pickett's first assignment was at Marine Officers' School at Norfolk Navy Yard, in Virginia, where he underwent officer training. Upon graduation in June 1914, Pickett was attached to the 4th Marine Regiment and sailed to the Naval Station in Guam. Before his regiment sailed to the Pacific, it took part in the Veracruz Expedition during the summer of 1914. Pickett served in Guam until August 1917, during which time he reached the rank of captain. He also witnessed the surrender and subsequent scuttling of German Merchant raider in April 1917, when United States declared war on Germany. Upon his return to the United States, Pickett served for a brief period at the Marine barracks at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton in Washington. He was transferred to the Marine Barracks at Quantico in Virginia in January 1918 and attached to the newly activated 11th Marine Regiment. Pickett served as commanding officer of a company in the regiment's 1st Battalion. Following a temporary promotion to the rank of major on July 1, 1918, he then assumed command of 1st Battalion. Pickett's regiment was attached to the 5th Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Eli K. Cole and ordered to France in October 1918. Picket and his unit arrived too late to see combat in World War I and spent the rest of the war in the towns of Issoudun and Montierchaume. After several months of occupation duty, Pickett returned to the United States in August 1919. The 11th Marines were deactivated after arrival at Naval Station Norfolk and Pickett reverted to his substantive rank of captain. He was then transferred to the Marine barracks at Charleston Navy Yard, before he was ordered for recruiting duty in Memphis in September 1920. Pickett was posted to the 4th Marine Regiment in October 1921 which then sailed with 2nd Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Charles G. Long, to Santo Domingo. His regiment was tasked with the support of military government and suppression of bandits under Desiderio Arias. Returning to the United States in June 1922, Pickett attended a field officers' course at the Marine Corps Schools in Quantico and then attached to Marine Corps headquarters. He was promoted to major on July 28, 1925, and assigned for duty with the Quartermaster Department under Brigadier General Charles L. McCawley. From June 1928, Pickett was attached to the 1st Marine Brigade and sent to Haiti. He took part in jungle patrols against Cacos bandits and also served as an instructor with the Garde d'Ha√Øti. He returned to the United States in January 1930 and served at Marine Corps headquarters until July 1935 during which time he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, on May 29, 1934. He then served at Marine Corps installations at Quantico and San Diego and completed a course at Army Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe in Virginia. Picket was promoted to the rank of colonel on June 28, 1938. ==World War II== Because of the increasing danger of Japanese expansion in Pacific during 1939, the United States Congress established a special board under Admiral Arthur J. Hepburn. This board was tasked with the investigation of need for additional naval bases in Pacific. Hepburn and his board emphasized the importance of Midway Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra Atoll. Pickett, who was the Senior Marine Officer of the 14th Naval District at the time, was tasked with the survey of all four atolls. In May 1940, Pickett supervised the deployment of the 3rd Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Pepper on Hawaii and ordered one of his 3-inch anti-aircraft artillery detachments to defend Midway Atoll. In March 1941, the 1st Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Bertram A. Bone also arrived on Hawaii and Pickett ordered immediately some of his detachments to the defensive positions on Palmyra and Johnston Atoll. In August of that year, he also ordered another defense detachment to Wake. These battalions consisted of the batteries with 5\\"/51 caliber guns, searchlight and aircraft sound locator and antiaircraft groups with M2 Browning and M1917 Browning machine guns and were ideal for the defense of the islands from attack from the sea and air. In addition to his duties as Marine Officer of the 14th Naval District, Pickett commanded the 3rd Defense Battalion from the end of August 1940 to the beginning of February 1941, when he handed over the command back to Pepper. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Pickett was the senior officer present at the harbor and was tasked with the coordination of the marine units. He was later commended by Admiral Claude C. Bloch, commander of the 14th Naval District, for his efforts during the attack. Pickett later received the Legion of Merit for his service in connection with the preparation of defenses on Hawaii and other islands. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in January 1942. Pickett was succeeded by Brigadier General LeRoy P. Hunt on May 19, 1943, and ordered stateside. After a brief period of leave at home, Pickett was ordered to Camp Elliott near San Diego and was tasked with the organization of the Troop Training Unit, Amphibious Training Command, Pacific Fleet at Coronado. This unit, under his command, was later responsible for the amphibious training of several marine units, including the 5th Marine Division. Pickett also coordinated the amphibious training for the United States Army's 81st Infantry Division. He was later commended for his service at Coronado by Admiral Richmond K. Turner, the commander of Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet and also by Major General Paul J. Mueller, commander of the 81st Division. On the basis of these commendations, he was decorated with his second Legion of Merit. ==Retirement== Following the end of the war, Pickett remained in command of the Troop training Unit at Coronado until July 1946, when he was succeeded again by Major General LeRoy Hunt. Pickett then retired from the Marine Corps after 33 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of major general for having been specially commended for performance of duty in actual combat. He was also appointed Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his service in the Pacific and at Coronado. Pickett died suddenly of heart failure on March 19, 1965, in Darjeeling, India, while on a round-the-world trip. He was survived by his wife, Mildred, and a son and daughter. The Major General Harry K. Pickett Memorial Scholarship at his alma mater is dedicated to his honor. The scholarship is awarded to young men of character, who are residents of the state of South Carolina or sons of United States Marines. ==Decorations== Here is the ribbon bar of Major General Harry K.

The only remaining visible structure standing is the chimney of the mill (known as the Port Hope Chimney), and the site is now used as part of the Stafford County Park. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. ==History== The first saw mill constructed at this site was built in 1858 for lumberman William R. Stafford. The mill had a stone chimney built by mason John Geitz. The original 1858 mill, along with the associated docks and the houses of hundreds of workers, was destroyed by fire in 1871. The mill was rebuilt in 1872, but destroyed by fire a second time in 1881. The mill was rebuilt again, and remained in use until probably the early 1890s. The 1858 chimney was used by all three mills. The mill and associated buildings sat unused for decades. The dock into the lake was destroyed in a 1913 storm, and the last building was removed in 1941 by a local farmer, who converted it into a farm shed. Commonwealth Associates, Inc. of Jackson, Michigan performed a limited archaeological investigation of a part of the site in 1978 in connection with proposed improvements of the Stafford County Park, but a more complete study of the site has not been done. ==Description== The saw mill site is now part of a county park and includes parking, lawn, and beach areas. The site covers the area of the former 1858 saw mill, accompanying grounds, and the covered over or submerged remnants of the Stafford dock that once extended 1,000 feet into the lake. The dock was made of timber cribs filled with stone. The last visible remnant of the mill is the 1858 chimney. The chimney stands just above the beach, and measures nine by ten feet along the ground, rising approximately 80 feet. The lower section of twenty feet is constructed of sandstone, and contains an open hearth on one side. The upper section of about 60 feet is constructed of red brick, and gradually tapers toward the top. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Stafford County Park Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1858 ","title":"W.

He held several political positions including serving as general secretary of the New Patriotic Party. He was serving as the Chief Executive Officer of Forestry Commission of Ghana before his demise. ==Early life and education== Kojo Afriyie was born in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. He attended Seventh Day Adventist Secondary School in Bekwai from where he obtained his GCE Ordinary level certificate. He proceeded to obtain his GCE Advanced level certificate from Konongo Odumase Secondary School in Konongo. He was admitted to study political science at the University of Ghana. He then enrolled at the Ghana School of Law where he graduated with Bachelor of Laws. After this he was admitted as a solicitor and counsel for the Supreme Court of Ghana. ==Career== Legal career Afriyie entered into private law practice in 1981. During the John Agyekum Kufour administration, he was appointed head of legal services at the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. He was later made to act as the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the corporation. Political career While managing his firm, Afriyie was also actively engaged in Ghanaian politics. He served as the general secretary of the New Patriotic Party from 2010 to 2014. He lost his bid to secure a second term to Kwabena Agyapong. In May 2017, while serving as the CEO of the Forestry Commission, he publicly declared that he would contest the New Patriotic Party's general secretary elections if there was an overwhelming call for him to do so.  CEO of Forestry Commission  In March 2017, President Nana Akuffo-Addo appointed Afriyie as CEO of the Forestry Commission. He replaced Samuel Afari Dartey, whose term as the CEO had ended. His appointment was surprising to many Ghanaians because of many rumours that he was linked to the position of head of the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority. That position was given to Paul Asare Ansah. Afriyie later revealed that the rumours were true but he had rejected the appointment due to his fear of the sea. He thanked the president for the Forestry Commission appointment and believed that since he hailed from the forest zone of Ghana, he would be able to have a greater impact in that area. As CEO of the Forestry Commission, Afriyie's job was to oversee the various public agencies that form the divisions of the Commission. His first assignment as head of the commission was to supervise the celebration of World Forest Day which fell on 21 March 2017. == Contempt case == In July 2013, Afriyie was summoned to the Supreme Court of Ghana because he had made some potentially contemptuous comments. He had criticised the Court for its actions in a criminal contempt case involving Sammy Awuku of the New Patriotic Party, and had implied that the justices' continuous mention of public radio discussions on cases that were before the court was a ploy by the court to curtail people from expressing themselves. Upon appearing before the court, his counsel, Ayikoi Otoo, pleaded with the court to be lenient and declared that his client had pleaded guilty to the charge. According to Ayikoi Otoo, \\"... some power for which no one had control over, entered Owusu Afriyie, because as a lawyer, he ought to have known the law\\". The Peace Council also offered a plea on Afriyie's behalf to the court. After a brief trial, Afriyie was fined 5000 cedis or, if he defaulted on payment, a six- month prison term. Afriyie was made to sign a bond of good behaviour as well as retracting and offering an apology to the bench within 24 hours on the same platform he had used to criticise the court. == Death == Afriyie died on July 1, 2020 in Accra after testing positive for COVID-19.

The area was developed beginning in 1909, and most of its homes were built by a single construction firm, creating a neighborhood appearance unified by style, scale, and setting, using the principles of the then- fashionable City Beautiful movement. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==Description and history== The area where West Boulevard is located in Hartford's southwest was in the late 19th century the country estate of Horace Fox, the owner of a local lumber company. It was one of the West End's last areas of open space. Fox began considering plans for development of the land as early as 1896, when period maps show proposed routes for West Boulevard. In line with the ideas of the City Beautiful movement, Fox envisioned a broad parkway extending from Prospect Avenue in the west to Forest Street in the east. Of this vision, only the western portion was actually implemented. West Boulevard was laid out from Prospect to South Whitney Street as a four-lane boulevard with a broad central median, with shade trees planted in the median and on the flanking sides. Fox sold off house lots in the 1910s and 1920s, mainly to developers, who then built houses and sold them to generally upwardly mobile residents. The historic district encompasses those blocks of West Boulevard, as well as about 1/2 block north of West Boulevard on Rodney Street, which was also built out at the same time. The houses are generally unified by their scale and setback from the road, and by their wood frame construction. Stylistically they are also quite similar, with most built in the then-fashionable Colonial Revival style. Most of them were built by the development firm of Freeburg, Erickson, and Felth, and have no architect credited in city records. Andrew Freeburg, one of the principals in the firm, lived and had his principal place of business at West Boulevard and South Whitney Street. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1909 ","title":"West Boulevard Historic District"},{"id":"56079840","text":"The 1994‚Äì95 Botola is the 39th season of the Moroccan Premier League.

A political conservative, he also held several senior government positions in Schleswig-Holstein. == Life ==  Provenance and early years  Scheele was born in Itzehoe, at that time in Holstein. His father was a customs officer who rose to become a Lieutenant Colonel, Benedict \\"Bendix\\" Ferdinand von Scheel (1749‚Äì1827). An uncle was Lieutenant General Heinrich Otto von Scheel (1745‚Äì1808). After several years at school in Hamburg he enrolled as a student at Kiel in 1816, emerging in 1821 with a Gl√ºckstadt law degree. In 1822 he took an internship in government service, by 1824 employed as a trainee. In 1827 he was sent as a regional administrator to H√ºtten, promoted in 1831. Meanwhile, in 1829 he became a chamberlain and in 1845 a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog, having won the favour of King Christian VIII as an evidently loyal government official opposed to separatist tendencies in Schleswig-Holstein. Price Frederick, the king's cousin, had been removed from his governorship of Schleswig-Holstein as an consequence of his active separatist involvement, and von Scheele was installed as regional head of government. In 1847 he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog. However, his approach made him unpopular, notably with ethnic Germans who made up the majority population in much of the region, and in March 1848 he had to flee in the face of the uprising that became the First Schleswig War. He was able to make his way through to Copenhagen where the new king, Frederick VII, who was already a personal friend, made him a privy counsellor. During 1850/51 he published a book under the title \\"Fragmente in zwanglosen Heften\\", advocating a modern constitution for Denmark and backing \\"civil liberties\\" (\\"kommunalfrihed\\"). In July 1850 was invited by Prime Minister Fritz Tillisch to take on administration of a region of Schleswig- Holstein embracing Gottorp, Husum and H√ºtten, which at that time were occupied by Danish troops, but after careful consideration von Scheele rejected the offer. Despite his conservative anti-separatist record he was highly critical of the language reform proposals of Fritz Tillisch, calling for equal treatment of German and Danish in linguistically mixed districts. In 1852 Scheele was appointed regional governor (\\"Landdrost\\") for Pinneberg, and the next year royal commissioner to the Holstein parliament, strongly opposing Schleswig-Holstein separatism.  National politics  In 1852 the king admitted von Scheele to the Order of the Elephant, Denmark's highest public honour. Through his close personal relationship with the king von Scheele played an important part in bringing about the fall of the √òrsted government in December 1854. The period was one of heightened political turmoil, driven by tensions between ethnic Germans and ethnic Danes at a time of growing nationalist awareness. During 1853 the √òrsted-Bluhme government found itself entering into a state of confrontation with the parliament (\\"Rigsdagen\\") after the leadership appeared minded to reduce the authority of the parliament and accord to the king the power to agree and issue the constitution which was needed to satisfy the aspirations that had been crystallised across Europe in 1848 and to deal with the peculiarly Danish issue of the seemingly irreconcilable political status of the bilingual and bicultural Schleswig- Holstein region in the south of the country. For leading liberals such as A. F. Tscherning and C. C. Hall, von Scheele now emerged as a pivotal figure, combining well known conservative instincts with an element of pragmatism with regard to constitutional matters that was not on display from the government. Unusually among the leading politicians, Scheele was also a close friend both of the king and of Countess Danner, the king's \\"morganatic\\" wife. The government issued the constitution on 26 July 1854 without sufficient consultation which unleashed a storm of protest from national liberal and democratic elements. The king was himself uneasy over the inflexibility demonstrated by the √òrsted government, and during a visit to Schleswig and Holstein in October 1854 the king and Scheele agreed to move against the √òrsted government. Scheele had already visited Berlin to discuss the matter with the Prussian Foreign Minister, Otto Theodor von Manteuffel, and received the clear message that the Prussian government wished for a swift resolution of the gathering constitutional crisis in southern Denmark. (Berlin had a clear interest in the matter especially since, unlike the rest of Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein had been part of the Holy Roman Empire before 1806.) It was not just the king who was uneasy about the government's behaviour and √òrsted was forced to resign the premiership at the end of 1854. The king now invited Scheele to form a new government. There followed a complex set of negotiations among the leading politicians and in the end Scheele concluded that he would not be able to lead the new government which instead emerged under the leadership of Peter Georg Bang. There was no party structure in the twentieth century sense, but it is reasonable to view the Bang government as a coalition between moderate liberals and pragmatic conservatives. Early in 1855 Scheele endorsed the implementation of the new constitution and joined the Bang government as minister for Holstein and secretary of state for foreign affairs. The government contained some disparate elements. Bang was not a \\"natural politician\\" and Scheele himself frequently lacked the patience normally associated with successful negotiation, but to some extent he made up for that with his mastery of detail and persuasive personality in the Rigsdagen, and the constitution finally became effective on 2 October 1855. Scheele received congratulations from the governments in Berlin and Vienna. As Minister for Holstein Scheele now increasingly ran into opposition from the powerful land-owner class, however, with his proposals to reduce their tax privileges and abolish their privileged status before the courts. There were also increasingly fevered arguments over sustaining currency harmonisation with the German confederation. Although he successfully fought off serious legal challenges in the courts, discontent over the constitution returned to the political agenda, and by the time the Bang government fell in February 1857, it appears that von Scheele's political capital was for most purposes exhausted. In February 1857 von Scheele caused a stir by sending a letter to various foreign governments in which he dismissed the ideas for a \\"Nordic union\\" (which were then being floated by the Swedes) as a completely impractical \\"poetic idyll\\" (\\"poetisk id√©\\"). Oscar I, the Swedish king, was moved to withdraw his offer of a \\"defence union\\", which was in any case problematic because it would have excluded Holstein, which was subject to additional risks and pressures. ==References== Category:People from Itzehoe Category:Danish knights Category:Danish civil servants Category:Foreign ministers of Denmark Category:Government ministers of Denmark Category:19th- century Danish people Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:1796 births Category:1874 deaths ","title":"Ludvig Nicolaus von Scheele"},{"id":"56079853","text":"Iris Adami Corradetti Iris Adami Corradetti (March 19, 1904 ‚Äì June 26, 1998) was an Italian opera soprano, and latterly a singing teacher. ==Biography== Adami Corradetti was born in Milan in 1904. Her father, , was a noted baritone singer at La Scala and other European venues, and a music critic. Her mother was Bice Adami, a soprano singer. Her younger half sister, Fiora Contino, became a conductor and music teacher. A soprano singer, Corradetti studied piano and taught herself singing. She debuted in 1926 at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan, playing the part of Coralit√† in the opera Anima Allegra by Franco Vittadini. In 1928, she was the protagonist at La Scala in Milan, playing Rosalina in Sly by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. In the same season she sang her first Mozart part, that of Barbarina in The Marriage of Figaro. Corradetti had a vast repertoire that included eighty works, of which thirty-five were first performances of a piece, and about a hundred roles, mostly by composers of early Romanticism, such as Mozart and Cimarosa, as well as Verdi, Puccini, and Mascagni. She also performed works by contemporary composers such as Alberto Franchetti, Giuseppe Mul√® and Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. The parts that were most noted in her career were those of Francesca, in Francesca da Rimini by Riccardo Zandonai and the Madama Butterfly by Puccini. In the 1930s, she recorded of some works for Italian radio. Corradetti officially retired from performing on January 28, 1946, during a Martini & Rossi concert; although on March 18, 1957, invited to a concert, she gave a final farewell to her career. After her retirement, Corradetti dedicated herself to teaching singing, initially in the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia in Venice, and latterly in Padua. Among her most famous students were Katia Ricciarelli, Mara Zampieri, Lucia Valentini Terrani, and Wladimiro Ganzarolli.

The election featured two major changes since the 2014 election: the return to a single national constituency and the increase in the number of French seats from 74 to 79 upon the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Officially, 79 MEPs were considered to have been elected, including five \\"virtual\\" MEPs who did not take their seats until the UK formally left the EU. The election featured 34 separate electoral lists, a record number at the national level. It was the first national election in France since the election of Emmanuel Macron as president and therefore his first major electoral test, taking place amid dismal approval ratings. For his party, Nathalie Loiseau led the Renaissance list of La R√©publique En Marche!, Democratic Movement (MoDem), Agir, and the Radical Movement which ultimately arrived in second with 22.42% of the vote, behind the National Rally (RN) list led by the 23-year-old Jordan Bardella which received 23.34% of the vote, with a lower vote percentage but more overall votes than its 2014 result. Turnout, at just over 50%, was the highest since the 1994 elections. Led by Yannick Jadot, Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV) managed a surprise third-place finish with 13.48% of the vote, short of its score in the 2009 elections in which it also achieved a surprise result. At the same time, the list of The Republicans (LR) led by the 33-year-old Catholic philosopher Fran√ßois-Xavier Bellamy ended up with a historically poor result of just 8.48% of the vote and the loss of 12 MEPs despite expectations of a strong electoral dynamic created by Bellamy's selection as the party's lead candidate. Similarly, the results were also a significant disappointment for Jean-Luc M√©lenchon's La France Insoumise, which fell far short of both its presidential and legislative results in 2017 with only 6.31% of the vote, narrowly ahead of the joint list between the Socialist Party (PS), Place Publique, and New Deal led by Rapha√´l Glucksmann (the first time in its history the PS did not lead an autonomous list), which managed to remain in the European Parliament with its score of 6.19% of the vote, slightly above the 5% threshold needed for seats. Numerous other lists fell short of the 5% threshold, including Nicolas Dupont-Aignan's Debout la France (DLF) and Beno√Æt Hamon's G√©n√©ration.s, the scores of which (both slightly above 3%) nevertheless allow their campaign expenses to be compensated by the state. The two were closely followed by the centre-right Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) led by Jean-Christophe Lagarde and the French Communist Party (PCF) led by Ian Brossat. The recently founded Animalist Party, an animal rights party, also created a small surprise with its score of 2.16%, comparable to some of the more prominent lists, despite its limited presence in the campaign. The only two notable pro-Frexit parties received 1.82% of the vote combined. Other lists included Urgence √âcologie, consisting of several small green parties, led by Dominique Bourg (garnering 1.82% of the vote); Lutte Ouvri√®re with 0.78% of the vote; and a list of gilets jaunes which collected 0.54% of the vote. == Background ==  Electoral system  European Parliament constituencies of France in the 2014 election Starting from the 2004 elections, France was divided into eight large regional electoral constituencies for the purposes of European Parliament elections with members elected by proportional representation. The electoral system changed ahead of the 2019 election, with broad support in the French political class for a return to a national vote. On 29 November, Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe announced that all parties consulted except for The Republicans supported returning to national lists, and confirmed the intention of the government to prepare a bill to change the voting system to that end, which was officially unveiled on 3 January 2018, preserving the 5% threshold for representation and 3% for reimbursement of campaign expenses. The possibility of transnational lists following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union was also considered. The return to national lists in effect benefits smaller parties which were previously disadvantaged by the system of large regional constituencies, while larger parties would win fewer seats. The bill creating a single national constituency was approved by a vote the National Assembly vote on the first reading on 20 February 2018, and the Senate officially adopted the bill on 23 May 2018, which was promulgated on 25 June after its validation by the Constitutional Council.  Dates  As the European elections are scheduled from 23 to 26 May 2019 and French votes are traditionally held on Sundays, the date of the 2019 European election in France was confirmed to be 26 May 2019. Declarations of lists and candidacies were to be submitted between 23 April and 3 May 2019, while voting in some of the overseas territories and for nationals in the Americas officially took place on 25 May 2019.  Number of seats  On 23 January 2018, the European Parliament Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a proposal to reduce the size of the hemicycle from 751 to 705, splitting 27 former British seats between 14 underrepresented member states of which France was set to gain 5, increasing its representation from 74 to 79. On 7 February, the European Parliament voted 368 to 274 against the principle of reallocating British seats to transnational lists, though the idea's fate was ultimately in the hands of the European Council. After the agreement on 10 April to postpone the British departure from the EU to 31 October, the participation of the United Kingdom in the European Parliament elections will mean that the number of elected MEPs will remain fixed at 74 until the eventual withdrawal of the UK. As a result, legislation to \\"provide for two phrases\\", one with 74 MEPs, and later with 79 in total, was tabled on 24 April; electoral lists will still require 79 candidates, of which 74 will take their seats immediately and the remaining 5 \\"virtual\\" MEPs upon the departure of the UK from the EU.  Broadcast campaign  The length of campaign clips for each list was determined by its declared support among national parliamentarians (senators, deputies, and MEPs), a change largely to the benefit of the governing majority at the expense of opposition parties. From 15 April 2019, the Conseil sup√©rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) ensured that all candidates receive a fair distribution of time in broadcast media, with the exact timing monitored by stations themselves and speaking time relayed every Monday until the elections. The campaign officially commenced on 13 May.  Televised debates  Hamon appealed against his exclusion from the France 2 debate on 4 April on 27 March, questioning the choice not to invite him given the inclusion of other lead candidates; this came after the earlier non-invitation of Brossat and Lagarde. He was joined in his case by Philippot and Asselineau, with the Paris administrative court subsequently ordering France 2 to invite the three to its debate, judging France T√©l√©visions's excuse that Hamon's views were sufficiently represented by the invitation of Glucksmann to have been insufficient. France T√©l√©visions contested this decision, and although the Conseil d'√âtat ultimately ruled that France 2 was not obligated to invite the three, France 2 maintained its invitation out of courtesy. This first debate was watched by only 1.62 million viewers, representing an audience share of 9.8%. On 9 April, just before the debate hosted by RFI and France 24, the RN announced Bardella would not participate in the debate, taking issue with its format and apparent lack of preparedness on the part of the hosts. As M√©lenchon was unable to appear on the CNews debate on 10 April due to a planned campaign meeting, Adrien Quatennens was invited to take his place instead. The decision of to split the debate on 22 May, hosted by France 2 and France Inter, into two separate segments provoked consternation among those invited to the second part, as did the choice not to invite the lead candidates of three of the principal lists (Bellamy, Loiseau, and Bardella) but their party leaders (Wauquiez, Guerini, and Le Pen) instead. On 14 May, Brossat said he would file an appeal with the CSA to intervene in the debate, while Hamon castigated France T√©l√©visions president Delphine Ernotte for the decision, with Lagarde, Dupont-Aignan, and Philippot also denouncing the arrangement. On 15 May, Hamon, Lagarde, and Dupont-Aignan held a joint press conference in front of the France T√©l√©visions headquarters to announce that they would boycott the debate unless its format was modified, and Yahoo! later announced that the three would participate in a debate on its site before the debate that evening, hosted by Cl√©ment Viktorovitch. The LCI debate on 20 May was held in a similar fashion, with the first part dedicated to \\"small\\" lists and the later part of the evening reserved for the \\"main\\" ones. Meanwhile, doubts about her performance meant Loiseau would not appear at the debate hosted by France 2, but rather Bayrou, while some considered inviting Canfin to the LCI debate. On 19 May, both Canfin and Loiseau demanded that the three final debates feature live fact-checking in spite of logistical difficulties.  Other events  On 23 September 2018, the national congress of the Association of Rural Mayors of France (Association des maires ruraux de France, or AMRF) announced that they would refuse to directly transmit the results of the elections to the state on the night of the election to voice their discontent with the lack of attention given by the government to rural policy. The 3 February 2019 edition of Le Journal du Dimanche revealed that Macron was interested in holding a referendum concurrent with the European elections on 26 May to conclude the grand d√©bat national (great national debate) and end the gilets jaunes protests. The opposition, suspicious about the referendum's timing, expressed skepticism, and the idea also lacked support from members of the government. Following the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on 15 April, several parties briefly suspended their campaigns for the European elections. == Outgoing delegation == Distribution of MEPs by European Parliament group as of 3 May 2019 Distribution of MEPs by national party as of 3 May 2019 The table below shows the composition of the delegation of France to the European Parliament as of 3 May 2019. MEPs marked with an asterisk (*) are not standing as candidates; those marked with two asterisks (**) are candidates, but only in a clearly non-electable position near the end of electoral lists. == Electoral lists ==  Summary  The table below is a summary of the main parties contesting the 2019 European elections in France.  Lutte Ouvri√®re  The leadership of the New Anticapitalist Party (NPA) initially voted in favor of a common list with Lutte Ouvri√®re (LO), with its national political council on 6 and 7 October 2018 voting 37‚Äì22 (with 5 abstentions and 10 non-participants) in favor of an alliance in the 2019 European elections; however, in November 2018, the parties acknowledged the failure to arrive to an agreement for a common list. The annual party congress of Lutte Ouvri√®re on 8 and 9 December voted to present an autonomous list, with spokeswoman and former presidential candidate Nathalie Arthaud announcing that she would be its lead candidate. Arthaud said the party refused an alliance with the NPA because the interests of workers were not a priority for the latter, and because she did not want to run a campaign on \\"all the struggles that can be fought, from ecology to feminism\\".  French Communist Party  On 1 December 2017, Pierre Laurent, national secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF), stated that he wanted to gather \\"the strongest possible left group\\" for the 2019 European elections, launching an appeal to Jean-Luc M√©lenchon of La France Insoumise and Beno√Æt Hamon of G√©n√©ration.s. The national council of the PCF on 30 and 31 March approved the principle of a \\"common platform\\" including various left-wing groups as well as members of civil society and intellectuals, postponing discussion of electoral strategy. On 3 June, Ian Brossat, deputy for housing to Socialist mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, was selected as the leader of the PCF list. On 14 June, the PCF again called for a common list of the left in an open letter addressed to parties on the left, excluding the Socialist Party (PS). In December, Fabien Roussel, recently elected leader of the party, indicated that he did not necessarily support a common list given disagreements between left-of-centre parties, and indicated that an alliance with Hamon would only occur if Brossat led the list. On 26 January, the PCF officially unveiled its list, voted on by party members from 31 January to 2 February. It includes two incumbent MEPs (Patrick Le Hyaric and Marie-Pierre Vieu), trade unionist Marie-H√©l√®ne Bourlard in second position (featured in the documentary film Merci patron! by sitting France Insoumise deputy Fran√ßois Ruffin), and is half composed of workers.  La France Insoumise  At the convention of his movement on 25 November 2017, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon announced that La France Insoumise would present a list in 2019, considering the elections a \\"referendum on the European question\\" to \\"break the chains, exit the European budgetary treaties\\". The movement negotiating an alliance with the Spanish party Podemos and the Portuguese Left Bloc in Lisbon on 12 April 2018. At the national level, M√©lenchon continued to refuse any alliance with either Hamon's movement or the French Communist Party (PCF). He announced on 11 March 2018 that he himself would not be a candidate. The movement published an unordered list of candidates on 5 June, with Charlotte Girard and Manuel Bompard guaranteed spots as the presumptive list leaders, in first and second position, respectively, and Younous Omarjee as the sole incumbent MEP. The movement received 637 applications, of which 506 were submitted by men and 131 by women; the electoral committee then ensured the demographic parity of the applicants. The resulting list was then submitted feedback until July, when the list was ranked, with another nine spots on the list reserved for members of civil society and trade unions and associations. On 4 July, following a meeting of the electoral committee on 30 June, the movement published an updated list consisting of 66 candidates, with 13 spots reserved for members of civil society. The list produced by the electoral committee was met with criticism by dissatisfied activists, including Li√™m Hoang-Ngoc of the \\"insubordinate Socialists\\", who \\"suspended\\" his movement's participation; former electoral committee member Lilian Guelfi, who denounced alleged favoritism by Manuel Bompard; and Sarah Soilihi and Fran√ßois Cocq, who withdrew their candidacies following its publication. Djordje Kuzmanovic later quit the movement in November following his removal from the list after sexist remarks. Nevertheless, the consultation of activists from 4 to 20 July resulted in its approval by 86.97% of participants. After Emmanuel Maurel and Marie-No√´lle Lienemann quit the PS in mid-October. the pair formed a new political party close to the Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC), the Republican and Socialist Left (GRS), in early 2019. On 15 October, MRC president Jean-Luc Laurent announced an alliance with Maurel and Lienemann to create a common list with La France Insoumise, with Maurel leaving the social democratic group in the European Parliament. In April 2019, political scientist Thomas Gu√©nol√©, in 14th position, accused La France insoumise of being \\"a dictatorship\\" : the party reacted by saying he was accused of sexual harassment and removed him from the list.url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2019/04/18/thomas-guenole- rompt-violemment-avec-la-france-insoumise-c-est-une- dictature_5451962_823448.html On 15 November, Girard confirmed that she would neither lead the list nor be a candidate in 2019, and appeared to imply that she was sidelined. On 9 December, the movement officially voted to approve its list of 79 candidates and designate Manon Aubry, a 29-year-old tax evasion specialist and spokeswoman at Oxfam France, as its lead candidate. Manuel Bompard, campaign director, was second on the list, followed by Le√Øla Chaibi and outgoing MEP Younous Omarjee. Emmanuel Maurel, who quit the PS for an alliance with the movement, appeared in sixth, with M√©lenchon in the symbolic penultimate position and Girard last. According to Aubry, their list included several active gilets jaunes. As in the 2017 presidential campaign, the movement used holograms to hold virtual meetings in 471 small towns throughout France (via \\"holovans\\"). Unable to secure financing, M√©lenchon called for supporters to participate in a \\"people's loan\\" to fund their campaign, collective 1.5 million euros within five days, and reaching 2 million euros by 10 April, with an average loan of 700 euros.  G√©n√©ration.s  On 21 January 2018, Beno√Æt Hamon announced alongside former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis of DiEM25 that G√©n√©ration.s would contest the 2019 European elections. On 10 March, Hamon called for the creation of the \\"first pan- European transnational list\\" alongside Razem in Poland, The Alternative in Denmark, and LIVRE in Portugal, publishing a common manifesto in June. Hamon sought to invite √âlise Lucet, host of Cash Investigation on France 2, as a lead candidate, but was rebuffed. Audrey Pulvar was also contacted, but indicated that she was not interested, as was the case with Christiane Taubira. The movement communicated with the Greens and PCF, even if the possibility of an alliance between the three was unlikely, and No√´l Mam√®re remained a possible \\"consensus candidate\\" in an alliance with the Greens, given his membership of both formations, but ruled out running on 25 June 2018. On 29 October, the movement launched a call for applications for prospective candidates from civil society, receiving between 300 and 400 applications. In mid-November 2018, incumbent MEP confirmed that he would not seek a second term. In an interview published in Le Monde on 6 December, Hamon confirmed that he would be the lead candidate of a \\"citizen alliance\\", and subsequently closed the door to an alliance with the PS on 7 January 2019, citing its membership of the Party of European Socialists (PES). Le Journal du Dimanche reported that top candidates would also include MEPs and Isabelle Thomas, ex-La France Insoumise member Sarah Soilihi, spokeswoman Aurore Lalucq, and community activist Salah Amokrane. In an interview published in Le Monde in early February, Hamon proposed that the left hold a \\"citizen vote\\" in April to select a common list and program, though only New Deal, (LRDG), and the Movement of Progressives (MdP) were receptive to the idea. Hamon then announced on 23 February that he would lead an independent list, revealing the first thirty candidates on the list on 26 February. Lalucq later quit, announcing on 18 March that she would join Place Publique. The movement indicated it was 600,000 euros short of financing its campaign, and considered soliciting donations via a \\"citizen bank\\".  Socialist Party, Place Publique, and Nouvelle Donne  Early on, a number of PS heavyweights declined to lead the list, including Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, Pierre Moscovici, St√©phane Le Foll, Olivier Faure, Christiane Taubira, Paul Magnette, Fran√ßois Hollande, Bernard Cazeneuve, S√©gol√®ne Royal, Jean-Christophe Cambad√©lis, and Christian Eckert. Julien Dray declared his candidacy, and Emmanuel Maurel was also reportedly approached to lead the list, and did not rule out the possibility at the time. On 8 October, Le Figaro reported that outgoing MEP √âric Andrieu was a candidate to lead the PS list, as was , who announced her candidacy on 11 October. Gabrielle Siry, , and Sylvie Guillaume were also considered potential list leaders. In preparation for the elections, the PS began drafting its platform in May 2018, launching a \\"digital collaborative platform\\", laruchesocialiste.fr, which only elicited 337 responses from 272 people in two months. Disagreements on the left wing of the party on the final form of the program persisted through September, despite commitments to create a left-wing and ecologist \\"intergroup\\" in the European Parliament, halt any new free trade treaties, and vote against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada. The text marked a new approach for the PS, arguing in favor of more social and environmental controls in trade agreements and a revision of the European treaties led by the left. Faure also affirmed that the PS would not support the candidacy of Frans Timmermans as Spitzenkandidat. In an interview with Le Monde published on 12 October, Maurel quit the PS and castigated its failure to represent socialism, soon followed by Marie-No√´lle Lienemann the following day, with the creating a new left-wing party associated with Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC) in 2019, the Republican and Socialist Left (GRS). On 15 December 2018, at the ending of a meeting of the national council of the PS, Faure for the first time proposed that the party participate in a \\"rally\\" of forces on the left. After Royal ruled out standing as a candidate of a common list on 11 January, Faure indicated he would be ready to lead a PS list if necessary. Rapha√´l Glucksmann, who co-founded Place Publique in an effort to unite the left, was offered the position of lead candidate. On 13 February, the national office of the party approved of Faure's plans to seek an alliance with Place Publique, and Glucksmann officially announced his intention to lead a list in the European elections on 15 March, with the national council of the PS voting to designate Glucksmann as lead candidate the following day, with 128 votes in favor, 5 against, and 35 abstensions (including St√©phane Le Foll and Luc Carvounas). The list is composed of half PS candidates and half those of other parties and figures from civil society, marking the first time since 1979 the PS did not lead its own list in the European elections. New Deal officially announced its support for the list on 18 March 2019, as did ex-G√©n√©ration.s spokeswoman Aurore Lalucq. After receiving 215 applications from party officials by 26 October 2018, the PS approved a list of 20 women and 20 men as candidates in the European elections on 27 March 2019, with 23 votes in favor and 11 against; Le Foll, Carvounas, Martine Aubry, and their allies expressed displeasure at the list, as did a number of candidates and outgoing MEPs, who denounced the diluted list (given the number of PS candidates in non-electable positions). After initially coming to an agreement, Virginie Rozi√®re's (LRDG) quit the list on 29 April, following pressure from their former PRG colleagues towards PS not to welcome the LRDG splitters while PRG was itself cancelling its merger into Macron-leaning Radical Movement. On 5 May, Le Parisien reported that Christiane Taubira would back the list, appearing alongside Glucksmann on 15 May.  Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens  On 27 February 2018, MEP Yannick Jadot stated that EELV would seek to present an independent list in 2019. Both Jadot and fellow MEP Mich√®le Rivasi opposed a rapprochement with Hamon like that in the 2017 presidential election. Among outgoing MEPs, Jos√© Bov√©, Eva Joly, and Pascal Durand did not intend to seek a third mandate. Durand, a supporter of Nicolas Hulot, was seen as open to working with La R√©publique En Marche!, as was Karima Delli, despite her denial of any such intentions, and on 13 April, she expressed her desire to lead the EELV list. Durand, on the other hand, ultimately joined the La R√©publique En Marche list. Other candidates reportedly included David Cormand, Julien Bayou, Marie Toussaint, and Mounir Satouri. On 19 December, S√©gol√®ne Royal offered to join the EELV list in second position, but was rejected the following day. Given the difficulty in finding a potential list leader, No√´l Mam√®re was named a possible \\"consensus candidate\\" in an alliance with Hamon, but later declined on 25 June. On 9 and 10 June, the federal council of the party agreed to put forth provisional lists to be submitted to a membership vote from 11 to 16 July, and the outlines of the party's plans for the 2019 elections were presented from 23 to 25 August. Two possible lists were created ‚Äì one led by Jadot and the other by Rivasi ‚Äì with the names of Damien Car√™me and Julien Bayou removed after later revisions. On 16 July, the party announced that Jadot won the vote with 58.69% of votes against 35.59% for Rivasi, and subsequently reaffirmed that he would not ally with Hamon again in the European elections. On 23 September, the EELV federal council agreed to place Damien Car√™me, mayor of Grande-Synthe, 3rd on the EELV list, and Alexis Tiouka, a former representative to the UN for the rights of indigenous peoples, later joined the list, becoming the first-ever Native American on a European electoral list. In an interview on 25 February 2019, Jadot announced the addition of regional councilor Beno√Æt Biteau to the list in 11th position. R√©gions et Peuples Solidaires planned to contest the elections but left open the possibility of allying with the Greens, and on 16 February 2019 announced it was an alliance, with former MEP Fran√ßois Alfonsi as well as Lydie Massard and Anne-Marie Hautant joining the list. On 23 February, the Independent Ecological Alliance (AEI) duly announced that it reached an agreement with the EELV, with Caroline Roose and Salima Yenbou within the top 10 electable places on the list. The Greens intend to target both ex-Socialists and disappointed Macron voters who view his government's policies as too right-wing. Jadot has sought to portray the EELV as neither left nor right but \\"central\\", attempting to represent a \\"pragmatic\\" German-style ecology and create an \\"ecologist pole\\" as opposed to the \\"productivist\\" and \\"populist\\" poles, saying that \\"ecology is not the left\\". The Greens, led by Jadot, also unveiled their plans for a \\"Green New Deal\\", a name borrowed from the American left, proposing dedicating 100 billion euros to investments in renewable energy and home insulation to achieve 100% electricity generation from renewables within 20 years.  La R√©publique En Marche and allies  In March 2019, Les √âchos reported that the choice of lead candidate was to be made internally between either health minister Agn√®s Buzyn or European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau. Loiseau officially announced she would seek the nomination for lead candidate following her debate with Marine Le Pen on the set of L'√âmission politique on 14 March, while Les √âchos and Le Parisien later reported that Buzyn withdrew her name from consideration. Loiseau was officially designated as lead candidate on 26 March as the list of the first 30 candidates was unveiled. Alain Jupp√© was the subject of early speculation regarding his potential candidacy to lead the list, though confirmed on 19 March 2018 that he would not stand, and his appointment to the Constitutional Council precluded his participation in the campaign, but he indicated he would have supported Macron's list. Other speculated list leaders included √âdouard Philippe, Fran√ßois Bayrou, Nicolas Hulot, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Sylvie Goulard, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Arnaud Danjean, and Michel Barnier. Pierre Moscovici ruled out the possibility, as did Barnier, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Bayrou, Danjean, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and Thomas Pesquet. Outgoing Green MEP Karima Delli, ministers Marl√®ne Schiappa and Brune Poirson, deputy Am√©lie de Montchalin, Pascal Canfin, head of the French section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and former France Inter journalist Bernard Guetta were also considered potential candidates. Canfin declined to lead the list on 16 November, and in late January 2019, Laurence Tubiana, president of the European Climate Foundation and former COP21 negotiator, was mentioned as a possibility, as were Le Drian, sailor Maud Fontenoy, justice minister Nicole Belloubet, and Emmanuelle Wargon. On 17 December 2017, at the congress of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), Christophe Castaner said he supported an \\"enlarged list\\" for the European elections based on their alliance, and on 26 September 2018, the movement officially announced the opening of applications for prospective candidates from civil society, receiving 2,673 in total, winnowed by an investiture committee chaired by Jean-Marc Borello. Former √âlys√©e advisor St√©phane S√©journ√© was designated campaign director on 29 October, tasked with creating a list alongside Agir, and seeking a lead candidate with a \\"green profile\\". For the MoDem, Bayrou selected R√©gis Lefebvre to serve as deputy campaign director. On 15 February, Challenges revealed that EELV MEP Pascal Durand would be on the list in an electable position and S√©journ√© in the top 25 places. The centre-right party Agir proposed several candidates for the list, including two in electable position: Nicolas Barnier (the son of Michel Barnier and a parliamentary assistant), as well as Fabienne Keller, Gilles Boyer, √âlisabeth Morin-Chartier, and Xavier Fournier. In an interview published in Challenges on 6 February, Radical Movement co-president Laurent H√©nart indicated that the movement would likely vote to join a common list, sparking dissent among some ex-PRG members including co-president Sylvia Pinel, who announced her departure from the party to resurrect the PRG on two days later. The candidates it proposed included outgoing MEP Dominique Riquet, Olga Johnson, and M√©lanie Fortier. One outgoing MEP, Jean Arthuis, announced that he would not seek to run again in 2019, and Agir MEP Tokia Sa√Øfi also retired, as did the party's other MEP √âlisabeth Morin-Chartier after learning she would not be in electable position on the list. Foreign nationals were also be on the list, including former Italian undersecretary for European affairs Sandro Gozi. After declining to run as a lead candidate, Canfin ultimately appeared in second on the list. La R√©publique En Marche considered alliances with similar European political parties including Citizens in Spain and the Democratic Party in Italy, as well as parties outside of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade was delegated with the task of forming contacts with potential European partners. On 9 September 2018, Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the ALDE group, claimed that La R√©publique En Marche would ally with ALDE, which Castaner denied. Reports in October indicated Macron and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte reached an agreement in principle for an alliance, though Anglade emphasized that ALDE parties would merely serve as the foundation, with EPP parties on the right such as Civic Platform in Poland and New Democracy in Greece as well as PES parties on the left including the Democratic Party in Italy and the Social Democratic Party of Austria in consideration. The party considered recruiting MEPs to form a group after the election. Following the airing of a report on France 2 on 11 March about ALDE's financial backing from Monsanto, manufacturer of glyphosate, the party announced that it would not join the ALDE, leading the latter to announce it would no longer accept corporate donations. Verhofstadt later announced on 2 May that the ALDE group would be dissolved after the elections to ally and create a new group.  Union of Democrats and Independents  On 15 December 2018, Lagarde launched the party's campaign at its extraordinary congress, hoping to gain the support of pro-European voters who were not necessarily in favor of Macron's ideas on Europe. The party is also seeking to gain support from LR voters disillusioned by the hard-right political line of Wauquiez. Former LR vice president Virginie Calmels as well as general Pierre de Villiers were approached as potential candidates. However, Calmels later denied she was contacted and ruled out working with the UDI. Xavier Bertrand planned to appear at the launch of the UDI congress remotely, but reiterated that he did not support a federal Europe did support the UDI list. The UDI list includes former MEP Nora Berra, an Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes regional councilor elected on the LR list who later quit the party to protest its hard-right positioning, in second position, as well as longtime centrist Louis Giscard d'Estaing, son of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, in third. While the party's sole remaining MEP Patricia Lalonde initially supported the principle of an independent list, she later urged the party to join the LR list, expressing support for Bellamy and Wauquiez; Lalonde did not seek another mandate in the elections.  The Republicans  On 18 November, Le Journal du Dimanche reported that LR leader Laurent Wauquiez was considering 33-year-old Catholic philosopher Fran√ßois- Xavier Bellamy as a candidate to lead the LR list in 2019, though his political inexperience and conservative profile initially raised concerns. Wauquiez decided to submit three names to the CNI on 29 January, naming not only Bellamy but Agn√®s Evren and Arnaud Danjean as top candidates for the list, balancing the various strands of the party, with Evren close to Val√©rie P√©cresse and Danjean a committed pro-European close to Alain Jupp√©. On 29 January, the CNI validated the nominations of Bellamy, Evren, and Danjean with 38 out of 40 votes. Other potential list leaders included Laurent Wauquiez, who declined, Virginie Calmels, Damien Abad, Nadine Morano, Jean Leonetti, Arnaud Danjean, Luc Ferry, Brice Hortefeux, Pierre de Villiers, √âric Woerth, Christian Jacob, Geoffroy Didier, Philippe Juvin, Michel Dantin, and Arnaud Danjean, though Leonetti declined, Ferry was uninterested, and Dantin decided instead to seek another term as mayor of Chamb√©ry in 2020. P√©cresse, Rachida Dati, and Michel Barnier also declined to lead the LR list. In an interview published on 10 March 2018 in Le Journal du Dimanche, Thierry Mariani militated for an alliance with Le Pen, and was subsequently threatened with expulsion from the party; he ultimately joined the RN list. On 9 October, Wauquiez ruled out the possibility of alliances with Debout la France, La R√©publique En Marche!, or the National Rally in a letter addressed to Nicolas Dupont-Aignan. On 12 February 2019, Herv√© Morin of The Centrists met with Wauquiez about a possible alliance for two out of the top 20 places on the list. On 6 March, the LR national investiture committee designated the first 26 candidates on the list. Alexandre Vergnes, general secretary of Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions (CPNT), was initially slated to appear in 13th ‚Äì and later 15th ‚Äì position, but was later demoted to 30th; ultimately, the party announced on 11 April that its candidates would be Martine Aury in 48th and Pascal Marie in 31st. Geoffroy Didier was appointed campaign director in March. Despite pressure from La R√©publique En Marche to support their list ahead of the 2020 municipal elections and implied threats not to support them in case of their refusal denounced by some as \\"blackmail\\", \\"Macron-compatible\\" mayors (including Arnaud Robinet and Christian Estrosi) largely backed Bellamy's list. Among outgoing MEPs, Nadine Morano, Brice Hortefeux, Alain Cadec, Franck Proust, Geoffroy Didier, and Ang√©lique Delahaye sought to stand as candidates, while Fran√ßoise Grosset√™te, √âlisabeth Morin-Chartier, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie, Alain Lamassoure, J√©r√¥me Lavrilleux, Renaud Muselier, and Maurice Ponga did not seek the party's investiture, with Rachida Dati also opting out in view of the 2020 municipal elections in Paris. Marc Joulaud and Philippe Juvin are also not running for another term.  Debout la France  On 19 January 2018, Europe 1 revealed that Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, leader of Debout la France, appeared to close the door to an alliance with the National Rally (RN) while still appealing for a \\"union of patriots\\" that could yet include members of the National Rally. On 20 March, the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) voted unanimously to join Dupont-Aignan's \\"The Lovers of France\\" (Les Amoureux de la France), a political formation including the Christian Democratic Party of Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Poisson and mayor of B√©ziers Robert M√©nard. On 31 May, the three figures of \\"The Lovers of France\\" presented a \\"common program\\" with president of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group Ryszard Legutko in attendance, coinciding with the defection of FN MEP Bernard Monot to join DLF and the publication of an open letter from Le Pen inviting Dupont-Aignan to form a common list, which the latter subsequently rejected publicly. On 23 September, Dupont-Aignan officially announced that he intended to lead a \\"union list\\" of the right in the 2019 European elections, and DLF officially concluded its alliance with the ECR on 21 December. RN MEP Sylvie Goddyn, who was expelled from the party on 19 October 2018 after indicating her support for Dupont-Aignan's initiative for a union list, initially planned to appear on the party's list, as did Poisson. According to a report in Le Figaro, Dupont-Aignan also sought to invite Jean Lassalle to lead his list but was rebuffed, as was the case with Thierry Mariani, who chose to join the RN list. Jeannette Bougrab also refused to join the list, while both Dupont-Aignan and Le Pen failed to recruit LR member Erik Tegn√©r. DLF attempted to draft another LR figure, Malika Sorel, while UBS whistleblower St√©phanie Gibaud became a candidate on the DLF list. On 11 February, L'Opinion reported that wealthy financier and writer Charles Gave would appear on the DLF list and provide the party with nearly 2 million euros in funding, while his daughter Emmanuelle Gave would also be on the list in an electable position. After Quotidien revealed the younger Gave's history of controversial tweets, DLF announced on 20 February that she would not be nominated, thus losing the elder Gave's guarantee of funding. Following the departure of the Gaves and denial of loans, the party relied on 1.2 million in funding via a \\"people's loan\\" from supporters, in addition to around 1 million euros provided by candidates on the list. On 28 March 2019, Dupont-Aignan unveiled the first 23 candidates on the list, excluding Poisson because of his alleged refusal to embrace a collective approach, with outgoing MEPs Monot and Goddyn also absent \\"by mutual agreement\\". Poisson reportedly threatened to launch his own list with Gave after being told he would appear in fifth position, rather than third as originally planned. Despite their participation in Les Amoureux de la France, M√©nard and Nicolas Dhuicq ultimately supported the list of the RN.  National Rally  According to a report in L'Obs on 22 November 2018, Jordan Bardella, the 23-year-old head of the party's youth wing G√©n√©ration Nation, was favored by Le Pen to lead the list. and on 7 January 2019, Louis Aliot confirmed that Bardella would lead the party's list in the European elections after being confirmed unanimously by the members of the RN's leadership. Two LR members, former minister Thierry Mariani and Jean- Paul Garraud, as well as economist Herv√© Juvin, appeared on the party's list. In addition, Andr√© Roug√©, who advised Le Pen during the presidential campaign and another ex-UMP member, employed in the mayoral office of Jacques Chirac until 1995, was also on the list. A number of other lead candidates were considered but did not ultimately run. On 1 December 2017, Nicolas Bay announced that Marine Le Pen would not lead the party's list in 2019. Juvin was also considered a possibility, and on 12 October 2018, Aliot confirmed said he would seek to become lead candidate, but announced on 20 November that he would instead seek the mayoralty of Perpignan in the 2020 municipal elections. On 13 December 2017, Le Pen claimed that she wanted an alliance with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, president of Debout la France, and met with Dupont-Aignan the same day to discuss \\"a possible partnership\\", but was rebuked a month later, and subsequently published an open letter seeking an alliance on 31 May 2018, only to receive his rejection again on 3 June. RN MEP Sylvie Goddyn was expelled from the party on 19 October 2018 after indicating her openness to Dupont-Aignan's initiative for a union list on the right. Le Pen campaigned with Bardella at public meetings on Saturday afternoons in 20 small communes over the course of a campaign, the cost of which is anticipated to be around 4 million euros, in addition to a single major campaign event in a regional capital on 1 May, with H√©nin-Beaumont mayor Steeve Briois appointed campaign director. Like La France Insoumise, the party launched an appeal for a \\"popular loan\\", soliciting donations from supporters in order to finance its campaign after being denied loans by French banks, and on 23 April announced that it raised 4 million euros using this scheme, which promised to repay lenders with 5% interest. Le Pen and Matteo Salvini plan to hold a joint campaign meeting in Italy in mid-May, likely in Milan on 18 May.  The Patriots  On 23 November 2017, Florian Philippot announced that his movement, The Patriots (Les Patriotes), would present candidates in the 2019 European elections, fighting for the French exit from the European Union. The party had three MEPs, including Sophie Montel and Mireille d'Ornano, though Montel quit the party on 5 July 2018. Philippot launched the party's campaign for the European elections with the publication of his book Frexit, setting out his vision of Europe, in September 2018. Despite his hopes to build a cross-party list, his appeals to Henri Guaino, Fran√ßois Asselineau, and Jean Lassalle went unreciprocated. Lacking public financing, Philippot called for donations to help fund the party's campaign. As with other parties, the movement sought to recruit gilets jaunes onto its list, with Philippot seeking to register the name with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) as well. Philippot confirmed on 22 February that his party would have the financial means to contest the elections, saying that he would lead the list, followed by d'Ornano in second place. On 30 April, Philippot filed his list, which was joined by members of Jean-Fran√ßois Barnaba's list Jaunes et citoyens; Barnaba himself is ninth on the list. On April 24, close to the deadline for filing of lists, Philippot publicly called for a common list with Asselineau; according to L'Opinion, he delegated Thibaud Lonjon with the task of soliciting an alliance, offering 300,000 euros in additional financing for the list (which had then already raised around 1.2 million euros). In addition to Asselineau, Philippot sought a last-minute alliance with Dupont-Aignan, this time offering 400,000 euros for the third spot on the list, but was again rejected, with Bertrand Dutheil de La Roch√®re confirming these approaches.  Popular Republican Union  On 18 November 2017, Fran√ßois Asselineau, founder of the Popular Republican Union (UPR), said at the party congress in Tours that he would \\"probably\\" be a candidate on the party's list in the 2019 European elections. Asselineau intends to leverage the party's online presence to help raise funds from its 32,000 members.  Gilets jaunes   Present lists  In a press release on 29 April, Francis Lalanne announced that he would present a list under the banner of Alliance jaune on 30 April, having allied with the abortive RIC list now led by J√©r√©my Cl√©ment, with a financial guarantee of 800,000 euros from Jean-Marc Governatori, co-secretary of the Independent Ecological Alliance (AEI) ‚Äì allied with the Greens ‚Äì in order to ensure the list would be able to contest the elections. The list was led by Lalanne, with Sophia Albert-Salmeron in second and Cl√©ment in third position. This effort began following the publication of an open letter signed by Lalanne and Governatori, co-secretary of the Independent Ecological Alliance (AEI), on 7 December 2018 supporting the principle of a gilets jaunes list. On 17 December, Lalanne announced the launch of the Rassemblement gilet jaune citoyen list, though was opposed by many gilets jaunes who felt that he did not represent them. According to Le Figaro, Jean-Fran√ßois Barnaba was expected to be chosen as the lead candidate for this list, despite having once considered launching his own list, but on 22 March instead announced that he wanted to lead his own list, Jaunes et citoyens, which later allied with Philippot's list, The Patriots, with ten candidates in non-electable positions. On 3 March, Christophe Chalen√ßon announced the creation of the √âvolution Citoyenne (Citizen Evolution) list for the European elections. Though Chalen√ßon is a notable figure of the movement, he says the list is not a list of \\"yellow vests\\", even if most of its candidates are, but consists of members of civil society representing \\"citizens of the left and right\\". Another list, Mouvement pour l'Initiative Citoyenne, which supports implementing the RIC at the national and European level, was selected by drawing lots, though it existed long before the movement, with its foundation in 2006 and presence in the 2009 elections. Yvan Bachaud, spokesman for the list (led by Gilles Helgen), reiterated on 6 May that the list has no connection to the gilets jaunes movement, and is only focused on supporting the RIC. Other parties ultimately included gilets jaunes on their lists, including the French Communist Party (PCF) with three, two present on the pro- Frexit Popular Republican Union (UPR) list led by Fran√ßois Asselineau, and right-wing activist Benjamin Cauchy in 9th position for Debout la France (DLF), of which he was already a member and spokesperson.  Abortive lists  { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"font- size:90%;float:right;padding:5px;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" RIC pre-list (23 Jan 2019) - ! # !

On 10 December, Hayk Shahinyan announced that he would also attempt to constitute a list. Christophe Chalen√ßon, one of the leaders of the \\"free\\" gilets jaunes, also supported the ambition of presenting a list in the European elections. Shahinyan's association, Gilets Jaunes, le mouvement, was the best-organized group, with 85,000 euros and 14,000 members. On 23 January, the group announced in a press release that they would present a list called Ralliement d'initiative citoyenne (RIC, or Citizens' Initiative Rally, referencing the acronym of the proposed referendum desired by many gilets jaunes) led by Ingrid Levavasseur, a 31-year-old nurse assistant, and also revealed the first 10 names on the list, with the remaining spots open to applications. Shahinyan was chosen as campaign director. The announcement of a list provoked largely negative reactions among other gilets jaunes, many of whom were skeptical and considered them opportunists. Marc Doyer, eighth on the list, was revealed to have previously supported Macron, and withdrew from the list on 28 January. Shahinyan also stepped down as campaign director, citing doubts. On 31 January, Brigitte Lapeyronie, ex-UDI member and trade unionist, also announced that she would not stand as a candidate due to personal reasons. Barnaba, who hoped to lead his own list, also quit. On 13 February, Levavasseur announced that she would quit the RIC list, a week after a controversial meeting with Luigi Di Maio, and announced on RTL on 11 March that she would not attempt to present a list. Two others on the list, C√¥me Dunis and Ayouba Sow, confirmed their departure from the initiative on 26 February. J√©r√©my Cl√©ment said that he would be ready to be lead candidate for the list unless a \\"more legitimate\\" candidate emerged. On 5 April, Fr√©d√©ric Mestdjian, spokesman for the RIC list, said that he expected to arrive at an alliance with \\"two or three\\" other lists of yellow vests within weeks, working with Lalanne's list. On 29 January, a gilet jaune leader from Nice, Patrick Cribouw, announced his intention to present a list in the European elections under the banner of Union jaune. Spokesman Fr√©deric Ibanez claimed the list already had around 40 candidates and would attempt to remain apolitical in terms of its composition. Appearing on BFM TV on 2 March, Cribouw claimed the list was complete and called for alliances with Mouraud, Levavasseur, and Valette. On 1 February, Thierry Paul Valette announced the creation of a European election list under the banner of the Rassemblement des Gilets jaunes citoyens, claiming to have already chosen 10 candidates, after having quit Lalanne's initiative, but subsequently announced on 26 April that he would not present a list. Shahinyan and Chalen√ßon announced their intention to create the mouvement alternatif citoyen (MAC) and hold a member vote in March to decide whether to present a list. For her part, Jacline Mouraud launched a party, Les √âmergents, on 27 January, and reiterated her intention not to present a list in the European elections but the 2020 municipal elections. Many of Macron's supporters considered gilets jaunes lists desirable, given that an internal poll suggested that such a list would siphon votes from the opposition and increase turnout by engaging traditional abstentionists, paradoxically strengthening Macron as a result. Others, however, warned that an electoral transformation of the movement could result in a French Five Star Movement.  Absent lists   New Anticapitalist Party  While the New Anticapitalist Party (NPA) initially sought to ally with Lutte Ouvri√®re (LO), with its national political council of 6 and 7 October 2018 approving of the principle of an alliance by a 37‚Äì22 vote (with 5 abstentions and 10 non-participants), talks broke down in November 2018. On 28 January, the NPA indicated that it would attempt to present a list despite its serious financial difficulties, soliciting donations from its members, with its leadership deciding on 24 March whether to contest the European elections. On 18 February, the party reiterated its desire to be present in the elections, requiring a million euros to ensure its ability to do so. The NPA ultimately announced on 25 March that it would not present a list in 2019, lacking the financial means to do so, and called on its supporters to vote for Lutte Ouvri√®re.  R√©sistons!  In an interview published in Valeurs actuelles on 3 May 2018, former presidential candidate Jean Lassalle announced his intention to present a list under the banner of his movement R√©sistons! in the European elections, hoping to defend the \\"territories and rurality\\" from the \\"European supranationalism, globalization and hypercapitalism\\". He voted \\"no\\" in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty referendum as well as the 2005 referendum on the European Constitution and opposed the Treaty of Lisbon in 2008. He intended to create a list composed of local mayors, farmers, business executives, and professionals inadequately represented in politics. On 6 March 2019, Lassalle indicated he had about a \\"quarter\\" of the 800,000 to 1 million euros needed to finance the campaign, and ultimately announced on 11 April 2019 that he would not present a list in the European elections, lacking sufficient funding.  Other electoral lists  On 23 November 2018, Delphine Batho of Ecology Generation confirmed that she intended to present a list, and on 18 March 2019, she confirmed alongside Antoine Waechter of the Independent Ecological Movement (MEI) that Dominique Bourg would lead their Urgence √âcologie list, also supported by the Movement of Progressives (MdP), as well as a significant contingent of the Union of Democrats and Ecologists (UDE). The Animalist Party presented a list in the elections led by H√©l√®ne Thouy, with several notable candidates including journalist Henry-Jean Servat and Sylvie Rocard, wife of the late former prime minister Michel Rocard, as well as backing from numerous film and television personalities, and former MEP Mich√®le Striffler in 11th position. Other lists include the monarchist and anti-EU Alliance Royale list led by Robert de Pr√©voisin; La ligne claire, a far-right identitarian list led by Renaud Camus, known for promoting the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, with Karim Ouchikh, president of Souverainet√©, Identit√© et Libert√©s (SIEL), in third position; the list of the Pirate Party, a pro-transparency pirate party led by Florie Marie; D√©mocratie repr√©sentative, a far-left list led by Hadama Traor√© emanating from the citizen collective La r√©volution est en marche; Parti des citoyens europ√©ens (PACE), led by Audric Alexandre, which calls for a federal Europe; the Liste de la reconqu√™te, the list of the extreme-right party Dissidence fran√ßaise (DF) led by the 30-year-old Vincent Vauclin, which includes a number of ex-RN candidates; the European Federalist Party (PFE), a federalist party led by its president Yves Gernigon; Allons Enfants, a pro- European \\"party of youth\\" consisting entirely of candidates under 30 and led by 22-year-old Sciences Po graduate Sophie Caillaud; D√©croissance 2019, a pro- degrowth and radical ecologist list led by Th√©r√®se Delfel; √Ä voix √©gales, a feminist list led by Nathalie Tomasini, former lawyer for Jacqueline Sauvage; Neutre et actif, a list led by Cathy Denise Ginette Corbet to \\"fight against abstention\\" in the elections; the far-left Parti R√©volutionnaire Communistes, a split from the PCF, led by national secretary Antonio Sanchez; Esp√©ranto - langue commune √©quitable pour l'Europe, the list of Europe D√©mocratie Esp√©ranto (EDE), led by Pierre Dieumegard, which calls for the designation of Esperanto as an official language; Les Oubli√©s de l'Europe, a list led by Olivier Bidou to defend the interests of \\"artisans, tradespeople, liberal professions, and the self-employed\\"; the Union D√©mocratique Pour La Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√© (UDLEF), a centre-right federalist list consisting mostly of African immigrants led by business leader Christian Luc Person; and Une Europe au service des peuples, the list of the Union des d√©mocrates musulmans fran√ßais (Union of French Muslim Democrats, UDMF) led by Najib Azergui, which was validated after a delay due to incomplete paperwork. == Election platforms == The table below is a summary of the platforms of the principal electoral lists in the European elections. == Opinion polls == File:Opinion polling for the 2019 European Parliament election in France.svg == Results == On 4 May 2019, the names of 33 official electoral lists, validated by the Ministry of the Interior, were published in the Journal officiel de la R√©publique fran√ßaise, with their order determined by drawing lots. A 34th list entitled Une Europe au service des peuples, representing the Union des d√©mocrates musulmans fran√ßais (Union of French Muslim Democrats, UDMF) led by Najib Azergui, was later validated by the Ministry of the Interior after an initial delay, due to a lack of written consent from several candidates on the list. In all, a total of 2,686 candidates were represented on these 34 lists, the number of which surpasses the previous record of 20 at the national level in the 1999 elections and the average of 24 lists per constituency in the 2014 elections. Lacking the financial means to do so, most minor electoral lists were unable to distribute ballot papers at every polling site, instead requiring voters to print their own ballots published online; others, like the Pirate Party, only printed a fraction of ballots for each polling station, with those in particularly favorable areas targeted for ballots, to cut costs. Due to the Article 50 extension granted to the United Kingdom, 79 MEPs will be considered to have been officially elected, but only 74 will initially take their seats, with 5 \\"virtual\\" MEPs to take their seats upon the departure of the UK from the EU. Comparisons for 2019 results for Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV) are made with the combined score it received in 2014 of 8.95%, the Independent Ecological Alliance (AEI) with 1.12%, and R√©gions et Peuples Solidaires (R&PS;) with 0.34% (representing 10.41% in total); for the Socialist Party (PS) common list including Place Publique and New Deal, with its score in 13.98% as well as that of New Deal with 2.90% (representing 16.88% in total); the score of the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) is compared to his number of seats in The Alternative in 2014; and for the French Communist Party (PCF), his number of seats within the Left Front electoral alliance (including the Union for the Overseas).  By department   By region   Communes with at least 100,000 inhabitants   Elected MEPs  Five MEPs were formally considered to have been elected in the elections, but will not take their seats pending the departure of the UK from the EU.  Electorate  == Aftermath and analysis == Turnout, up by 7.7 points compared to the previous European elections, was the highest since the 1994 elections. The results of the election were a confirmation of the establishment of the National Rally and La Republique En Marche as the two strongest political forces, between them leading in every single department. Although it fell relative to 2014, elevated turnout also meant the RN also attained a new record vote total in the European elections. Pre-election polls failed to capture both the rise of the Greens and abysmal result of The Republicans. Even if surveys in the closing weeks uniformly reflected an increase in estimated turnout, that alone did not explain the discrepancy between polls and the final result. Fr√©d√©ric Dabi, deputy director general of the polling institute Ifop, admitted that pollsters missed the result, while Brice Teinturier, deputy managing director at Ipsos, suggested that the LR vote was more fragile than immediately visible, with their electorate less firm and many placing Loiseau's list as their second choice; the same was true for La Republique En Marche, with 17% of its backers then considering a vote for the Greens. Teinturier suggested that there had been a \\"double transfer\\" in votes in the closing weekend during the polling ban, with LR supporters moving Loiseau's list to prevent the RN from a first-place finish, the Greens depriving votes from the En Marche list, and a porous Socialist electorate compatible with both. Surveys indicated that nearly a quarter of voters made their choice only in the weekend before, with over half of EELV voters deciding within the last week alone, while retirees, who traditionally make up the LR vote, instead voted for the Renaissance list. The results of the European elections in France were also viewed with interest for their potential implications in the upcoming municipal elections in 2020. In Paris, the Renaissance list came first with 33% of the vote, followed by the Greens with just under 20%, LR with a catastrophic score of just 10%, the Socialists on 8%, RN on 7%, and M√©lenchon's France Insoumise on only 5%. Despite the overall vote share of the LREM list remaining relatively stable compared to Macron's result in 2017, the massive increase in support in the wealthier western arrondissements and decrease in support everywhere else in the city reflected the changing nature of its electoral base with the loss of its left flank. Even in Marseille, a stronghold of the right, the LR list received only 8% of the vote, whereas the National Rally led with just over 26% and the list backed by M√©lenchon with just over 8% in his electoral fief. In reaction to the results, the √âlys√©e claimed that it perceived the outcome as a \\"disappointment\\", but \\"not a defeat\\", while pointing to EELV's strong showing as reflecting strong support for ecological issues which it had made central to the campaign, with no change in direction expected from the government. Interpretations of the RN's score were also qualified, described as a \\"victory but not a triumph\\", falling short of the 25% mark in late polls, matching its usual electoral results and marking a slight decrease from its share of the vote from 2014. Speaking after the RN's victory, Le Pen called for the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly after the \\"democratic rejection\\" of Macron with his list's second-place finish. For his part, Beno√Æt Hamon decided to take time to reflect upon his next steps and to try to assist in uniting the left after his movement, G√©n√©ration.s, fell short and failed to secure any seats. Despite implicit pressure on him to step down after overseeing the worst result for the right in its history, Laurent Wauquiez initially sought to remain at the helm of The Republicans, proposing an \\"Estates General\\" to update the party's strategy and propositions. The results were also a major disappointment for M√©lenchon's France Insoumise with a score just over 6%, only narrowly ahead of the PS/Place Publique list, cut in third compared to the 2017 presidential election; like LR, it was also potentially a victim of tactical voting, potentially due to a strategic failure in framing the election as an anti-Macron referendum. Wauquiez ultimately announced his resignation as president of The Republicans a week later, on 2 June. == See also == *2020 French municipal elections *2022 French presidential election *Opinion polling on the Emmanuel Macron presidency == References  External links == *Official results *Results by region, department, constituency, canton, commune, and polling station *Statements of principle for lists and candidates *Full list of candidates (data.gouv.fr) *Summary of programs of the principal lists *Summary of backgrounds of lead candidates *Official campaign clips *Analysis of votes of the MEPs who served from 2014‚Äì2019 from Le Monde *List of current French MEPs 2019 France ","title":"2019 European Parliament election in France"},{"id":"56079978","text":"The Wethersfield Avenue Car Barn, also known locally just as the Trolley Barn, is a historic trolley barn at 331 Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. Built in 1902, it is the only surviving building used exclusively for the area's extensive electrified street car network in the first half of the 20th century. Now converted to other uses, it was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==Description and history== The Wethersfield Avenue Car Barn is located in Hartford's southern Barry Square neighborhood, occupying most of a city block's frontage on the west side of Wethersfield Avenue, between Elliot and Benton Streets. It is a multi-section brick structure, ranging in height from two to four stories. A tall central section is flanked by four-story towers, with two-story flanking wings that have projecting pavilions at the ends. The styling is a fairly typical early 20th-century commercial Italianate, with multi-story round-arch windows, brick corbelling, and terra cotta panels. Trolley service began in Hartford in 1862, and this location is where the Hartford and Wethersfield Horse Railway, operators of the service, had its main facility. Originally horsecar service, the company began electrifying its routes in 1888, and changed its name to the Hartford Street Railway Company in 1893, reflecting a move away from horse- drawn services. This facility was built to replace the previous one, because of the reduced demand for horse care and increased demand for trolley maintenance and storage. As the company expanded, it also established maintenance facilities on Vernon and State Streets; only one of these survives in much-altered form as a bus facility. This facility survived until 1941, when trolley service was discontinued in favor of buses, and was sold. It was converted into a sporting arena, used primarily for boxing events. It has since been repurposed for other uses, including housing social service agencies. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Trolleybus transport in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1902 Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Wethersfield Avenue Car Barn"},{"id":"56080004","text":"Augochlorini is a tribe of sweat bees in the subfamily Halictinae.

Dissegna was a popular child known for his constant smile and deep love for Jesus Christ and His Blessed Mother; he likewise recited rosaries on a frequent basis and was a frequent attendant at Mass each week following the reception of his First Communion. His beatification process opened in 1995 in Turin and culminated two decades later after the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to title Dissegna as Venerable on 7 November 2014. ==Life== Silvio Dissegna was born on 1 July 1967 in Turin at 12:10 am as the first of two children to Ottavio Dissegna and Gabriella Martignon. His little brother was Carlo (b. 6 July 1968). Dissegna received his baptism on 6 July in the hospital chapel from the Dominican priest Domenico Moine with the names \\"Silvio Antonio Giovanni\\". In late September 1973 he began grade school in Poirino and his teacher at this time was Vanna Appendino Ricci. His second teacher in 1974 was Alfredo Salvano and he received excellent marks in his exams. From 1975 to 1977 his teacher was Giovanni Chiara who noted his excellent maturation in all his subjects. He ended school on 7 April 1978 due to his illness and his hospitalization in Moncalieri on 10 April. Dissegna (a popular child with a constant smile) was known for being full of life who desired becoming a school teacher when he was older. His teachers perceived him to be clever in his class and his notebooks were full of descriptions about nature and games as well as his future aspirations. Dissegna liked to ride his bike and watch cartoons on television. He made his First Communion on 7 September 1975 alongside his brother Carlo from Father Vincenzo Pausa. It was following this event that he became a frequent attender in Masses each week. On 25 December 1977 ‚Äì Christmas ‚Äì his mother gifted the child with his own typewriter and dedicated his first page to her: \\"Thank you, mamma, for bringing me into the world for giving me life which is so beautiful! I have a great desire to live!\\" He developed bone cancer in 1978 just before he turned eleven when he began to suffer terrible and constant pain in his legs in the spring (this manifested around January). He made several doctor visits who prescribed certain medications to him. But the pain grew more intense over time which led to several tests being performed which resulted in the diagnosis on 13 May 1978 that Dissegna had bone cancer. But he did not despair at the diagnosis unlike his parents. He said to his distressed father: \\"Papa, have courage! Jesus will not abandon us\\". He said to his mother: \\"If I die it is not important. I will suffer to the end\\". On 4 June 1978 he asked his friends: \\"Tell Don Luigi to bring me Communion at home every day\\"; Luigi Delsanto did this for him. He dedicated his time to reciting rosaries and offering his sufferings for missionaries and the conversion of sinners as well as for the three popes who reigned in his life. He received his Confirmation in a wheelchair on 21 May 1978 from Father Piero Giacobbo. On the occasions when he was hospitalized he asked the chaplain to bring him frequent Communion. From 13 June 1978 to January 1979 (other hospitalizations from 24 July 21 August, 18 September 16 October, and 20 November) he had seven hospitalizations in Paris for treatment with his father remaining at his side on these trips. On one such trip the individual in the bed next to him was in pain and began cursing. This upset Dissegna who wept at the person's obscenities. Dissegna's father Ottavio sent a heartfelt letter to Pope Paul VI on 27 May 1978 asking for \\"a prayer and a blessing for Silvio\\". Paul VI responded on 2 June with a letter assuring Ottavio of his support while exhorting the Dissegna's \\"to trust in divine goodness\\". His last visit to a church was in mid-January 1979. Dissegna lost his sight on 10 June 1979 (following swelling; the left pupil deteriorated on 26 July) and then his hearing that 4 September (prior to his death) due to the cancer's aggressive growth within him; large sores opened across his body in May after his left leg broke due to the weakening bone. Dissegna died in his home with a smile on his face in the evening on 24 September 1979 in Poirino at 9:20 pm. He had received the Anointing of the Sick the morning of his death as well as the Viaticum; he was lucid when Father Vincenzo Pansa (the parish priest) was there that morning to administer both to the ailing child. His funeral was celebrated in the Poirino parish church on 26 September; thirty priests and around a thousand people attended his funeral. ==Beatification process== The beatification process opened in the Turin archdiocese in a diocesan process that the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Giovanni Saldarini inaugurated on 8 February 1995 and which Cardinal Severino Poletto later closed at a solemn Mass on 25 October 2001. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 7 March 1995 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints decreed \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled Dissegna as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process in Rome on 8 November 2001 prior to receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2010 for in-depth assessment. Theologians met and approved the cause on 5 November 2013 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 21 October 2014. The confirmation of Dissegna's life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to title the child as Venerable on 7 November 2014. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini. Cardinal Pietro Palazzini read one of the two biographical accounts about Dissegna and then wrote: \\"The example of Silvio illustrates that children are able to attain heroic virtues and are worthy of canonization\\". John Paul II also said of him on 9 November 2001 to Dissegna's parents: \\"Silvio is a beautiful figure\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * Hagiography Circle * Official website Category:1967 births Category:1979 deaths Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Italy Category:Italian children Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from Turin Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Silvio Dissegna"},{"id":"56080093","text":"For Men Only (, translit.

They have been described as \\"punk rock legends\\" by Westwords Brad Jones. After they broke up, lead singer Pat Todd founded Pat Todd & the Rankoutsiders. ==History== The Lazy Cowgirls were formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by Pat Todd (vocals), Doug Phillips (aka D.D. Weekday) (guitar), Allen Clark (drums), and Keith Telligman (bass guitar), all of whom originally grew up together in Vincennes, Indiana. They started playing shows regularly in 1984. Their self-titled debut was released in 1985 on Restless Records, and was produced by Chris D. It was followed by Tapping the Source, which was released in 1987 on the Bomp! label. They then searched for a new label to release a single on, which led to the establishment of the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. Their third album, Radio Cowgirl, was released in 1989 as the first album on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The album contains recordings of one of the band's famously energetic live performances for KCSB-FM. An article in Spin that year described them as \\"one of the planet's ranking punk bands\\". Their fourth album, How It Looks -- How It Is, was released the following year, also on Sympathy for the Record Industry. In 1991, Telligman and Clark quit the band, and their rhythm section became highly variable for the next several years. By 1995, when the band released Ragged Soul, this seemed to have changed, with their lineup now consisting of Todd, Weekday, Michael Leigh (rhythm guitar), Ed Huerta (drums), and Leonard Keringer (bass guitar). Ragged Soul was co-produced by Earle Mankey, and was described by Trouser Press as the band's \\"best shot at commercial success\\". In 1996, Weekday and Huerta both left the band. When they released the album A Little Sex and Death in 1997, it featured Bob Deagle on drums and Eric Chandler on guitar. Leigh rejoined the band on guitar in 1999, and the band released Rank Outsider later that year. Less than six months later, they followed it up with 2000's Somewhere Down the Line. Their final album, I'm Goin' Out And Get Hurt Tonight, was released in 2004 on Reservation Records, making it the band's only album for this label. After the Cowgirls broke up later in 2004, Todd started another band, known as Pat Todd & the Rankoutsiders. ==Critical reception== The Lazy Cowgirls were often compared to famous proto-punk bands such as the Ramones, the New York Dolls, and the Stooges. Brad Jones, writing in Westword, described their style as \\"...lean, soulful, and as abrupt as an ice pick through the forehead,\\" and wrote that it was exemplified on their album Ragged Soul. In a review of the same album, Peter Margasak described it as the band's best, and as \\"...a thrilling mix of Stooge-oid rattle and soulful twang.\\" Joe S. Harrington describes the band as \\"...a kind of brazen New York Dolls/Sex Pistols equivalent\\". He also writes that they followed in the tradition of the Leaving Trains, who were also a largely apolitical punk band. In a review of I‚Äôm Goin‚Äô Out and Get Hurt Tonight, Fred Mills described the album as the band's \\"...latest, possibly greatest platter\\" and its sound as \\"...a hi-nrg roar.\\" ==Discography== *Lazy Cowgirls (Restless, 1985) *Tapping the Source (Bomp!, 1987) *Third Time's the Charm (Grown Up Wrong EP, 1988) *Radio Cowgirl (Sympathy for the Record Industry, 1989) *How It Looks ‚Äì How It Is (Sympathy for the Record Industry, 1990) *Ragged Soul (Crypt, 1995) *A Little Sex and Death (Crypt, 1997) *Rank Outsider (Sympathy for the Record Industry, 1999) *Somewhere Down the Line (Sympathy for the Record Industry, 2000) *Here and Now (Live!)

The National Maritime Historical Society awarded O‚ÄôBrien their Distinguished Service Award for his body of artwork in 2012. == Biography == Patrick O‚ÄôBrien was born in Boston. In 1982 O'Brien earned a degree in biology from the University of Virginia. He then became a full-time artist in the mid 1980s. In 2011 O‚ÄôBrien began teaching as a part-time faculty member at The Maryland Institute College of Art. He lives in Baltimore, MD. O'Brien is not related to the well-known British author Patrick O‚ÄôBrian (1914-2000,) but because he is a writer, and works in a similar genre, there is often confusion between the two authors. == Children‚Äôs books == O‚ÄôBrien is the author and illustrator of 12 children's books, and the illustrator of 6 others. His first book was published in 1995. Most of his books are non-fiction. His specialty is prehistoric animals and historical subjects such as knights, pirates and trains. O‚ÄôBrien has also illustrated a series of sci-fi adventure tales featuring dinosaurs in space, the Captain Raptor series. Publishers Weekly says ‚Äúthe series combines Jurassic Park, Star Trek and Captain Nemo, balancing tongue-in-cheek cheesiness with earnest enthusiasm.‚Äù The Washington Post described it as ‚Äúwhat most small boys would agree is the perfect book‚Äù and described the art as ‚Äújust plain beautiful.‚Äù In 2017 O‚ÄôBrien published You Are The First Kid on Mars (Putnam, 2009.) Publishers Weekly said of the book, ‚ÄúO'Brien takes an inventive leap into the future... Made captivatingly real by stunning digital art, this intriguing vision of space exploration should set imaginations soaring.‚Äù A copy of the book was launched into space aboard a SpaceX rocket in August, 2017 and delivered to The International Space Station, as part of a program called Story Time From Space. == Marine art == In 2003 O‚ÄôBrien began painting maritime scenes. He specializes in historic scenes from the age of sail. O‚ÄôBrien does extensive research to ensure that each painting is historically and nautically accurate. In 2011 The U. S. Coast Guard commissioned O‚ÄôBrien to create three paintings of historic Coast Guard vessels. One of the painting hangs in the main cabin aboard the USCG EAGLE. ExxonMobil commissioned several paintings depicting newly built supertankers. In 2009 The Gaylord National Resort at The National Harbor in Maryland commissioned two very large maritime paintings for their lobby. The U. S. Naval Institute has commissioned several paintings for covers of their magazine Naval History, including a large painting of The Battle of the Chesapeake.  Exhibitions  In 2008 The Union League Club in New York City hosted a solo-exhibition of O‚ÄôBrien's work entitled New York in the Age of Sail. In 2010 The U. S. Naval Academy Museum mounted a solo-exhibition of O‚ÄôBrien's work featuring twenty-eight oil paintings. The paintings were loaned by collectors from around the country. O‚ÄôBrien has exhibited regularly since 2004 at the annual Mystic International Marine Art Exhibition. In 2010 at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, MD, mounted an exhibition featuring O‚ÄôBrien's artwork. The exhibit was called Space, Sword and Dinosaurs, the Creation of Art for Children‚Äôs Books.Broadcast news segment, WJZ TV in Baltimore, MD, March 16, 2010 In 2017 several pieces of O‚ÄôBrien's artwork were included in an exhibition of artwork from children's books at The National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC. In 2007 O‚ÄôBrien had a solo exhibition of his paintings in Portsmouth, VA. The exhibit was entitled The Civil War at Sea.  Awards  In 2012 The National Maritime Historical Society awarded O‚ÄôBrien their Distinguished Service Award for his body of artwork. In 2015 O‚ÄôBrien was awarded the Schaefer Maritime Heritage Award at the Mystic International Marine Art Exhibition at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut. In 2010 the Mystic Seaport Museum awarded O‚ÄôBrien their Museum Purchase Award, which means the museum bought O‚ÄôBrien's painting for its permanent collection. == Selected works ==  Books written and illustrated by O'Brien  * The Making of a Knight, 1998 * Gigantic!, 1999 * Steam, Smoke and Steel, 2000 * The Hindenburg, 2000 * Megatooth, 2001 * The Great Ships, 2001 * Mammoth, 2002 * Fantastic Flights, 2003 * Duel of the Ironclads, 2003 * The Mutiny of the Bounty, 2007 * Sabertooth, 2008 * You Are the First Kid on Mars, 2009  Books written by O'Brien and Kevin O'Malley, and illustrated by O'Brien.  * Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery, 2005 * Captain Raptor and the Space Pirates, 2007 ==References External links == * Patrick O'Brien at The Maryland Institute College of Art * Patrick O'Brien at Charlesbridge Publishing * Patrick O'Brien at Penguin Random House * patrickobrienstudio Category:American children's writers Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American children's book illustrators Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American writers Category:University of Virginia alumni Category:Maryland Institute College of Art faculty Category:20th-century American writers Category:Artists from Boston Category:Writers from Boston ","title":"Patrick O'Brien (artist)"},{"id":"56080524","text":"Xing Yong (died 223), courtesy name Zi'ang, was a government official of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

Telugu version of this show known as Siri Siri Muvvalu airs on Star Maa, and Kannada version known as Bayasade Bali Bande airs on Star Suvarna. == Plot == Kavya's latest attempt at marriage fails when her fianc√©'s family demands she transfer her family's property to her future husband's name, which would leave her widow mother and unwed younger sisters homeless. Kavya later falls in love with her friend and tenant Sreejith, only learning after they are engaged that he loves her sister Keerthi. Keerthi begins working for Siddharth, and after a time they confess their love for each other. However, his best friend Jeeva expects Siddharth to marry Shivani, Jeeva's sister. Shivani presumes that it is Kavya that Siddharth loves, and so in a misguided attempt to come between them, Jeeva marries Kavya. Kavya later learns of this and accepts her presumed role to protect Keerthi. Marriage plans are finalized for Siddharth and Shivani, but he abandons her to secretly date Keerthi. Jeeva and Kavya gradually become closer. Jeeva's ex-girlfriend Neethu tries to get Jeeva back by claiming that he is the father of her unborn child, faking a DNA test. She, Shivani, and Dhyan (the actual father of Neethu's child) then attempt to kill Jeeva. This fails, and Achamma gives ownership of Ishwaramadom Group to Kavya. Later, Jeeva and Achamma work together to expose Neethu and Dhyan, who are thrown out of Ishwaramadom. Shivani and Indira Bhai plot to have Neethu suffer a miscarriage, and they blame it on Kavya. Neethu presses charges against Kavya, but Jeeva sets himself up as the culprit to save Kavya, jeopardizing his film career. Kavya and Sreejith save Jeeva and Indira is arrested. Shivani steals money which was meant for Jeeva's new film project, and uses it to release Indira from prison. Conflict results as blame shifts over the lost funds. Keerthi resigns from the company along with Sidhu, whom she pressures into marriage. With Indira's help, Shivani plots against her brother Shiva, having him kidnapped but saying that Kavya and Jeeva won't pay the ransom to turn Shiva against them. Indira blocks the sale of a property needed to finance Jeeva's new film project, leading to her expulsion and a lawsuit. Kavya is pressured to appear in the film. Shivani destroys evidence and frames Sidhu, causing a rift between Kavya and Keerthi. Pregnant Kavya is hospitalized when Shivani poisons her food. The machinations eventually become too much for Shiva, who admits to his misdeeds with his mother in order to protect Sreekutty's baby. Jeeva suffers amnesia following an auto collision, with the family warned not to force his memories. He misbehaves and quarrels with Kavya, who is explained to be his nurse, but when she leaves he has her brought back as his secretary. Although Shivani schemes against Kavya, Jeeva realizes his feelings and arranges to propose to Kavya. Kavya learns of this and gently tries to explain their life together but Jeeva develops a severe headache and cannot understand. Jeeva is arrested for abducting Abhirami, said to be his wife, who is found in a mental asylum. She and the police convince Jeeva to take responsibility and bring her home, and he tries to make amends though others in the family say she is a fake. Abhirami schemes to have Kavya expelled from the house. Jeeva reads Kavya's diary and realizes that she is his wife and carrying his child; uncertain of who his enemies are, he feigns ignorance of this but is more caring toward Kavya. After Abhirami's claims become more outrageous, Jeeva confides to Kavya that he remembers her, and asks her help catch those responsible for his automobile collision. Later another girl, Sahira, is appointed to take care of Kavya's health. Kavya, however, miscarries the baby and requests Sahira to be a surrogate mother of Kavya and Jeeva's child. In return, Kavya takes care of the expenses of Sahira's sister's treatment. Sahira accepts the proposal. However things took a turn when another man, Shankar, claims that Kavya is his wife and shows photographs to Sahira. He raises the claim in court. However Kavya proves him wrong in Court. Things go downhill when Sahira miscarries the child. Later Kavya finds that she is again pregnant with Jeeva's child. A marriage proposal comes Shivani's way. The guy, Jayesh, is a doctor. Indirabai wants Shivani to marry Jayesh thinking about the status they could get once Shivani is married to a doctor. The astrologer, however, tells Achamma and others, that if this marriage is solemnised, it could create problems in the groom's family. Later Kavya and Jeeva plans to trick Indirabai. They make Shivani and Indirabai observe several poojas. The marriage finally took place and the situation quickly deteriorates. Neethu and Dhyan tries to ruin the marriage by telling Jayesh about the relationship Shivani once had with Sidharth. Shivani seeks help from Kavya and Kavya discloses the truth to Jayesh. He, however, states that he is not bothered by such stories and fires Dhyan. Listening to her mother's advice, Shivani creates havoc in Jayesh's house. Jayesh slaps Shivani when she questions about the purity of his mother, Vanaja, who is a retired school teacher.I ndirabai challenges him claiming that she will make him pay for slapping her daughter, Shivani. A case is filed and Kavya appears for Jayesh and his mother and pleads not guilty. They win the case and Shivani and her mother feel disappointed. Later Shivani finds that she is pregnant with Jayesh's baby. Indirabai, however, forces her to abort the baby. Dr. Annie Thomas who is an old friend of Dr. Jayesh, informs him about Shivani's pregnancy. He requests her to somehow convince Shivani and Indirabai not to abort the baby. In an attempt to cause abortion, Indirabai mixes poison in the pudding made by Achamma. Shivani is suspicious and seeks help from Jeeva and Kavya. Also Shivani finds Jayesh with a new girl. She is disturbed and follows Jayesh. Kavya and Jeeva later decide to take Shivani back to Ishwaramadom with them. It turns out that the girl Shivani saw with Jayesh was his cousin, Devika. Jeeva and Kavya, however, on Jayesh's direction, conceals it from Shivani. Shivani is disturbed and wants Jayesh back. Months later, Jeeva is shown waiting before the Labour room and appears very tensed and Achamma consoles him. Dr. Gayathri arrives and tells Jeeva that Kavya has delivered twin girls who are named Riya and Diya Years later, Kavya and Jeeva are now separated. Kavya has the custody of Diya and Jeeva has the custody of Riya. Kavya and Diya are living with Sreejith who has a son named Appu ( Sreejith is like a guardian for Kavya, they are not married.The identity of Appu is not revield yet.) Achamma who is saddened with Kavya's separation from Ishwaramadam compels Jeeva to remarry. Diya wishes to go to Jeeva's house for an interview for a project from school not knowing that he is her father as Kavya hadn't said to her about Diya's father or his family. Now enters at Ishwaramadam, Urmila in the name of writing a biography of Jeeva. Actually she is sent by G.K who wants Kavya and her daughter. Then Adv.

But Sreejith didn't digest with this, he insulted Juan. Kavya and Sreejith made heated argument about Juan's behavior. Later Juan's sister, Jennifer stuns Kavya by making a surpise visit to her.

After her testimony was shown on a television program, she was killed by her ex-husband, Jos√© Parejo Avivar, on December 17, 1997 at age 60. Her death provoked a national reckoning about gender violence, and as a consequence, legal protections against gender and domestic violence were added to the Criminal Code of Spain. Parejo began abusing Orantes soon after they married, and the behavior intensified over the course of the next 40 years. Although she tried to escape and report her husband to the police, there were no laws to protect victims of domestic violence in Spain, nor in much of the rest of Europe. After years of trying, a divorce was finally granted in 1996. On December 4th 1997, a year after the divorce, she appeared on the television program \\"De Tarde en Tarde\\" and described the violence and sexual abuse she and her children suffered over the course of her 40 year marriage. Instances of his physical and emotional abuse included punishing her if another man looked at her, isolating her from her family, forbidding her from attending the weddings of her siblings, inappropriately touching their young daughters and countless near-death beatings. She described how she went to the police dozens of times and attempted to obtain a divorce when it became legal in 1981, with no success. When one was finally granted in 1996, she was forced to continue occupying the same house as her husband. 13 days after her interview, Orantes was found dead, murdered by her ex-husband, who had beaten her, tied her to a chair, and burned her alive. The gruesome nature of her murder, especially in such close proximity to her emotionally powerful interview, outraged the country and led to rallies across Spain to call for the protection of domestic violence victims. The conservative government dismissed these rallies, describing what happened to Orantes as an \\"isolated\\" event. To challenge this assertion, associations began documenting evidence and statistics about the prevalence of domestic violence. It was only in 2004 that Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero introduced Spain's first laws addressing domestic and gender violence. The far-right Vox party has since increasingly pushed for the elimination of these laws. Parejo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for the murder of his ex-wife. However, seven years after the murder, on November 17, 2004, Jos√© Parejo died at the Hospital Ruiz de Alda, in Granada, after suffering a myocardial infarction in prison. Orantes was the fifty-ninth victim of domestic abuse-related murder in Spain in 1997. Orantes's sons also claimed to have been abused by Parejo. == References == Category:1937 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Female murder victims Category:People from Granada Category:Victims of domestic abuse Category:Violence against women in Spain ","title":"Murder of Ana Orantes"},{"id":"56080584","text":"Lions Group NYC (Lions Group) is a family-owned and managed real estate development firm in New York City.

The low-budget film, produced by Nallai Ananthan, had musical score by Chandrabose and was released in 2005 after many delays. ==Plot== Naaga (Ranjith) was a rowdy who secretly worked for Sub-Inspector Pandian (Satya Prakash) and helped the police solve cases. One day, the news reporter Lakshmi (Indhu) revealed Pandian's partnership with a rowdy to the media. The issue quickly mushroomed and made the front page. The scandal tarnished Pandian's reputation, and the promotion that he was waiting for so long was cancelled by his superiors. Naaga then kidnapped Lakshmi, and Pandian brutally raped her. Pandian ordered Naaga to kill her, but Naaga changed his mind and let her go. Many years later, Lakshmi, who suffers from mental illness, is the mother of the little girl Devi (Baby Akshaya) born due to the rape. Guru (Vignesh) is a TV serial and commercial actor who wants to become a cinema hero. One day, he finds his friend Julie (Aruna Giridhar) dead in her home. The police arrested him for killing her. Jhansi (Monal), who loves Guru since her childhood, decides to get him out of prison and conducts an investigation alone.

He made numerous natural history expeditions to northern Africa. He donated his various collections to the National Museum of Natural History in France. He was the second son of Henri Peyerimhoff de Fontenelle ((1838‚Äì1877)), mayor of Colmar, France. His older brother was Henri de Peyerimhoff (1871‚Äì1953), a French civil servant and industrialist. Peyerimhoff obtained his education at the Coll√®ge Saint- Sigisbert in Nancy, and later at the √âcole des Eaux et For√™ts in the same city. In 1896 he was appointed to the Eaux et For√™ts of Senones (in the Vosges). It was here, while making his first investigations into the cave fauna of the Lower Alps, that Peyerimhoff became friends with J. Sainte-Claire Deville, at that time an artillery lieutenant, but who would go on to become a noted entomologist. Peyerimhoff later moved to Algeria to work at the Forest Research Station there. In 1935, he was appointed director of the institution, a role that he kept until his retirement in 1937. At that point, Peyerimhoff was an honorary inspector general of the Water and Forests Department and also an officer of the Legion of Honor. During World War II, he was called to direct the Forest Research Station du Bois de Boulogne in Algeria. Only in 1950, due to illness, did Peyerimhoff finally abandon his interests in this area. ==Abbreviation (botany)== (See the list of all genres and species described by this author in IPNI.) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Wikispecies has an article about Paul de Peyerimhoff de Fontenelle.

The song reached number five on the UK chart, and reached the top ten in Australia, but was not released as a single in the US. It was composed by John, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone. The music for the song was largely based on a South African folk tune called 'Isonto Lezayone', which was recorded in 1963 by Phineas Mkhize. The whistle riff and chorus melody are borrowed from this piece, and Mkhize is given a songwriting credit for the song on this basis. 'Passengers' had the most co-writers for an original Elton John song at that point, only to be out-done by John's 'Wrap Her Up' from the following year. It has been suggested that Taupin's lyric has an anti- apartheid message behind ithttp://eltonjohnallsongslist.blogspot.co.uk. John performed the song live during his 1985 tour of the UK, with a slightly re- arranged version of the track, making use of the brass section he utilized for the tour. The song has seemingly been discarded by John, having not been played live since then, as of 2019. The song was included on his 1990 UK release 'The Very Best of Elton John', but has not been included on any compilation since. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Simon Milne, was filmed in St. Tropez, France.

The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) final report said regional transit authority Sound Transit failed to take steps to mitigate a curve at the accident location, and inadequately trained the train's engineer. The train was making the inaugural run of the Point Defiance Bypass, a new passenger rail route south of Tacoma, Washington operated by Amtrak in partnership with state and local authorities in Oregon and Washington, on right-of-way owned and operated by Sound Transit. The bypass was intended to reduce congestion and separate passenger and freight traffic, and was designed for faster speeds and shorter travel times (saving ten minutes from Seattle to Portland) than the previous route used by Cascades. The lead locomotive and all twelve cars derailed at 07:33 local time while approaching a bridge over Interstate 5 (I-5). The trailing locomotive remained on the rails. A number of automobiles on southbound I-5 were crushed and three people on board the train died. The train derailed a short distance from where the new route merges with the previous route. Preliminary data from the data recorder showed that the train was traveling at , nearly over the speed limit, when the incident happened. == Background == Overview of new Amtrak Cascades inland route (red; to the south), showing accident location, and old shoreline route (green; to the north) The Point Defiance Bypass was built from 2010 to 2017 as a replacement for the BNSF mainline that runs along the Puget Sound coast between the Nisqually River and Tacoma. The $181 million bypass, using an inland route that follows I-5, was built by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) on right of way owned by Sound Transit, the regional transit authority. The Amtrak Cascades service is a joint effort of WSDOT and Oregon Department of Transportation, with Amtrak as a contracting operator. In the wake of the December 18 derailment, the safety of the bypass was questioned by elected officials. The 2006 Cascades corridor plan recommended that the curve and overpass where the derailment occurred be replaced with a straighter alignment, costing $412 million. The final plans omitted the overpass replacement, with a smaller budget of $180 million granted for the entire project. == Derailment == Schematic site overview. The lead locomotive is the leftmost vehicle and stopped in the southbound lanes of Interstate 5. The train's rear locomotive is top-right. One car lies inverted under the bridge (shown in blue). At 07:33 local time (15:33 UTC), the leading locomotive and twelve cars of the southbound Amtrak Cascades number 501 passenger train derailed southwest of DuPont. DuPont is about south of Seattle and about south of the Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord (JBLM) main gate. The train derailed while approaching the railroad bridge across southbound I-5 near Mounts Road, which contains a left-hand bend. The lead locomotive, a new Siemens Charger No. 1402, and six rail cars went down the embankment to the west of the bridge (to the train's right, in the original direction of travel); the locomotive ended up on I-5 and spilled about of fuel. Two further cars ended up on the bridge span, and three cars went off the railroad bridge abutment on the opposite side, some onto I-5. The trailing General Electric Genesis P42DC locomotive, No. 181, remained on the tracks. Seven vehicles, including two trucks, were damaged by the derailed cars of the train. The southbound train was operating between Seattle and Portland, Oregon, on the first revenue service run of the Cascades on the new, faster Point Defiance Bypass route between Lacey and Tacoma. The train was running about 30 minutes behind schedule. Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson said that positive train control was not active on the track, a factor cited in two accidents along a curve in Spuyten Duyvil and a similar crash along a curve in Port Richmond, Philadelphia. == Casualties == There were five Amtrak employees, a technician from train manufacturer Talgo, and 77 passengers on board the train at the time of the derailment. Three passengers were killed, 57 passengers and crew members were injured. Eight road vehicles were damaged in the accident. Of the ten people in them, eight were injured. All three deceased were in the seventh coach of the train. Ten of the injured were in serious condition, and thirteen had moderate or minor injuries. In total, more than 80 people were injured. Treatment was provided at hospitals including Madigan Army Medical Center at JBLM, Providence St. Peter Hospital in Olympia, St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, Tacoma General Hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, and St. Clare Hospital in Lakewood. Three soldiers from JBLM, including a Madigan Army Medical Center nurse, left their vehicles to give medical assistance to people trapped inside the train cars, and help them escape. The three passengers killed in the derailment were train enthusiasts, including two members of rail advocacy group All Aboard Washington. == Aftermath == WSDOT-recommended detour routes on the evening of December 18 extended more than for the northern route with a travel time over 90 minutes, or alternatively, a southern route of , with a travel time over 2 hours. Under normal conditions, driving from Tacoma to Olympia takes about 30 minutes. Amtrak temporarily suspended service for south of Seattle for several hours because of the accident, resuming on the former coast route and the old Tacoma station. Southbound automobile traffic was rerouted away from I-5 by WSDOT until the site was cleared of debris and inspected. On December 18, JBLM allowed southbound traffic through from DuPont to State Route 510 near Lacey. WSDOT announced on December 21 that it would not resume Amtrak service on the Point Defiance Bypass until positive train control is implemented in 2018. The accident caused at least $40 million in damage, including the cost of the trainset, damage to vehicles, and damage to the overpass. Cleanup and freeway reopening Some of the wrecked train cars were removed by trucks on December 19. Two southbound lanes of I-5 were reopened on December 20, with a reduced speed limit, as the cleanup and investigation continued. By the morning of December 21, all lanes of the freeway had been reopened. Fate of rolling stock Damage to the locomotive after the crash. Locomotive WDTX 1402 and all passenger stock was written off and scrapped. Locomotive AMTK 181 was undamaged and returned to service. ==Response== Within hours of the derailment, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency and activated the Washington Military Department's emergency operations center at Camp Murray, adjacent to JBLM, to coordinate the multi-agency response to the incident. A civilian support and reunification center was set up at DuPont City Hall. The Bloodworks Northwest blood bank called for donors after the crash. President Donald Trump said on Twitter a few hours after the accident that the derailment shows that his \\"soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be passed quickly.\\" He said \\"several trillion dollars\\" were spent in the Middle East while the transport infrastructure \\"crumble[s]\\". A second tweet said his \\"thoughts and prayers are with everyone\\", and he thanked first responders. The Associated Press and The New York Times reports of Trump's tweets said the accident had occurred on newly constructed track that was part of a recently upgraded line. The New York Times added that this project was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, an act signed by President Barack Obama that aimed to address infrastructure shortfalls. The New York Times editorial board said that the derailment is symptomatic of the Federal Government's failure to invest in infrastructure. It said that despite Trump seemingly acknowledging the problem, his administration's $630 million budget cuts to Amtrak, and a proposed plan to shift infrastructure costs down to state and local governments, would only serve to aggravate the problem. ==Investigation== NTSB engineers examine the locomotive event recorder two days after the derailment The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened an investigation into the accident and dispatched a 20-member Go Team to the crash site. The NTSB said its investigators would be on-site for seven to ten days. One aspect of the investigation is whether the engineer lost situational awareness. The NTSB said the train was traveling at at a point soon before it derailed. The speed limit on the curved track segment where the derailment occurred is , but the preceding track segment north of Mounts Road has a limit of . An initial review by the NTSB said that the train data recorders had been recovered from both locomotives. The recorder showed that the engineer had commented on the train's excessive speed six seconds before the derailment, and applied the brakes. The lead locomotive was traveling at when recording stopped. The NTSB said their investigation would take 12 to 24 months. A preliminary report into the accident was published on January 4, 2018. The NTSB interviewed the train's engineer, who suffered serious injuries, in January. He told investigators that he did not see the advance speed sign or milepost 18, mistakenly thinking he was at milepost 17. The engineer applied the train's brakes after seeing the final speed signpost, immediately north of the curve. In its final hearing on May 21, 2019, the NTSB blamed the crash on Sound Transit's failure to mitigate the curve, and for Sound Transit failing to adequately train the engineer to handle the situation on the new line and equipment. The NTSB stated that the crew was attentive and not distracted by conversation or cellular telephones. Although the engineer knew about the 30 mile-per-hour curve ahead, he had missed the single sign telling him to slow down; he also missed the milepost markers. As the train approached the curve, the train signaled a warning, but the engineer, being new to the Charger locomotive, had to study the console to decipher the warning. It was an overspeed warning: the train was moving faster than , the maximum speed on the line. (It was not warning the engineer about approaching the section; the system did not have that capability.) During the 20 seconds that the engineer was deciphering the warning, he was not looking outside and therefore could not see the approaching danger. When he did look up, it was too late. ==Litigation== In January 2020, the train's engineer filed a personal injury lawsuit against Amtrak, claiming that the company failed to properly train him to operate the train and to operate over the route, and that they failed to complete installation of Positive Train Control over the route. ==See also== *December 2013 Spuyten Duyvil derailment, commuter train that took a curve at far above its posted speed limit *List of accidents on Amtrak *List of American railroad accidents *List of rail accidents (2010‚Äìpresent) * Transportation safety in the United States ==ReferencesExternal links== *Amtrak derailment - Accident No. RRD18MR001  NTSB *Questions and answers about the derailment  WSDOT *: \\"Amtrak Cascades Train 501, operated by Amtrak, consisted of a Talgo constructed trainset containing 12 cars; (1) one power car, (1) one baggage car, (1) one lounge car, (1) one bistro car, (2) two business class cars, (6) six coach cars.

It was originally built by the Northern Pacific Railway ‚Äì the Tacoma‚ÄìLakewood segment in 1874 as part of the Prairie Line, and the Lakewood‚ÄìDuPont section in 1891. Passenger service on the lines declined after the 1914 completion of a flatter route along Puget Sound, and ended entirely in 1956. The route was identified as a passenger rail bypass in 1992. Sounder commuter rail service to Lakewood began in 2012. The $181.1 million improvement of the remaining section began construction in 2015 as part of general improvements to the Amtrak Cascades corridor to eliminate the slow and winding route along the Puget Sound shoreline that included single-track tunnels. It was opened for Amtrak service on December 18, 2017, but the first Cascades train derailed at speed on a bridge over Interstate 5 while traveling southbound near DuPont. Amtrak service was rerouted to the old line pending investigation and upgrades. ==Route== The Point Defiance Bypass begins at a junction with the BNSF mainline near the Nisqually River bridge, east of Lacey. The railway crosses over Interstate 5 and travels along the freeway's north side through DuPont and Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord (JBLM). In Lakewood, it stops at a train station and turns north, merging with the Tacoma Rail mainline. Trains continue north through South Tacoma station and follow South Tacoma Way as it makes a gradual turn to the east. The bypass passes under State Route 16 and over Pacific Avenue while approaching Tacoma Dome Station. The railway travels over the Dome District area of Tacoma along a high trestle bridge and rejoins the BNSF mainline near the Puyallup River bridge. The project included the construction of five upgraded at-grade crossings and several grade-separated overpasses and underpasses along Interstate 5 in Dupont and near JBLM. ==History== A section of the Point Defiance Bypass in Lakewood, seen from Lakewood station The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) opened the Prairie Line ‚Äì part of its planned transcontinental mainline ‚Äì through Yelm and Lakewood on January 5, 1874. On May 1, 1891, the NP-owned Tacoma, Olympia & Grays Harbor Railroad completed a branch of the Northern Pacific between Lakeview (near modern Lakewood) and Lacey, passing through the Fort Lewis military base. By 1914, the NP (plus the GN and UP under trackage rights) operated 11 daily round trips over the Prairie Line, plus 3 daily round trips to Grays Harbor over the newer branch. Just south of Tacoma, the Prairie Line had a section of difficult 2.2% grade. In 1914, the NP opened the Point Defiance Line along the coast of Puget Sound and around Point Defiance. Part of the line to Grays Harbor was used by the new line; the section between DuPont and Lakewood became the American Lake Branch. Most NP and UP passenger and freight service moved to the newer, flatter line. On August 8, 1943, the GN moved its remaining Seattle‚ÄìPortland round trip to the Point Defiance Line, leaving only NP trains to Grays Harbor on the old line. Those trains were discontinued in February 1956, leaving the American Lake Branch and the Tacoma‚ÄìTenino section of the Prairie Line used only by freight service. The GN and NP were merged into the Burlington Northern Railway (BN) in 1970. In 1973, the BN increased clearances on the Point Defiance Line, allowing trains carrying Boeing aircraft parts to use that line. Long-distance freight service was removed from the Prairie Line, and it was abandoned south of Yelm in 1986. The Point Defiance Line, however, proved not to be ideal for Amtrak passenger service. Mudslides frequently closed the line, and the 1988 conversion of two tunnels to single track to further increase freight clearances limited capacity. In 1992, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) identified the American Lake Branch and the northern section of the Prairie Line as a potential alignment for a new Amtrak bypass of Point Defiance. In April 2003, the BNSF Railway (the successor to the BN) removed the remaining of the Prairie Line in Tacoma from service, thus allowing Sound Transit to build the Tacoma Link without an expensive level crossing. In return, Sound Transit funded repairs to the American Lake Branch for continued BNSF freight service to Fort Lewis, while Tacoma Rail took over freight service on the line in Tacoma. BNSF sold the Tacoma‚ÄìLakewood section to Sound Transit for commuter rail use in 2004 for $13.4 million, with BNSF retaining a freight easement. WSDOT published a long-range plan for the Amtrak Cascades corridor in 2006, outlining a series of projects needed before reactivating passenger rail service on the line. The projects, known collectively as the Point Defiance Bypass, included rebuilding of tracks and ties, a new signal system, improvements to at-grade crossings, and a $230 million bridge to replace a viaduct crossing Interstate 5 on a tight curve near the Nisqually River. The project ultimately did not include the Nisqually bridge, which became the site of the 2017 derailment. The Point Defiance Bypass project underwent environmental review in 2006 and started final design in 2007. The $181 million project was funded through transportation packages previously approved by the state legislature, as well as the federal stimulus package of 2009. Officials from Lakewood and DuPont voiced their concerns about safety and increased traffic congestion resulting from the bypass's construction, leading to concessions in the final design by the state. Construction began in 2009, with the northern end connected to a former UP line at Tacoma Dome Station, and Sounder commuter rail service to Lakewood began in October 2012. Construction on the Nisqually‚ÄìLakewood segment began in 2015 and was completed in late 2016. Testing of trains at full speeds of up to was conducted from January 2017 to December 2017. The bypass is planned to carry twelve daily Amtrak trains on the Cascades and Coast Starlight. Sound Transit plans to extend Sounder commuter rail service to DuPont in 2036, with an additional station at Berkeley Street. 2017 derailment On December 18, 2017, during the inaugural southbound run of the Cascades on the Point Defiance Bypass, the train derailed while crossing Interstate 5 near the Nisqually River. Of the 84 people aboard (77 passengers and 7 employees) on board, 3 were killed. After the accident, which closed the bypass to Amtrak service, WSDOT announced that it would not resume service until the full implementation of positive train control (PTC). (Sounder service to Lakewood continued to operate.) Service was then scheduled to restart in early 2019. The PTC system was fully installed by late 2018 and activated on the Point Defiance Bypass in March 2019. The National Transportation Safety Board presented its final report on the accident on May 21, 2019, with WSDOT issuing a subsequent statement that they would need time to analyze the report before resuming service on the line. The restoration of Amtrak service on the Point Defiance Bypass is tentatively scheduled for 2020, after agreements with local officials and the arrival of new Talgo trainsets. ==See also== * ==References== Category:Rail infrastructure in Washington (state) Category:Transportation in Pierce County, Washington Category:Railway lines opened in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Point Defiance Bypass"},{"id":"56081306","text":"Central figures of the Nativity, Metropolitan Museum of Art Adoration of the Magi, National Gallery, 19 x 47.4 cm Nativity, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 7 3/8 x 17 1/8 in. (18.7 x 43.5 cm) Two small paintings in London and New York are believed to come from the same predella, and are attributed to Zanobi Strozzi, a Florentine painter who was probably a pupil of Fra Angelico. They are an Adoration of the Magi in the National Gallery in London, and a Nativity (strictly an Adoration of the Child) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. They date to about 1433‚Äì34 and are in tempera and gold on panel.Christiansen; Gordon, 422‚Äì24 Various suggestions have been made as to the authorship of the panels, and the polytych altarpiece of which the predella formed the lowest part. The two owning museums now agree that these two panels are the only ones to survive from the same predella.Christiansen; Gordon, 422 The most likely solution is that the altarpiece had as its main panel a Virgin and Child now in the Hermitage Museum, and side panels of saints, namely: \\"on the left, Saints Nicholas, Lawrence, and John the Baptist (Hyde Collection, Glens Falls, New York), and, on the right, Saints Zenobius, Francis, and Anthony of Padua (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven).\\"Kanter and Palladino, 242‚Äì245, with a reconstruction illustrated at 244; Christiansen (quoted); Yale. That the three top panels belong together is rather conclusively shown by the end Yale robe running over into the Hermitage panel. There was probably at least one more panel, as the centre of the predella. This might have been a Marriage of the Virgin, or an Annunciation,Christiansen other core scenes in cycles of the Life of the Virgin. Both John the Baptist and Zenobius were patron saints of Florence, where according to tradition Zenobius had been the first bishop, and Saints Francis and Anthony were Franciscans, suggesting that the altarpiece was made for a Franciscan church in the city. The other two saints, Nicholas and Lawrence, may have been the name saints of people connected to the commission, or reflect the dedication of the original chapel or church.Kanter and Palladino, 245; Christiansen It remains possible that Fra Angelico himself had a role in the altarpiece; possibly it was sub-contracted by him to Strozzi and perhaps others.Kanter and Palladino, 242‚Äì245 ==London Adoration of the Magi== The painting shows iconographical details found in other Florentine paintings of the period. Saint Joseph holds the gift of the eldest king, who kneels before the baby Jesus. The gifts of the other two kings are covered with veils.Gordon, 422‚Äì24 The flowers in the grassy foreground relate to Strozzi's illuminations.Gordon, 424 The scale of the figures and horses is not consistent, and one scholar divides the attribution between Strozzi and Battista di Biagio Sanguigni (aka the Master of 1419), with whom Strozzi lived until 1438. In general the style imitates Fra Angelico's style of the 1430s,Gordon, 422 and another possibility is that he painted Saint Joseph and the sitting and kneeling figures, generally recognised as being of better quality, while Strozzi contributed the rather cruder other standing figures, which can be considered more typical of his style.Kanter and Palladino, 243‚Äì245 File:Zanobi Strozzi - Saints Nicholas, Lawrence and Johtn the Baptist.JPGSaints Nicholas, Lawrence and John the Baptist, Hyde Collection, Glens Falls, New York File:Zanobi strozzi, madonna col bambino in trono.JPGVirgin and Child, Hermitage Museum File:Yale strozzi.jpgSaints Zenobius, Francis and Anthony of Padua, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, 76.5 x 47 cm (30 1/8 x 18 1/2 in. ==NotesReferences== *Christiansen, Keith, Met \\"catalogue\\" entry, on painting's web page, 2012 *Gordon, Dillian, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Fifteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume 1, 2003, *Kanter, Laurence, and Pia Palladino, with contributions by Magnolia Scudieri, Carl Brandon Strehlke, Victor M.

Leanse has spent 35 years working with leaders at Apple, Google, Facebook, as an entrepreneur, and with dozens of startups. She‚Äôs a writer on topics of workplace dynamics and a Stanford instructor. Her work has spanned entrepreneurship, corporate leadership, investing, and strategy consulting. An alum of Apple (1981 ‚Äì 1990), she launched the company's first online activity through the User Group Connection, an initiative she founded at Apple in 1985. She was employed by Google from 2008 through 2010 and created a social list- making app Lists by 222do for the initial launch of the Facebook development platform (2007). Her article about the word \\"Just\\" and its use across genders has received nearly 5 million views on Business Insider (2017). It was originally published via Women 2.0, an organization she advised from 2012 through 2016. She spoke on \\"Happiness by Design\\" at TEDx Berkeley in 2016. Leanse is an instructor at Stanford University and teaches through the university's Continuing Studies program. Leanse is a contributing writer to Arianna Huffington's Thrive Global platform. == Early life == Leanse was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in the Fairglen neighborhood of San Jose, CA. Her father, John Gerald Petry, was a WWII veteran and mechanical engineer who held several patents for automotive lift technology. Her mother, Kathleen Minch Petry, was a secretary and hospital administrator. She graduated from Presentation High School in 1976 and was named a Bank of America Bicentennial Scholar and was also a National Merit Scholar. She studied art and international business and graduated from San Diego State University with a BA in International Marketing in 1981. Upon graduating she was in a serious bicycle accident and returned to San Jose to recover at her parents‚Äô home. It was at that time that she sent an application to Apple and received a rejection letter, which she challenged and was hired in November 1981. Shortly after graduating she was in a serious bicycle accident and returned to San Jose to recover at her parents' home. It was at that time that she applied to Apple and received a rejection letter, which she challenged. She was hired in November 1981 and wrote about the experience in a 2014 article about the Apple logo and its impact. Her first job at Apple was as an International Communications Specialist in the Intercontinental division, which distributed and promoted Apple products, primarily the Apple II and Apple III and related accessories, everywhere in the world except for the US and Europe. She launched Apple‚Äôs first formal product communications (they were newsletters) to these regions and introduced Spanish language versions of these communications in 1986. She also did product launches in the markets they served. She joined the extended Macintosh team in 1983 as Product Manager for international Macintosh accessories, including local-language keyboards, CCITT and CSA modems, regionally-compliant printers, and power supplies. In 1985 she was asked to interview for a role as Apple‚Äôs first ‚ÄúUser Evangelist‚Äù ‚Äì a response to frustration in the Apple II installed base that Apple had abandoned, its earliest and most faithful users as it began to focus increasingly on the Macintosh. John Sculley served as a sponsor for this position and she accepted the role in September 1985. == Technology career ==  Apple  Ellen Petry Leanse Apple employee badge. 1988 User Group Advisory Council. Appearing in the chair to the right is Ellen Petry Leanse. In her nine years at Apple Leanse served on the Macintosh launch team (1984) and led the company‚Äôs pioneering work in creating online communities. Leanse became an Apple employee in November 1981 and became Apple's first User Evangelist in September 1985. The User Group track she established at MacWorld conferences brought Apple product leaders including Bill Atkinson, Alan Kay, Guy Kawasaki together with users to exchange information on product priorities and direction. Leanse led and grew this organization through 1990, when she left Apple. Her charter was to address the frustration directed at Apple from the Apple II and Apple III installed base - individuals, business people, government officials and education leaders from around the world who had come to feel abandoned by Apple as it turned its attention to the Macintosh. Image of old Apple mug provided to the Advisory Council Ellen Petry Leanse guided the design of this vintage Apple mug, working with Apple's Creative Services team. She states, \\"It would not meet Apple design standards today but it sure worked at the time.\\" The \\"Thanks\\" is a tribute to the Advisory Council Ellen Petry brought together to talk with Apple about ways of working with User Groups at the time. In 1985 Leanse became Apple‚Äôs first ‚ÄúUser Evangelist,‚Äù charged to forge relationships with Apple‚Äôs growing, and increasingly divided, Apple II/Apple III and Macintosh installed base. Her early work connected her with technology influencers including NASA‚Äôs David Lavery, the Boston Computer Society‚Äôs Jonathan Rotenberg, and the Berkeley Macintosh User Group‚Äôs Raines Cohen and Reese Jones. Forming Apple‚Äôs User Group Connection, Leanse established the first online interaction between Apple and its users in November 1985. This work leveraged existing networks including Usenet Arpanet/Darpanet, The Well, and private Bulletin Board Systems to bring product updates, live interviews, software updates, and other resources with Apple communities worldwide. Active participants included NASA‚Äôs David Lavery, the Boston Computer Society‚Äôs Jonathan Rotenberg, and the Berkeley Macintosh User Group‚Äôs Raines Cohen and Reese Jones. The User Group track she established at MacWorld conferences brought Apple product leaders including Bill Atkinson, Alan Kay, Guy Kawasaki together with users to exchange information on product priorities and direction. Eighteen months after the release of the Macintosh, owners of Apple II and Apple III personal computers expressed frustration with the limited development of new features for these products. Seeking a commitment to ongoing support of utilities and software, users contacted Apple, published complaints in computer publications, and spoke out at public events such as MacWorld and other trade shows to ask for a future path. Furthermore, as Macintosh users sought more direct means of learning about innovations and capabilities of the Mac and its software (in 1985, standards for customer support depended primarily on written/mailed correspondence) Macintosh users began to ask Apple and software providers for faster access to technical and usability information, as well as upgrades. Apple CEO John Sculley responded by creating a position for a \\"User Group Evangelist\\" charged with realigning Apple with its active user community through communication and identification of mutually-beneficial product development. In September 1985, Apple established the Apple User Group Connection, led by Leanse, in response to input from users in community User Groups including Boston Computer Society and Berkeley Macintosh Users Group, along with user communities within educational, science, and business organizations. AUGC was formed in response to concerns from users in community user groups that, with the release of the Macintosh, development for existing Apple II and Apple III computers were compromised. The idea was for Apple to share information with its user community directly, rather than through the more traditional support and distribution channels. The organization successfully encouraged Apple to pursue early internet technology such as bulletin board systems and ARPANET. Leanse's work in the UGC guided her to establish Apple's first connection with users via the early roots of the web ‚Äì ARPANET, The WELL, Bulletin board systems, etc. It was groundbreaking work that pioneered much of what is possible and done today through social networks and other online communities. Leanse grew and ran the group through 1990 when she left Apple to focus on her personal life. Many of the early UGC contributors have gone on to be real creators and contributors in their own rights. NASA's Dave Lavery, through his work with Apple User Groups within NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab, was an active influencer of the User Group Connection's early progress. The early days of Leanse's role aligned her with Apple's passionate user group community and gave her an eye-opening window into a new world: the early roots of the World Wide Web. Through connected BBS networks, Arpa and Darpanet, The WELL, Usenet, and other systems, thousands of Apple users around the world were sharing information and support with each other and using their collective knowledge to make the most of their Apple systems. These pioneering users began to experiment with information-sharing through a few leads in this network, and quickly realized the power that this network had to speed product information, updates, and support to people, using much less effort than the standard method ‚Äì the U.S. Mail ‚Äì would have allowed. AUGC produced promotional videos for Apple products. In April 2012, PandoDaily included Leanse as one of the top 5 tech marketers. In the article she is attributed as being the pioneer of online community.  Google  She was an employee of Google between 2008 and 2010, charged with leading marketing communications for the Google G-Suite. ==Educator== In 2013 Leanse joined Stanford University‚Äôs Continuing Studies faculty to teach the neuroscience of innovation through on-campus and online courses. She currently teaches an online course, \\"Unleashing Creative Innovation and Building Great Products\\" for Stanford, combining principles of \\"cognitive neuroscience, design frameworks and evolutionary biology,\\" Her work and course at Stanford were featured in the article, \\"Former Google and Apple exec now challenges Stanford students to design products that make people happy\\" via CNBC. ==Writer== She has published multiple articles on brain-aware leadership, well-being, gender, and interpersonal dynamics. Her articles have been globally syndicated, receiving up to 8 million views and guiding readers everywhere to new levels of self-awareness and empowerment. ==Author==  The Happiness Hack  Leanse is a study of neuroscience and \\"brain hacking\\". Her book The Happiness Hack, published by Sourcebooks in 2017, explores concepts of attention, connection, and life satisfaction through perspectives on applied neuroscience.  Summary  The Happiness Hack uses the lens of evolutionary biology and neurochemistry to explore how routine behaviors in modern life can interfere with happiness ‚Äì and how to ‚Äúhack back,‚Äù improving well-being and life satisfaction. The book discusses various ideas and solutions that are rooted in neuroscience, examining the role of the brain in creating our point of view and how it affects our focus, purpose, and the achievement of true satisfaction, and how opening to new possibilities of thinking differently can help an individual \\"hack into happiness\\". The Happiness Hack is a brain-aware guide to bringing more enjoyment, success, and happiness to our daily, and long-term, lives. By simplifying basic concepts of neuroscience, The Happiness Hack offers insights into stress, distraction, tech addiction, and a sense of disconnection in ways that let readers identify common mental tendencies ‚Äì and guide the brain toward alternate paths.  Influences  Leanse has acknowledged the work of neuroleadership influencer David Rock in her book. She also acknowledges the work of Stanford researcher and neuroanatomist Sarah Eagleman, who provided scientific review on the book.  Reception  The Happiness Hack launched at a Kepler‚Äôs Literary Foundation event to a live audience and global livestream. It was selected by Barnes and Noble as a featured book for the 2017 holiday season. The Happiness Hack was named one of \\"The 12 Best Productivity Books of 2017\\" by Evernote.  Press  The Happiness Hack was prominently mentioned in the article, \\"Former Google and Apple exec now challenges Stanford students to design products that make people happy\\" via CNBC. ==Achievements== In 2012 Leanse was named a 'Silicon Valley Woman of Influence' by Business Journal. Leanse has been a Board member for D-Rev, the Children‚Äôs Health Council, and the Menlo Park Atherton Education Foundation (serving the Menlo Park City School District). ==References External links == *Former Google and Apple exec now challenges Stanford students to design products that make people happy: CNBC (2018) *\\"Just\\" Say No: Thrive Global (2017) *Mac User Groups Fade in Number and Influence, but Devotees Press On: New York Times (2015) *Former Google and Apple Exec Says This Word Can Damage Your Credibility: Business Insider (2015) *Do It Yourself Job Creation: Inc.

He was suffect consul at some yet undetermined nundinium in the first century.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 209, 219 According to Pliny the Elder, a Glitius was the first husband of Vistilia, famous for having seven children by six husbands; she had a son by him, but Pliny does not provide the child's name.Pliny, Naturalis Historia, VII.39 Ronald Syme identifies this son (born c. 15 BC) as the father of Glitius Gallus.Syme, \\"Domitius Corbulo\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 60 (1970), p. 31 His tombstone was erected by his wife, Maximila Agnata, at Faleria Nova in Etruria. == Career == A fragmentary inscription from Faleria provides us with details of the earlier portion of his cursus honorum. = ILS 999 Gallus began in his teens as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4f Soon after he became a salius Palatinus, a member of a priesthood that was reserved to patricians. These two facts led Werner Eck to speculate that Gallus was adlected into the patrician order;Eck, Senatoren von Vespasian bis Hadrian (M√ºnchen: C.H. Beck'sche, 1970), pp. 107f however, other experts, such as Hermann Dessau, Syme, and Valerie Maxfield, argue that Gallus was a patrician by birth.Syme asserts that it was his father who was adlected into the patrician order. As Maxfield points out, if he was a patrician by birth, it would explain the absence of a military tribunate from this inscription.Maxfield, V (1972) The Dona Militaria of the Roman Army (Durham theses, Durham University, 1972), vol. 1 p. 25 The inscription continues its list with the mention that Gallus was quaestor in attendance to the emperor at the time; the omission of a name suggests the emperor was one under damnatio memoriae, leading Syme to identify this unnamed emperor with \\"one of the ephemeral emperors of 69.\\"Syme \\"P. Calvisius Ruso. One Person or Two?\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 56 (1984), p. 175 This was followed by the republican magistracy of praetor, omitting mention of plebeian tribune or aedile; patricians were excused from needing to hold either office in order to advance to the praetorship. After this office he was admitted to the flamines Augustales. Then, for unknown reasons, Gallus received dona militaria in the form of a single hasta pura (or headless spear) from the emperors Vespasian and Titus during their censorship in the years 73-74. \\"No military posts are recorded in the career of Glitius Gallus so the fact that the decoration was awarded by Vespasian and Titus suggests that it was a reward, not for military service, but for adherence to the Flavian cause in A.D. 69,\\" Maxfield writes. \\"This would explain why there was only one hasta and none of the coronae and vexilla normally awarded to a senator.\\" The surviving portion ends with mention of his consulship. The date of his consulship is disputed. One interpretation is based on the fact that the second inscription from Faleria refers to Vespasian without the adjective divus (\\"divine\\", attesting to his posthumous promotion to a god) -- which would point to a date before Vespasian's death in the year 79. On the other hand, Syme argues that there are examples of Vespasian being referred to after his death without the word divus; thus its omission does not necessarily mean the inscription was made before Vespasian's death. This allowed Syme to identify Glitius Gallus with an otherwise unknown Gallus who was suffect consul of the year 84. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome ","title":"Publius Glitius Gallus"},{"id":"56081607","text":"Alberto Solanas (born 6 November 1955) is a Spanish athlete.

In the male, the clypeus and labrum are yellow, and the antennae are very long, being as long as the head and body combined. The female's antennae are shorter. ==Distribution and habitat== This bee occurs in the Palearctic realm, ranging from Western Europe to as far east as Siberia and China. In Britain it is patchily distributed in southern England and Wales. In favoured locations it can be quite numerous and tends to nest in aggregations. It typically is present near the coast in bare areas and short turf, in open grassy areas in woodland and sometimes on heathlands. ==Ecology== The adult female prepares a burrow, usually in clay soil, kneading the walls to make them smooth. The nest is provisioned with a mixture of pollen and honey made into a paste and an egg is laid on this. The larva feeds on the paste when it hatches. The winter is usually spent as a pre-pupa in the burrow, pupating the following spring and emerging from the burrow as an adult soon thereafter. On leaving the burrow, the male passes its long antennae through a notch on the tarsus (first leg segment), by which means any adhering membranes are scraped off. However some individuals may pass the winter in the adult state. The bees are on the wing between May and July. In the Mediterranean region, the male is a pollinator of the bee orchid Ophrys apifera. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Apinae Category:Hymenoptera of Asia Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Eucera longicornis"},{"id":"56081880","text":"General Sir John Wright Guise, 3rd Baronet (20 July 1777 ‚Äì 1 April 1865) was a British Army general. ==Life== Guise was born at Elmore, Gloucestershire, the second son of John Guise of Highnam Court, who was created a baronet in 1783, and died in 1794; his mother was the daughter and heiress of Thomas Wright.

Chief of Army Staff Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag paying homage to mortal remains of Late Rifleman Bishal Gurung of 31 GR, martyred in Thangdhar Sector in Kashmir on 25 May 2015, in New Delhi Indian Army operations in Jammu and Kashmir include security operations such as Operation Rakshak which began in 1990, Operation Sarp Vinash in 2003 and Operation Randori Behak in 2020. Other operations include humanitarian missions such as Operation Megh Rahat and operations with a social aim such as Operation Goodwill and Operation Calm Down. The Indian Army works in tandem with the other arms of the Indian Armed Forces and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir such as during Mission Sahayata or joint operations. ==Security Impact==  Operation Rakshak  Operation Rakshak is an ongoing counter- insurgency and counter-terrorism operation started during the height of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir in June 1990. The operation adapted itself from being merely a \\"show of strength\\" in 1990 to encompassing more areas in 1991 such as orders \\"not to enter the houses of civilians\\", \\"not to smoke in religious places\\" and \\"not to damage standing crops\\". 753 Indian army personnel died during Operation Rakshak between 2007 and 2015. Major Mohit Sharma, who was killed while performing duties under Operation Rakshak, was posthumously awarded India's highest peacetime gallantry award ‚ÄòAshok Chakra‚Äô on 15 August 2009. Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala was also killed during Operation Rakshak 18 November 2017, and was posthumously awarded the Ashok Chakra 25 January 2018. The Operation Rakshak Memorial is located in Badami Bagh Cantonment, Srinagar.  Operation All Out  Operation All Out (OAO) a joint offensive launched by Indian security forces in 2017 to flush out militants and terrorists in Kashmir until there is complete peace in the state. Operation All-Out includes the Indian Army, CRPF, Jammu and Kashmir Police, BSF and IB. It was launched against numerous militant groups including Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen and Al-Badr. The operation was initiated with the consent of Ministry for Home Affairs Government of India following the unrest in 2016 due to the death of Burhan Wani and subsequent militant and terrorist attacks in the region such as the Amarnath Yatra terror attack on 10 July 2017 in which eight Hindu pilgrims were killed and at least 18 others injured. On 14 January 2019, the Jammu and Kashmir Governor, Satya Pal Malik, said that there was no such thing as Operation All Out and that the phrase was a misnomer:  Operation Calm Down  Operation Calm Down was started by the Indian army in Jammu and Kashmir following the aftermath of the death of Burhan Wani in July 2016 which had led to unrest in Kashmir in which more than 90 civilians and 2 security personnel were killed and thousands injured. It was started in September 2016. Over 4000 additional troops were deployed as part of Operation Calm Down to bring back order to the region, but direct instructions were given to the troops to use minimal force. The troops were mainly deployed in South Kashmir. Schools, shops and connectivity to some regions in Kashmir had been lost for over three months due to the unrest and militancy and Operation Calm Down aimed to undo this.  Operation Sarp Vinash  Operation Sarp Vinash (Snake Destroyer) was an operation undertaken by Indian army to flush out terrorists who made bases in the Hilkaka Poonch-Surankot area of the Pir Panjal range in Jammu and Kashmir during April‚ÄìMay 2003. In the operation the Indian army killed 64 terrorists belonging to various jihadist outfits. The system of hideouts used by the terrorists found during this operation was the largest ever in the known history of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. Over several years, terrorists of groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami, al- Badr and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had been building up safe houses and safe areas in strategic areas of the region of Pir Panjal in Poonch for many years over a region of 150 sq kilometers. The network of bunkers and shelters around the region known as Hill Kaka in Surankote numbered nearly over a hundred, and were intermingled with shelters used by local herdsmen. 9 Para-Commando Regiment were called to capture Peak 3689 in Hill Kaka after surveillance picked up footprints converging at one location. 13 terrorists were killed in this, the single largest number during operation Sarp Vinash. 6 Rashtriya Rifles, 163 Brigade, 100 Brigade and the 15 Corps were also called in for operations. From diaries captured from killed terrorists, the presence of a rudimentary counter-intelligence system of the terrorist organisations was revealed, which involved killing women and children who had given up information to Indian security forces. An extensive communications system using portable satellite phones was also found which allowed the terrorists to contact handlers in Pakistan and India. Paratrooper Sanjog Chhetri, 9 Para (SF), was awarded an Ashoka Chakra in 2004 posthumously for his role in the Operation Sarp Vinash in which he succumbed. During Operation Sarp Vinash, media claims of different Indian media houses about what actually happened during the operation were hyped and very contradictory. == Operation Sadbhavana (Goodwill) == Operation Sadbhavana, also referred to as Operation Goodwill has been launched in Jammu and Kashmir by the Indian Army under their Military Civic Action programmes, which are aimed at \\"Winning the Hearts and Minds\\" (WHAM) of the people in the region. Sadbhavna literally means 'harmony', therefore the operation can also be interpreted as Operation Harmony. The catchphrase of the operation is \\"Jawan aur Awam, Aman Hai Muqaam\\" (peace is the destination for both the people and the soldier).Dr. Arpita Anant.

Centre for Land Warfare Studies Welfare initiatives under Operation Sadbhavana include infrastructure development, medical care, women and youth empowerment, educational tours and sports tournaments among other initiatives. Over 450 crore rupees (70 million US$) has been directly spent on this programme and more funding provided through donors. The projects are planned according to the needs and desires of the local population and are handed over to the state government after successful initiation. 'Operation Sadbhavana' is a resolve by the Indian army to come closer to the population in Jammu and Kashmir and develop mutual faith and trust which the army gets across the rest of India.  Background  Operation Sadbhavana was officially launched in 1998, especially in rural areas near the Line of Control (LOC) where insurgency and militancy had caused destruction to property and a sense of alienation among the people of Jammu and Kashmir from the rest of India.  Initiatives  Kashmir Super-30 & Super-40 In 2013, the Indian Army teamed up with the New Delhi-based NGO, Centre for Social Responsibility and Leadership (CSRL), to launch the Super-30 initiative along the lines of the highly acclaimed and successful Super-30 concept started by Abhayanand in Bihar. Over time the initiative included more students and was subsequently called the Army Super-40, and soon will become the Army Super-50. Nine students of the 2016-17 Army Super-40 batch cleared the difficult IIT-JEE advanced examination. Various Indian organizations have provided funding for this project including Power Grid India contributing for the first batch, the Rural Electrification Council (REC) contributing for the second batch and the TATA Relief Committee funding the third batch. Schools The Indian Army has established 53 English medium Army Goodwill Schools in places in Jammu and Kashmir such as Rajouri, Poonch, Boniyar, Uri (Baramulla), Khanabal (Anantnag), Karu (Leh), Kargil and Chandigam (Kupwara). Assistance has also been provided to approximately 2700 public schools. These army schools are known to provide undisturbed and good quality education even during times of unrest. Army Goodwill Schools operating under the shelter of Operation Sadbhavana are educating more than 10000 students in the Kashmir Valley itself and over 14000 students in Jammu and Kashmir. Women Empowerment Centres Here women are taught various skills, awareness is raised about health and birth control, information regarding banking and loan procedures is imparted, basic education is imparted including operating computers, fashion designing and craft related skills. Under this initiative centers such as the Women's Vocational Training Centre, Poonch, Usha Fashion Design School, Baramulla and Women Empowerment Centre, Baramulla have been set up.A group of students from Poonch & Rajouri, who are on educational tour under ‚ÄòSadbhavana Operation‚Äô meeting the Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Farooq Abdullah, in New Delhi on 17 February 2012. Educational/Motivational Tours Pratibha Devisingh Patil with the members of the National Integration Tour for senior citizens of Operation Sadbhavana from Mendhar Tehsil, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi on March 9, 2009 Between 2012 and 2015, the Indian army conducted over 250 educational, national integration and capacity building tours (CBTs) and in each tour around 30 members are accommodated. The members of the tour get to visit places such as Punjab, Dehradun, Kerala, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Gopalpur, Agra and New Delhi which each tour being unique in its own way. The students also get to interact with students in India, administrative and government officials, which sometimes also includes the President and Prime Minister of India, as well as other figures. For many of the Kashmiri children on tours, they get the opportunity for the first time to travel outside Kashmir. Model Villages Model Villages set up under Operation Sadbhavana include Chandigam Model Village, Lolab (Kupwara) and Sagra Model Village, Mendhar (Poonch). Health Care Medical Camps are conducted on a regular basis by the Indian army. A Military Hospital in Kargil has also been set up which also caters to civilians with various services being free of cost. The Pritam Spiritual Foundation (Poonch) under Operation Sadbhavana has provided artificial limbs free of cost to over 3100 people who have been victims of militancy, mine blasts or crossborder firing. Under operation Sadbhavana veterinary aid camps and free treatment to civil animals are also offered. Sports The Indian army organises various sporting events in Jammu and Kashmir in coordination with local sports bodies. Some events that has been conducted under this initiative includes the Baramulla Girls Badminton League, Baramulla Cricket Premier League, Kupwara Premier Football League, Gingle Volleyball League. As many thirty two teams participated in the cricket tournament even as sixteen teams participated in the football tournament. == Operation Megh Rahat == In September 2014, the Kashmir region witnessed severe flooding in many areas. The rainfall and flooding resulted in people dying on both sides of the border. The Indian Armed Forces were deployed to conduct search, rescue, relief (NDRF and other local bodies also coordinated efforts). Nearly 30,000 troops were deployed. By mid-September, over 200,000 people were rescued by the Armed forces. While the Army's Northern Command response was called Operation Megh Rahat, the Armed Forces assistance as a whole was called Mission Sahayata.

The Indian Army changes it's strategy in summer which included redeployment as per summer infiltration routes along the LoC. Indian security forces, between January and May 2020, conducted 27 operations in which more than 64 terrorists were killed.

Located along Rƒ±htƒ±m Avenue, just east of the Galata Bridge, ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ± operates many ferries from Karak√∂y to Kadƒ±k√∂y, Bostancƒ±, √úsk√ºdar and to piers along the Golden Horn, as far west as Ey√ºp. Karak√∂y pier first opened in 1959, replacing an older pier on the Galata Bridge, and has been rebuilt three times since. It is located on the southern shore of the historic Galata neighborhood, known today as Karak√∂y. Connections to the historic T√ºnel funicular railway, Istanbul Tram and IETT city bus service is available, as well as connection to private Turyol ferry service at the nearby Turyol pier on the west side of the Galata Bridge. ==History== Ferry service from the Galata-Emin√∂n√º area to Kadƒ±k√∂y began in the mid-19th century from Emin√∂n√º Pier, on the southern shore of the Golden Horn. It wasn't until 1919 that a pier was opened on the Galata side of the inlet. This pier was built along the Galata Bridge and kept operating until 16 January 1959, when a storm destroyed the pier. The pier was rebuilt within the same year, but moved to a new location east of the bridge to its current location. This pier extended outwards on the water and was used for ferries primarily to Kadƒ±k√∂y. On 1 March 1966, two Soviet-flagged vessels, the M/T Lutsk and the M/T Kransky Oktiabr, collided near the Maiden's Tower causing 1,850 tons of oil to be spilled into the Bosporus.

Hicks sits on the Executive Committee of the Society for the History of Technology, and is an Associate Editor of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. Hicks's work focuses on issues of gender discrimination in the computing industry. Their book \\"Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge In Computing\\" reveals a switch in the 1960s and 1970s, where as computing roles became more powerful, women who dominated computer programming roles were systematically replaced with men. Hicks is known for drawing from this history when writing about contemporary gender issues in the computing industry. Hicks has also written about the early history of computer dating in the mainframe era, showing that women were at the forefront of creating computer dating businesses, contrary to what was previously thought. Hicks was appointed to an associate professorship with tenure at Illinois Institute of Technology in 2018. Prior to that they were an assistant professor of history of technology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, an assistant professor of history at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and had also taught as a visiting assistant professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina.

He is also a full-time faculty member in the Nanoelectronics and Nanomaterials group of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. He is known for his work on semiconductor theory and simulation, and on nanoscale quantum devices including quantum wires, quantum dots, and quantum wells. He studies and develops nanoscale materials with potential electronic and biological applications. ==Early life and education== Jean-Pierre Leburton was born on to Edmond Jules Leburton and Charlotte (Joniaux) Leburton in Li√®ge, Belgium. His father, at one time Prime Minister of Belgium, sparked Jean-Pierre Leburton's interest in physics. Jean- Pierre Leburton received his Licence (B.Sc.) in Physics in 1971 and his Doctorat (Ph.D.) in 1978 from the University of Li√®ge, Belgium. ==Career== Leburton worked as a research scientist at the Siemens AG research laboratory in Munich, Germany from 1979 to 1981. From 1981-1983, Leburton worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC) as a visiting assistant professor. In 1983 he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He became an associate Professor in 1987 and a full professor in 1991. He worked with Karl Hess, co-director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and became one of the original faculty members at the Beckman Institute in 1989. He held the Hitachi LTD Chair on Quantum Materials as a visiting professor at the University of Tokyo, Japan in 1992. He was also a visiting professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2000. In 2003, he was named the Gregory E. Stillman Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois. He has been the head of the Computational Electronics group at the Beckman Institute, and is currently a full-time faculty member in the Nanoelectronics and Nanomaterials group at the Beckman Institute. In 2008 he also became a professor of physics at UIUC. He has published more than 300 papers in technical journals and books. He is first editor of Phonons in semiconductor nanostructures (1993) and co-editor of Contemporary Topics in Semiconductor Spintronics (2017), among others. ==Research== Leburton has consistently been a pioneer, whose investigations of ideas begin at the farthest edges of what is possible. In addition to his own research team and other researchers at the University of Illinois, he collaborates with researchers at other institutions. His work has impact in a wide variety of areas, from computer design to medical diagnosis. In the 1980s and 1990s, Leburton began to study quantum wires. He developed simulation tools to study quantum confinement using a combination of solid-state physics principles and device simulation. He was the first to develop a technique for Monte Carlo simulation of non- linear transport in quantum wires. His simulation tools and physical models help to describe behavior of quantum wires, quantum dots, and quantum wells. He has studied the optical properties of superlattices and established the index of refraction in superlattices both experimentally and theoretically. Techniques for effective and inexpensive DNA sensing and sequencing are important to understanding disease mechanisms, identifying genetically-based conditions, and developing methods for personalized diagnosis and treatment. In 2004, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) defined a set of goals for DNA sensing and sequencing. Leburton participated with Greg Timp and others in the NIH's Revolutionary Genome Sequencing Technologies program, popularly known as the \\"$1000 genome\\" project. Their goal was to develop a synthetic nanopore for the sequencing of DNA. Leburton developed a novel approach, applying techniques from semiconductor technology to artificial nanopores. By 2006, they were able to create multilayer artificial membranes, using semiconductor materials, and to manipulate their ion flow. Nanopore sequencing has been classed as a third-generation sequencing technique, and considered one of the most promising approaches to meeting the NIH's \\"gold standard\\". Leburton, Klaus Schulten and others studied the structure and behavior of graphene nanoribbons, developing and testing models for hybrid solid-liquid systems. A two-dimensional material consisting of a single atomic layer of material, graphene has particularly interesting electronic properties. By manipulating graphene's electrical properties, researchers detected DNA molecules passing through a nanopore in a graphene layer embedded in a solid- state membrane. The electrical sensitivity of the graphene membrane varied depending on its geometry. Researchers could detect both rotational and positional conformation of the DNA strand. Leburton and his colleagues have since developed methods for detecting DNA methylation using nanopore sensors. This approach has important applications for the early detection of cancer. Leburton has been involved in ongoing study of spintronics in semiconductor nanostructures, including the movement of electrons through carbon nanotubes and the application of physics to all-carbon, cascaded spintronic circuit design. In a high electric field graphene may behave like a transistor. Leburton and others are studying graphene's behavior in such conditions, examining the possibility of developing biomolecules with nanoelectronic properties. ==Awards== * 2017, Lifetime membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) * 2011, Associate of the Royal Academy of Belgium * 2008, Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London * 2004, Quantum Devices Award, International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors * 2004, Gold Medal for Scientific Achievement, 75th Anniversary of the Alumnus Association of the University of Li√®ge, Belgium * 2003, named Gregory E.

It has a narrow, thick lipped mouth which is downward facing with two pairs of short barbels behind the mouth. One pair is rostral and one pair is maxillary and this is one of the features that distinguishes it from otherwise similar species. The dorsal fin origin is just in front of the origin of the pelvic fins and the dorsal fin is concave on its uppermargin, with a strong, smooth and stiff spine The caudal fin is deeply forked with small tuberclues on the rays. The overall colour is brown with a paler abdomen and it may have dark tips to the fins. It can grow to a maximum total length of 150 cm and a weight of 90 kg. However, the rod and reel caught record fish was roughly 59 kg and measured 169 cm in length while a fish caught by other means was 93 kg and 183 cm. The fish was originally described by Sykes https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/10449#/summary as having \\"a remarkable projecting prominence between the upper lip and nostrils, giving to the fish the appearance of being Roman-nosed.\\" Among the meristic features he described are: pectoral fin 16 rays; ventral 9 rays; dorsal 12 rays including first branched; anal fin 8 rays. In the 2013 paper On the identities of Barbus mussulah by Knight et al.,https://biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3750.3.1/0 which has been instrumental in clearing confusions between Hypselobarbus mussulah and Tor remadevii, the lateral line scale count is shown as 42, which clearly demonstrates this fish is not a mahseer (member of genus Tor). ==Distribution== The humpback mahseer is endemic to the Western Ghats in southern India. It has been recorded from the Krishna and possibly the Godavari in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala. It occurs in isolated pockets and the species' distribution is extremely fragmented and the total area of the species range is probably less than 500 km2. ==Habitat and ecology== The humpback mahseer shows a preference for the deeper stretches of clear, fast flowing large jungle streams and rivers in upland areas. It has an omnivorous diet and feeds on fish, crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fruits and algae. ==Conservation== The humpback mahseer is a sought after fish for anglers from the British colonial times to the present although the actual species involved was not determined as the original description of Barbus mussulah was not considered definitive. The species was redescribed as Hypselobarbus mussullah in the 1990s and 2016 and the species is the type specimen of the genus Hypselobarbus. When this species was classified under Tor mussulah, it was considered synonymous with the orange-finned mahseer (Tor remadevii), a highly endangered species endemic to the Kaveri basin, unlike the humpback which is endemic to the Krishna basin. When the humpback was reclassified to Hypselobarbus, the orange-finned mahseer was split from it for this reason. ==References== Category:Hypselobarbus Category:Fish described in 1839‚âà ","title":"Humpback mahseer"},{"id":"56082400","text":"Chen Guangyi (; born August 1933) is a Chinese retired politician. He served as Governor of Gansu Province, Communist Party Secretary of Fujian Province, and Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. ==Early life and career== Chen Guangyi was born in August 1933 in Putian, Fujian Province. After graduating from the Mechanical-Electrical Department of Northeast China Engineering College (now Northeastern University) in 1953, he began working as a technician at the Ministry of Metallurgy. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1959. ==Career in Gansu== By 1960 Chen was working in Gansu Province in Northwest China, serving as a deputy division head for the Heavy Industry Department of Gansu, and Director of the Production Office of the Northwest China Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Academy (1964‚Äì1975). In 1980 he was promoted to Deputy Director of the Gansu Provincial Planning Committee, In March 1983, he was promoted to Deputy Party Secretary of Gansu, and a month later, Governor of Gansu Province. As governor, he focused on poverty relief, soil erosion, and mining. He became a member of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in September 1985. ==Career in Fujian== In March 1986, Chen was transferred to his home province of Fujian to serve as its Party Chief. It was said that Jia Qinglin, a northerner, was intended to replace the retiring party chief Xiang Nan, but because of opposition from Fujianese cadres, the top post of the province went to Chen Guangyi instead. Chen's performance as the top leader of Fujian was mixed. Despite an infusion of Taiwanese investment starting in 1988 and a record level of economic growth and foreign investment, Chen and other provincial leaders were criticized for \\"conservative thinking\\" and \\"poor implementation\\". Chen was further criticized for his unenthusiastic support for the Xiamen special economic zone and for Deng Xiaoping's southern tour of 1992. He responded swiftly and effectively to the complaints, and throughout the rest of 1992, he worked with officials from Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou in southern Fujian on a strategy for growth. This resulted in strong performances in 1993, when Fujian had record economic growth which exceeded the national rate. ==National government== In 1993, Chen was appointed Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and served in that position until 1998. After 1998, he mainly worked in the National People's Congress (NPC), serving as Chairman of the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee in the 9th NPC (1998‚Äì2003), and as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in the 10th NPC (2003‚Äì2008). Chen was a member of the 12th to the 15th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Putian Category:Governors of Gansu Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Fujian Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Fujian Category:Directors of the Civil Aviation Administration of China Category:Northeastern University (China) alumni Category:Members of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Chen Guangyi"},{"id":"56082409","text":"Stereo Satellite is an American rock band featuring guitarist Mike Orlando and Jordan Cannata of Adrenaline Mob, former Rock Star Supernova singer Lukas Rossi, and Disturbed bassist John Moyer.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Beech took a commission in the British Army in 1915, and served until 1926 as an officer in the Royal Army Pay Corps, retiring from active service as a major and staff paymaster. In 1937 he was elected as one of two councillors for Woolwich West to the London County Council, as a Municipal Reform Party candidate, and remained in office for the next nine years. In November 1943 he was also elected to the House of Commons for the same constituency, representing the Conservative Party; he succeeded Sir Kingsley Wood, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had died in office. Due to the war- time electoral truce, the by-election was not contested by the Labour or Liberal parties, and Beech won a clear majority over an Independent Labour Party candidate and another independent. Beech contested the seat at the 1945 general election, but was defeated by the Labour candidate Henry Berry. In 1946, he was also defeated for re-election to the London County Council, with both Woolwich West seats being won by Labour.

The by-election was prompted after the Constitutional Council invalidated the election of Jo√´l Aviragnet, candidate of the Socialist Party (PS), in the June 2017 legislative elections on 18 December 2017. Aviragnet was re-elected by a massive margin in the second round rematch against Montsarrat, securing over 70% of valid votes and winning by a margin 40 points larger than in June 2017. == Background == Following the second round of the 2017 legislative election in Haute-Garonne's 8th constituency on 18 June, Michel Montsarrat, candidate of La R√©publique En Marche! defeated by 91 votes, filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council appealing the election of Jo√´l Aviragnet of the Socialist Party (PS). Montsarrat questioned a number of irregularities, including those in several communes where Aviragnet multiplied his result in the second round. On 18 December, the constitutional council annulled the election of Aviragnet, considering the irregularities listed by Montserrat to have affected 4 votes given differences in signatures indicating that votes were not given by the voter in question, 1 vote in Saint-Bertrand- de-Comminges and 10 votes in Montastruc-de-Salies given discrepancies between the number of ballots and signatures, and 64 votes in the only polling station in Gensac-de-Boulogne where article L. 68 of the electoral code, requiring the registration lists of every polling station and associated documents be transmitted along with the record of voting operations after the completion of voting, was not respected. Given these issues, and the small number of votes separating the two candidates, the constitutional council judged it appropriate to annul the result and call a by-election within the constituency. The first and second rounds of the by-election are scheduled for 11 and 18 March 2018, with candidacies to submitted between 12 and 16 February. Polling stations throughout the constituency will be open from 8:00 to 18:00 CET, with those in Saint-Gaudens open until 19:00 CET. == Candidates and campaign == Michel Montsarrat, a former rugby player for AS B√©ziers H√©rault, later a restaurateur, and hotel manager living in Luchon, was once again invested as a candidate of La R√©publique En Marche!, supported by the nine deputies of the presidential party in the department. On 30 January, the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) decided to back Montsarrat in the by-election, breaking from the party's historical alliance with the right. The initial campaign of Montsarrat was considered lethargic, and was perturbed by the apparent theft of the laptop of his campaign director on 25 January, adding to existing frustration with his campaign management. Montsarrat was castigated early on over the potential closure of the court of Saint-Gaudens, and later over the invitation of Montsarrat to a visit by Laura Flessel as a \\"deputy for Haute-Garonne\\" on a published list of invitees. On 9 January, justice minister Nicole Belloubet visited the constituency in support of Montsarrat, the first of a series of ministers to visit the constituency to campaign, followed by Minister of Territorial Cohesion Jacques M√©zard on 12 February, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux on 15 February, and finally Christophe Castaner on 2 March. Castaner held a second public meeting, this time alongside Genevieve Darrieussecq, on 3 March, and Jean-Michel Blanquer and G√©rard Collomb traveled to the constituency on 9 March. Local elected supporters, including deputy Micka√´l Nogal and mayor of Rieumes Jennifer Courtois-P√©riss√©, attended a public meeting with Montsarrat on 23 February. Jo√´l Aviragnet, a specialized educator, and Socialist Party (PS) mayor of Encausse-les-Thermes, also received the renewed support of his party, and was backed by Carole Delga, president of the regional council of Occitanie, who selected him as a substitute, with Aviragnet occupying her seat in the National Assembly from July 2014 to July 2015. Socialist deputy Val√©rie Rabault appeared at a public meeting on 20 February to back Aviragnet, who also benefited from the strength of local party activists. Henri Nayrou, president of the departmental council of Ari√®ge, attended a public meeting with Aviragnet, who was later joined not only by Delga, but also by Georges M√©ric, president of the departmental council of Haute-Garonne, at a public meeting on 7 March. Over the course of the campaign, Aviragnet visited all 283 communes in the constituency. Marie-Claire Uchan, like Aviragnet, is a mayor, presiding over Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, and in a statement, almost 150 mayors in the constituency called upon voters to support Aviragnet. The movement Bastir Occitanie, which presented J√©r√¥me Piques as its candidate in June 2017, decided to back Aviragnet in the by-election. Aviragnet held another public meeting with Delga and M√©ric on 14 March, and received the support of the French Communist Party (PCF) in the second round, as well as that of G√©n√©ration.s, the movement of Beno√Æt Hamon. Philippe Gimenez, a financial comptroller, also returned to the field with the investiture of La France Insoumise. On 15 February, deputy Fran√ßois Ruffin toured the constituency in support of Gimenez, followed by a public meeting with Jean-Luc M√©lenchon on 21 February, which was attended by nearly a thousand people. On 2 March, Li√™m Hoang-Ngoc attended two public meetings with Gimenez, was joined by Cl√©mentine Autain on 3 March, and followed by Caroline Fiat on 4 March. Deputy Alexis Corbi√®re then visited on 6 and 7 March to campaign in support of Gimenez. The selection of a candidate of The Republicans (LR) proved more difficult. Though Jennifer Courtois-P√©riss√©, regional councillor and mayor of Rieumes, was considered the natural candidate in the constituency, she left the party to join La R√©publique En Marche!, in which she held a national leadership position. Party members then sought president of the LR regional federation and former deputy Laurence Arribag√© to run in the by-election, but were rebuked. However, recently elected president of the party Laurent Wauquiez made clear his desire to present a candidate in the constituency, and his entourage sought to bypass the regional federation in the investiture process. Philippe Maurin, a 63-year-old resident of Luchon who served as deputy mayor of Montauban under Brigitte Bar√®ges from 2008 to 2014, was ultimately selected as the party's candidate on 16 January. On 6 March, Christian Jacob, president of The Republicans group in the National Assembly, traveled to the constituency to offer his backing to the candidacy of Maurin. The National Front (FN) also declared its intent to present a candidate within the constituency, with regional councillor Marie-Christine Parolin, an administrative agent, again invested by the party. After a public meeting with deputy Gilbert Collard on 28 January, she appeared alongside party president Marine Le Pen and deputy Louis Aliot on 3 March. Corinne Marquerie, a retired educator, also returned as the candidate of the PCF, and was joined by Member of the European Parliament Marie-Pierre Vieu at a public meeting on 1 March. On 1 February, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, president of Debout la France, presented 49-year-old former LR member S√©bastien Broucke, a principal education adviser from Saint-Gaudens, as the party's candidate, with the party's candidate in June, Laure Gonzalez, initially selected as his substitute; however, Gonzalez withdrew for personal reasons, and was replaced by campaign coordinator Jean- Claude Bringuier. Mayor of Ore Herv√© Minec stood as the candidate of the Popular Republican Union (UPR), with party president Fran√ßois Asselineau visiting in support. Marie-C√©cile Seigle-Vatte, a retired professor of economics and management, stood for Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV). Starting in 1983, she served several mandates as a municipal councillor, including in Fonsorbes, Saint-Denis de la R√©union, and Agassac. A member of the party's federal council and regional executive office, she received the support of Julien Bayou, national spokesman for the EELV, in a visit to the constituency on 1 March. Martine Guiraud, a laboratory technician, stood for Lutte Ouvri√®re (LO), and Francis Meynier for the European Alliance for Peace, Prosperity, Sharing. The campaign centered around the themes of rurality and agriculture in the Comminges region, the preservation of public services (including the threatened closure of the court in Saint-Gaudens, and issues of transport, access to digital and medical services, and housing. Candidates also discussed the reopening of the Montr√©jeau‚ÄìLuchon railway line, restoration of ski stations (including the planned restoration of the Luchon gondola), and installation of telephone towers in isolated municipalities. Before the first round, Gimenez proposed a public debate against Montsarrat; though the latter suggested that it was \\"healthy to debate\\", he postponed making a decision until after returning from the Paris International Agricultural Show. He ultimately declined, and indicated that while he was open to the idea, he believed that the proposal was not made in good faith, viewing the exclusion of the PS candidate as an effort to claim the flag of the \\"true anti-Macron opposition\\". On 14 March, 100% Radio, Vi√†Occitanie, and La D√©p√™che du Midi hosted a debate moderated by Olivier Roirand and Brice Vidal between Aviragnet and Montsarrat from 19:00 to 20:00 CET. == 2017 election result == First round results by commune Second round results by commune {  right;font-size:95%;\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Candidate !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party !colspan=\\"2\\"First round !colspan=\\"2\\"Second round - !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Michel Montsarrat REM  33.40  49.87 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jo√´l Aviragnet PS  17.78 '''''' 50.13 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Marie- Christine Parolin FN  15.23 colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"11\\" E9E9E9;\\" - style=\\"background:;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Philippe Gimenez FI  14.11 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jean-Luc Rivi√®re UDI‚ÄìLR  8.73 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Corinne Marquerie PCF  3.09 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Sophie Handschutter EELV  2.80 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Laure Gonzalez DLF  1.41 - style=\\"background:;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"David Labarre R!

The laker was one of four almost identical vessels; and William E. Corey were both launched in Chicago, launched in West Bay City, Michigan and launched in Superior, Wisconsin. All four vessels were the largest on the lakes at the time of their launch, hence the unofficial title \\"Queen of the Lakes\\". ==Mataafa Storm== The launch of William E. Corey Shortly after her launch the brand new William E. Corey encountered one of the worst storms in Great Lakes history, the Mataafa Storm of 1905. On November 28, William E.

After the storm William E. Corey was removed and repaired. ==SS Ridgetown== Ridgetown acts as the breakwater for the harbor. Over the next fifty three years William E. Corey changed hands many times until in 1963 she was sold to the Upper Lakes Shipping Company and renamed Ridgetown. The ship served for seven more years until in 1970 when she was scuttled as a temporary breakwater at Nanticoke, Ontario in the summer. Later refloated at an unknown date. In the summer of 1974 she was scuttled as a breakwater at Mississauga, Ontario. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1905 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1905 Category:Ships built in Chicago Category:Ships sunk as breakwaters Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Queen of the Lakes Category:Ships powered by a triple expansion steam engine ","title":"SS William E.

Hay won by a small majority. However, at the subsequent 1923 general election he was defeated by Edwards. Hay thus sat for slightly under a year, one of the shortest-serving MPs in history.

The by-election was prompted by the invalidation of the election of Jean-Pierre Door, candidate of The Republicans (LR), in the June 2017 legislative elections by the Constitutional Council on 18 December 2017. In the second round of the 2017 legislative elections on 18 June, the result was the closest in the country, with Door winning by 8 votes before the election was annulled. Door won the second round of the by-election with 67.08% of the vote against M√©lusine Harl√©, candidate of La R√©publique En Marche!, with 32.92%. == Background == Following the second round of the 2017 legislative election in Loiret's 4th constituency on 18 June, M√©lusine Harl√©, candidate of La R√©publique En Marche! defeated by 8 votes in the closest contest of the year, filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council appealing the election of Jean-Pierre Door of The Republicans (LR). On 18 December, the constitutional council annulled the election of Door, with the number of ballots in the commune of Pr√©fontaines differing from the number of signatures, reducing the number of votes cast there from 166 to 165. In addition, article L. 49 of the electoral code prohibits candidates from distributing electoral materials starting from midnight the day before the election, and Harl√© argued that a Facebook post made by Door depicting a speech in his capacities as mayor of Montargis commemorating the Appeal of 18 June, as well as a post made by deputy mayor Fabrice Bouscal noting that he voted for Door and inviting voters to \\"choose the experience faced with adventure\\", were in breach of the article. Given the extremely narrow margin between the two candidates at the fact that the Facebook posts were not private but public and made on the date of the election, the constitutional council ruled to annul the election of Door, triggering a by-election in the constituency. The first and second rounds of the by-election are scheduled for 18 and 25 March 2018, with 119 polling stations in 69 communes open from 8:00 to 18:00 CET. Candidates were required submit declarations of their candidacies between 19 and 23 February. == Candidates == Incumbent deputy Jean-Pierre Door of The Republicans (LR), a 76-year-old cardiologist, stood in the by-election to attempt to maintain his seat. On 30 January 2018, the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) announced its support for Door, citing his support for the political line of Alain Jupp√©. Deputy and president of the Union of the Right and Centre group in the regional council of Centre-Val de Loire Guillaume Peltier visited the constituency to support Door on 8 March, followed by senator Jean-No√´l Cardoux on 9 March, former minister √âlisabeth Hubert on 13 March, LR president Laurent Wauquiez, president of The Republicans group in the National Assembly Christian Jacob, and deputy Antoine Savignat on 14 March, accompanied by UDI deputies Philippe Vigier and Maurice Leroy at a meeting attended by over 400 people, and Val√©rie P√©cresse and Damien Abad between the two rounds on 20 March. M√©lusine Harl√©, a 45-year-old CEO of a management company and candidate of La R√©publique En Marche!, launched her campaign on 13 January 2018 alongside party president Christophe Castaner, against the backdrop of motorcyclists protesting the government's reduction of speed limits on local roads from 90 km/h to 80 km/h. On 1 March, minister Jacqueline Gourault attended a public meeting in support of Harl√© in Solterre, and Mounir Mahjoubi visited Ferri√®res-en-G√¢tinais on 2 March. Deputies Aurore Berg√©, Gilles Le Gendre, and Caroline Janvier also campaigned on behalf of Harl√© at a public meeting on 9 March, and Olivier Dussopt subsequently visited the constituency on 16 March. Ludovic Marchetti, a 31-year-old pastry chef, municipal councillor of Amilly, and departmental secretary of the National Front (FN) in Loiret, was again selected as the party's candidate in the constituency. The section of the French Communist Party (PCF) based in the constituency argued for a common front on the left unifying the PCF, La France Insoumise, and supporters of Beno√Æt Hamon behind a single antiliberal and ecologist candidate. Franck Demaumont of the PCF also initially intended to run, before reversing his decision and Bruno Nottin was nominated in his place, with Fran√ßoise Causse of La France Insoumise selected as his substitute. Nottin, a 43-year-old court clerk, received the support of Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV), which was initially considered likely to present its own candidate. On 6 March, Pierre Laurent, national secretary of the PCF, visited Amilly to support Nottin. J√©r√¥me Schmitt, a 46-year-old employed in the nuclear sector, contested Loiret's 6th constituency in 2017 and stood as the candidate of La France Insoumise, which did not present a candidate in the constituency in June against PCF mayor of Ch√¢lette-sur-Loing Franck Demaumont in acknowledgment of his sponsorship of Jean-Luc M√©lenchon for the presidential election. However, relations between the two movements deteriorated since then, though Schmitt did not rule out the possibility of an alliance with the PCF. Adrien Quatennens and Fran√ßois Ruffin visited the constituency in support of Schmitt on 1 March, followed by door-to-door campaigning by deputies Sabine Rubin and √âric Coquerel on 10 March, and Jean- Luc M√©lenchon hosted a public meeting, introduced by Alexis Corbi√®re, that was attended by some 200 people in Montargis on 13 March. Jalila Gaboret, a 45-year-old secondary school teacher, was again announced as the candidate of the PS on 27 January, and received the support of Olivier Faure, leader of the New Left group in the National Assembly, at a public meeting in Ingr√© on 19 February. Luc Bucheton, a 55-year-notary and departmental secretary of Debout la France (DLF), was again invested by the party, and received the support of DLF president Nicolas Dupont-Aignan in Cepoy on 14 March, and was also accompanied by FN regional councillor Alexandre Cuignache, who decided to leave the party to join Dupont-Aignan. Dominique Clergue, a 52-year-old blue- collar worker, was again invested by Lutte Ouvri√®re (LO). Laurent Chaillou, a 46-year-old supervisor, was invested by the Popular Republican Union (UPR), and UPR founder Fran√ßois Asselineau visited the constituency in support of his party's candidate on 10 March. Nicolas Rousseaux, a 42-year-old executive, was invested under the banner of Force Nationale. Fr√©d√©ric Chaouat, a 55-year-old English professor, stood as an independent candidate. Jo√´l-Pierre Chevreux, a 62-year-old editor of an online publication, stood as the candidate of the Humans, Animals, Nature Movement (MHAN). France Bleu Orl√©ans and apostrophe45 broadcast a debate between Door and Harl√© on 22 March at 19:00 CET. == 2017 election result == First round results by commune Second round results by commune {  right;font-size:95%;\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Candidate !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party !colspan=\\"2\\"First round !colspan=\\"2\\"Second round - !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"M√©lusine Harl√© REM  28.56  49.99 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jean-Pierre Door* LR  23.78 '''''' 50.01 - style=\\"background:;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Ludovic Marchetti FN  20.78 colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"9\\" E9E9E9;\\" - style=\\"background:;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Franck Demaumont PCF‚ÄìFI  11.60 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jalila Gaboret PS  5.48 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Luc Bucheton DLF  3.01 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Alphonse Proffit SE  2.37 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Massila Salemkour EELV  2.27 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Dominique Clergue LO  0.96 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Zo√© Baron UPR  0.65 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Christine Rochoux DVD  0.53 - colspan=\\"7\\" E9E9E9;\\" -style=\\"font- weight:bold;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Votes  100.00  100.00 - colspan=\\"7\\" E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Valid votes  97.87  89.93 - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Blank votes  1.51  7.15 - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Null votes  0.62  2.92 - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Turnout  48.96  43.37 - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Abstentions  51.04  56.63 - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Registered voters  E9E9E9;\\"  E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"7\\" E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"7\\" left;\\"Source: Ministry of the Interior, political parties * Incumbent deputy } == 2018 by-election result == First round results by commune Second round results by commune {  right;font-size:95%;\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Candidate !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party !colspan=\\"3\\"First round !colspan=\\"3\\"Second round - !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% !style=\\"width:45px;\\"+/‚Äì !style=\\"width:50px;\\"Votes !style=\\"width:45px;\\"% !style=\\"width:45px;\\"+/‚Äì - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jean-Pierre Door LR‚ÄìUDI  38.20 style=\\"color:green;\\"+14.41 '''''' 67.08 style=\\"color:green;\\"+17.07 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"M√©lusine Harl√© REM  20.20 style=\\"color:red;\\"‚Äì8.35  32.92 style=\\"color:red;\\"‚Äì17.07 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Ludovic Marchetti FN  13.88 style=\\"color:red;\\"‚Äì6.91 colspan=\\"3\\" rowspan=\\"10\\" E9E9E9;\\" - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jalila Gaboret PS  6.65 style=\\"color:green;\\"+1.17 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Bruno Nottin PCF‚ÄìEELV  5.96 style=\\"color:red;\\"‚Äì5.64 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Luc Bucheton DLF  5.23 style=\\"color:green;\\"+2.22 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"J√©r√¥me Schmitt FI  4.96 style=\\"color:green;\\"+4.96 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Jo√´l-Pierre Chevreux ECO  1.96 style=\\"color:green;\\"+1.96 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Dominique Clergue LO  1.60 style=\\"color:green;\\"+0.64 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Laurent Chaillou UPR  0.81 style=\\"color:green;\\"+0.16 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Nicolas Rousseaux EXD  0.43 style=\\"color:green;\\"+0.43 - style=\\"background:;\\" left;\\"Fr√©d√©ric Chaouat SE  0.13 style=\\"color:green;\\"+0.13 - colspan=\\"9\\" E9E9E9;\\" -style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Votes  100.00 ‚Äì  100.00 ‚Äì - colspan=\\"9\\" E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Valid votes  96.97 ‚Äì0.90  88.88 ‚Äì1.05 - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Blank votes  1.97  +0.46  7.04 ‚Äì0.11 - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Null votes  1.06  +0.44  4.08  +1.17 - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Turnout  30.36 ‚Äì18.60  28.61 ‚Äì14.76 - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Abstentions  69.64  +18.60  71.39  +14.76 - colspan=\\"3\\" left;\\"Registered voters  colspan=\\"2\\" E9E9E9;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"9\\" E9E9E9;\\" - colspan=\\"9\\" left;\\"Source: Pr√©fecture du Loiret } == References  External links == *Excerpts of debate broadcast on 22 March *Results of past legislative by-elections from the Ministry of the Interior Category:2018 elections in France 2018 Category:March 2018 events in France ","title":"2018 Loiret's 4th constituency by-election"},{"id":"56082885","text":"Tuvalu has been slow to deal with problems that people with a disability face in the country. Since 1978, the government of Tuvalu has been slow to create policy and laws for people with disabilities. In addition, few studies have been done to assess the scope of the issue on the islands. The first comprehensive study of people with disabilities in Tuvalu was done in February 2017. == Demographics == In 2012, there were 206 people with disabilities in Tuvalu, with the rate of prevalence of disability at 1.9% of the population. Most people with disabilities had a physical disability of some kind with 27.7% having a mental disability. A comprehensive study of people with disabilities in Tuvalu was done in 2017, and they collected 466 in the database for the Fusi Alofa Association (FAA) Tuvalu which is an organisation for people with disabilities. == Policy ==  Legislation  Tuvalu implemented a mental health policy for the country in 1978. Current law does not prohibit discriminating against people with disabilities in all areas of their lives. There is no law or provisions for accommodating people with disabilities in public spaces. There are no government benefits for people with disabilities in Tuvalu. Tuvalu has tasked its Community Affairs Department in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Rural Development to protect the rights of people with disabilities in the country. Tuvalu has signed and ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  Non-Governmental organisations  Before 2010, the Tuvalu Red Cross Society handled issues relating to people with disabilities, in addition to the other services they provided. The Red Cross used a medical model of disability. The organisation provided workshops and gave out wheelchairs and crutches to those who need them. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Red Cross operated a \\"small educational centre\\" on Funafuti, which employed two staff to help children with disabilities. The Fusi Alofa Association (FAA) Tuvalu was created in 2010 and is the only cross-disability organisation working in Tuvalu. FAA Tuvalu was established to promote the rights of persons with disabilities and to give children with disabilities greater opportunities in Tuvalu. Prior to the formation of FAA Tuvalu, there were no services for disabled children in the country. FAA Tuvalu currently operates a school for children with disabilities on Funafuti. == Unique challenges == Even though the island nation is small, transportation for people with physical disabilities can be an issue. In addition, even government buildings may not be accessible to individuals with physical disabilities. Climate change also is problem that affects all Pacific Island nations and the elderly and people with disabilities are at a greater risk of being affected. == References ==  Citations   Sources  * * * ","title":"Disability in Tuvalu"},{"id":"56082916","text":"RyeMabee, also known as Castlewood, is a historic mansion in Monteagle, Tennessee, U.S..

Christaan Diederik Emerens Johan Bangeman Huygens (31 October 1772 in Sint-Oedenrode ‚Äì 24 March 1857 in Maastricht) was a Dutch diplomat and civil servant, from 1825 to 1832 Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Washington, DC. ==Career== Bangeman Huygens was the son of Willem Vincent Bangeman, a merchant in the Dutch East India Company, and Catharina Constantia Huygens (whose surname he in 1781 added to that of his fatherApparently at the request of his childless uncle Diederik Huijgens, who feared that the family name Huijgens would become extinct with him otherwise; he also adopted the Huijgens family crest at the same time; cf. A.C. Snouckaert v. S., Wapen Bangeman?, in: De navorscher-Nederlands archief voor genealogie en heraldiek, heemkunde en geschiedenis, Volume 52 (1902), pp. 100-101). He became a partisan of the Patriot faction, but was nevertheless sent out in 1793 with the last envoy of the Dutch Republic to Denmark, Jacob Fagel as his secretary. After Fagel's dismissal as a result of the Batavian Revolution in 1795, he stayed on as charg√© d'affaires. He acted as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Batavian Republic (after his formal appointment in 1796Jaarboek van het Limburgs Geschied- en Oudheidkundig Genootschap, vol. 100 (1965), p. 159) and subsequently the Kingdom of Holland, at the court of the Kingdom of Denmark till 1807. (In 1795 he was involved in the diplomatic aftermath of the engagement between Royal Navy and Batavian frigates known as the Action of 22 August 1795Jan Wagenaar, Vaderlandsche historie,: vervattende de geschiedenissen der vereenigde nederlanden, zints den aanveng der noord- americaansche onlusten, en den daar uit gevolgden oorlog tusschen engeland en deezen staat, tot den tegenwoordigen tyd (Johannes Allaart 1803), pp. 130-131; Martinus Stuart, Nieuwe Nederlandsche Jaarboeken [van het Koningrijk der Nederlanden], Vol 30 (Amsterdam 1795), p.5556). In 1807 he was appointed a member of the Staatsraad (Council of State) of the Kingdom of Holland, which he remained till 1809. In 1808 he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of Holland to the Kingdom of Westphalia which he remained till 1809. At the same time he was the King's commissioner in Ost-Friesland, which at the time had been annexed by the Kingdom of Holland, and remained a Staatsraad. After the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland by the French Empire in 1810 he was appointed requestmeester-generaal (a Napoleonic functionary in the government of the Dutch polders), which he remained till the restoration of Dutch independence in 1813. In 1815 he was again appointed Minister Pleninpotentiary, now of the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands, to the Hanseatic Cities in Hamburg, which he remained till 1825. In 1825 he became Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the United States, which he remained till July, 1832 (i.e. during the Administration of John Quincy Adams and the first Administration of Andrew Jackson). In 1831 he was instrumental in the retrieval of part of the jewelry collection of the Princess of Orange, future Queen Consort of the Netherlands, that had been stolen in 1829 in Brussels by a certain Constant Polari, and had been transported to the U.S.Verslag der teregtzitting van het Hof van Assises, provincie Holland (Zuider-kwartier), gehouden den 7den Maart 1834, in zake van Constant Polari, beschuldigd van diefstal in het Paleis van HH. KK. HH. den Prins en de Prinses van Oranje te Brussel (Van Cleef 1834), pp. 17 ff. In 1832 he again went to Copenhagen, where he had started his diplomatic career, as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Danish Court, and remained there till 1842. He was a Commander in the Order of the Union, the Order of the Reunion, and the Order of the Netherlands Lion. ==Family Life== Bangeman Huygens first married Elise Marguerite Jos√®phe Sophie Constance Marie Lauri, countess of Danneskiold L√∂wendal, in Paris in 1802.

In 2017, the town of Queen Creek named a new community park the \\"Mansel Carter Oasis Park\\" in his honor. ==Early years== Carter was born in Quaker City, Ohio. When he was young, he studied photography and worked as a mechanic in his hometown. He moved to Indiana and purchased an airplane with which he provided a shuttle service. During the Great Depression, he worked as a lumberjack on the Zuni Indian Reservation.Exploring Carter and Kennedy‚Äôs San Tan MountainsQueen Creek community park to be named after iconic resident.Republic; September 22, 2001. ==Marion E. Kennedy== In 1941, Carter moved to the town of Gilbert, Arizona and opened a photography shop. He was drafted by the United States Army during World War II and served a short tour of duty. He was eventually discharged on account of his age. He met and befriended Marion E. Kennedy (1874-1960), a Cherokee Indian from Oklahoma whose job was delivering ice. Kennedy had at one time attended the Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania where he studied geology. One of his classmates was Jim Thorpe, a notable Native-American sports hero. ==Gold prospecting== Carter received a monthly pension from the military. Both Carter and Kennedy decided to try their hands as gold prospectors and moved to the San Tan Mountains in the town of Queen Creek. The Mountain Men, as they became known, established various claims and their campsite became their home. Kennedy taught Carter how to drill for gold and they became life-long friends. When Kennedy died in 1960, Carter buried him near their campsite. Carter discontinued prospecting for gold after the death of his friend. He handcarved and sold \\"cactus curios\\" to the many visitors which he received from different parts of the country. Carter was featured in \\"Arizona Road\\" with Bill Leverton. He kept a guest book, which along with some of his cactus curios and many of his personal belongings, were donated to the San Tan Historical Society‚Äôs Museum after he died in 1987 of cancer. That same year Phoenix Magazine named him an \\"Arizona Legend\\". Both Carter and Kennedy are buried where their campsite was located by the Goldmine Trail.

It was inspired by the experiences of Bush's grandmother, Pasquina Fratini Galavotti, who worked on the Sunnyside Plantation in Arkansas as a child. == Plot == Two families develop an uneasy friendship while eking out a living on a cotton plantation named Sweet Hope. The Pascalas are Italian immigrants working as indentured laborers; the Halls are African-American sharecroppers. Like the other workers at Sweet Hope, the Pascalas and the Halls face disease, poverty, and a dangerous manager. The black sharecroppers help the Italians learn English and survive in an unfamiliar climate. The Pascalas are paid in company scrip and forbidden to leave the plantation until their debt is worked off. Having arrived too late in the year to start a crop, they keep falling further into debt. After attempting to negotiate with management for better conditions, the Italians organize against the plantation company. When the sharecroppers stand up for the Italians, it triggers \\"a tragic chain of events that implicates individuals, families, company, town, and the justice system.\\" == Background == In the late 1800s and early 1900s, thousands of Italians were lured to the American South to work on plantations and in factories, where they were often exploited. In 1907, the U.S. Department of Justice appointed Mary Grace Quackenbos to investigate complaints that workers in the South were being held in peonage. A major focus of the investigation was Sunnyside, a cotton plantation in Arkansas. As a child, Mary Bucci Bush heard many stories about the Sunnyside plantation from her grandmother and great aunt, who had worked there as children. Sweet Hope was inspired by their accounts. In the 1970s, Bush began recording interviews with her grandmother. In the late 1980s she spent several weeks camping out on the Sunnyside site, interviewing survivors and descendants of plantation workers. Over the years she made several more trips to the area. On one of them, she happened to meet the historian Randolph Boehm, who was researching a biography of Quackenbos. Boehm introduced Bush to Ernesto Milani, who was researching Sunnyside from the perspective of the Italian government. The three writers shared their research and lectured together at conferences. Although Bush is careful to note that Sweet Hope is a work of fiction, she dedicated it to \\"all the inhabitants of Sunnyside Plantation, Italian and African American, whose voices were never heard and whose stories were never told.\\" == Publication history == After years of research and revision, Bush spent several more years trying to find a publisher for her novel. She was told the market for historical fiction was small. Another reason, she suggested in an interview, was a lack of interest in the stories of Italian Americans other than mobsters. The novel was published by a Canadian press, Guernica Editions, in 2011. Excerpts have appeared in literary journals such as Syracuse University Magazine (1990) and Fili D'Aquilone (in Italian, 2016); and in anthologies, including Mary Jo Bona's The Voices We Carry: Recent Italian American Women's Fiction (2007), Anthony Tamburri's From the Margin: Writings in Italian Americana (2000), Maria Mazziotti Gillan's Growing Up Ethnic in America (1999), and Terry Wolverton's HERS 2: Brilliant New Fiction by Lesbian Writers (1997). == Reception == Sweet Hope won the Tillie Olsen Book Prize from the Working Class Studies Association in 2012. It was a finalist for Binghamton University's John Gardner Book Award and the 2012 Paterson Fiction Prize. In December 2012 it was the subject of a panel discussion at the annual conference of the Italian American Studies Association. While not widely reviewed, the book has been praised by several critics. Thom Vernon of the Arkansas Review classes Sweet Hope with John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills, Pietro Di Donato's Christ in Concrete, and other notable works that give voice to the working poor. A reviewer in Publishers Weekly calls the book \\"thoroughly researched and engaging.\\" In Italian Americana, UCLA professor Joanne Ruvoli writes, \\"This heartbreaking historical novel makes an important contribution to the story of Italian Americans in the United States.\\" == References == Category:2011 American novels Category:Novels set in Arkansas Category:Italian-American novels Category:Italian-American culture in Arkansas Category:Literature by women Category:Working-class literature ","title":"Sweet Hope"},{"id":"56083050","text":"Rainbow Mirror is a triple album by the American musical project Prurient, the performing name of the artist Dominick Fernow.

During their heyday, they stood World and World Grand Champion stallions such as JFK, He's Puttin' on the Ritz, Pride's Generator, and Watch It Now at stud and had multiple show horses. Waterfall Farms was later sold and no longer is an operational horse facility. ==History== Waterfall Farms is a 936-acre property located in Bedford County, Tennessee, a few miles from Shelbyville. It was first bought by Buddy Hugh in the 1960s and had multiple owners until 1994, when it was purchased by Bill and Sandra Johnson and given its ultimate name. The front 89 acres of the property housed the majority of the horses, with a guest center, cottages and multiple barns, totaling over 300 stalls, and a riding arena with bleachers. The arena was the site of horse shows and the annual colt preview. Waterfall Farms hosted horse shows sanctioned by the Walking Horse Owners Association (WHOA) for several years. They had a number of employees, including notable trainers such as Tracy Boyd. In 2010 Waterfall was sold to Wayne and Jean Day of Goodlettsville and the name was changed. The couple announced at the time that they planned to stand stallions as well as raise cattle on the back part of the farm. The following year, the Johnsons were suspended for alleged violations of the Horse Protection Act that happened in 2000, but this did not affect Waterfall as it was no longer theirs. ==Stallions== Waterfall stood many World and World Grand Champion stallions at stud to the public. The Johnsons owned the 1994 World Grand Champion He's Puttin' on the Ritz during his show career and stood him at stud for the rest of his life. A few months after buying the farm, the Johnsons purchased JFK, a stallion who was only defeated once in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. He stood at stud there for many years. Pride's Generator, a major influence in Walking Horse bloodlines who sired two World Grand Champions and over 100 World Champions, stood at Waterfall for several years in the 1990s. He was owned by Claude Crowley. In addition to standing stallions owned by others, Waterfall had a training barn and showed horses. They owned multiple show horses, including Watch It Now, who was originally named The Titan. Watch It Now won the World Grand Championship in 2009, the same year he was purchased by Waterfall. He was retired to stud there the fall after his Championship. Waterfall Farms implemented an incentive program to recognize foals sired by their stallions. If a horse sired by a Waterfall stallion during the years he stood at stud there won a World Championship, it received $100,000, with $50,000 going to the breeder and $50,000 going to the owner if they were two different people. ==References== Category:Tennessee Walking Horses Category:Horse farms in Tennessee ","title":"Waterfall Farms"},{"id":"56083194","text":"Thomas B.

It is a yellow solid that gives yellowish aqueous solutions. ==Synthesis and structure== Solutions of Fe-EDTA are produced by combining ferrous salts and aqueous solutions of EDTA known as Jacobson's solution. Near neutral pH, the principle complex is [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]‚àí, although most sources ignore the aquo ligand. The [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]‚àí anion has been crystallized with many cations, e.g., the trihydrate Na[Fe(EDTA)(H2O)].2H2O. The salts as well as the solutions are yellow-brown. Provided the nutrient solution in which the [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]‚àí complex will be used has a pH of at least 5.5, all the uncomplexed iron, as a result of incomplete synthesis reaction, will still change into the chelated ferric form. ==Uses== In contact with aerated natural waters, iron salts convert to the ferric form. Near neutral pH, ferric ions form insoluble solids and are thus not bioavailable. EDTA (and other chelating agents) address this problem, by forming soluble complexes that resist formation of hydroxides. Together with pentetic acid (DTPA), EDTA is widely used for sequestering metal ions. Otherwise these metal ions catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which is used to bleach pulp in paper making. Several million kilograms EDTA are produced for this purpose annually.J. Roger Hart \\"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid and Related Chelating Agents\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Iron chelate is commonly used for agricultural purposes to treat chlorosis, a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll. Iron and ligand are absorbed separately by the plant roots whereby the highly stable ferric chelate is first reduced to the less stable ferrous chelate. In horticulture, iron chelate is often referred to as 'sequestered iron' and is used as a plant tonic, often mixed with other nutrients and plant foods (e.g. seaweed). It is recommended in ornamental horticulture for feeding ericaceous plants like Rhododendrons if they are growing in calcareous soils. The sequestered iron is available to the ericaceous plants, without adjusting the soil's pH, and thus, lime-induced chlorosis is prevented. Iron chelate has also been used as a bait in the chemical control of slugs, snails and slaters in agriculture in Australia and New Zealand. They have advantages over other more generally poisonous substances used as their toxicity is more specific to molluscs. Ferric EDTA is also used to control some broadleaf weeds in lawns. On the other hand, these molecular ions may also serve as plant available iron nutrients in a blend of modified Hoagland and Long Ashton solutions.

This led to Harry Parkinson' debut at left-half against Accrington at the latter' Thorneyholme Road ground. Everton won the toss and elected to let Accrington kick-off into the low December sun.

Accrington dominated the first-half but only had a Billy Barbour goal to show for all their pressure at half-time. Accrington were to rue their missed chances as within four minutes of the restart Bolton were 2-1 up. Not long after Bolton took the lead Jack Kirkham of Accrington equalised.

Sheffield is also the Pastor of New Destiny Christian Fellowship, which has churches in Detroit and Brooklyn, New York. Sheffield as of 2018 serves as the Co-Chair of the MDP Community Democratic Caucus. ==Personal life== Sheffield was born in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Mary (n√©e Otto), and Rev. Horace Sheffield, Jr., a supervisor at Ford Motor Company. The elder Sheffield fought to create the UAW's Inter-Racial Committee. Later, he was instrumental in helping stage the legendary April 1941 workers strike at Ford. Sheffield is the father of Detroit City Council President Pro Tem Mary Sheffield. ==Education== After graduating Cass Tech High School, Sheffield attended Wayne State University, where he received his B.A. in History & English Sheffield later attended the University of Michigan Dearborn, receiving his Masters in Public Administration in 1995 In 2000, the University of Michigan awarded Sheffield its \\"African American Alumni Affiliate Alumnus of the Year\\" award. In 2016, the University of Michigan awarded Sheffield its \\"Making A Difference (M.A.D.)\\" Award . The award honors alumni who have made significant contributions to their community and/or career through their time, actions, talents and dedication. ==Community activism== Sheffield is the CEO of the Detroit Association of Black Organizations, Chairman of the Detroit Ecumenical Ministers Alliance and Founder/Former President of both the Detroit and Michigan Chapters of the National Action Network. Sheffield also founded the Detroit Cares Alternative Academy. The privately run academy, under contract with Detroit Public Schools, receives its funding from the district. Traditional academic courses are taught alongside cosmetology, building trades and culinary arts. In 2003, Sheffield co-wrote a letter with Al Sharpton to American Honda, complaining that the company did not hire enough African- Americans in management. \\"We support those that support us,\\" the letter said. \\"We cannot be silent while African-Americans spend hard-earned dollars with a company that does not hire, promote or do business with us in a statistically significant manner.\\" In 2009, Sheffield spearheaded the National Black Leadership Commission. The conference brought together religious, political and labor leaders, in hopes of promoting a Congressional bill that would help tackle the spread of the virus in at-risk communities. Sheffield served as a member of the organizing committee for the 2009 NCAA Final Four, that was hosted at Ford Field in Detroit. In 2010, Sheffield called for Michigan's Attorney General, Mike Cox, to apologize over remarks Cox made about Rev. Al Sharpton eulogizing 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, who was killed in a police raid. Cox stated that he was disgusted by the planned appearance of Sharpton at the funeral and accused the New York minister of a \\"drive-by at the scene of a tragedy.\\" In 2016, Sheffield started the \\"Bust the Ball\\" campaign, which held protests August 17 in Detroit, and on August 29th in New York. His main complaint was that the NBA was engaging in \\"Green-lining,\\" economically excluding people of color beyond the basketball court. Sheffield stated that he decided to form a protest after he reached out to the NBA, including Commissioner Adam Silver, as well as the Pistons and Palace Sports & Entertainment vice chairman Arn Tellem, with no response. On Christmas morning 2016, a man left a message on a New Destiny Christian Fellowship prayer hotline, using racial slurs and threatening to firebomb Sheffield's church. In 2017, Sheffield and the Detroit Association of Black Organizations paid half the cost for a Detroit gas station to participate in Project Green Light. The project allows the Detroit Police Department to tap into surveillance cameras at participating locations, to monitor what is going on. Participation hinges on the location being equipped with city-approved cameras and lights, which costs $5,000 up front. ==Political career== In 1979, Sheffield was a founding co-chair of The Commission for the Advancement of Policy Affecting Youth, the Disadvantaged and the Poor. It was the first nationwide, youth led attempt to increase African-American voter registration. Commission members included LeVar Burton and Michael Jackson. In 2014, Sheffield was called by a federal grand jury to talk about what he knew regarding efforts to influence the selection of Detroit City Council leaders. The FBI was investigating rumors that Thomas Hardiman, President and CEO of A&H; Contractors, was reportedly trying to bribe Detroit City Council members, in an attempt to influence the outcome of the vote for Council President. Sheffield said he was angry because Hardiman approached his daughter, Councilwoman Mary Sheffield, about the vote. 2014 13th Congressional District Primary Election In April 2014, Sheffield filed to run in the Democratic Primary Election for Michigan's 13th Congressional District, against incumbent John Conyers. Michigan election law states that a Congressional candidate can only qualify to appear on a ballot via a nominating petition. Since 1966, anyone that collects, or signs, nominating petitions must be a registered voter within the Congressional District. The petitions must be filed with the Secretary of State by the stated deadline, in order to appear on the August primary election ballot. Candidates currently need 1,000 signatures in order to qualify. At the deadline, Conyers campaign had submitted nearly 2,000 signed nominating petitions to the Wayne County Clerk's office, almost double the amount needed. Election officials invalidated hundreds of Conyers petitions for violations, such as incorrect voter addresses, leaving Conyers with approximately 1,200 signed petitions. The Detroit News reported that two of Conyers petition gatherers were not registered voters, while two others were not registered voters until the week of the report, meaning they collected signatures when they were not registered voters. These irregularities came to light when Sheffield challenged the signatures. Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett ruled that the signatures gathered by those men were invalid, invalidating another 644 signed petitions. This left Conyers with only 592 valid signatures, hundreds of signatures short of the legal requirement. Conyers, along with the ACLU filed a Federal lawsuit that challenged the Michigan law that required petition circulators to be registered voters. They argued that the law was unconstitutional, since petition gathering is political speech and voter registration is not a requirement to exercise First Amendment rights. Detroit Federal District Judge Matthew Leittman agreed and placed Conyers back on the ballot. On August 5, 2014, John Conyers won the primary election, receiving 86% of the vote.

The business operated as Disher & Milne from 1846 until July 1853 when the partnership was dissolved, and William Milne opened a similar business under his own name on Grenfell Street, opposite Elder & Co. From August 1853 the business continued with James B. Manford as Disher & Manford, then in March 1854 was bought out by Peter G. Harris. In 1857 William Milne was elected to the seat of Onkaparinga, and retired from business around the same time. ;William Milne, jun. In November 1869, his son William Milne, jun.

George had been a senior manager there for some years, and Price had until recently been manager of the Mount Gambier branch of the National Bank of Australasia. Their brother John Milne was also involved in the company for a time. In 1887 William Milne, jun. and Price quietly retired from active involvement in the company, leaving George Milne in control. William had a home on Palmer Place, North Adelaide and a summer residence, \\"Byethorne\\" at Mount Lofty. He was an active director of the Executor Trustee and Agency Company. Price died in 1895.

The AFC set out the following schedule for the round of 16: * R16-1: Runners-up Group A v Runners-up Group C * R16-2: Winners Group D v 3rd Group B/E/F * R16-3: Winners Group B v 3rd Group A/C/D * R16-4: Winners Group F v Runners-up Group E * R16-5: Winners Group C v 3rd Group A/B/F * R16-6: Winners Group E v Runners-up Group D * R16-7: Winners Group A v 3rd Group C/D/E * R16-8: Runners-up Group B v Runners-up Group F Combinations of matches in the round of 16 The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depended on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16: {  center; font-size:85%\\" - ! colspan=\\"6\\"Third-placed teams qualify from groups ! rowspan=\\"16\\" ! 1A vs ! 1B vs ! 1C vs ! 1D vs -  A  B  C  D    3C  3D  3A  3B -  A  B  C   E   3C  3A  3B  3E -  A  B  C    F  3C  3A  3B  3F -  A  B   D  E   3D  3A  3B  3E -  A  B   D   F  3D  3A  3B  3F -  A  B    E  F  3E  3A  3B  3F -  A   C  D  E   3C  3D  3A  3E - BBF3BB;\\"  A   C  D   F  3C  3D  3A  3F -  A   C   E  F  3C  3A  3F  3E -  A    D  E  F  3D  3A  3F  3E -   B  C  D  E   3C  3D  3B  3E -   B  C  D   F  3C  3D  3B  3F -   B  C   E  F  3E  3C  3B  3F -   B   D  E  F  3E  3D  3B  3F -    C  D  E  F  3C  3D  3F  3E } ==Qualified teams== The top two placed teams from each of the six groups, plus the four best-placed third teams, qualified for the knockout stage. {  - !

Jordan came close in the 20th minute when Musa Al- Taamari lured three defenders out of position before his back-heel pass found Feras Shelbaieh, whose cross to Yaseen Al-Bakhit saw his effort going wide. In the 35th minute, ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u left-footed strike was parried away by Amer Shafi. Jordan took the lead in the 38th minute after ƒê·ªó H√πng D≈©ng brought Salem Al-Ajalin down just outside the box, and Baha' Abdel-Rahman scored from the resultant free-kick into the top right corner of the net. Six minutes into the second half, Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng Ho√†ng sent in a curling cross in front of the goal mouth which Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng squeezed past the Jordanian defenders for the equaliser. Neither side managed to find a route to goal in the remaining minutes, forcing the first ever AFC Asian Cup last-16 tie to go into extra- time. Neither side was willing to take unnecessary risks in extra-time, as penalties were needed to decide the tie. Jordan were the first to miss with Baha' Faisal striking the crossbar which was then followed by Ahmed Samir's effort saved by Vietnam goalkeeper ƒê·∫∑ng VƒÉn L√¢m. Vietnam's Tr·∫ßn Minh V∆∞∆°ng then failed to put the game to bed with Vietnam's fourth effort but B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng I made no mistake as the Southeast Asians sealed their first knockout stage's win and marched into the quarter-finals. The win meant that since reunification, Vietnam had reached the quarter-finals in all their two Asian Cups they participated, but this was also the country's first ever win in the knockout stage, though technically it was a draw. For Jordan, the loss meant they have never won any competitive knockout stage games in their Asian Cup history. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Amer Shafi (c) - RB 2 Feras Shelbaieh - CB 3 Tareq Khattab - CB 21Salem Al-Ajalin - LB 19Anas Bani Yaseen - CM 6 Saeed Murjan   - CM 4 Baha' Abdel-Rahman - RW 18Musa Al-Taamari   - AM 7 Yousef Al-Rawashdeh   - LW 13Khalil Bani Attiah  - CF 11Yaseen Al-Bakhit   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 9 Baha' Faisal   - DF 23Ihsan Haddad   - FW 14Ahmad Ersan   - MF 10Ahmed Samir   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Vital Borkelmans } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 23ƒê·∫∑ng VƒÉn L√¢m - CB 2 ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh - CB 3 Qu·∫ø Ng·ªçc H·∫£i (c) - CB 4 B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng I - RWB8 Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng Ho√†ng   - LWB5 ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u - RM 19Nguy·ªÖn Quang H·∫£i - CM 7 Nguy·ªÖn Huy H√πng   - CM 16ƒê·ªó H√πng D≈©ng - LM 20Phan VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c   - CF 10Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 22Nguy·ªÖn Ti·∫øn Linh   - FW 9 Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n   - MF 6 L∆∞∆°ng Xu√¢n Tr∆∞·ªùng   - MF 14Tr·∫ßn Minh V∆∞∆°ng   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Park Hang- seo } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Nguy·ªÖn Quang H·∫£i (Vietnam) Assistant referees: Reza Sokhandan (Iran) Mohammadreza Mansouri (Iran) Fourth official: Abu Bakar Al-Amri (Oman) Additional assistant referees: Mohanad Qassim (Iraq) Liu Kwok Man (Hong Kong) } Thailand vs China PR Chinese players after scoring first goal In the 31st minute, Thitipan Puangchan‚Äôs shot ended up at Supachai Jaided‚Äôs feet who turned and scored from seven yards out to open the scoring. Yu Dabao made way for Xiao Zhi and, within three minutes, China were level as Zheng Zhi clipped his cross in from the right and Xiao scored on the rebound after Siwarak Tedsungnoen had saved the striker‚Äôs initial downward header. By the 71st minute China were in front when Gao Lin scored from the spot after having his heels clipped in the area by Tanaboon Kesarat, the forward fired high into the top corner to give his team the lead. A flying save from Yan Junling deep into injury time following Pansa Hemviboon‚Äôs shot ensured the East Asians to win their first knockout stage's match since 2004 and progressed. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 23Siwarak Tedsungnoen - RB 3 Theerathon Bunmathan - CB 4 Chalermpong Kerdkaew - CB 6 Pansa Hemviboon - LB 16Mika Chunuonsee - CM 18Chanathip Songkrasin - CM 8 Thitipan Puangchan  - CM 17Tanaboon Kesarat   - RW 22Supachai Jaided   - CF 10Teerasil Dangda (c) - LW 19Tristan Do - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 12Chananan Pombuppha   - MF 21Pokklaw Anan   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Sirisak Yodyardthai } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Yan Junling - RB 19Liu Yang   - CB 4 Shi Ke  - CB 5 Zhang Linpeng  - LB 6 Feng Xiaoting - CM 11Hao Junmin - CM 15Wu Xi   - CM 10Zheng Zhi (c) - RW 18Gao Lin - CF 7 Wu Lei - LW 22Yu Dabao   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 9 Xiao Zhi   - MF 16Jin Jingdao   - MF 8 Zhao Xuri   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Marcello Lippi } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Feng Xiaoting (China PR) Assistant referees: Mohamed Al-Hammadi (United Arab Emirates) Hasan Al-Mahri (United Arab Emirates) Fourth official: Palitha Hemathunga (Sri Lanka) Additional assistant referees: Ammar Al-Jeneibi (United Arab Emirates) Hettikamkanamge Perera (Sri Lanka) } Iran vs Oman Alireza Beiranvand saving Oman's penalty Oman were awarded a penalty in the third minute when Majid Hosseini brought down Muhsen Al-Ghassani, only for Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand to tip Ahmed Kano‚Äôs effort from 12 yards around the post. Iran broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute, Alireza Jahanbakhsh fired home after Mohammed Al-Musalami had failed to cut out Milad Mohammadi‚Äôs long ball. Nine minutes later, Mehdi Taremi was brought down in the area by Saad Al- Mukhaini and Ashkan Dejagah stepped up to convert the resulting penalty.

Mohammed Al-Fatil sneaked in a header from the centre of the box from a set-piece situation, but the defender placed it wide of the mark. Japan came close six minutes later with Ritsu Doan finding space in the danger area after collecting Takumi Minamino‚Äôs pass but saw his effort blocked by the Saudi defence. Japan scored the opening goal in the 20th minute as Takehiro Tomiyasu rose the highest to nod the ball home. With five minutes left in the half, Hattan Bahebri muscled his way into the box, but his curling shot flew past the right post, as Japan stayed ahead going into the break. In the second half, Maya Yoshida connected with a header from Gaku Shibasaki‚Äôs delivery but Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais collected it safely. In the 73rd minute, Abdullah Otayf found Housain Al-Mogahwi lurking in the box but the midfielder sent his header high above the bar as Japan soaked up the pressure to seal their quarter-final spot. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 12Sh≈´ichi Gonda - RB 19Hiroki Sakai - CB 16Takehiro Tomiyasu - CB 22Maya Yoshida (c) - LB 5 Yuto Nagatomo - CM 6 Wataru Endo - CM 7 Gaku Shibasaki - RW 21Ritsu Doan   - AM 9 Takumi Minamino   - LW 8 Genki Haraguchi - CF 13Yoshinori Muto   - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 14Junya Ito   - DF 18Tsukasa Shiotani   - FW 11Koya Kitagawa   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Hajime Moriyasu } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 21Mohammed Al-Owais - RB 2 Mohammed Al-Breik - CB 23Mohammed Al-Fatil - CB 4 Ali Al-Bulaihi - LB 13Yasser Al-Shahrani  - DM 14Abdullah Otayf   - RM 11Hattan Bahebri   - CM 20Abdulaziz Al-Bishi   - CM 16Housain Al-Mogahwi - LM 10Salem Al-Dawsari (c) - CF 19Fahad Al-Muwallad  - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 8 Yahya Al-Shehri   - FW 9 Mohammed Al-Saiari   - MF 18Abdulrahman Ghareeb   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Juan Antonio Pizzi } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Takehiro Tomiyasu (Japan) Assistant referees: Abdukhamidullo Rasulov (Uzbekistan) Jakhongir Saidov (Uzbekistan) Fourth official: Sergei Grishchenko (Kyrgyzstan) Additional assistant referees: Valentin Kovalenko (Uzbekistan) Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain) } Australia vs Uzbekistan Eldor Shomurodov‚Äôs change of pace left Trent Sainsbury flat-footed in the penalty area, only for Mathew Ryan to deny the striker‚Äôs effort when in on the Australian goal. Two minutes before the half hour, Uzbekistan went close as Javokhir Sidikov let fly from distance, the ball going narrowly wide of Ryan‚Äôs right post. In the second half, Jamie Maclaren‚Äôs blocked shot looped up for Rhyan Grant to head into the hands of Ignatiy Nesterov while the full-back was also on the end of Milos Degenek‚Äôs diagonal ball, sending his header over the bar from an acute angle. Nesterov was on hand to push away Tom Rogic‚Äôs deflected effort 10 minutes from time. With the 90 minutes finishing goalless, the game went into extra-time and Chris Ikonomidis, Mathew Leckie and Rogic all failed to break the deadlock for the defending champions, leaving the game to drift towards a shootout. Nesterov saved Aziz Behich's penalty in the second round of the shootout before Islom Tukhtakhodjaev was denied by Ryan and, with Dostonbek Khamdamov missing in the penultimate round, Leckie struck to take Australia through. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Mathew Ryan - RB 4 Rhyan Grant  - CB 2 Milos Degenek - CB 5 Mark Milligan (c) - LB 16Aziz Behich  - CM 20Trent Sainsbury - CM 22Jackson Irvine - RW 21Awer Mabil   - AM 23Tom Rogic   - LW 15Chris Ikonomidis   - CF 9 Jamie Maclaren   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 7 Mathew Leckie   - FW 14Apostolos Giannou   - FW 10Robbie Kruse   - MF 8 Massimo Luongo   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Graham Arnold } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Ignatiy Nesterov - RB 6 Davron Khashimov  - CB 20Islom Tukhtakhodjaev  - CB 5 Anzur Ismailov - LB 13Oleg Zoteev   - RM 17Dostonbek Khamdamov   - CM 19Otabek Shukurov - CM 22Javokhir Sidikov   - LM 11Jaloliddin Masharipov - CF 14Eldor Shomurodov   - CF 9 Odil Ahmedov (c) - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 8 Ikromjon Alibaev   - FW 10Marat Bikmaev   - DF 4 Farrukh Sayfiev   - MF 16Azizbek Turgunboev   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 H√©ctor C√∫per } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Jackson Irvine (Australia) Assistant referees: Taleb Al-Marri (Qatar) Saud Al-Maqaleh (Qatar) Fourth official: Palitha Hemathunga (Sri Lanka) Additional assistant referees: Khamis Al-Marri (Qatar) Ahmed Al-Kaf (Oman) } United Arab Emirates vs Kyrgyzstan The Emiratis went ahead in the 13th minute through a Khamis Esmaeel header from Ismail Matar‚Äôs corner. Kyrgyzstan bounced back shortly before the half-hour mark, Akhlidin Israilov‚Äôs pass found Mirlan Murzaev who rounded UAE goalkeeper Khalid Eisa and finished to draw his side level. Matar threatened to restore the UAE‚Äôs lead when he fizzed a shot from distance narrowly over as the first half drew to a close. After the break, Ali Mabkhout headed Bandar Al-Ahbabi‚Äôs cross inches wide of the post, before a curling Valery Kichin delivery thudded against Eisa‚Äôs crossbar with the custodian beaten. In the 64th minute, the UAE went ahead once again, this time Mabkhout collected Amer Abdulrahman‚Äôs pass and shot the ball beyond Kutman Kadyrbekov. Tursunali Rustamov headed home a last gasp equaliser following Anton Zemlianukhin‚Äôs cross to send the match into extra-time. Mabkhout spurned an early chance in the second minute of the additional 30, before ‚Äì just 60 seconds later ‚Äì the striker was brought down in the area by Bekzhan Sagynbaev. Substitute Ahmed Khalil stepped up to convert the resulting penalty and put his side ahead yet again.

Two minutes from the half-time whistle, Son Heung-min laid a pass to Lee Yong on the right flank, who then sent the ball into the box which was blocked by goalkeeper Sayed Shubbar Alawi, only for it to land at Hwang Hee-chan‚Äôs feet who then tapped it into the net. In the 70th minute, the Korean defenders failed to cleanly clear a corner kick, allowing Jamal Rashid to fire a shot which seemed heading into the top right corner, only for Seung-gyu to palm it out. The Korean defence was breached for the first time in the tournament when Mohamed Al Romaihi slammed the ball into the net after Hong Chul had made a last ditch clearance of Mahdi Al-Humaidan‚Äôs attempt. Hwang Ui-jo intercepted a poor back pass in added time but his attempt to curl the ball past an onrushing Alawi went wide. The tie was then subsequently forced into extra- time. Bahrain were caught off guard when Yong sent in a cross from the right which Kim Jin-su met with a header to seal his team's place in the quarter- finals. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Kim Seung-gyu - RB 2 Lee Yong - CB 4 Kim Min-jae - CB 19Kim Young-gwon - LB 14Hong Chul   - CM 6 Hwang In-beom   - CM 5 Jung Woo-young - RW 11Hwang Hee-chan   - AM 7 Son Heung-min (c) - LW 17Lee Chung-yong   - CF 18Hwang Ui-jo - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 8 Ju Se-jong   - FW 9 Ji Dong-won   - MF 12Lee Seung-woo   - DF 3 Kim Jin-su   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Paulo Bento } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Sayed Shubbar Alawi   - RB 16Sayed Redha Isa   - CB 5 Hamad Al-Shamsan - CB 3 Waleed Al Hayam - LB 8 Mohamed Marhoon   - CM 19Kamil Al Aswad - CM 7 Abdulwahab Al-Safi (c) - RW 4 Sayed Dhiya Saeed - AM 23Jamal Rashid - LW 11Ali Madan   - CF 13Mohamed Al Romaihi - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 20Sami Al-Husaini   - FW 9 Mahdi Al-Humaidan   - GK 22Abdulkarim Fardan   - FW 10Abdulla Yusuf Helal   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Miroslav Soukup } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Lee Yong (South Korea) Assistant referees: Hiroshi Yamauchi (Japan) Jun Mihara (Japan) Fourth official: Anton Shchetinin (Australia) Additional assistant referees: Jumpei Iida (Japan) Turki Al-Khudhayr (Saudi Arabia) } Qatar vs Iraq Qatar spurned the first opportunity of the game when Abdelkarim Hassan rattled the bar with a shot from close-range following Abdulaziz Hatem‚Äôs cross in the fourth minute. Hatem came close to connecting with Abdelkarim‚Äôs whipped delivery, only for goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb to then dive at the feet of an onrushing Mohanad Ali to repel Iraq‚Äôs opening attack of the tie. Abdelkarim‚Äôs deflected cross brushed an upright and Bassam Al-Rawi headed Akram Afif‚Äôs corner wide of the target. Qatar went ahead on 62 minutes after Al-Rawi curled home a free-kick. Moments later, Jalal Hassan spread himself well to deny Abdelkarim, before producing another fine stop to keep out a Hatem drive from distance. Ali Adnan flashed a free-kick inches past the post and then Ahmad Ibrahim's 80th minute header missed by a similarly fine margin. Qatar held firm despite late Iraqi pressure to win their first ever knockout stage's match and moved on to the next round. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Saad Al Sheeb - RB 2 R√≥-R√≥ - CB 15Bassam Al-Rawi  - CB 4 Tarek Salman - LB 3 Abdelkarim Hassan  - CM 6 Abdulaziz Hatem - CM 23Assim Madibo  - CM 16Boualem Khoukhi - RW 10Hassan Al-Haydos (c)   - CF 19Almoez Ali - LW 11Akram Afif - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 12Karim Boudiaf   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 F√©lix S√°nchez } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Jalal Hassan (c) - RB 2 Ahmad Ibrahim  - CB 6 Ali Adnan - CB 17Alaa Ali Mhawi   - LB 5 Ali Faez - RM 13Bashar Resan - CM 11Humam Tariq   - CM 7 Safaa Hadi  - CM 14Amjad Attwan  - LM 16Hussein Ali - CF 10Mohanad Ali  - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 15Ali Husni    - FW 19Mohammed Dawood    - DF 22Rebin Sulaka   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Sreƒçko Katanec } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Akram Afif (Qatar) Assistant referees: Ronnie Koh Min Kiat (Singapore) Sergei Grishchenko (Kyrgyzstan) Fourth official: Rashid Al-Ghaithi (Oman) Additional assistant referees: Hettikamkanamge Perera (Sri Lanka) Ahmed Al-Ali (Jordan) } ==Quarter-finals== Vietnam vs Japan Vietnamese fans Koya Kitagawa‚Äôs pass to Genki Haraguchi in the 23rd minute was slid out of play by Vietnam defender ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh. The resulting corner saw Haraguchi send in a curler that found Maya Yoshida, who headed the ball into the back of the net. However, VAR was called into action for the first time in the history of the AFC Asian Cup and much to Vietnam‚Äôs relief, the referee disallowed the goal as Yoshida‚Äôs header had deflected off his arm. Sh≈´ichi Gonda was forced into making his first save of the game as Phan VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c came close with a 37th minute strike, before being called into action again a minute later to deny another close-range attempt from the VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c. Ritsu Doan‚Äôs run was blocked by B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng I and the referee, after referring to the VAR, awarded a penalty which the Japanese midfielder converted in the 57th minute.

The Iranians then spurned a chance to double their advantage when Hossein Kanaanizadegan found Taremi from Ashkan Dejagah‚Äôs free-kick only to somehow miss the target from only three yards. Azmoun out-muscled Liu Yiming and rounded goalkeeper Yan Junling to score shortly after the half-hour mark. After the break, Taremi and Kanaanizadegan looped headers narrowly over the bar, before Alireza Jahanbakhsh curled an effort narrowly wide of Yan‚Äôs left-hand upright on 58 minutes. Substitute Yu Dabao missed from close-range with 10 minutes remaining leaving Karim Ansarifard to net another for Iran after yet another defensive error. The victory allowed Iran to play in the semi-finals for the first time since 2004 edition where they finished third-place. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Yan Junling - RB 6 Feng Xiaoting   - CB 2 Liu Yiming - CB 4 Shi Ke - LB 17Zhang Chengdong - CM 15Wu Xi   - CM 10Zheng Zhi (c) - CM 19Liu Yang - RW 7 Wu Lei   - CF 18Gao Lin - LW 11Hao Junmin - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 8 Zhao Xuri   - FW 9 Xiao Zhi   - FW 22Yu Dabao   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Marcello Lippi } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Alireza Beiranvand - RB 23Ramin Rezaeian - CB 8 Morteza Pouraliganji - CB 13Hossein Kanaanizadegan - LB 5 Milad Mohammadi - RM 18Alireza Jahanbakhsh   - CM 9 Omid Ebrahimi - CM 3 Ehsan Hajsafi - LM 21Ashkan Dejagah (c)   - AM 17Mehdi Taremi  - CF 20Sardar Azmoun   - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 14Saman Ghoddos   - DF 4 Rouzbeh Cheshmi   - FW 10Karim Ansarifard   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Carlos Queiroz } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Sardar Azmoun (Iran) Assistant referees: Taleb Al-Marri (Qatar) Saud Al-Maqaleh (Qatar) Fourth official: C√©sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico) Video assistant referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) Assistant video assistant referees: Khamis Al-Marri (Qatar) Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan) } South Korea vs Qatar Qatari players celebrating Akram Afif brought a save out of goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu shortly after the half-hour mark. Moments later, midfielder Hwang In-beom curled a shot narrowly wide from the edge of the area after Qatar had failed to adequately deal with Lee Yong‚Äôs free-kick. In the second half, Hwang Ui-jo controlled the ball before bringing a fine save out of Qatar custodian Saad Al Sheeb. Kim Jin-su grazed the outside of an upright with a free-kick, before Qatar took the lead minutes later. Gathering possession some 25 yards from goal, Abdulaziz Hatem sent the ball past Seung-gyu‚Äôs dive and into the bottom corner. Within seconds Ui-Jo had a goal ruled out by the VAR for offside, while Boualem Khoukhi‚Äôs overhead kick was repelled by Seung-gyu.

With five minutes left in the half, Apostolos Giannou's shot on goal was swatted clear by Khalid Eisa. At the other end, Ali Mabkhout headed over from close range. In the second half, Giannou had the ball in the net following the introduction of Mathew Leckie for Jamie Maclaren, but his effort was ruled out for offside. In the 68th minute, Mabkhout put the UAE ahead with their first opening of the second period, the forward stepped in to intercept Milos Degenek‚Äôs backpass before rounding Ryan to score. Australia attempted to claw back an equaliser but the Socceroos came up short to end their reign as Asian champions. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 17Khalid Eisa - RB 23Mohamed Ahmed   - CB 6 Fares Juma - CB 19Ismail Ahmed - LB 3 Walid Abbas  - CM 2 Ali Salmeen - CM 8 Majed Hassan - RW 9 Bandar Al-Ahbabi - AM 10Ismail Matar (c)   - LW 15Ismail Al Hammadi   - CF 7 Ali Mabkhout - colspan=3Substitutions: - DF 12Khalifa Al Hammadi   - MF 16Mohamed Abdulrahman   - MF 20Saif Rashid   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Alberto Zaccheroni } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Mathew Ryan - RB 4 Rhyan Grant - CB 20Trent Sainsbury - CB 2 Milos Degenek - LB 16Aziz Behich - RM 10Robbie Kruse   - CM 22Jackson Irvine  - CM 5 Mark Milligan (c) - LM 15Chris Ikonomidis - CF 14Apostolos Giannou   - CF 9 Jamie Maclaren   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 7 Mathew Leckie   - FW 21Awer Mabil   - FW 11Andrew Nabbout   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Graham Arnold } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Ali Mabkhout (United Arab Emirates) Assistant referees: Yaser Tulefat (Bahrain) Jun Mihara (Japan) Fourth official: Turki Al-Khudhayr (Saudi Arabia) Video assistant referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) Assistant video assistant referees: Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain) C√©sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico) } ==Semi-finals== Iran vs Japan Japan's first goal Iran and Japan have faced each other in three previous Asian Cup editions, with Japan won one and drew two other games. Iran has also never scored a goal on Japan in every Asian Cup they met. Yuya Osako‚Äôs ball found space behind Alireza Jahanbakhsh and the advancing Yuto Nagatomo sent in a low cross that Takumi Minamino steered wide. Maya Yoshida headed wide from Gaku Shibasaki‚Äôs corner while Ritsu Doan dragged his attempt just wide of goal. In the opening minutes of the second half, Ashkan Dejagah and Ehsan Hajsafi both saw their attempts miss the target. Moments later, Hossein Kanaanizadegan turned to protest to the referee following a collision with Minamino and, while the official ignored the Iranian pleas, Minamino sent in a cross which was headed home by Osako. Jahanbakhsh almost restored parity five minutes later, only for Sh≈´ichi Gonda to tip his free-kick over the bar while Morteza Pouraliganji headed just off target moments later. Minamino's pass into the centre struck the sliding Pouraliganji on the arm. The resulting penalty saw Osako send Alireza Beiranvand the wrong way to double Japan's lead. In added time, Genki Haraguchi added the third with a burst through the defence before smashing his shot past Beiranvand to confirm Japan‚Äôs progress to the final. The loss, for Iran, meant that the country's Asian Cup thirst has been extended to 47 years, since the last win back in 1976 when Iran hosted the competition. For Japan, since professionalization of football in 1990s, Japan has made into the final in five editions out of eight, which remains as a record. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Alireza Beiranvand - RB 23Ramin Rezaeian - CB 8 Morteza Pouraliganji - CB 13Hossein Kanaanizadegan - LB 5 Milad Mohammadi - CM 9 Omid Ebrahimi  - CM 3 Ehsan Hajsafi - RW 18Alireza Jahanbakhsh   - AM 21Ashkan Dejagah (c)   - LW 11Vahid Amiri   - CF 20Sardar Azmoun  - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 10Karim Ansarifard   - MF 14Saman Ghoddos   - MF 16Mehdi Torabi   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Carlos Queiroz } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 12Sh≈´ichi Gonda - RB 19Hiroki Sakai   - CB 16Takehiro Tomiyasu - CB 22Maya Yoshida (c) - LB 5 Yuto Nagatomo  - RM 21Ritsu Doan   - CM 7 Gaku Shibasaki - CM 6 Wataru Endo   - LM 8 Genki Haraguchi - CF 15Yuya Osako - CF 9 Takumi Minamino - colspan=3Substitutions: - DF 18Tsukasa Shiotani   - DF 3 Sei Muroya   - MF 14Junya Ito   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Hajime Moriyasu } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Yuya Osako (Japan) Assistant referees: Matthew Cream (Australia) Anton Shchetinin (Australia) Fourth official: Kim Dong-jin (South Korea) Video assistant referee: Paolo Valeri (Italy) Assistant video assistant referees: Muhammad Taqi (Singapore) Ko Hyung-jin (South Korea) } Qatar vs United Arab Emirates Almoez Ali after scoring second goal Qatar took the lead at the 22nd minute, Boualem Khoukhi‚Äôs angled drive from 18 yards found its way under Khalid Eisa‚Äôs dive and into the net. The UAE responded through an Ismail Al Hammadi header which was saved by Saad Al Sheeb, and a similar effort from Ali Mabkhout that fizzed wide of the target shortly before the half-hour mark. Qatar doubled their lead in the 38th minute. Akram Afif found Almoez Ali who advanced into the area before firing home via a post to equal Ali Daei‚Äôs record for the most goals by a player at Asia‚Äôs premier event. Shortly after, Al Sheeb was on hand to deny Ahmed Khalil. Qatar added a third in the 81st minute when captain Hassan Al- Haydos manoeuvred past Bandar Al-Ahbabi and clipped the ball over Eisa. After the UAE‚Äôs Ismail Ahmed was shown a straight red card late on for dangerous play, substitute Hamid Ismail rounded off the scoring to confirm Qatar's place in the final. The match was marred by bottle and footwear-throwing incidents committed by the UAE supporters. This conduct was preceded by booing the Qatari national anthem. The two countries have had a hostile relationship and had cut ties due to the ongoing diplomatic crisis. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Saad Al Sheeb - CB 23Assim Madibo - CB 16Boualem Khoukhi - CB 4 Tarek Salman - RWB2 R√≥-R√≥   - LWB3 Abdelkarim Hassan - CM 10Hassan Al-Haydos (c) - CM 14Salem Al-Hajri - CM 12Karim Boudiaf  - CF 11Akram Afif   - CF 19Almoez Ali   - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 7 Ahmed Alaaeldin   - DF 8 Hamid Ismail   - DF 13Tameem Al-Muhaza   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 F√©lix S√°nchez } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 17Khalid Eisa - RB 13Khamis Esmaeel - CB 19Ismail Ahmed  - CB 6 Fares Juma (c) - LB 3 Walid Abbas - CM 2 Ali Salmeen - CM 5 Amer Abdulrahman   - RW 9 Bandar Al-Ahbabi - AM 20Saif Rashid   - LW 15Ismail Al Hammadi   - CF 7 Ali Mabkhout - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 10Ismail Matar   - FW 11Ahmed Khalil   - MF 16Mohamed Abdulrahman   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Alberto Zaccheroni } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Man of the Match: Boualem Khoukhi (Qatar) Assistant referees: Miguel Hern√°ndez (Mexico) Alberto Mor√≠n (Mexico) Fourth official: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan) Video assistant referee: Paolo Valeri (Italy) Assistant video assistant referees: Muhammad Taqi (Singapore) Chris Beath (Australia) } ==FinalReferencesExternal links== * Category:2019 AFC Asian Cup ","title":"2019 AFC Asian Cup knockout stage"},{"id":"56083544","text":"The 2019 AFC Asian Cup Final was a football match which determined the winner of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the 17th edition of the AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of the Asian Football Confederation. The match was held at the Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on 1 February 2019 and was contested by Japan and Qatar. Japan had won in each of its four previous AFC Asian Cup finals, while Qatar were playing in their first, which they managed to reach without conceding a goal in the prior six matches. Qatar won the final 3‚Äì1 for their first AFC Asian Cup title, scoring twice in the first half and earning a late penalty in the second half. For Japan, this was their first defeat in an Asian Cup final. Qatari fans were largely unable to attend the tournament due to the ongoing Qatar diplomatic crisis. ==Venue== Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the largest stadium in the United Arab Emirates, hosted the Asian Cup Final. The 43,000-seat stadium was built in 1980 and is primarily used by the Emirati national football team. Zayed Sports City was the host of the 1996 Asian Cup Final and 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship final, as well as several FIFA Club World Cup finals, most recently in 2018. The Dubai Roads and Transport Authority solicited independent bids in 2015 to build a 60,000-seat stadium to host the Asian Cup final, but Zayed Sports City Stadium was announced in 2017 as the venue for the opening match and final. ==Route to the final== { style=\\"width:100%; text-align:center\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; background:#99CCFF\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Japan !

They qualified for the 2019 tournament by topping Group E with an undefeated record of seven wins and one draw, scoring 27 goals and conceding none. After the team reached the round of 16 during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, head coach Akira Nishino was replaced by Hajime Moriyasu, who had assisted Nishino and served as coach of the under-23 team preparing for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Moriyasu elected to exclude several veteran players in his Asian Cup squad, including midfielder Shinji Kagawa and striker Shinji Okazaki, with the goal of exposing younger, in-form players to international competition. Under Moriyasu's tenure, Japan was undefeated in five matches before the start of the Asian Cup. In their opening match of the Asian Cup, Japan faced Turkmenistan and conceded a goal in the 26th minute, a long-range strike by Arslanmyrat Amanow, and entered halftime trailing 1‚Äì0. Japan took the lead in the second half with a brace from Yuya Osako, who scored in the 56th and 60th minutes, and added a third goal by Ritsu Doan eleven minutes later. The lead was cut back to 3‚Äì2 by a penalty kick scored in the 78th minute by Ahmet Ata√Ωew. Moriyasu acknowledged that the team struggled in the match against Turkmenistan and praised their performance before adding that they would need to improve in order to advance from the group stage. In their second match against Oman, Japan had several early chances that they failed to convert into goals before earning a penalty in the 28th minute for a tackle on Genki Haraguchi, who scored. The 1‚Äì0 win, which came with Oman being denied a penalty for an alleged handball in the first half, saw Japan qualify for the knockout round. Moriyasu fielded an entirely new starting lineup, save for forward Koya Kitagawa, for the final group stage match against Uzbekistan. Japan and clinched a first-place finish in Group F through a come-from-behind 2‚Äì1 victory over Uzbekistan. After conceding a goal in the 40th minute, Japan responded with a header scored by Yoshinori Muto in the 43rd minute and a long-distance strike by Tsukasa Shiotani in the 58th minute. The Samurai Blue faced Saudi Arabia in the round of 16 and played defensively, fielding a lineup similar to their first two group stage matches. Japan advanced with a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Saudis on a 20th-minute header scored by Takehiro Tomiyasu and protected the lead against the majority of possession and shots held by the Saudis. The quarter-finals marked the debut of the video assistant referee (VAR) system at the Asian Cup and was used in the match between Japan and Vietnam, calling back a goal in the 25th minute for a handball and awarding Japan a penalty kick in the 57th minute, which was scored by Ritsu Doan to give the Samurai Blue a 1‚Äì0 win. Moriyasu defended the team's results after receiving criticism over the team's style of play, which relied on one- goal margins in the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the semi-finals. Playing in the semi-finals against the top-ranked Iranian team, who had yet to concede a goal, the two teams were kept to a scoreless draw in the first half. Japan made several halftime adjustments to its attack that produced a 3‚Äì0 victory and advancement to their fifth Asian Cup final. Yuya Osako netted a brace with a header in the 56th minute and a penalty kick in the 67th minute that was awarded by VAR for a handball; Genki Haraguchi then added a third goal in stoppage time to seal the team's win. Qatar South Korea Qatar has participated in nine previous editions of the Asian Cup, advancing twice from the group stage in 2000 and 2011 before being eliminated in the quarter- finals. The country was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup and earned a qualification berth, prompting the Qataris to begin preparing the national team for the world stage. Former Barcelona youth coach F√©lix S√°nchez was named the manager of the U-23 and senior national teams in 2017, cultivating an attack-oriented style and utilizing young talents who had emerged since the World Cup announcement. In the second round of the Asian Cup qualification tournament, Qatar placed first with a record of seven wins and one loss‚Äîincluding a 15‚Äì0 victory over Bhutan that broke their record for their largest margin of victory. While their performance in the second round qualified them for the Asian Cup, Qatar failed to clinch a berth for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, placing last in its third-round group with seven losses in ten matches. S√°nchez called up a young squad, including eleven members aged younger than 22, that was primarily pooled from the domestic league's Al-Sadd and Al-Duhail as well as members of the team who had won the 2014 AFC U-19 Championship under his tenure. In two warm-up friendlies, Qatar earned an upset 1‚Äì0 victory over Switzerland and drew 2‚Äì2 with Iceland. The team was affected by the ongoing diplomatic dispute between Qatar and a coalition of Middle Eastern and Muslim nations led by Saudi Arabia and including hosts United Arab Emirates, causing them to take indirect flights and being denied access to federation officials and journalists. Qatar were drawn into Group E and opened their Asian Cup campaign against Lebanon, winning 2‚Äì0 on second- half goals by center-back Bassam Al-Rawi and forward Almoez Ali. It was the first time that Qatar had won an Asian Cup match hosted in another country. In their second match, facing North Korea in front of an announced attendance of 452 spectators at Khalifa bin Zayed Stadium, Qatar won 6‚Äì0 with four goals by Ali to reach the knockout round, which became Qatar's largest ever victory in their Asian Cup history. The final group stage match against Saudi Arabia was nicknamed the \\"Blockade Derby\\", referencing the land, air, and sea blockade, and was won 2‚Äì0 by Qatar with two goals scored by Almoez Ali to top their group comfortably. The team faced Iraq in the round of 16 and won 1‚Äì0, with the lone goal of the match coming from a free kick scored by Iraqi-born Bassam Al-Rawi in the 62nd minute. Qatar then played against 2015 runners-up South Korea, which had managed to eliminate Germany in the 2018 FIFA World Cup earlier before, in the quarter-finals and created the biggest shock in the tournament, a 1‚Äì0 win on a goal from Abdulaziz Hatem in the 78th minute, setting up a semi-finals match against hosts United Arab Emirates. The semi- final, dubbed the second installment of the \\"Blockade Derby\\", was played in front of 38,646 spectators at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, where hostile Emirati supporters threw sandals and water bottles at Qatari players. Boualem Khoukhi scored the opening goal for Qatar in the 22nd minute and was followed by Almoez Ali, who scored his eighth goal of the tournament in the 37th minute and tied the record set by Ali Daei for Iran in 1996. A goal by Hassan Al-Haydos in the 80th minute and substitute Hamid Ismail in stoppage time gave Qatar a 4‚Äì0 win to help them reach their first Asian Cup final. Qatar also became the second team to advance to the final without conceding a goal, following South Korea's run in 2015. ==Pre-match== Officials Ravshan Irmatov was the head referee at the final. Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov was selected to lead the officiating team for the final, which was announced by the AFC on 30 January 2019. He previously officiated at three FIFA World Cups, the 2012 Summer Olympics, FIFA Club World Cup, and the FIFA Confederations Cup. The final is Irmatov's fifth match as referee during the tournament, having officiated two group stage matches and two knockout matches. His compatriots Abdukhamidullo Rasulov and Jakhongir Saidov were chosen as assistant referees, while Chinese referee Ma Ning was the fourth official. Italian Paolo Valeri was named the video assistant referee, presiding over the first use of the technology in the final of the Asian Cup. Muhammad Taqi of Singapore and Chris Beath of Australia were the assistant video assistant referees for the match. Qatar player eligibility On 30 January 2019, soon after the hosts lost to Qatar in the semi-finals, the United Arab Emirates Football Association (UAEFA) lodged a formal appeal to the AFC over the eligibility of Sudanese-born striker Almoez Ali and Iraqi-born defender Bassam Al-Rawi, claiming that they did not qualify to play for Qatar. The appeal was filed on residency grounds per Article 7 of the FIFA statutes, which states a player is eligible to play for a representative team if he has \\"lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association\\". It was alleged by the UAEFA that Ali and Al-Rawi had not lived continuously in Qatar for at least five years over the age of 18, although the players claimed that their mothers were born in Qatar. On 1 February 2019, hours prior to the final, the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee ruled in favour of Qatar national team and dismissed the protest lodged by the UAEFA. ==Match== Summary The match kicked off at 18:00 local time in Abu Dhabi at Zayed Sports City Stadium, in front of an announced attendance of 36,776 spectators, including several thousand Omanis. Japan began the match with two set piece chances, but neither was able to provide a scoring chance. Qatar's Almoez Ali opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a bicycle kick from after juggling a ball received from Akram Afif. With his ninth goal of the tournament, Ali took the record for most goals scored during an Asian Cup that was previously held by Iranian Ali Daei. Abdulaziz Hatem scored Qatar's next goal in the 27th minute, shooting from past Japanese goalkeeper Sh≈´ichi Gonda towards the top corner. Japan regained possession and found several scoring chances before and after halftime, including a missed header from Yoshinori Muto and several corner kicks, but were unable to produce a shot on goal. Qatar received an early chance to score their third goal in the 56th minute on a counterattack, but the shot by Hatem went over the crossbar. The lead was cut to 2‚Äì1 with a 69th-minute goal from close range by Takumi Minamino‚Äîthe first to be conceded by Qatar during the tournament. Qatar were awarded a penalty kick in the 82nd minute by the video assistant referee for a handball by Japanese captain Maya Yoshida, who blocked a shot from a corner kick. The penalty was converted by Akram Afif to give Qatar a 3‚Äì1 lead that they kept until the end of the match.

With their victory over Japan, Qatar had earned its first Asian Cup title, having never previously advanced past the quarter-finals, and became the ninth country to win the tournament. The match was Japan's first loss in the tournament after a perfect record of six wins as well as their first loss in an Asian Cup final, having won the previous four final matches. Qatar finished the tournament with a perfect record, winning all seven matches en route to the title. The match also marked the debut of a new match ball and trophy for the Asian Cup, as well as the first use of a video assistant referee during the tournament final. Almoez Ali, who was named the AFC Asian Cup MVP as the best player of the tournament, won the top scorer award after scoring nine of Qatar's 19 goals in the tournament, surpassing the Asian Cup record of eight goals set by Ali Daei of Iran in 1996. Goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb kept six successive clean sheets, winning him the award for best goalkeeper of the tournament, and only conceded one goal during the entire tournament, to Takumi Minamino in the final. Qatar's Akram Afif was selected as the final's man of the match, with one penalty goal and two assists in the match. Overall, he finished the tournament with ten assists, the most of any player. Runners-up Japan won the fair play award as the team with the tournament's best disciplinary record. Qatar and Japan were both invited to also compete in the 2019 Copa Am√©rica prior to the tournament. According to Qatar-based media outlet Al Jazeera, Emirati newspapers emphasized that Japan lost the final, reflecting the ongoing diplomatic rift between Qatar and the UAE. ==See also== * 2019 AFC Asian Cup knockout stage ==ReferencesExternal links== * Final Category:21st century in Abu Dhabi 2019 Category:February 2019 sports events in Asia Category:Japan national football team matches Category:Qatar national football team matches Category:Sports competitions in Abu Dhabi Category:2019 in Japanese football Category:2018‚Äì19 in Qatari football ","title":"2019 AFC Asian Cup Final"},{"id":"56083550","text":"Martti Kullervo M√∂ls√§ (born 2 April 1952 in Kihni√∂, Finland) is a Finnish politician.

Westmeath. In 1627, he translated Annals of Clonmacnoise into English,Mageoghegan (Conall), CODECS and thus gaining him the title Conall the Historian. ==Biography== Family Mag Eochag√°inn was a direct Geoghegan descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages ‚Äì specifically from the branch of Fiachu mac N√©ill. His paternal grandmother, Gyles \\"Shiela\\" O'Dempsey was sister to Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier. It is speculated that he was born in 1592, in Lismoyny (Co. Westmeath), near Clara, Co. Offaly, to Anne Fitzgerald (or Fitz Thomas; d. 1580), and Neal/Niall Mag Eochag√°in, brother of Roche MacGeoghegan. His wife is thought to have been Margaret Coughlin ‚Äì his only known sons being Conla, husband of Marian Molloy (daughter of Art M‚ÄôCahir Molloy, of Ralehyn), and Anthony, Bishop of Meath. If this were the case, that would make him a common ancestor of many Geoghegans and Gahagans. He died in 1644. The Annals of Clonmacnoise The Annals of Clonmacnoise is also known as \\"Mageoghagan‚Äôs Book\\" in honor of MacGeoghegan's contributions to its translation. Mag Eochag√°in dedicated this translation to his brother-in-law, Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochl√°in (Terrence Coughlin), whose family was among the last to uphold and practice native Gaelic Irish customs. The translation was completed on April 20, 1627 in the Castle of Lemanaghan in County Offaly. The original manuscript of MacGeoghegan's translation is lost, but there are several copies of it in both the Library of Trinity College and in the British Museum.

It has rarely used, primitive campsites sprinkled along streams and a ravine with a \\"great view\\" that gives no evidence of man's activities. The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. ==Location and access== Boundary of the Wilson Mountain wildland of the Jefferson National Forest as identified by the Wilderness Society. The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 10 miles northeast of Buchanan, Virginia, between the James River on the west, SR 780 on the northeast, and North Creek Road (FS 59) on the south. The Forest Service 2015 Motor Vehicle Use Map shows roads and trails in the forest and gives the type of vehicle allowed on each route with possible seasonal restrictions. The map covering Wilson Mountain area (Map 31) is included in the gallery below. Caution should be taken when using forest service road numbers since they are not consistent in different maps of the area. Trails and roads into the area include: *The Wilson Mountain Trail, FS 12, 3.0 miles, moderate, blue-blazed. *Sprouts Run National Recreation Trail, FS 3003, 3.3 miles, moderate, yellow-blazed. *Skillen Mountain Road (Rt 316), 1.7 miles with an additional 0.3 miles seasonally restricted *Gilmore Hollow A Road (Rt 280-A), 0.7 miles. *Pine Ridge Trail The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 789. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The James River Face Wilderness Addition is covered by USGS topographic map Arnold Valley. A key to the topographic maps for the northern half of the Jefferson National Forest is in the gallery below. ==Natural history== The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. The Natural Heritage Program has identified three special biological areas in this wildland: the North Creek Woodland, Jennings Creek Shale Barren and Sprouts Run. These sites contain shale barrens with a unique collection of plants. Compared to the Ridge and Valley Province to the west, the Blue Ridge Mountains have few shale barrens. There is a tract of forest close the ridgeline of Pine Mountain with trees older than 140 years. Water thrushes are found in a small wetland on the northwestern edge of the area. The area also contains unusual plants such as the Virginia white-haired leatherflower, the Virginia false-gromwell, crested coral root and the Biltmore form of white ash. Hemlock beech forests are found along Sprouts Run. ==Topography== Wilson Mountain, a long ridge facing the James River with a 2044 feet elevation, is composed of quartzite and metasiltstone. This ridge is just south of the section of James River that forms the boundary between two physiographic provinces, the Blue Ridge and the Ridge and Valley. Whereas the Blue Ridge Mountains are composed mostly of granitic/metamorphic rock, the Ridge and Valley is composed of sedimentary, folded rock. Thus the area forms a habitat linkage between the two provinces. Other peaks in the area include Pine Ridge (2172 feet) and Thomas Mountain (2231 feet). ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The area was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The Gilmore Hollow timber project was approved in 1993, and the 196 acre Wilson Mountain timber project was approved in 1997. About half of the wildland is in a forest service prescription that allows up to 16% of the area to be logged in order to create early successional habitat A large part of the remaining area is designated as \\"Dispersed Recreation-Suitable\\" which also allows logging. In 2001, the Skillern Mountain fire burned parts of the eastern end of the wildland. ==Nearby Wildlands== Nearby wilderness areas and wildlands recognized as one of Virginia's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" by the Wilderness Society are: *James River Face Wilderness *Thunder Ridge Wilderness *James River Face Wilderness Addition *White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain *North Creek (conservation area) *Cove Mountain ==References== Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Protected areas of Bedford County, Virginia Category:Protected areas of Rockbridge County, Virginia ","title":"Wilson Mountain"},{"id":"56084178","text":"Kendra Shank is a jazz vocalist. ==Career== Shank's mother was an actress and playwright and her father was a playwright and teacher at the University of California.

It was founded in 1997. ==History== Karate was first introduced in Ghana in the second half of the 1990s. Until the late 1990s, karate training in Ghana was more of a traditional martial art than a sport. Karate prospered because of the immense contribution of practitioners and mentors such as Sensei Daniel Djura, founder of Africa Goju; Sensei Donald Djura; Sensei Moses Baiden; Sensei Duke Banson; and Sensei Quagrine. On 30 April 1997, a national body was registered and inaugurated with the National Sports Council (NSC) in the name of Ghana Karate-Do Federation (GKF) as the 26th sporting association. The GKF was affiliated to the Union of African Karate Federation (UFAK) and eventually to the World Karate Federation (WKF). The founding members were Melvin Brown, Francis Fuster, Benjamin Selormey, Victor Amara, Daniel Gyamfi and Samuel Akpalu. After the inauguration of the federation, there was the need to form an executive and a technical committee. The executive committee was chaired by Rtd. Captain George Mould, and FrancisFuster and Jude Adu-Amankwah were his vice. All the other members were karatekas and served on the technical committee with Benjamin Selormey as Technical Director. The Ghana Karate-Do Federation later came to be recognized as Ghana Karate-Do Association. In 2004 Jude Adu-Amankwah took over from Capt. Mould as president of the association, with Sensei Melvin Brown as Technical Director, and Sensei Kwabena A. Poku as Referee and vice to the Technical Director. The other members of the technical committee were Sensei Prince Wilson, Sensei George-Slater Commodore, Sensei Saadisu Mamah Idrissu, Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe and Sensei Sylvester Davies. The technical committee is in charge of coaching and general training and grading of karatekas at the national level. The membership of the executive committee was changed in 2009, with Michael Nunoo as the Chairman of the association and Sensei Saadisu Idrissu as the Technical Director. The present composition of the Management Board as of May 2011 is Michael Nunoo, Chairman; Ade Sawyer, Vice-Chairman; Patrick Anyidoho-Cofie, General Secretary; Nathaniel Nartey, member; Sensei Kwabena Poku, Head Coach; Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe, Deputy Coach; and Dr. Sulley, member. The executive committee is now referred to as the management board. The present members of the technical committee are Sensei Kwabena A. Poku, Head Coach; Sensei Prince Wilson; Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe, Deputy Coach; Sensei Isaac Amponsah; Sensei Ibrahim Jarrah; Victor Lartey; and Emmanuel Adjei. The GKA took its first outing the year it was inaugurated, in 1997, to the UFAK Zone 3 Championships in the Ivory Coast, and won two gold, four silver and two bronze medals. Since then the association has participated in many yearly UFAK Zone 3 Championships and has performed increasingly well, winning laurels in both Kumite and Kata. The Association has also represented Ghana in three All Africa Games since its inauguration: in 1997, 2003 and 2007, when contestant Victor Lartey won by correction of a previous decision. ==International competition== Ghana Karate Do Association is a member of the African umbrella organization Union of African Karate Federation (UAKF) as well as the World Association for World Karate Federation (WKF).

The inscription is notable for including symbols for numerals \\"8, 10, 80 and 90\\" in the 5th-century, as well as mentioning the ancient city of Pataliputra (modern Patna). ==Description== The inscribed stones were discovered in 1872 by R.S. Prasad on blocks inside a room of a new house built from demolished and recut stone. The house was located in Gadhwa Fort, also referred to as the Garhwa Fort, in Allahabad district. Prasad brought these to the attention of the archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, who visited them and after cleaning the lime was able to obtain prints. The first of these were published in 1873, while the last was published in 1890 after Cunningham carefully removed all the remaining lime and cleaned the surface to find additional inscriptions. The origin of the stones is unknown. The recutting and the prior history of the pillar blocks had badly damaged most of the inscription, but preserved enough under a coat of lime. The original block was inscribed on its various faces. The structure it belonged to was demolished then likely cut into pieces, thereafter smoothened. The recovered stone has on one face only traces of 11 lines each with about 13 characters. These are too damaged to be read reliably, but the size and pattern of characters match the other faces. The back face was likely hammered and broken into two, leaving a rough edge with no text. The breaking has damaged about the last half of the all lines on the left face, and the first half of all lines on the right face. The damage extends to the top, where some number of lines have been lost. The discovered inscription is in Sanskrit in prose. The upper part of the inscription on the Gadhwa stone fragment 1 is dated to 408 CE. It states that Chandragupta II the \\"worshipper of the divine one\\" is establishing a perpetual sattra (almshouse, charitable feeding houses) with a gift of \\"ten dindras\\". The next section is dated to 418 CE, and it states that Kumaragupta, the \\"worshipper of the divine one\\" is establishing another perpetual sattra with two gifts of \\"ten dindras and (...)\\". The third decipherable section is a third grant, also by Kumaragupta which establishes another perpetual sattra with a gift of \\"twelve dindras\\". ==Significance== The Gadhwa stone inscription is significant in establishing a tradition of charitable giving by Indian kings and the existence of the institution of sattra in early 5th-century. It also confirms that Kumaragupta succeeded as the monarch of the Gupta Empire after Chandragupta II. According to the archaeologist Michael Willis, the tradition of charitable feeding houses for Brahmins and the needy can be traced to the mid-2nd century CE in an Kushana era inscription. The Garhwa inscriptions, states Willis, when combined with the Bilsad and Podagarh inscriptions suggests that sattra were attached to Hindu temples and these were charity- based community kitchens that fed the \\"Brahmins, wandering ascetics (sadhus) and the destitute\\". This endowment-driven activity was deemed to be an aspect of Hindu puja. Willis adds that the damaged Gadhwa inscriptions leaves it unclear whether the sattra was \\"for the benefit of brahmins\\" or was \\"established and run by the Brahmins\\" financed by the king's endowment. ==References== Bibliography * * ==External links== *Gadhwa Stone Inscriptions: Pillar Fragment 1, Donations 1‚Äì3, Siddham, United Kingdom *Gadhwa Stone Inscriptions: Pillar Fragment 2, Donations 4‚Äì9, Siddham, United Kingdom Category:Indian inscriptions Category:Mathura ","title":"Gadhwa Stone Inscriptions"},{"id":"56084336","text":"John C.

N. Rao. Listed as Rambayin Kadhal The film featured K. Sarangkapani and K. L. V. Vasantha in the lead roles. The film has an alternate title Yathbhavishyan. ==Plot== The story is based on Hindu mythology. Ramba is a dancer in Indra's court. One day she descends to earth to see its beauty. She is enthralled by the riverside scenery in a country. She stays there for a long time and hence gets late for a dance performance in the court. Indra gets angry and curses her to become a statue near that river. Narada takes pity on Ramba and asks Indra to give a remedy. Indra agrees and says that Ramba can rejoin as court dance once she has suffered enough for her penance. In the meantime, an innocent young man, Yathabavishayan, who lives in a village near the river is fooled by his friends. They make him marry a donkey. After celebrations, they leave him. Yathabavishayan falls asleep. Narada arranges the statue (Ramba) to be placed near Yathabavishayan. When the young man gets up, he finds that he was sleeping at the foot of a statue of a woman. While he gets excited about it, the statue comes alive as a young woman. She falls in love with Yathabavishayan and takes him to heaven with her. One day, while in heaven, Yathabavishayan asks her to take him to Yama's Kingdom. He learns the secret of living without the fear of death. Yama finds now he has no work because people on earth has come to know the secret of staying alive. Yama makes inquiry and complaints to Indra that Ramba is responsible from bringing a human being to his (Yama's) Kingdom and taking him back to earth thus, revealing the secret of staying alive without death. Indra curses Ramba to become a ghost. Now Yathabavishayan could not see Ramba. He is mentally affected and wanders about. Ramba realiases that she cannot go back to Indra's court as dancer if she stays as a ghost. She asks Narada to advise her. He tells her a way out. As per that plan, she enters the body of Subashini, the princess of Kasi. The King, Kasi Rajan and his wife, Kasi Rani are baffled by the strange behaviour of the princess. They arrange for a witch doctor to cure her. During the witch doctor's rituals, the wandering Yathabavishayan gets there. Finding him, Ramba, within the body of the princess comes out and goes towards Yathabavishayan. Narada appears to her and advises her that she belongs to the heaven and therefore she should relinquish any love she has towards a human being. She accepts his advice. As she has relinquished her love for an earthly being her status is restored. She tells Yathabavishayan to marry Subashini, the princess. So, Yathabavishayan marries the princess and also inherits her father's Kingdom. ==Cast== Cast according to the opening credits of the film ;Male cast * K. Sarangapani Yathabavishyan * R.

M. Varga is a fictional character in the FX television series Fargo. He is the main antagonist of the third season and is portrayed by David Thewlis. ==Character overview== Varga is a cunning and verbose criminal mastermind who presides over a massive money laundering scheme. He is the implied boss of the criminal organization Narwhal, which employs his henchmen Yuri Gurka (Goran Bogdan), Meemo (Andy Yu) and Golem (DJ Qualls), who carry out murders and confidence tricks. Varga is of apparent English origin and suffers from bulimia nervosa, which leads to his teeth deteriorating. On the character's eating disorder, Thewlis has said, \\"The idea is bulimia in his life. He‚Äôs a man who is so ultimately in control of seemingly everything, and it‚Äôs therefore an expression of the one part of his existence that he‚Äôs not in control of, something that at times he loses control of‚Ä¶ vulnerability.\\" Despite his wealth, Varga shuns excess and is always seen wearing a discount suit and second-hand tie. Throughout the season, he is seen living in the back of a semi-trailer, in which he sleeps on the floor and works on a workstation connected to computer servers. According to Varga's creator, Noah Hawley: \\"It‚Äôs a very spartan life he lives... Obviously he‚Äôs got a lot of money, but you‚Äôll never see him in a hotel or in a towncar.\\" There are signs of paranoia in Varga's dialogue and behavior: he expresses a belief in Moon landing conspiracy theories as well as prejudices such as antisemitism, believes that wealth should be used to \\"become invisible\\" to hide from \\"the Mongol hordes\\" and appears to admire Joseph Stalin (a portrait of whom is seen on a wall next to Varga's workstation). ==Storyline== In 2010, Varga arrives at Stussy Corporation offices when CEO Emmit Stussy (Ewan McGregor) seeks to repay a business loan from Varga's shady organization made two years before. However, Varga explains that the company does not want their money back, and that it was an \\"investment\\" and partnership with his organization. Concerned for his business, Emmit asks his lawyer Irv Blumkin to investigate Varga. A Google search causes the lawyer's computer to crash and, later, Varga's henchmen Yuri Gurka and Meemo toss him off a parking garage. Varga then takes ownership of an unused wing of Emmit's offices. Learning of a theft by Emmit's ne'er-do- well younger brother Ray (also McGregor), and suspecting Varga was involved in Irv's death, Emmit and his business partner Sy Feltz (Michael Stuhlbarg) consider selling their company. Things escalate when Varga shows up unannounced for dinner at Emmit's house. After dinner, Varga proposes to sign Emmit on as a business partner. Although Emmit is reluctant, Varga convinces him that signing will allow him to become much richer and ensure his wealth is protected; the former ultimately complies. When police officer Winnie Lopez (Olivia Sandoval) is investigating a hit-and-run that Sy committed during a visit to Ray, Sy acts very suspiciously because Yuri and Meemo are watching. As punishment, Varga takes Sy's office, urinates into Sy's mug, and makes him drink it at gunpoint. Varga has a meeting with Emmit, voicing his distrust of Sy and suggests he and Ray may be working together to bring Emmit down. Explaining to Emmit and Sy, he plans to expand Stussy Lots by 16 garages within three months; Sy is wary, but Emmit seems eager. When police chief Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) and Lopez try to question Emmit, Varga curtails the meeting and obtains Gloria's card. A distraught Emmit calls Varga to manage the cleanup of Ray's death at the former's hand. Varga concocts a story that Ray abused his girlfriend Nikki Swango (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), causing injuries actually inflicted by Yuri, and she retaliated. On Christmas, Varga asks Emmit how he feels about killing Ray; Emmit responds, \\"Free\\", but begins to cry. He sends uniformed assassin Golem (DJ Qualls) to kill an imprisoned Nikki but, when this fails, his men plant a ramp, causing the prison bus, with Nikki and Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) inside, to overturn. Nikki escapes with Wrench's help; Golem and Yuri are killed during the chase. In the meanwhile, Varga poisons Sy, sending him into a coma. Two-and-a-half months later, Nikki and Mr. Wrench are still at large, and Varga has expanded Emmit's business after becoming his partner. Varga gives Emmit tranquilizers to calm him, which he feigns taking. In an attempt to get out from under Varga's thumb, Emmit turns himself in to the police and confesses to all his crimes. To nullify Emmit's confession, Varga directs Meemo to kill two random men with the last name of Stussy: Marvin Stussy, a dentist in St. Cloud, is killed in the same manner as Ray, as well as George Stussy, with the intention of these two deaths plus Ray and Ennis looking like the work of an unusual serial killer. Varga also directs an ex-con named Donald Woo to be picked up for the murders and deliberately take the fall, admitting to having committed all four. Varga meets with Nikki, and in order to get out of the blackmailing he repeatedly attempts to both poison and to hire her, but she refuses. Nikki gives Varga 24 hours to pay her ransom or she'll send his and Emmit's financials to the IRS. After returning from the police station, Emmit is forced to sign many contracts, after which he grabs Meemo's gun and attempts to force Varga to withdraw from his house and business. Varga incapacitates him, and Meemo attacks him from behind. After leaving Emmit's house, Varga, Meemo, and the crew go to meet Nikki and Mr. Wrench to pay ransom for the hard drives, but are ambushed by Wrench. Meemo and his accomplices are killed, but Varga escapes. Emmit, regaining consciousness, goes to Stussy Lots' offices to find that Ruby Goldfarb (Mary McDonnell), a businesswoman who is apparently in league with Varga, has finalized her acquisition of the company for $100,000 and has begun moving her employees into the building. Goldfarb assures Emmit that he holds millions in offshore accounts, but that he is liable for Stussy Lots' large debts and advises him to declare bankruptcy. Five years later, Gloria, now an agent for the Department of Homeland Security, interviews Varga, who is going by the name \\"Daniel Rand\\", in a holding cell. She declares that in five minutes he will be going to jail for money laundering and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder. However, Varga asserts that in five minutes Gloria's superior will arrive and let him go free. Gloria scoffs, then starts counting down the minutes on the cell's clock while Varga hums, confident. ==Production== Prior to his casting, Thewlis has already been a fan of the original 1996 film and had seen the previous two seasons. Upon learning that Hawley was interested in him for season 3, he jumped at the chance. Thewlis enjoyed playing the character, saying \\"I think I‚Äôve had more fun playing Varga than I‚Äôve had for quite a number of years, playing anything. It‚Äôs just so beautifully written. Every few weeks, I got a new script, I‚Äôd settle down with a cup of coffee like I was about to read Anna Karenina.\\" Thewlis appeared in the 1998 Coen brothers film, The Big Lebowski. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/fullcredits ==Reception== Thewlis received critical acclaim for his performance. Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire remarked, \\"When Fargo Year 3 announced its cast, Ewan McGregor was clearly the biggest name involved, and the fact that he would be playing brothers had everyone intrigued. But in subsequent weeks, fans aren't clamoring for McGregor's Ray or Emmit, but they are obsessed with the character of V.M. Varga. And that's because David Thewlis is turning in one of the spring's darkest, most horrifying supporting performances, one that will be hard to overlook this Emmy season.\\" Brian Tallerica of Vulture.com, praising the whole cast, singled out Thewlis, saying \\"If I had to pick one (MVP), it might be Thewlis, who gave the season its simmering menace.\\" Maureen Ryan of Variety also opined \\"David Thewlis' sallow, well-spoken gangster, for instance, is one of the most menacing men to ever wear a sack-like, forgettable bargain suit.\\" For his work on Fargo, Thewlis was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film. ==References== Category:Fargo (TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Category:Fictional blackmailers Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional crime bosses Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional fraudsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Antisemitism in fiction Category:Eating disorders Category:Male characters in television ","title":"V.

These three- dimensional selfies are also known as 3D portraits, 3D figurines, 3D-printed figurines, mini-me figurines and miniature statues. In 2014 a first 3D printed bust of a President, Barack Obama, was made. 3D-digital-imaging specialists used handheld 3D scanners to create an accurate representation of the President. == Description == The capture of a subject as a 3D model can be accomplished in many ways. One of the methods, is called photogrammetry. Many systems use one or more digital cameras to take 2D pictures of the subject, under normal lighting, under projected light patterns, or a combination of these. Inexpensive systems use a single camera which is moved around the subject in 360¬∞ at various heights, over minutes, while the subject stays immobile. More elaborate systems have a vertical bar of cameras rotate around the subject, usually achieving a full scan in 10 seconds. Most expensive systems have an enclosed 3D photo booth with 50 to 100 cameras statically embedded in walls and the ceiling, firing all at once, eliminating differences in image capture caused by movements of the subject. Friday, 12 April 2019 A piece of software then reconstructs a 3D model of the subject from these pictures. One of the 3D photo booth, which creates life-like portraits, is called Veronica Chorographic Scanner. The scanner participated in the project of Royal Academy of Arts, where people could have themselves scanned. The scanner utilized 8 cameras taking 96 photographs of a person from each angle. Photogrammetry scanning is generally considered more life-like, than scanning with 3D scanners. Another method for capturing a 3D selfie uses dedicated 3D scanning equipment which may more accurately capture geometry and texture, but take longer to perform. Scanners may be handheld, tripod mounted or fitted to another system that will allow the full geometry of a person to be captured. One of the well-known full body 3D scanners are Shapify booth, based on Artec Eva 3D scanners and Twindom Twinstant Mobile. Production of 3D selfieshttps://www.3dgeneration.com/3d-figuren/ is enabled by 3D printing technologies. This includes the ability to 3D print in full color using gypsum-based binder jetting techniques, giving the figurine a sandstone-like texture and look.

This process relies on the presence of cyanobacteria as a partner species within the lichen. The ability to fix nitrogen enables lichen to live in nutrient- poor environments. Lichen can also extract nitrogen from the rocks on which they grow. Nitrogen fixation, and hence the abundance of lichen and their host plants, may be decreased by application of nitrogen-based agricultural fertilizer and by atmospheric pollution. ==The nitrogen cycle== The nitrogen cycle is one of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. It involves the conversion of nitrogen into different chemical forms. The main processes of the nitrogen cycle are the fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. As one of the macronutrients, nitrogen plays an important role in plant growth. The nitrogen cycle is affected by environmental factors. For example, in the subarctic heath, increase in temperature can cause nitrogen fixation to increase or decrease based on season, while overall climate warming indirectly caused the vegetation change which in turn affected the nitrogen fixation process. ==Lichens== Lichens are symbiotic organisms that play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle on Earth. The characteristics of lichens, such as strong resistance to factors such as desiccation, ability to grow and break down rocks allow lichen to grow in different types of environment including highly nitrogen limited area such as subarctic heath. While it does not occur often, formation of akinetes (type of cell formed by cyanobacteria which are resistant to cold and desiccation) was observed in nitrogen fixing lichen. Depending on its partner, lichens derive the carbon and nitrogen from algal and cyanobacteria photobionts (which fixes nitrogen from the air). Lichen fungi can fix nitrogen during the day and night, as long the dark period is not too long.  Nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing lichens  Both nitrogen-fixing lichens and non-nitrogen-fixing lichens take up nitrogen from the environment as a nutrient. Both type of lichens secrete many different organic compounds to absorb minerals from the substrates. Main difference between nitrogen fixing lichen and non-nitrogen fixing lichen is their photosynthetic partner: nitrogen fixing lichen partner with cyanobacteria which can fix nitrogen from the air, while green alga, partner of non nitrogen fixing lichen, does not perform the same process. The nitrogen fixation is energetically costly due to chemical transformation and only about 10% of lichen are partnered with cyanobacteria. In agricultural regions, non nitrogen fixing lichen reflect uptake of ammonia emission indicating that it have lower nitrogen value. Some lichens such as Placopsis gelada contain both nitrogen fixing phototrophs and non nitrogen-fixing phototrophs in which Nostoc (cyanobacteria, the phototrophic nitrogen fixer) was dwelling within cephalodia (small gall like structure within lichen; contains cyanobacteria symbionts). In such cases, heterocyst differentiation was greater in cephalodia when compared to having Nostoc as the primary symbionts in lichens, showing that, in the presence of non nitrogen-fixing phototroph, Nostoc specialize for nitrogen fixation. == Interaction with lichen ==  Response to nitrogen and phosphorus  A lichen's response to nutrient enrichment depends on not only on species and environmental factors but also partially on thallus concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Ammonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen can be assimilated by lichen along with phosphorus as an important stimulant for cyanolichens. The photobiont will become less dependent on fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases as it will be able to access its own nitrogen and it will stimulate the photobiont, causing it to build up, resulting in increased photosynthesis which increases carbon input. However, for lichens that cannot increase their photobiont growth, nitrogen deposition can be damaging due to higher nitrogen concentration than their biological requirements. Generally, when a lichenized algal cell is nitrogen limited, the addition of nitrogen caused the growth of algal cells. Under nitrogen limiting condition, chlorophyll concentration was positively correlated with the growth of algal cells indicating that should the concentration of chlorophyll increase, the photobiont population will also increase. As lichens absorb nitrogen through fixation, it will have a very strong negative reaction if the nitrogen availability changes, indicating its sensitivity to environmental changes. According to the experiment by Sparrius et al., when nitrogen fertilizer was added into the soil, lichen cover was reduced by ~50%, while the addition of phosphorus showed opposite result. In the region such as boreal forest, where nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting nutrients and for symbiotic interaction to occur properly, their ratio must be balanced. General pollution of climate that is indicated by the concentration of nitrogen oxides can also affect the growth of lichen. When compared to bryophyte (non-vascular land plant), which is also sensitive to nitrogen fertilizer, lichen showed a much stronger response.  Nitrogen metabolism  There are many different species of lichens and each has its own way of allocating nitrogen. The non nitrogen fixing lichen invests a large amount of nitrogen into photosynthetic tissue, whereas nitrogen fixing lichen will invest into the fungal tissue. Nitrogen-fixing lichen species can only attain a certain amount of nitrogen, as the addition of ammonium decreases its rate of nitrogen-fixation, which decreases the amount of nitrogen that is exported into the adjacent hyphae. Nitrogen fixation is energy dependent and very costly for lichens. In a region where nitrogen deposition is high, lichens have a lower uptake of nitrogen in comparison to the Antarctic green algal lichen, which takes up 90% of nitrogen deposition in both nitrate and ammonium form. Some lichen species are able to refrain from assimilating excessive amount of nitrogen in order to maintain a balanced tissue concentration. Majority of lichen species absorbs more NH4+ than NO3- and the impact of temperature on the rate of fixation is \\"consonant to the normal enzymatic kinetics of them\\".  Effects of nitrogen fixation  Nitrogen fixing lichens actively fix atmospheric nitrogen using the nostoc, located in the cephalodia. Lichens are sensitive to nitrogen availability. Upon nitrogen fixation, there will be an increase of algal cell growth, chlorophyll concentration, and photobiont population. While costly, in regions where nitrogen availability is low, fixation process is the main way for the lichen to absorb nitrogen which is macronutrient (essential nutrient). == Importance ==  Ecology  Nitrogen, as a macronutrient and a biogeochemical cycle, also affects the ecology. Through the nitrogen cycle, it breaks down into the chemical form that allows plants to absorb as nutrients. There are certain regions in the world that most plants cannot live due to harsh environments as well as lack of nutrients such as nitrogen. That means that in some regions, the biogeochemical cycle (including nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle) is unlikely to run smoothly. Lichen is able to absorb nitrogen in multiple forms from soil, rock, and air, taking a part in carbon cycle at the same time. Even though only a small fraction of lichens have the ability to fix nitrogen, it helps the lichen to spread throughout the world and survive even in the harsh environment. The industrial nitrogen fertilizer greatly affected the vegetation and agriculture throughout the world, resulting significantly increased the amount of food with better quality, but it has a negative impact on ecology in the long run. Deposition of nitrogen causes soil acidification, and the nitrogen in the fertilizer are often leached through soil and water, running off the different area. Soil acidification increases toxicity of the soil which reduces plant biodiversity and based on the toxic level of soil acidification, heavy metal such as aluminum and iron can be related to soil water.  Rock and soil  Earth's mantle contains non-atmospheric nitrogen in the form of rocks and in the soil. Weathering of the rocks and stone are normally caused by physical, chemical and biological processes. Plants cannot absorb nitrogen from rocks, but fungi can. Fungi within lichens can extract nutrients from mineral surfaces by secreting organic acids. The organic acids (e.g. phenolic acids) are important in solubilizing nutrients from inorganic substrates. A study was conducted to test rock phosphate solubilization by lichen-forming fungi. Bacteria that were attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces stimulate exopolysaccharide synthesis. While lichens have the ability to absorb nitrogen from rock, this only accounts for a small portion of the nitrogen cycle compared to the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen as it is more easily available.  Effects on vegetation  Photobionts will become less dependent on fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases, as it will be able to access its own nitrogen, and primary producers' nutrient limit will also be reduced. Nitrogen is one of the more limiting nutrients and the addition of nitrogen stimulates the photobiont, building up its cell, which subsequently increases its photosynthesis and its carbon input. Multiple nitrogen compounds can be assimilated by lichens, such as NH4+, NO3‚àí and organic nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen deposition reduces the nutrient limitation of primary production. Increase in nitrogen deposition will allow the photobiont to access its own nitrogen which makes it less fungal dependent but only up to certain point. Depending on the environmental nitrogen availability, the addition of nitrogen can either increase and decrease the growth of the lichen. If the lichen cannot increase its photobiont growth, high nitrogen uptake may result in a higher concentration than it physiologically requires which will negatively affect the lichen and its host plant as the other nutrients are too limiting. Lichen's response to nutrient enrichment is both species-specific and dependent on environmental factors such as nutrient concentration, light availability and water supply. == Nitrogen stress == Lichen is nitrogen sensitive and change in nitrogen availability can affect its health greatly. Two main nitrogen stress factors for lichens are nitrogen deficiency and high nitrogen deposition. Both types of nitrogen stress result in the reduction of the rate of thallus expansion in lichen. Nitrogen stressed lichen did not show a significant change in chitin:chlorophyll ratios, but ergosterol concentration showed significant increase indicating a higher demand on the respiratory system. The Haber-Bosch process is the main industrial procedure for nitrogen fertilizer (ammonia) production today which is used for agricultural purposes; it is stated that more than 5 billion people owe their existence to it. It has increased food production and farmers no longer have to sacrifice crop yield, for nitrogen application eliminates the need for rotating sequence. However, nitrogen deposition causes soil acidification as well as nitrogen leaching. In the long term, use of nitrogen fertilizer causes the soil to acidify which reduce the crop performance due heavy metal toxicity and reduction of other nutrients. Leached nitrogen can also travel to other regions via water which will contaminate the water and affect plant biodiversity in the nearby areas such as forest or empty fields where lichens are likely to be present. According to an experiment, the ammonium toxicity due to nitrogen deposition reduced the vitality of lichen greatly at different regions such as inland dunes, boreal conditions, and subarctic heaths. == References == Category:Lichenology Category:Nitrogen cycle ","title":"Lichens and nitrogen cycling"},{"id":"56084856","text":"Ming Dynasty () is a 2019 Chinese historical television series starring lead actors Tang Wei and Zhu Yawen. The fictionalized series is adapted from the Chinese novel The Chronicle of the Six Eras () by Lianjing Zhuyi (). The television series is aired on Hunan Television. The show gained much attention and viewership from non-Chinese viewers, having already achieved high ratings in mainland China, despite the director taking on an artistic interpretation from the literary Chinese classic. == Synopsis == During the first year of Emperor Yongle of Ming's reign, the royal doctor Jing Qing and his whole family was beheaded by the Emperor. However, his two daughters were saved. The youngest daughter is adopted by the Hu family and is named Hu Shanxiang. The eldest daughter was rescued and adopted by Sun Zhong under the name of Sun Ruowei. Years later, the mysterious yet powerful Qingzheng Cult manipulates Sun Ruowei in secret by trying to get her to marry the ambitious Prince of Han, Zhu Gaoxu. However, Sun Ruowei somehow becomes an imperial concubine to (then) Crown Prince Xuande, whom she had met before on her previous adventures. Now the concubine of her enemy's son, she plotted revenge but finally gave up her own personal vengeance for the sake of the citizens of Ming, and truly ended up falling in love with her husband. After the untimely passing of the Xuande Emperor, Sun Ruowei successively experienced the power usurpation of her son Emperor Yingzong of Ming by the Jingtai Emperor. With her wisdom and ability, she rescued the Ming dynasty several times from danger while helping her son to become a noble and virtuous ruler. == Cast ==  Main  * Tang Wei as Sun Ruowei, Empress Sun ** The daughter of an Imperial Physician killed during the reign of Yongle Emperor later adopted by Sun Zhong and renamed as Sun Ruowei. She is intelligent and brave; however, she is manipulated by the Qingzheng cult to seek revenge for her parents' death. She longs to be reunited with her younger sister, who was separated from her while they were running away. She encounters Zhu Zhanji, who suspects her motives and identity. Through their encounters, Zhanji falls in love with her despite knowing her background and her love for Xu Bin. After her father passes away, she honors her father's arrangements for her to married to Zhanji and moves into Forbidden City to become Zhanji's concubine. After getting married, she helps the ill Crown Prince Hongxi Emperor in the affairs of the state, which familiarizes her with state and military affairs and gets her into trouble with the Yongle Emperor as it is taboo for women of the harem to intervene in government affairs. When Zhu Zhanji ascends the throne, she is titled Huang Fei and it is clear from Zhanji's treatment that he loves her more and prefers her over her long-lost sister Hu Shanxiang, who happens to be Zhanji's legitimate wife and Empress. When Ruowei becomes pregnant soon after Shanxiang's miscarriage, tension grows. However Ruowei continues to protect Shanxiang from Zhanji's suspicion and mistrust. Ruowei then gives birth to Zhu Qizhen When Zhanji finds out the truth behind Shanxiang's relationship with Prince Han, he deposes her and promotes Ruowei as his Empress. Soon Ruowei is made aware that Yongle Emperor decreed that if she bore a son, she should not be allowed to live to protect the Ming Dynasty from a usurper. However, Zhanji decides to let Ruowei live and instead of having her buried alive with him and entrusts the country to her before dying. When asked if she ever regretted this life, she tells Zhanji that she doesn't and tells him that she is grateful to him for giving her the love of her life. After his death, Ruowei is tasked with the regnancy of the kingdom, raising her child with development issues and dealing with her sister and her son and the Empress Zhang.Ruowei protects the kingdom multiple times during the ascension and deposing of her son and the Jingtai Emperor, but grows sick and tired of all of the deaths and political machinations she witnessed. She severs ties with her son telling him that every surviving member of the Zhu family is a living dead person and leaves the kingdom to travel the world with Xu Bin, fulfilling her wish from when she was a young woman. * Zhu Yawen as Zhu Zhanji, Xuande Emperor, Hongxi Emperor's 1st son (Crown prince) ** The son of Hongxi Emperor and Empress Zhang. He is ambitious, proud and aims to be like his grandfather. A favorite of the Yongle Emperor, he encounters Ruowei while investigating an attempt to assassinate the Emperor. He falls in love with Ruowei and promises her dying father to take care of her. However, he is forced to marry Hu Shanxiang, a candidate nominated by Prince Han and takes Ruowei as his concubine. While fighting a battle with the Emperor, he finds out the Emperor's plan to enthrone Prince Han instead of his father, he blocks all news of the death of the Emperor which causes the deepening of resentment between him and Prince Han and Prince Zhao. After his father's death, he is enthroned as the Xuande Emperor. Prince Han begins to lose his mind and Prince Zhao attempts to manipulate him against Prince Han. After the birth of his children, he finds out that the Empress allowed Prince Han to escape Beijing resulting in a huge rebellion that almost took his life. He also finds out that Prince Han's conspiracies led to his father's and grandfather's death. After the revelation, Zhanji distances himself from all politics and grows immensely sick. He also reveals to Ruowei about the edict left behind to have her killed if she bore a son, and tells her he is contemplating having her buried with him alive. However, he takes her off the list containing the people who would be buried alive with him and tells her that despite his love for her, he has to let her go for the sake of their son.

Parviscopa is a member of the Ediacaran biota (635-542 Ma), and is more specifically part of the Avalon type assemblage, which is from the older part of the Ediacaran (580‚Äì560 Ma) and is characterized by deep water deposits. == Description == Parviscopa Hofmann et al. 2008 is similar to other frondose forms. It has a stem and branches and can appear plant-like. Specimens are typically between 2-3 centimeters in length. Parviscopa is found at the Bonavista Peninsula in Newfoundland, Canada and has been assigned to the phylum Petalonamae Pflug 1972. It is similar to the genus Primocandelabrum, which is also found in the same region, but Parviscopa is smaller and has better defined branches and lacks a basal attachment disc. == Diversity == Parviscopa bonavistensis is the only known species within the genus. There are presently only a few known specimens of Parviscopa, of which the type specimen is NFM F-507. Parviscopa is differentiated from Primocandelabrum because of its lack of a basal attachment disc. Some researchers have suggested that it is possible that Parviscopa is a juvenile Primocandelabrum without a preserved disc. == Discovery == Parviscopa was described by Hofmann, O'Brien, and King in 2008. It was discovered at the Bonavista Peninsula in Newfoundland, Canada leading to the species name of bonavistensis. Parviscopa means little broom made of twigs which refers to the appearance of the specimens. The specimens appear to look like typical trace fossils, but researchers agree that they represent body fossils. == Distribution == The known distribution of Parviscopa is currently limited to the Avalon type assemblage in the Mistaken Point Formation of Newfoundland, Canada. == Ecology == Parviscopa lived in the deep sea with other similar organisms. They were sessile organisms that were attached to the sea floor and were likely suspension feeders. They may have fed through osmosis or filter feeding. The area they lived in was probably too deep for organisms to photosynthesize. == Significance == Parviscopa is unique because it does not have rangeomorph branching like many of the other Avalonian taxa. Although Parviscopa is a body fossil, it resembles many trace fossils. It has also not been resolved if Parviscopa actually belongs to Primocandelabrum or if it is its own separate genus (see Diversity). Primocandelabrum and Parviscopa do not resemble larger taxa, and they are both only a few centimeters in length. == See also == * List of Ediacaran genera * Mistaken Point, Newfoundland and Labrador * Avalonia == References == Category:Ediacaran biota Category:Ediacaran Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Ediacaran Canada Category:Fossils of Canada Category:Paleozoic life of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Rangeomorpha ","title":"Parviscopa"},{"id":"56084889","text":"The 16th SS Police Regiment () was initially named the 16th Police Regiment (Polizei-Regiment 16) when it was formed in 1942 from existing Order Police units (Ordnungspolizei) for security duties on the Eastern Front.

He attended the Brisbane Normal School and the Brisbane Grammar School. He worked in his father's architecture firm as an assistant while completing a degree in engineering at the University of Queensland. == Engineering == The first meeting of the Greater Brisbane Council in March 1925 established Cross River Commission to establish what bridges were needed for Brisbane. There were three members: chairman Roger Hawken, Professor of Engineering at the University of Queensland, William Muir Nelson and Wilson. Their report showed 11 proposed river crossings, and considered costs and savings made due to the reduction in haulage costs etc, and the need for a railway bridge was also discussed. Their report ultimately led to the construction of the William Jolly Bridge and the Story Bridge, but their proposal for a bridge at New Farm has yet to be realised. ==Architectural works== Notable works by Wilson include: * Cliffside Apartments in Kangaroo Point, listed on the Queensland Heritage Register * St Lucia Presbyterian Church listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register * conversion of a private home in Chelmer into a World War II convalescent hospital, The Lady Wilson Red Cross Convalescent Home, later the Chelmer Police College, listed on the Queensland Heritage Register * St George's Greek Orthodox Church, South Brisbane, circa 1958, listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register == Later life == Wilson died on 19 July 1967 at St Lucia.

He is also an author, policy adviser, a media- commentator, and an administrator. Currently, he is the President of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.http://www.grips.ac.jp/en/about/president/ Before assuming the current position, he was a Professor of International Politics at the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia, The University of Tokyo (1990- March 2012, September 2015- March 2017), and the President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) from April 2012 to September 2015. Tanaka served in various advisory panels commissioned by the Government of Japan. == Early life and academic career == Tanaka was born in Shikishi, Saitama, in August 1954. He obtained his bachelor's degree in International Relations at the University of Tokyo in 1977 and Ph.D. in Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981. Soon after his graduation, he joined the Research Institute for Peace and Security (RIPS) as a researcher, and in 1983 he started lecturing at the University of Tokyo. Tanaka's academic research has been inter-disciplinary, composed of theoretical essays, historical description, and computer based programs designed to analyze and predict developments in international politics. During his MA and PhD training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tanaka was influenced by professors Lucian Pye and Hayward Alker. Combining China studies and computer programs, he produced research about the negotiating process of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China (concluded in 1978), and a computer program named CHINA_WATCHER. Underlying the program was a decision-making model which assumed that both the pre-existing world view of the decision-makers and the precedent found out in response to the current situation constitute the basis of the current decision-making. Tanaka wrote his PhD dissertation incorporating findings derived from this program, titling it ‚ÄúChinese International Conflict Behavior, 1949-1978.‚Äù Having returned to Japan in 1981, Tanaka joined the Research Institute for Peace and Security (RIPS), where he was mainly in charge of editing an annual report entitled ‚ÄúAsian Security‚Äù. Influenced by the work of Professors Inoki Masamichi and Kosaka Masataka, then two of Japan's most prominent scholars on International Politics, Tanaka - who had been mostly occupied with theoretical work and computer programming until then - came to acknowledge that the analysis of current affairs was an ‚Äúimportant area of work for scholars of international politics.‚Äù In the summer of 1982, as the Textbook Problem came to strain the relations between Japan and China, Tanaka wrote a paper examining the reasons behind China's vocal objection to Japanese textbooks. Around the same time, Tanaka had collaborated with Professor Kumon Shumpei in researching the world system as a unit of analysis. In their joint work, they argued that during the 19th and 20th century, three ‚Äúsocial games‚Äù emerged, developed and declined in the following order: power game, wealth game, and knowledge game. Later, Tanaka developed this paper into a book entitled ‚ÄúThe World System‚Äù; the book was published in Japanese by the University of Tokyo Press (1989). In 1994, Tanaka received the Ushiba Fellowship and spent a year in St. Anthony College, Oxford, where he dedicated most of the time writing the manuscript of a book speculating the direction of the contemporary world system, ‚ÄúThe New Middle Ages‚Äù (Atarashi ch≈´sei) 1996, in Japanese; ‚ÄúThe World System in the 21st Century‚Äù in English, published in 2002 by The International House of Japan). In this book, Tanaka draws on Hedley Bull‚Äôs new medievalism, and on Robert Keohane‚Äôs and Joseph Nye‚Äôs complex interdependence, and classifies the world order into three spheres (new medieval, modernization, chaotic; later however, Tanaka modified the names of these three spheres to the liberal, realist, and fragile correspondingly). He argues that while all parts of the world system move toward the first sphere of ‚Äúnew medievalism‚Äù, all three spheres would characterize the world system for the foreseeable future. Among Tanaka's other publications are numerous books and articles on world politics and security issues in Japanese and English including ‚ÄúJapan-China Relations 1945-2000‚Äù (Nichu kankei 1945-1990, published in 1991), ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù (Anzen Hosho, published in 1997), ‚ÄúJapan in Asia‚Äù (Ajia no Naka no Nihon, 2007, in Japanese, ‚ÄúJapan in Asia‚Äù in English, published in 2017), An East Asian Community and the United States (Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, D.C., 2007, co-edited with Ralph A. Cossa), and ‚ÄúThe Yasukuni Issue and Japan‚Äôs International Relations‚Äù (published in 2008). Since 1994, Tanaka has been developing the database ‚ÄúThe World and Japan‚Äù, which currently stores nearly 10,000 historical documents dealing with Japan's domestic and international politics in the 20th and 21st centuries. An average number of about 150,000 hits per month has been registered in the database's website. == Administrative, professional, and advisory career == Tanaka served in various administrative roles at the University of Tokyo: as the Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia (2002-2006), as the Executive Vice President (2009-2011), and as Vice President (2009 and 2011). In the latter position, he was in charge of its international affairs; under his term, the University joined the G-30 program and established degree programs in English catered to both Japanese and international students, including the PEAK program in Komaba Campus. In April 2012, Tanaka became the president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), after succeeding Sadako Ogata. Upon the Cabinet's approval of Tanaka's appointment to the role, Japan's Foreign Minister Koichiro Genba described Tanaka as, \\"a prominent scholar in international politics who is highly acclaimed in the world as well as in Japan. His works and activities encompass a wide ranging fields including diplomacy, security, politics and economics, and he has been involved in making various proposals to the government.\\" Among the many projects that the agency oversaw around the world, Tanaka was involved in the comprehensive peace agreement signed in March 2014 between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The agreement ended a two-decade long negotiation process between the parties, and soon after JICA began implementing several ‚Äúquick impact‚Äù projects in the area in order to improve the prospects of a lasting peace in the region. In addition to his administrative and professional capacities, Tanaka has served in various advisory roles, such as the ‚ÄúEast Asia Vision Group‚Äù, an advisory panel for the ASEAN+3 summit (1999 to 2001), as well as several government and semi- governmental advisory panels including the Council of Defense-Strategic Studies (2001), the Advisory Group on International Cooperation for Peace (2002), and the Council on Security and Defense Capability (2009). More recently, he was involved in drafting policy recommendations such as ‚ÄúJapan's New Security Strategy: Multilayered and Cooperative Security Strategy‚Äù (2008), and the ‚ÄúToward a Greater Alliance: A Policy Proposal of the Mt. Fuji Dialogue Special Task Force‚Äù(2017). In addition to advisory roles in Japan, Tanaka has advised for international organizations such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). == Media commentary == Tanaka occasionally contributes to media outlets, such as the Nikkei Asian Review Mainichi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Asahi Shimbun == Honors == Medal with Purple Ribbon in 2012 for academic achievements. == References == Category:Japanese political scientists Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:People from Saitama Prefecture Category:University of Tokyo alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:International relations scholars ","title":"Akihiko Tanaka"},{"id":"56085215","text":"French Federation of Taekwondo and Related Disciplines ( is an association \\"law of 1901\\" which aims to organize on the French territory the practice of taekwondo, hapkido, tang soo do and Soo Bahk Do since 1995.

Kudo performed \\"Blue Rose\\" on the 45th K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, marking her seventh consecutive appearance on the show. It is the first in a trilogy of singles with the word \\"blue\\" in the title: \\"Blue Rose\\" was later followed by \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Blue Zone\\". ==Background== \\"Blue Rose\\" was written by Kudo, under the pseudonym Aeri, and Takashi Tsushimi. It is the first single since \\"Senry≈´ no Shizuku\\" to have Kudo credited as a lyricist. The song is written in the key of C# minor and set to a tempo of 112 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from E3 to C5. Lyrically, Kudo incarnates a woman putting it all on the line to seduce a man. She likens her actions to that of a \\"sweet devil\\" when setting up a \\"diamond trap\\" for her lover, and declares herself a \\"blue angel\\" promising to find endless love. The song is noted for having a strong rock aesthetic. It was praised for its copious hard guitar riffs, something out of the ordinary coming from Kudo, who received acclaim for unleashing her wild side on the record and amping up the style and glamour, both musically and visually. ==Live performances== Kudo's performances of \\"Blue Rose\\" are characterized by the accompanying intricate and sensual dance routine, performed alongside multiple backup dancers. The choreography was created by TRF's Sam and Chiharu. Kudo wore a different color variation of the same outfit when performing: a turtleneck crop top, high-slit maxi dress, over-the-knee stockings and platform heels. She wore an all-white version of the ensemble for her K≈çhaku Uta Gassen performance. In a retrospective interview, Kudo named Janet Jackson as one of her inspirations for the performance style. Japanese TV personality Mitz Mangrove has praised Kudo for the bold performances and cited her as one of the pioneers of Japanese dancing singers. ==Chart performance== The single debuted at number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 45,000 copies in its first week. It spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 100; it fell off the charts in June, but charted for a week in January 1994, following Kudo's performance on K≈çhaku, when it came back at number 97 before dropping off completely the next week. With over 299,000 copies sold in 1993, it came in at number 89 on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart. ==Track listingCharts== center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1994) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  center;\\"12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  center;\\"89 } ==Certification== - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan (RIAJ)  Gold  305,000 - ==References== Category:1994 songs Category:1994 singles Category:Songs with lyrics by Shizuka Kudo Category:Songs used as jingles Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"Blue Rose (song)"},{"id":"56085300","text":"Stefan Wallat (born 15 February 1987) is a German lightweight rower.

The decision was one of several by the High Court following the 1974 joint sitting of the Australian Parliament. The High Court held, by majority, that one of the laws passed at the joint sitting - the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973 \\\\- was not valid because the required time had not elapsed between the Senate's first rejection of the law and its being passed a second time by the House of Representatives. == Background == Section 57 of the Constitution provides the procedure for the breaking of deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate: During its first term in office, the Whitlam Government held a majority in the House of Representatives but not the Senate, which twice rejected 10 government bills. On 13 December 1973, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill was passed by the House of Representatives and transmitted to the Senate. The government moved a motion to suspend the Standing Orders to allow the Bill to proceed to passage \\"without delay\\". The Senate did not pass the motion and instead adjourned debate to later in the day. One the resumption of debate, the Senate resolved to adjourn the debate to the next sitting day. The Senate then adjourned to a date to be fixed which, in due course, became 28 February 1974. On 14 February 1974, the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, prorogued the Parliament until 28 February 1974. Pursuant to the Senate's standing orders, all bills lapsed as a result of the prorogation, subject to the Senate resolving to take up the bill once more. On 7 March 1974, the House of Representatives resolved to send a request to the Senate to resume reconsideration of the Bill. The Senate resumed consideration of the Bill on 19 March 1974 and ultimately rejected it on 2 April 1974. On 8 April 1974, the House of Representatives again passed the Bill. On 10 April 1974, the Senate adjourned debate on the Bill for 6 months. On 14 April 1974, the Governor-General dissolved both Houses, citing 6 bills which had been twice rejected by the Senate, including the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. At the double dissolution election in May 1974, the Whitlam government was returned with a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives and still without a Senate majority. Following the Senate's further rejection of the bills used as justification for the double dissolution election, an historic joint sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament was convened in August 1974, at which all 6 of the rejected bills which had been cited for the double dissolution were passed. == Argument == The states of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia commenced proceedings challenging the validity of the Act. They argued that the Bill had been first rejected by the Senate on 2 April 1974 and that, as a result, the required 3 months had not passed before its second passage by the House of Representatives. Therefore, it was argued, the Bill was not one to which section 57 of the Constitution could apply. The Commonwealth made several arguments in defence of the validity of the Act: # that the adjournment of debate on 13 December 1973 was a rejection or failure to pass the law; # that in determining whether the law was rejected or not passed, regard could be had to statements by Opposition senators about their intention to oppose the law; # the interval of 3 months referred to in section 57 is calculated from the first passing of the law by the House of Representatives; # the provisions of section 57 are merely directory, not mandatory; # the issues are non- justiciable. == Decision == All members of the Court wrote separate opinions. All members, other than Justice McTiernan, concluded that the Court had jurisdiction. By majority, the Court held that the Act was invalid as it had not met the requirements of section 57 and so should not have been considered and passed at the joint sitting.  Majority  Chief Justice Barwick and Justices Gibbs, Stephen and Mason held the Act to be invalid. They rejected the Commonwealth's contention that the Senate had failed to pass the Bill when it adjourned on 13 December 1973. Barwick CJ held that the Senate will have failed to pass a bill where the time has come for it to \\"take a stand with respect to the Bill\\" and it \\"merely prevaricates\\". page 122 He concluded that such time had not been reached on 13 December 1973. pages 123-4 Justice Gibbs held that section 57 permitted the Senate a \\"reasonable time\\" to consider a bill transmitted by the House of Representatives and that it was \\"impossible to hold\\" that the Senate had failed to pass the Act on 13 December 1973. pages 148-9 Justice Stephen held that the Senate would not have failed to pass a bill as long as it was engaged in the normal process of deliberation upon proposed laws and the deliberative process was not being used for the ulterior purpose of delaying, rather than considering, the proposed law. page 171 Justice Mason also held the test to be one of reasonable time for the Senate to consider the law. page 186  Dissent  Justices McTiernan and Jacobs dissented. Justice McTiernan held that the question of whether a law met the requirements of section 57 was a political question which could not be decided by the High Court. pages 135-137 Justice Jacobs considered the controversy to be justiciable and held that section 57 gives to the Senate a period of 3 months in which to pass the proposed law and, if it has not done so, then it has \\"failed to pass the law\\" with the period of 3 months to be calculated from when it was first open to the Senate to consider the law. pages 195-6 == References == Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1975 in Australian law Category:1975 in case law Category:Australian constitutional law ","title":"Victoria v Commonwealth (September 1975)"},{"id":"56085332","text":"Gwanghwamun Love Song is a musical directed by Lee GiNa, written by Ko Sun Woong, composed by Lee Young Hoon and choreographed by Seo Byung Koo.

According to Jayanti Madhukar, it is defined as: The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as: == Etymology == According to T.S. Ravishankar, former director of the Epigraphy branch of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Estampage is a purely Indian term used by Epigraphists. However, a more linguistically correct explanation would be that it originated from the French word estampage (by itself of Proto-Germanic etymology) that literally means 'stamping' and in practice, can mean either of the two processes, namely industrial stamping of steel (forging) or the artistic stamping of various materials. The latter meaning seems to be have been adopted into epigraphy. == Process of estampage == Estampage is typically obtained by pressing wet paper on to the rock face, over which any ink material (usually, coal or Indian ink) is wiped. An representative procedure is listed below: * Soak a brush in water * Clean the surface of the stone (that holds the inscription) using the brush. * Carpet the stone surface using a large piece of wet paper (or layers of paper) * Pat the wet paper(s) gently, using a dabber made of soft material. * Use Indian ink (usually black-colored) to smear the paper with the dabber, in order to get the impression of the surface. * Allow the paper to dry on the stone surface. * When the paper becomes dry, take it off slowly. * Observe and verify the ink impression (estampage) emerging as white-colored letters (grooves of the characters) against the dark (black) background. Epigraphers usually take a long time (days to weeks) to post-process the generated estampages, as they try to decipher, analyze, transliterate and translate the inscribed text. == Usage == Within India, estampages have been made for numerous items and inscriptions of archaeological significance. Some of them include: * Edicts of Ashoka and Estampages of Girnar Edicts in particular * Madho Sarup Vats * Works by Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department * Works by M. G. S. Narayanan * Syriac/Pahlavi inscriptions of Kerala == Museums and displays == In 2016, the epigraphy branch of the ASI Southern Zone opened a new, permanent museum and exhibition of estampages named Eugen Julius Theodor Hultzsch Memorial Museum and Epigraphical Photo Exhibition at the historic Fort St. George at Chennai, South India. This museum is named after E. Hultzsch, a German epigraphist and Indologist renowned for understanding and deciphering the ancient inscriptions of Ashoka, as part of his 159th birthday celebrations. == See also == * Fernand Courby, a French archaeologist * Collection of over 10,000 estampages from Greece and Middle East at Maison de l'Orient et de la M√©diterran√©e, Lyon, France == References == Category:Archaeological corpora Category:Methods in archaeology Category:Epigraphy ","title":"Estampage"},{"id":"56085344","text":"Claas Mertens (born 2 January 1992) is a German lightweight rower.

The Germans contained the Soviet offensive in its northern portion after initial gains and pushed the southern portion back to its starting point. German counterattack on 30 July. ==Battle== In July 1943, while the Battle of Kursk was raging to the north, two German armies of Army Group South in the Donets Basin confronted two Soviet army groups on a 660-kilometer front. Stavka launched two offensives on 17 July in the Donets basin, involving 474,220 men and 1,864 tanks and assault guns. The Izyum-Barvenkovo Offensive against the 1st Panzer Army consisted of 202,430 Soviet troops as well as 1,109 tanks and assault guns. Air support was provided by the 17th Air Army. The Soviets established bridgeheads several kilometers deep but were stopped by a German counteroffensive led by two Panzer Divisions. After 10 days the Soviets called off the operation, having lost 38,690 men. The Mius Offensive deployed 271,790 men with 737 tanks and assault guns in four field armies as well as the 8th Air Army against the 11 heavily under-strength divisions of the German 6th Army. The Soviets achieved a penetration 15 kilometers deep and 20 kilometers wide, alarming the German High Command. After initial interference from Adolf Hitler in delaying the movement of German reinforcements, a counteroffensive deploying 258 operational tanks in five Panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions, including the SS divisions Das Reich and Totenkopf, was launched on 30 July. The German counterattack was backed by the Luftwaffe's IV Air Corps, providing close air support and air interdiction against the Red Army. The attack achieved immediate success, encircling five Soviet divisions on the second day. A wild, general rout of the Soviet armies to the Mius followed. On 2 August, the Germans reached the Mius at Dmitrievka, regaining their positions after inflicting at least 61,070 casualties on the Soviets, of which 15,303 were listed as killed or missing. Actual Soviet losses were far higher, as 6th Army took 17,762 prisoners, more than the Soviet total for killed and missing. Operationally, the Germans stopped the attacks of two Soviet army groups in their tracks and inflicted at least 99,760 casualties on the Red Army, while losing more than 21,369 men themselves. Strategically, the Red Army failed in its objectives but achieved an indirect success by forcing the transfer of German armored forces from the Kursk salient, smoothing the ground for Operation Rumyantsev, the Soviet attack on Kharkov, which was launched on 3 August. The Germans were forced once again to redeploy their most battle- worthy mechanized divisions to contain this more immediate threat, which the Soviets exploited by launching a successful offensive in the Donets region on 13 August, deploying 1,053,000 men. ==CitationsBibliography== * Category:Battles and operations of the Soviet‚ÄìGerman War Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:Strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II Category:Donbass Category:1943 in Ukraine Category:July 1943 events Category:August 1943 events ","title":"Donbass Strategic Offensive (July 1943)"},{"id":"56085419","text":"The Wazirabad barrage or Wazirabad bridgeI.

The plant most likely originated in Jingtang, Huadu District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. Originally it was cultivated for its body and seeds. The most commonly eaten component of the plant is its taproot, although its green leaves are eaten as well. This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances, its seeds may remain fertile for many years. The oldest lotus germination recorded involved 1,300-year-old seeds which were recovered from a dry lake bed in northeastern China. ==History== The Jingtang was discovered over 800 years ago in a lotus pond. More than 1,000 villagers collectively dug lotus roots out of the ground by hand in mud ponds. An example of this is present within the village of Jingtang, Huadu in northern Guangzhou. It is a local custom to begin extracting lotus roots about seven days before the Dongzhi Festival (Winter Solstice) in the Chinese Lunar Calendar. ==Myths and legends== The Eight Immortals According to a legend, Eight ImmortalsEight Immortals: Chinese immortals including Tieguai Li, Guolao Zhang, Lizi Han, Guojiu Cao, Dongbin Lv, Xiangzi Han, Caihe Lan and Xianggu He, who often wander together. once visited the home of an immortal being named XianguXiangu He: One of the Eight Immortals, Guangzhou Zengcheng people, the green litchi is from her. to eat green litchi. Suddenly they felt an evil air rush up. Tieguai Li, upon smelling it, said, \\"There must be a plague.\\" The Eight Immortals saw the barren hillsides and dried out fields cracking from the heat. Hundreds of villagers were starving and some collapsed on the ground, while others were attempting to flee the village. The Eight Immortals looked very anxious, Tieguai Lee smiled: \\"Do not worry, I have an idea.\\" He took out a Dan from one side of the gourd, put it into his mouth and bit. Then, with saliva, he spat and it began to rain which made the barren hills and fields become green and the pond filled with water. The powerless villagers rushed to the side of the ridge to collect wild vegetables where they encountered the Eight Immortals. After seeing the Eight Immortals, they calmed down. However, Xiangu was still worried, because the villagers were thin, weak, and had no food. She remembered the merciful Avalokitesvara who gave her a few lotus seeds and said to her: \\"When you see the humans suffering, you can throw these lotus seed to save the world.‚Äù So, she quickly took out lotus seeds from the sleeves and threw them down into a large reservoir. After a while, the pond grew lotus flowers and lotus leaves. The Eight Immortals' work was done. The following year, the winter came and the lotus leaf withered. The experienced peasants knew that the lotus root was ripe and led the villagers to dig the lotus root and eat it. It is believed that everyone who eats this lotus root becomes strong and healthy, causing the following generations down the line to thrive. ==Appearance== Sections are slender - about , with each small part measuring about .Freshly harvested Jingtang Lotus Root The shape of the plant is the same as a common lotus root. However, the appearance of the plant's body differs slightly. The lotus root, when produced from the pond, looks rough, thin and long. It is slightly thicker than a human thumb, with a length of more than looking like tree roots. ==Botany== The lotus roots are planted in the soil of the pond or river bottom, while the leaves float on top of the water surface or are held well above it. The flowers are usually found on thick stems rising several centimeters above the leaves. The leaves may be as large as in diameter, while the showy flowers can be up to in diameter. Unharvested Jingtang Lotus Root ==Production== The previous lotus pond was about 20 acres and produced about 20,000 lotus roots. At the end of 2008, the village set up an agricultural development company and expanded the pond to 70 acres. Subsequently, the planting area reached 66,667 square meters. With the increased size, the output rose to about five or six million kilograms. The stems of lotus roots are made of mostly water. When the water is evaporated during production, the nutrients within become concentrated. ==Usage== Jingtang Lotus Root BrothLotus roots are often pickled in rice vinegar, sugar, chili or garlic. It has a crunchy texture with sweet-tangy flavors. In Asian cuisine, it is popular with salad, prawns, sesame oil or coriander leaves. Lotus roots have been found to be rich in dietary fiber, Vitamin C, potassium, thiamine, riboflavin, Vitamin B6, phosphorus, copper, and manganese, while being very low in saturated fat. Lotus roots have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments, from bleeding to hematemesis, and have been shown to contain anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and anti-anxiety properties. Recent studies have also shown that the consumption of taurine, a free-radical found in lotus roots, have positive health effects including easing inflammation, acting as a neuroprotector, protecting against diabetes, and helping regulate immune systems. ==Storage== Dried Jingtang Lotus Root If exposed to air, it will last for 1‚Äì2 days. After being harvested, the lotus root quickly wilts, decays and becomes brown. ==Distinct features== The Jingtang lotus root has three distinct features that differ from the common lotus root. Firstly, the lotus root grown in the pond is thin and long, while the common lotus root is thick and short. Secondly, after the lotus root harvest in winter, people do not need to plant it again. As long as there is water, the lotus leaf grows every spring. The lotus root does not need to be tended to, as long as the root has water source. Digging the Jingtang lotus roots Typically, the lotus root shares communal ownership within a village. Every year after the winter solstice, the village chooses a day for harvesting the lotus root. The whole village takes part in the harvest. The person who digs out a root gets to keep it. When digging, people do not use tools, because the lotus root is thin and long. Also, they grow in the middle of the deep mud, so people must dig by hand in order to dig it all out. The lotus root in the above photo can be sold for a high price, so it is prudent for villages to be careful while digging. The longer the lotus root is, the higher price it fetches. On average, they grow to be long. The longest lotus root found was and weighed . ==ReferencesExternal links== *Lotus Root Inspection Instructions - USDA *Jingtang Lotus Roots - Guanzhou city agriculture breau * Lotus Roots - Lotus root nutrition facts Category:Nelumbo Category:Root vegetables ","title":"Jingtang Lotus Roots"},{"id":"56085448","text":"The William Hemmelberg House is a historic stone farmhouse in Elba Township, Minnesota, United States.

Each bar is one character wide with the printer's entire character set: either alphabetic characters, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals and symbols, molded into the front surface in a single column. In printing, each bar is raised up until the correct character for that print position was opposite the paper, whereupon the bar is pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action is relatively slow, as it takes time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line. Type bars were replaced by type wheels or a drum in later printers, most notably: * IBM 407 - introduced 1949 - type wheels \\\\- adapted as an input/output unit on the IBM 650 * IBM 716 - introduced in 1952 with the IBM 701 and others in the IBM 700/7000 series * IBM 1132 \\\\- introduced in 1965 with the low cost IBM 1130 computer system. The 1132 was the last printer manufactured by IBM to use the 407's technology.

Their initial production facility was in Oldham, England, but when they outgrew that they moved to larger premises in Corby. The Midas was the first original vehicle from D&H;, which had been started to build the Mini Marcos. Richard Oakes, an established kit car designer, was commissioned to develop the new car, the design of which was complete by early 1978. A prototype version of the Midas was shown that year at the Performance Car Show at London's Alexandra Palace, to an \\"enthusiastic\\" reception. The Midas was offered as a complete kit, minus engine and gearbox, for ¬£3250 (); the first deliveries were made in 1979. Fifty-seven Mark 1s were produced before the introduction of the Mark 2 in 1981. ==Construction== The Midas is built around an all-composite monocoque body shell of \\"exceptional quality\\". The car used the Mini engine/gearbox and front subframe, but the rear subframe was replaced by a beam on which the Mini's trailing arms were hinged. The suspension was developed by ex-Team Lotus engineer Arthur Birchall. ==Mark 2, Midas Bronze== Rear Gordon Murray, technical director of Brabham, a British Formula One racing car manufacturer, became interested in the Midas, and at Dermott's invitation suggested some modifications to the car to make it more aerodynamic. Murray's suggestions were incorporated into the Midas Mark 2, introduced in 1981 and continuing in production until 1989. After the 1985 introduction of the Mark 3 \\"Midas Gold\\", the Mark 2 was sold as the Midas Bronze. ==Mark 3: Midas Gold== Midas Gold convertible The Midas Gold coupe was introduced in 1985, and first shown at Motorfair in London. The Mark 2 continued in production however, renamed the Midas Bronze. The Midas Gold convertible was introduced in 1989, \\"to much critical acclaim\\", but the Midas factory was destroyed by fire later that year, ending all production and pushing Midas Cars into liquidation. ==Later developments== Pastiche Cars bought the rights to the Midas range in 1990, and relaunched the Midas Gold Convertible, albeit with a somewhat reduced specification. But after taking ten orders for the kit, none of which were supplied, Pastiche too went into liquidation, in 1991. GTM Cars then took over the rights to the Midas range and relaunched the brand at the Sandown Park Kit Car Show in August 1991. GTM introduced new models, including the 2+2 in coup√© and convertible versions. In 2001 GTM sold the Midas operation to Midas Cars, a new company based in Redditch and run by Marc Bailey. He renamed the 2+2 Coup√© the Cortez, and the 2+2 Convertible as the Excelsior; the latter made its first public appearance at the Donnington Kit Car Show in September 2001. Bailey's operation was short-lived however, and Midas Cars ceased trading in 2003. The Midas marque then passed to Alternative Cars in early 2004. ==References==  Notes  Citations Bibliography * * Category:Cars introduced in 1978 ","title":"Midas Bronze"},{"id":"56085780","text":"Wacky Races may refer to: ==Television== * Wacky Races (1968 TV series) * Wacky Races (2017 TV series), a reboot of the 1968 series == Video games == * Wacky Races (1991 video game), by Atlus for NES * Wacky Races (2000 video game), by Appaloosa for PlayStation, Windows and Game Boy Color * Wacky Races/Wacky Races: Starring Dastardly and Muttley 2000/2001, by Infogrames for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 * Wacky Races: Mad Motors, 2007, by Coyote and Blast! for PlayStation 2 * Wacky Races: Crash and Dash, 2008, by Eidos for Nintendo DS and Wii ==Other== * Wacky Raceland, a comic book series envisioning the original racers in a more comic-book realistic style ","title":"Wacky Races"},{"id":"56085786","text":"The Battle of Namdaemun was an insurgency by the Korean army against Japanese forces in Korea. It was a reaction to the disbandment of the Korean army following the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907. It took place at Namdaemun Gate in Seoul on August 1, 1907. == Overview == In June 1907, the Japanese forced the Sunjong Emperor to disband the Armed Forces of the Korean Empire. As a consequence, the Armed Forces of the Korean Empire went on a revolution with arms. The site and street where the battle exploded corresponds today to the current location of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Because of the vastly inferior armaments of the Korean army, the battle resulted in a Japanese victory, with Japan capturing the army base. Many members of the disbanded army joined the Righteous Armies and together they solidified a foundation for the Righteous Armies‚Äô Battle of 1907. == Historical context and description == In 1906, the installation of the Japanese Resident-General directed by Prince Ito Hirobumi in Korea. The Japanese Resident-General of Korea was installed in 1906, during the 44th year of the King Gojong‚Äôs reign. After this event, Imperial Japan hurried to annex Korea outright. Japan forced Emperor Gojong to abdicate the throne of Korea in June 1907. This was possible because of the Hague Secret Emissary Affair, also called the Jeongmi Treaty, which concluded the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907. The treaty disbanded the Armed Forces of the Korean Empire, which was the last military force. On August 1 at 8:00 a.m., the 1st Battalion (unarmed 1st Infantry Regiment) was about to depart for the training center where the disbandment ceremony was supposed to happen. The 1st Battalion Commander Major Park Seung-hwan (1869-1907), wrote a note on a paper in protest against the disbandment of the armed forces, \\"I could die ten thousand times because I couldn‚Äôt protect my country as a soldier‚Äù. Then Park committed suicide by shooting himself. His suicide enraged the soldiers, who extorted ammunition and armaments, arranged sentries around the barracks and started to open fire with guns against the Japanese army. The 2nd Infantry Regiment or 1st Battalion inside Sungnyemun Gate, heard the gunshots around Seosomun Gate. They arrived and also opened as well fire on the Imperial Japanese Army. Around 9:30 am, the Imperial Japanese Army put its 51st Infantry Regiment, first second and third Battalions, to fire indiscriminately with machine guns installed on the rampart of Sungnyemun. The Korean forces' armaments were vastly inferior to the Japanese army's. Therefore, the Namdaemun Barracks was occupied around 10:50 a.m. and the Seosomun Barracks was taken by the Imperial Japanese Army around 11:40 a.m. A major part of the Imperial Korean Armed Forces kept on resisting outside Seosomun Gate. Many of the disbanded soldiers joined the Righteous Armies to fight. They strengthened a foundation for the Righteous Armies‚Äô Battle of 1907, which led to the Anti-Japanese War of the Righteous Armies. The geographical map of Gyeongseong in 1903, shows that the Barracks of the 1st Battalion (currently 120 in Seosomun-dong) and the Barracks of the 2nd Battalion (currently 34 in Namchang-dong), were located in the southeast of Seosomun Gate and Sungnyemun Gate respectively. Seosomun and Sungnyemun are the place where the street battle exploded. This site now corresponds to the current Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. == Analysis == The Battle of Namdaemun against Japan was sparked by the desire to resist dissolution of the Korean army. From an international point of view, the battle is seen as a small combat action because of the small size of the Korean forces. Indeed, Korean soldiers numbered only 3,000 during this battle. On another hand, from a national Korean point of view, this event was important because almost all of the capital guards were committed in it. As a matter of fact, there were 20,000 Korean soldiers in the country and only 4,000 in the capital city. == Aftermath == Righteous army of Jeongmi (1907); the man dressed in all-black is an Imperial Korean Army soldier. Many members of the Korean Empire Armies were killed or captured during the Battle of Namdaemun.  The Righteous Army  Before the Battle of Namdaemun, the Righteous Army was mostly composed of poor peasants, fishermen, tiger hunters, miners, merchants, and laborers. After the Battle of Namdaemun many regular army members joined the Righteous army in 1907. ==Cultural references== 2018 Mr. Sunshine (Korean Drama) == See also == * Hague Secret Emissary Affair * It≈ç Hirobumi * Ye Wanyong * Sunjong of Korea * Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1907 * Unequal treaty * Righteous army * Korean independence movement == References == Category:1907 in Korea Category:History of Korea Category:Korea under Japanese rule Category:Battles involving Japan Category:Battles involving Korea ","title":"Battle of Namdaemun"},{"id":"56085790","text":"Naval Enna Jewel is a 2017 Indian Malayalam-language drama film co-written, co-produced and directed by Renji Lal Damodaran.

From 1989 to 1993 he was Governor of Hainan Province, where he had a highly antagonistic relationship with the Party Chief Deng Hongxun. He also served as Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China and Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry. ==Early life and career== Liu was born in June 1936 in Tianjin. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1956. In 1961 he graduated from the radio engineering department of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine, USSR. After returning to China he began working for the Fourth Ministry of Machine Building. From 1981 to 1984 he was director of the No. 1425 Research Institute of the Fourth Ministry of Machine Building. In 1984, he was appointed vice-minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry and became associated with Li Peng, then a vice-premier whose portfolio included the electronics industry. ==Governor of Hainan== In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the top leaders of Hainan Province, Xu Shijie and Liang Xiang, were dismissed because Liang was an ally of the reformist national leader Zhao Ziyang and Xu supported Liang's policies. Liu was selected to replace Governor Liang Xiang on the recommendation of Premier Li Peng. He was formally appointed governor on 14 September 1989, but effectively took over the position before that. In a meeting of provincial party leaders on 4 September, he emphasized that provincial cadres should implement the policy of the central government \\"to the letter\\". However, Liu was unable to work together with the Communist Party Secretary of Hainan, Deng Hongxun, who was associated with the central leaders Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi. From 1990 to 1992, the two top officials of Hainan clashed fiercely, hindering the young province's development. By the end of 1992, Deng and Liu were trying to drive each other out of the province. A high-ranking official, Li Shanyou, accused Liu of visiting a prostitute. Li was imprisoned after the accusation was proven false, and Liu launched a counter-investigation to find the instigator, rumoured to be Deng. Their infighting became an embarrassment to the central government, which transferred both of them to Beijing in January 1993, and replaced them with a single official, Ruan Chongwu. ==Later career== After leaving Hainan, Liu again served as vice-minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry from 1993 to 1998. After a brief stint as vice-minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology from March to June 1998, he was appointed Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. He served in that position until May 2002, when he reached retirement age and was replaced by Yang Yuanyuan. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Subcommittee Chairman of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Liu was a member of the 14th and the 15th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Hainan Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Tianjin Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Tianjin Category:Directors of the Civil Aviation Administration of China Category:Kyiv Polytechnic Institute alumni Category:Engineers from Tianjin Category:Members of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Chinese expatriates in the Soviet Union ","title":"Liu Jianfeng (PRC)"},{"id":"56086004","text":"J.

A sharp fight, lasting about forty-five minutes, ensued, when the Moros were put to flight and scattered, with a loss of about 29 killed and wounded. Our casualties, 1 Officer and 2 enlisted men wounded. == Warfare over slavery == When the Moro Province announced the anti-slavery law in the last months of 1903, General Wood and Taft thought that the Maguindanao would continue to follow the lead of colonial progress. Instead, the declaration of abolition destroyed the political and economic system of indirect rule over the whole valley through Datu Piang in Cotabato. A Treaty had been made with the Sultan of Sulu while in Mindanao there were different sultans who claimed headships in their own districts, and one of them was Datu Ali, who waged a long and successful war with the Spaniards. A difficult problem for the Americans to establish civil government among hill tribes, Filipino settlements, and piratical Mohammedan groups each with fears and hate one another. Warfare over slavery began in March and April 1904, when Datu Ali, led his followers to battle in the northern half of the Pulangi River Valley, the sa-raya (Upper Valley) region that had supported the late Datu Uto's resistance against the Spaniards in 1899. Slave parties were active and tribes in Mindanao were raided and oppressed; there were violence and disorders everywhere. The weak Sultan of Sulu - Jamalul Kiram is defeated by his feudal datus. The sultan of Maguindanao, Datu Mangigin fled from the cotabato valley, in fear of his rival Datu Ali and was a refugee in Dumankilas bay. Such condition cannot be ignored and it was felt that American authority must be exerted.Prescott Barrows, David (1914)A Decade of American Government in the Philippines, 1903-1913. World book company, New York p.56. Datu Piang, on the other hand used his political skill and control of long-distance trade through the Chinese merchants of Cotabato to bring the other major datus of the valley into an accommodation with the United States. Upon Datu Uto's declined in power, Datu Ali, the heir to the sultanate of Buayan, emerged as the dominant leader of the sa-raya region. He assembled the most powerful armed men expert in guerrilla warfare and constructed the largest and most heavily armed Kota in Mindanao in preparation for the American resistance.Webb, Mary Griffin, et. al.(1915). Famous living Americans, with portraits p.565. The Governor of Cotabato District knew through his reliable intelligence that Mastura, son of the last sultan of Maguindanao and the sultan of Talakuku and several allied datus including the important Datu Ampatuan pledge that if they would have to give up their slaves, they would rather fight and join Datu Ali. With Datu Ali's efforts to recruit support from the Lake Lanao Region, several thousand followers had congregated in Ali's Great Kota to revolt against the American. Datu Ali married Datu Piang‚Äôs daughter, bonding their alliance in ties of kinships. The ending of slave trade resulted in many heavy, long-drawn-out fights with the principal Moro Band of Mindanao.Sears, Joseph Hamblen(1920). The career of Leonard Wood. D. Appleton and company, New York and London. p.187. == The Hunt for Datu Ali ==  The First Hunt: The Pulangi River  In early March 1904, General Leonard Wood led a large military expedition up the Pulangi River against Ali.Dphrepaulezz, Omar H.

An ‚ÄúArab Priest‚Äù with Datu Piang Sherif Tuan, ‚Äúalso stated that the Moros Datus pledge to fight and obeisance that they would not submit to any interference with their slave trading and holding. On May 1904, Datu Ali ambushed seventeenth Infantry killing two officers and seventeen men. Later, about forty soldiers headed by an officer who is ignorant of the terrain and local languange, guided by faithless moro. They hiked through the trackless swamps leading their men into the heart of an unexplored territory. The trail led through high Tigbao grass, black mud of a churned-up trail with occasional holes where the men sanks to their waists. They penetrated seven miles into the heart of the territory of Datu Ali's best general - Bapa ni Manakup also known as Sharif Mangacop - The son of Sharif Ampatuan from his first wife Bai Idsad.Vic Hurley (14 June 2011). Jungle Patrol, the Story of the Philippine Constabulary (1901-1936). Cerberus Books, 14 June 2011. p. 280‚Äì. While officers moving forward, a sudden spurt of rifle fired from killing men and dying in the stinking mud. They withdrew in disorder while the victorious Moros completed their work by beheading and disemboweling the head of dying Americans with their vicious kris and barong. Yet, even then Datu Ali showed some spark of noble warfare. The two captured American soldiers were cared for and later freed and returned to Cotabato. The ambush where later called and known to Americans as \\"the Simpetan Massacre\\" ‚Äì A blood little affair, campaigning against hostile Moros in the part of Mindanao. As time passed by, a soldiers developed a grudging respect of their prey. Unable to truck down the elusive datu, General Wood tried to negotiate Datu Ali to surrender. Dr. Najeeb Saleeby, a former member of Wood's Legislative Council and Ali's old acquaintances, could not convince Datu Ali to surrender. Instead, Datu Ali wrote a defiant letter addressing Wood \\"Which is better for you, to kill me or not?... Until I Die all the people will not submit to the government, because I will try to kill the people who are friends to Americans.\\" Reasons for General Wood to declare war against Datu Ali and his followers as a struggle against slavery and ‚Äúlawlessness.‚Äù General Wood responded the following day by posting a $500 reward for Datu Ali's capture, dead or alive.McCallum,Jack(2007)Leonard Wood: Rough Rider, Surgeon, Architect of American Imperialism.

The Mindanao Herald Pub. Co., ZamboangaGeneral Wood's analysis of Ali's rebellion reinterpreted the recent history of Maguindanao to suit his identification of abolition with progress, civilization, and colonial authority. Failure to punish Ali will only leave the Moros with an undue sense of their importance to obey either the Civil Governor of the District or any other Authority.‚Äù While Datu Ali and his followers is still actively engaged in slave-hunting among the hill tribes, General Wood believes that Ali and his followers ‚Äúthe Moros‚Äù were still wild people, who is not yet properly conquered, discipline and colonize outside their selves. With General Wood's condemnation of Moros, he knew that the antislavery law will provoke a great deal of opposition among the Moro Datus especially Datu Ali and Datu Djimbangan who was making a good deal of money in slave trading. Antislavery law ignited their general contempt for American Authority. General Wood also reported that all of the Datus were united to resist the American rule for the operation of the slave law except Datu Piang. General Wood believed that Datu Ali's death could serve as the elimination of the only obstacles to ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The American hatched a Series of assassination attempt killing Datu Ali was initiated including using his nephew, the son of Datu Djimbangan but with no luck.Salman, Michael (1960).

Captain Frank Ross McCoy of the 3rd Cavalry, and aide de camp to General Wood, formed the above Provisional Company consisting of volunteers from the 22nd Infantry, specifically to go after the Moro chieftain called the Datu Ali, who was The Last Major Chieftain to oppose American sovereignty on the island of Mindanao. Datu Ali consistently raided local villages, conducted hit and run attacks on US camps, and continued his campaign of insurrection through terror and fear. In September 1905, General Wood received intelligence that Datu Ali was encamped on his ranch deep in the mountains along the Malola (now known as Malala) River. Due to Datu Ali's stubborn resistance to the Americans, Datu Piang convince many of his fellow datus to end their support to Datu Ali and were no longer willing to put up with the misery and devastation that had been visited upon them. They wanted it ended before the unpredictable and vengeful General Wood returned. Piang had tipped off Captain McCoy that Datu Ali, was hiding out in a cabin near Lake Buluan within his large family and had sent most of his men back to their villages. This information had been relayed from Sharif Afdal, a religious leader, who had recently visited him due to sickness. Of equal importance, Datu Inuk (also known as Inog), a sworn enemy of Datu Ali and Tomas Torres, the long-time head scout for the Americans in Mindanao, volunteered to accompany and guide Captain McCoy to Datu Ali's location to identify him in person since the few Americans who could recognize him at sight were no longer stationed in the Philippines. General Wood ordered that an assault force be raised to find and apprehend Datu Ali. A large number of volunteers arose from the Regiment for the dangerous assignment, and from those volunteers Captain F.R. McCoy hand-picked 100 men provisional company from the 22nd Infantry Regiment, stationed at Camp Keithley in Lanao in secret; so as not to alert the residents of Cotabato that an operation was underway. They sailed October 11 from Iligan to the small town of Digos on the Davao Gulf with a short stopover in Zamboanga. Picking up two squads of Philippine Scouts, McCoy's party force-marched fifty miles across the high route he had traveled the year before, skirting the flanks of the impressive Mt. Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines. As they descended into the valley, it was decided to leave the lame and exhausted behind, reducing the expedition to 77 men.Harbord, James Guthrie(1925). Leaves from a War Diary. Dood, Mead & Company, New York. p. 130.

Upon landing on the 16th Of October, they were joined by 10 Filipino Scouts and began the hazardous journey into the interior. They crossed the jungle covered mountains in five days, reaching Datu Ali's encampment in the early morning hours of October 22. Quickly and quietly they surrounded the ranch buildings and waited. As the sun rose, Datu Ali and a dozen of his men came out of the main house unsuspecting and unarmed.Gowing, Peter Gordon, \\"Mandate In Moroland: The American Government Of Muslim Filipinos, 1899-1920\\" (1968). History - Dissertations. 92. Lieutenant Philip Remington sent one squad forward and another around to the rear of the house. Datu Ali ran back inside and armed himself and began firing at the Americans. A bullet just missed Lt Remington but hit and killed Private Bobbs.Minnewande Smith,Oskaloosa, et al (1922):History of the Twenty- Second United States Infantry. New York. Remington then charged into the house firing his pistol, hitting Datu Ali and knocking the man down. Staggering to his feet, Datu Ali ran through the back door, only to be cut down by a hail of bullets from the waiting second squad.James G.S. (1942). ‚ÄúThis Week in the Past‚Äù.

Annual reports of the secretary of war, Volume 3. Government Printing Press, Washington. p.211. Oral tradition asserts that the Americans obtained Piang's assistance only by torturing him. The campaign against Datu Ali closed with the death of Maguindanao Chief who, betrayed by his own men. Datu Piang then reigned supreme in the valley, conciliating American Officials with gifts of brass, chicken, and eggs. The opportunist merchant chief lives with prosper.White, John (1928): Bullets and Bolos ‚Äì Fifteen Years In The Philippine Islands, Century Company, London. Nevertheless, as Beckett points out, ‚ÄúAli‚Äôs death saw Datu Piang on the winning side, the authorities in his debt, and his aristocratic rival out the way‚Äù. Datu Piang then appointed as Muslim Provincial Board Member in Cotabato and in the following year appointed to the National Assembly by the American Governor General. The two position with few formal responsibility with virtually no legal authority.Mckenna, T.M.

London Though armed resistance would continue by several Moro Leaders over the next six years, the major battles and campaigns of the Insurrection could now be considered to be over. Yet, when Maguindanao Moros gather for the rice planting or harvest, songs are sung and tales are told of Datu Ali -last, and perhaps not the least noble, of the maguindanao chief.Tucker, Spencer C. (2009).The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History [3 volumes]: A Political, Social, and Military History. California.

The band's language has expanded with the addition of Ferreira, yet it's more intuitive -- where the space and complexity are different shades in the face of beauty\\". Writing in The Guardian, John Fordham commented \\"The original alto sax, clarinets, piano and drums now expands to include the subtle and cinematic Ryan Ferreira‚Äôs guitar. Though this is the most collectivised edition of Snakeoil, a wealth of fascinating detail remains ... Some Berne followers might find the sense of being lost within his tightening mazes increases with this more collective venture, but DownBeat magazine nailed Berne‚Äôs current music by declaring that it ‚Äúrocks and thinks, explores, deconstructs and, yes, it swings‚Äù\\".Fordham, J. The Guardian Review, April 24, 2015 The All About Jazz review by Karl Ackermann said that \\"You've Been Watching Me represents another forward-looking development for Berne and Snakeoil. The quintet works in various breakout formations adding to the variety of textures and sounds. There's an openness in this setting that adds depth and drama to the improvisations that weave through the arrangements. Berne's music has never been anything less than challenging, but here it is broader and more accessible without sacrificing edginess; You've Been Watching Me is a major achievement in Berne's portfolio\\".Ackermann, K. All About Jazz Review, April 10, 2015 JazzTimes reviewer Mike Shanley wrote \\"Snakeoil‚Äôs third album finds Berne continuing to assert his intense writing style under the ECM banner, with guitarist/collaborator David Torn handling the production for a second time and maintaining the saxophonist‚Äôs personality ... Previous Berne groups have focused on acoustic frenzy (Bloodcount) and dabbled in noisy electric structures (Science Friction).

It was released through Pony Canyon as the album's second and final single on July 21, 1994. ==Background== \\"Jaguar Line\\" was written by Kudo, under the pseudonym Aeri, and Masaya Ozeki. It is the second consecutive single penned and produced by Kudo. The song is written in the key of G minor and set to a tempo of 110 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from G3 to B4 in modal voice, and to D5 in head voice. The track is as an electronic dance-rock number. It has been compared to the sound of The Chemical Brothers and described as a far cry from the idol days of Kudo. She received positive feedback for challenging herself by branching out into different genres. The song is cited as experimental and indicative of Kudo's personal artistic growth. Lyrically, the song chronicles the adventure of the narrator who presents herself as a metaphorical jaguar moving through the Savannah and being pursued by a hunter, facing a kill-or-be-killed predicament. ==Live performances== Kudo's live performances of \\"Jaguar Line\\" followed the same style as her previous single, \\"Blue Rose\\": revealing outfits and a sultry choreography, created by TRF's Chiharu. Kudo performed the song in a leopard print one-shoulder crop top, mini skirt and knee-high boots and was accompanied by two backup dancers. ==Cover versions== In 1995, Priscilla Chan recorded a cover of the song for her album, Welcome Back, on which it is dubbed \\"Love Is Not Clear\\" (‰∏çÊ∏ÖÊô∞ÁöÑÊàÄÊÑõ).

The video was released onto YouTube by the Future of Life Institute and Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at Berkeley, on 12 November 2017. The video quickly went viral, gaining over two million views. The video was also screened to the November 2017 United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons meeting in Geneva. ==Video== Students attempt to flee lethal microdrones The dramatization, seven minutes in length, is set in a Black Mirror-style near future. Small, palm-sized autonomous drones using facial recognition and shaped explosives can be programmed to seek out and eliminate known individuals or classes of individuals (such as individuals wearing an enemy military uniform). A tech executive pitches that nuclear weapons are now \\"obsolete\\": a $25 million order of \\"unstoppable\\" drones can kill half a city. As the video unfolds, the technology get re-purposed by unknown parties to assassinate political opponents, from sitting congressmen to student activists identified via their Facebook profiles. In one scene, the swarming drones coordinate with each other to gain entrance to a building: a larger drone blasts a hole in a wall to give access to smaller ones. The dramatization is followed by a forty- second entreaty by Russell: \\"This short film is more than just speculation; it shows the results of integrating and miniaturizing technologies that we already have... AI's potential to benefit humanity is enormous, even in defense, but allowing machines to choose to kill humans will be devastating to our security and freedom.\\" ==Production== According to Russell, \\"What we were trying to show was the property of autonomous weapons to turn into weapons of mass destruction automatically because you can launch as many as you want... and so we thought a video would make it very clear.\\" Russell also expressed a desire to displace the unrealistic and unhelpful Hollywood \\"Terminator\\" conception of autonomous weapons with something more realistic. The video was produced by Space Digital at MediaCityUK and directed by Stewart Sugg with location shots at Hertfordshire University and in Edinburgh. Edinburgh was chosen because the filmmakers \\"needed streets that would be empty on a Sunday morning\\" for the shots of armed police patrolling deserted streets, and because the location is recognizable to international audiences. All of the drones were added in post-production. ==Feasibility== In December 2017 The Economist assessed the feasibility of Slaughterbots in relation to the U.S. MAST and DCIST microdrone programs. MAST currently has a cyclocopter that weighs less than 30 grams, but that has the downside of being easily disturbed by its own reflected turbulence when too close to a wall. Another candidate is something like Salto, a 98-gram hopping robot, which performs better than cyclocopters in confined spaces. The level of autonomous inter-drone coordination shown in Slaughterbots is currently not available, but this too is starting to change. Overall The Economist agreed that \\"slaughterbots\\" may become feasible in the foreseeable future: \\"In 2008, a spy drone that you could hold in the palm of your hand was an idea from science fiction. Such drones are now commonplace... When DCIST wraps up in 2022, the idea of Slaughterbots may seem a lot less fictional than it does now.\\" The Economist is skeptical that arms control could prevent such a militarization of drone swarms: \\"As someone said of nuclear weapons after the first one was detonated, the only secret worth keeping is now out: the damn things work\\". Paul Scharre of the Center for a New American Security disagreed with the feasibility of the video's scenario, stating that \\"Every military technology has a countermeasure, and countermeasures against small drones aren't even hypothetical. The U.S. government is actively working on ways to shoot down, jam, fry, hack, ensnare, or otherwise defeat small drones. The microdrones in the video could be defeated by something as simple as chicken wire. The video shows heavier-payload drones blasting holes through walls so that other drones can get inside, but the solution is simply layered defenses.\\" Scharre also stated that Russell's implied proposal, a legally binding treaty banning autonomous weapons, \\"won't solve the real problems humanity faces as autonomy advances in weapons. A ban won't stop terrorists from fashioning crude DIY robotic weapons... In fact, it's not even clear whether a ban would prohibit the weapons shown in the video, which are actually fairly discriminate.\\" In April 2018 the governmental Swiss Drones and Robotics Centre, referencing Slaughterbots, tested a 3-gram shaped charge on a head model and concluded that \\"injuries are so severe that the chances of survival are very small\\". ==Cultural reception== Matt McFarland of CNN opined that \\"Perhaps the most nightmarish, dystopian film of 2017 didn't come from Hollywood\\". McFarland also stated that the debate over banning killer robots had taken a \\"sensationalistic\\" turn: In 2015, \\"they relied on open letters and petitions with academic language\\", and used dry language like 'armed quadcopters'. Now, in 2017, \\"they are warning of 'slaughterbots'\\". ==See also== * Lethal autonomous weapon * \\"Hated in the Nation\\", a Black Mirror TV series episode that features bee-like drones ==ReferencesExternal links== *Slaughterbots (2017) on YouTube *Why You Shouldn't Fear 'Slaughterbots' (Scharre) **Why You Should Fear 'Slaughterbots' ‚Äî A Response (Russell et al) Category:2017 films Category:Drone films Category:Dystopian films Category:Viral videos ","title":"Slaughterbots"},{"id":"56086377","text":"Manoj G.

It was private land belonging to the Malaysian state of Johor from 1862. Some portions of it had been acquired by the Government of Singapore in 1990 and in 2009 respectively. The property is restricted from the public and is fenced along Tyersall Avenue. The ring road known as Catterick Circle used to run through the estate, and was still shown on maps even after the late Sultan of Johor's former palaces were no longer charted on any modern maps of Singapore. Catterick Circle was officially removed from updated maps of Singapore in the 1990s. ==History== Early colonial years About three to four decades after Singapore was established as a Straits Settlement trading port in 1819, the adjoined estates consisted of Woodneuk and Tyersall at Tanglin and were first owned by the English trader Captain John Dill Ross, and the lawyer William \\"Royal Billy\\" Napier respectively, as their private residences. The first mention of Tyersall in a Singapore newspaper was on 5 November 1860, when the wife of William Paterson, the merchant of Paterson, Simons & Co., gave birth to their son in Tyersall House as reported by the Singapore Free Press. The estates would later be bought by Abu Bakar in the late 1850s. He would later moved his residence there from Teluk Belanga upon his reign as the Temenggong in 1862. He made Woodneuk House his official residence named \\"Istana\\". On 19 November 1881, the Maharaja of Johor, Abu Bakar, held the first drag hunt in Singapore with his hounds around the Tanglin area, including Woodneuk and Tyersall. It was revealed later on 21 May 1883, that the first telephone line in Singapore had been in operation between Tyersall House and Woodneuk House (or Istana Woodneuk), before the opening of telephonic communication between Singapore and Johor by the Oriental Telephone Company the following month. On 7 September 1887, the Tyersall Drag Hunt Club was established there by the Committee. In 1890, Sultan Abu Bakar had Napier's former house demolished to build his palace on its former ground. Istana Tyersall (1892‚Äì1935) The Istana Tyersall, or Tyersall Palace, was completed and had a grand opening by the Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi Smith on 3 December 1892. The Sultan held receptions for several historic events and parties. The palace was known to be first building in Singapore to be supplied with electricity. On 6 April 1893, the Sultan held his reception to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his party who arrived at his residence in the evening at 5.30 pm. The Archduke and Prince Franz Ferdinand, and his party was shown various rooms and items of the palace, before proceeding on the Sultan's carriages towards the direction of Tanjong Pagar. In his will made on 14 April 1895, Woodneuk was bequeathed to his fourth wife, Sultana Khadijah, and the rest of his premises were made state property of the State of Johor. The Sultan held his last reception at the palace on 15 April 1895, before he left Singapore on the mail steamer Pekin for Europe on 23 April 1895. Upon his death from pneumonia in South Kensington, London, on 4 June 1895, the Tyersall and its premises were soon handed over to his son upon his reign as the Sultan Ibrahim of Johor in November 1895. The new Sultan however, would preferred to stay at the Woodneuk House. On 3 August 1896, Ungku Maimunah, the 1st Sultana to Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, invited King of Siam Rama V and his Queen Savang Vadhana to the palace, where they met the Sultan's family with a cordial reception. On 29 May 1897, the Sultan gave a huge Race Week Tiffin in front of about a hundred of guests at Tyersall. On 24 April 1899, the Sultan Ibrahim set up a training ground for polo players from the Singapore Polo Club to use when the Serangoon Road Race Course (part of the present day Farrer Park) was not available for their training. The training ground later became known as the Tyersall Polo Ground. On 30 September 1899, the Singapore Polo Club hosted the first Horse and Dog Show there, On 17 February 1900, the Sultan held the Farewell Gymkhara with 4th King's Own Regiment at the Tyersall Polo Ground, Following the gymkhana, he held the farewell luncheon party at the palace on 21 February, with over 60 guests which included officers of the King's Own Regiment, the 16th Madras Native Infantry and the rest of the Garrison, and also the representatives of the official, commercial and sports. The Singapore Polo Club held a second Horse and Dog Show on 14 July 1900. Sultan Ibrahim later took over Woodneuk following the death of Sultana Khadijah on 1 February 1904. On 11 September 1905, a fire broke out at Istana Tyersall at midnight and was put out by 6:00 a.m. the following day. The palace's ballroom and billiard room were destroyed as well as several pieces of furniture and art collections within the rooms which were badly burned. The palace was abandoned following the fire. The Sultan gave his permission to the Singapore Hunt Club to use the Tyersall Polo Ground to hold gymkhana on 10 February 1907. Later, he gave his permission to the Singapore Automotive Club to hold the first motor gymkhana which involved thirty cars on 18 October 1907. On 30 November 1910, a meeting was held at the Straits Chinese Recreation Club's pavilion clubhouse in Hong Lim Green, Singapore, and it was announced that the Sultan was willing to lease the premises and the grounds for 21 years at a rent of S$150 per month for the first seven years, S$250 per month for the following seven years, and S$350 per month for the final seven years. This was approved by the committee and members of the Straits Chinese Recreation Club. On 7 December 1910, the Tyersall Country Club was formed at a meeting attended by the members of the various Singapore clubs chaired by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson at the abandoned Istana Tyersall house. The Club's proposed plans to become the lessees of Tyersall Palace (Istana Tyersall). It had to determine the issue of debentures and other matters, which included the dividing of its halls and apartments, the rebuilding of its ballroom and the erection of the new buildings nearby. However, later in the early 1912, this scheme was reported to have fallen through during a meeting at the Tanglin Club. The last use of Tyersall Polo Ground by the Singapore Polo Club as a training ground was on 9 January 1915. In 1924, the road known as Garden Road which divided between Tyersall and Singapore Botanic Gardens was renamed to Tyersall Avenue. Istana Woodneuk (1935‚Äìpresent) In 1932, a new palace Istana Woodneuk, or Istana Wooden York to the State of Johor, was rebuilt on its former site on another hill not far away and completed in September 1935 as a replacement residence for the Sultan Ibrahim and his new wife Sultanah Helen. The dilapidated Istana Tyersall was reportedly demolished under the a issued by the Sultan in 1935. World War II In 1939, the Sultan Ibrahim, based at Johor at the time, had allowed part of Tyersall, which was the once the sites of the former Istana Tyersall and former Tyersall Polo Ground, and including their surrounding grounds, to be used by the Indian Army to be stationed and converted as a military camp area. It included many vehicles in a mechanisation effort in preparation for World War II. Meanwhile, on 8 August 1939, the Second Battalion of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders under Lieutenant Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart arrived in Singapore from India and first settled temporarily at the Gillman Barracks. The 12th Indian Infantry Brigade headquarters, and the Indian Military Hospital, which consisted of a cluster of thatched huts was completed by the contractor A. G. Dobb and Co. for the 4/19th Hyderabad Regiment and 5/2nd Punjab Regiment at Tyersall Park. Following which, the Second Battalion of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders later moved to Tyersall Park in December 1939 as part of 12th Indian Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Archibald Charles Melvill Paris. The estate, or grounds, was referred to as Tyersall Park, Tyersall Camp, or Tyersall Park Camp in the news and by the military stationed there. On 7 August 1941, the Maharaja of Patiala Yadavindra Singh, during his two-day visit in Singapore to inspect its defenses, visited the Indian Military Hospital at Tyersall Park on a Thursday afternoon. On 29 January 1942, the 210 Royal Marines, who were the survivors of the sunken and after the Naval Battle of Malaya, moved to Tyersall Park to join the 250 Argylls. Later on 3 February 1942, they were amalgamated into a composite battalion known as the Plymouth Argylls (in reference to the Argylls affiliation with the Plymouth Argyle Football Club and that all the Marines were from the Plymouth Division). Japanese invasion of Singapore On 9 February 1942, during the Battle of Singapore, the Plymouth Argylls left late in the morning and moved towards the Tengah airfield. The Istana Woodneuk, under the name of \\"Tyersall Palace\\", served temporarily as the 2/30th Battalion AIF headquarters under Major General Gordon Bennett. On 11 February 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders moved to Tyersall Park from the bombed Birdwood Camp at Changi, and departed for Bukit Timah to fight the invading Japanese Imperial Army. After the blast from a Japanese mortar attack which indicated that the nearby junction of Holland Road and Ulu Pandan Road was held by the Japanese Imperial Army, Major General Bennett withdrew his headquarters from Woodneuk to Tanglin Barracks. The Indian Military Hospital, despite having Red Crosses painted on its roof, was destroyed by a fire caused by incendiary bombs deliberately dropped by Japanese fighter planes. Later on the following day in the afternoon of 12 February 1942, the surviving Plymouth Argylls arrived back at Tyersall Park, only to find themselves involved in a major rescue operation there. It was later estimated that about 700 medics and patients had reportedly burned to death in the area. Japanese occupation of Singapore Following the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, on 17 February 1942, Piper Charles Stuart was ordered by the Japanese to march the surviving Plymouth Argylls out of Tyersall Park to Changi. Tyersall Park would later serve as one of seven POW camps for interned Indian Army personnel in Singapore under Lieutenant Colonel Gurhux Singh of Jind State Forces. It was under the supervision of the Japanese Imperial Army until 1945. Post-war era After Singapore was liberated in 1945, the Supreme Allied Command South East Asia (SACSEA) headquarters was set up at the Tyersall Park. 58 members of the Women's Voluntary Service were also stationed there. The Istana Woodneuk was briefly occupied by General Sir Miles Dempsey and later by Commander-in-Chief Sir Montagu Stopford in 1946 until SACSEA was disbanded in November. On 16 January 1947, the palace was occupied by the Governor-General of Malaya Malcolm MacDonald and his wife. By 1948, the palace was returned to the Sultan for his official residence in Singapore. In 1954, the Tyersall Park was leased out for military use and in 1959, the estate was returned to the Sultan of Johor. On 17 April 1959, the Johor State Council approved $5,000 for the maintenance and upkeep of Tyersall Park. ==Recent developments== In December 1990, the Government of Singapore had acquired part of the former Tyersall Park from the State of Johor. On 1 June 2004, the sum of S$25 million was awarded as compensation for the compulsory acquisition of Tyersall. On 9 June 2004, the Collector obtained a court order to pay said compensation into court due to a dispute with the State of Johor over the title to receive the compensation. In 2009, the Government of Singapore had acquired a 9.8 ha part of the 24.4 ha of the former Tyersall Park estate from the State of Johor as part for the \\"Tyersall\\" extension of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. This involved the repositioning of the existing Tyersall Avenue, the demolition of the two historic gate posts along Tyersall Avenue which once lead to the former Tyersall Park and Istana Woodneuk, the restructuring of visitor access to the National Orchid Garden and Ginger Garden, the creation of fresh water swamp forest and the extension of the National Orchid Garden nursery. On 31 March 2017, the Singapore Botanic Gardens' new extension was officially opened by Lee Hsien Loong, the 3rd Prime Minister of Singapore, as the Learning Forest. As of 2019, Tunku Ismail Idris, the Tunku Mahkota of Johor, is the current registered landowner of this estate, which was since zoned for \\"special use of green space\\", meaning that no developments of residential and commercial nature will be improvised on the site. According to Alan Cheong, a senior director at Savills Singapore Pte Ltd, if this estate was put up on sale, it could fetch at least S$4.7 billion. ==In popular culture== Tyersall Park was first mentioned in the first novel of Kevin Kwan's the Crazy Rich trilogy, Crazy Rich Asians (2013), being re-imagined as a 64-acre estate belonging to Shang Su Yi, Nick Young's grandmother. The estate would later become a major plot point in Kwan's third and final novel in the trilogy, Rich People Problems (2017). In the production of the 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians based on the novel of the same name, Carcosa Seri Negara, the former luxury hotel which consisted of the two colonial mansions at Perdana Botanical Gardens, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were used to depict the interior and exterior of Tyersall Park mansion. A lake was later digitally added to the estate grounds in post-production. In the Cond√© Nast Traveler interview with film director Jon M. Chu, Chu said: \\"There were certain aspects to Tyersall Park, where Nick‚Äôs grandmother lives, that you couldn‚Äôt find in Singapore. That‚Äôs what makes the fictional Tyersall Park, this sort of Central Park within the tight squeeze of Singapore, such an amazing location in the book, because those properties just don‚Äôt exist anymore. So we had to go to Malaysia to film that part.\\" ==See also== * Istana Tyersall * Istana Woodneuk * Abu Bakar of Johor * Ibrahim of Johor ==References== Category:Parks in Singapore Category:Places in Singapore Category:Royal residences in Singapore Category:Protected areas of Singapore Category:British rule in Singapore Category:Military installations of Singapore Category:Military installations established in 1939 Category:Japanese occupation of Singapore Category:Military history of Japan during World War II Category:World War II prisoner of war camps in Singapore ","title":"Tyersall Park"},{"id":"56086439","text":"Fangshan Chengguan station () is a station on Yanfang Line of the Beijing Subway.

The data available includes flight numbers, how fast an aircraft is moving, its elevation and destination of travel. Several variants of the service are available as mobile apps including free, premium 3D and augmented reality versions. The flight tracking map and database can be accessed by web browsers. Plane Finder allows registered users to share their ADS-B and MLAT data via the Plane Finder ADS-B Client, available for macOS, Windows and Linux. Plane Finder supports VFR charts from NATS and was the first major flight tracking app to introduce a replay feature, allowing users to replay flights dating back to 2011. == Flight tracking == Plane Finder collects data from its own global network of receivers, using the following sources. Automatic dependent surveillance- broadcast (ADS-B)  A network of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) receivers gathers aircraft data such as callsign, position and speed. Plane Finder servers supplement this data with additional information, including aircraft registration/tail number, departure airport, destination, artwork, and photographs. Plane Finder users can apply for an ADS-B receiver in exchange for their flight data. Multilateration (MLAT)  To deliver aircraft position data where ADS-B is unavailable, Plane Finder uses multilateration (MLAT). Using three or more receivers running Plane Finder client software, monitoring the aircraft simultaneously, the aircraft‚Äôs position is calculated using receiver location and accurate timestamps. While European airspace is widely covered, only some parts of North American airspace are covered. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) feed  ADS-B is prevalent across Europe and Australia, but not in North America. Where MLAT or ADS-B data is unavailable, a feed from the Federal Aviation Administration provides flight information. The FAA feed covers United States and Canadian airspace, including bordering areas of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  FLARM feed  Plane Finder collects data from a centralised FLARM feed, for monitoring small aircraft and gliders. == Flight data source == The Plane Finder website and database is widely used as an information source to support articles in the media. The Independent used Plane Finder flight tracking to demonstrate to readers the flight path of flight MT2706, which turned back as a result of last minute Egyptian government flight restrictions on 6 November 2015. The Independent also used Plane Finder information to demonstrate a timeline of the speed/altitude of flight 7K 9268, a Russian plane which crashed on 31 October 2015. The BBC cited Plane Finder in regards to the point at which at British Airways flight turned back to Heathrow Airport to make an emergency landing after smoke was seen coming from its engines. Plane Finder data has also been used to create original imagery for the media, such as the Washington Post, which used Plane Finder as a source to show flight patterns immediately after the Brussels bombings in March 2016. == References == Category: Mobile applications Category:Aviation websites ","title":"Plane Finder"},{"id":"56086591","text":"Directorate of Archives and Libraries is a government department responsible for the management and operations of the National Library and the National Archives in Bangladesh and is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Some nine such sites are known at present especially ed-Dur in the Emirate Umm al-Qaiwain, and Mleiha in Sharjah in the Oman peninsula.

Imports are numerous from the upper Gulf, but also from South Asia. Several Greco-Roman finds came to light. Aside from so-called balsamaria few pottery finds are held in common with the Late Iron Age known at Samad al-Shan in central Oman.

Finds from these assemblages challenge the view around the year 0 of south-eastern Arabia during the centuries, in which the Persian Parthians rule replaced later by the Sasanians, an interpretation which dominates the secondary literature for the past 50 years.

The legal basis is the Tiroler Bergwachtgesetz (Tyrolean Mountain Guards Act) of 3 July 2002. The Tyrolean Mountain Guards is thus one of nine mountain and nature conservation organisations in Austria. ==History== The first Tyrolean Mountain Guards Act came into force on 31 October 1927. The tasks of the mountain guards under this law were \\"The protection of persons and property in field, alp and forest property, alpine shelters, their equipment and accessories and the maintenance of contamination or disfigurement of the area by tossing and dropping objects, especially so far the danger, injury or pollution is related to a sporting activity or excursion traffic \\". In 1938, the mountain guards were made subordinate to the gendarmerie as an auxiliary police force. The duties remained the same as before the merge. Under Nazi occupation the nature reserves in Tyrol were greatly expanded, with the mountain guards continuing in their role of enforcing conservation laws. In 1978 the new Tyrolean Mountain Guard Act 1977 came into force. The mountain guards were merged into a body of public law enforcement, providing more powers to guards to great regulatory oversight. The exercise of mountain rescue services was regulated, but continued not to be a core focus. In 2002 an amended version of the Tyrolean Mountain Guard Act 1977 was passed. It was the first time mountain rescue services were outlined in the Mountain Guard Act. In 2007, the Tyrolean mountain rescue service stations were also equipped with digital radio systems, which has allowed statewide communication. ==Task Area== The members of the Tiroler Bergwacht are sworn in officers of public supervision and supervise as auxiliary officers of the district administrative authorities in the designated area of activity according to mountain guard law ¬ß1: *Tyrolean nature conservation law with associated regulations *Tyrolean National Park Law Hohe Tauern *Tyrolean Waste Management Act *Landespolizeigesetz Noise protection, protection against endangering and harassment by animals *Tyrolean field protection law *Tyrolean camping law In section 10 of the Tiroler Bergwachtgesetz, the mountain guard is also to be used as a rescue service in the case of natural disasters and other rescue operations. ==Uniform== The Tiroler Bergwachtgesetz precisely regulates the appearance of the mountain guard. The uniforms are sourced from the clothing management fund of the B.M.I. In the long term, this enables the most economical efficient procurement of service clothing. For all weather conditions, there are various outer clothing and jacket options (multipurpose jackets, fleeces, and fleece jackets). Furthermore, mountain guards are provided short- and long-sleeved shirts, a rock-grey alpine trousers, and a baseball cap and beret headgear. The position of a mountain guard is recognisable by the rank slides worn. ==Powers== The supervisory organisations of the Tiroler Bergwacht gave the Bergwacht special powers to enforce the law of the Tyrol Landtag. Mountain guards are allowed to enforce these state laws: *Stop people and vehicles and ask for proof of identity. *Issue warnings or report violations to the district administrative board (at the discretion of the incoming supervisory board). *In special cases, arrest people and present them to the district administration. *Confiscate objects that being in possession of such constitute an offense. *Specially trained mountain guards may collect fines. ==Ranks== {  style=\\"font-size:80%;\\" align=\\"center;\\" - !

The sketches used Adobe Character Animator to allow Colbert to interact with the character in real-time. The character was also featured in an animated short during Colbert's election night special for Showtime. Development Following the online success of the sketches, Late Show showrunner Chris Licht suggested to Tim Luecke and Matt Lappin that they develop the concept into its own television series. In their pitch to Showtime, Luecke and Lappin described the potential series as a look \\"behind the scenes at the White House\\" and that their goal would be to \\"produce it as quickly as we possibly could so that we could begin to keep up with the news cycle.\\" On July 27, 2017, Showtime announced that it had greenlit an animated series based on the sketches, with Colbert, Matt Lappin and Chris Licht as executive producers. On December 18, 2017, it was announced that the series would premiere on February 11, 2018. On March 8, 2018, Showtime announced that they were ordering an additional seven episodes of the series that are set to air during the summer of 2018. This order would bring the first season total of episodes up to seventeen. On May 30, 2018, it was announced that the additional seven episodes of season one would premiere on July 15, 2018. On August 22, 2018, it was announced that Showtime had greenlit a midterm elections themed television special from the series titled \\"Our Cartoon President: Election Special 2018\\". The episode was scheduled to air on November 4, 2018 and expected to feature appearances from the cartoon versions of Vladimir Putin, Rudy Giuliani, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. On January 22, 2019, it was announced that Showtime had renewed the series for a second season consisting of ten episodes. On January 26, 2020, the first part of the third season was aired, consisting of ten more episodes. On July 29, 2020, Showtime announced in a video that the show would be returning on September 20, 2020 with the second half of Season 3, featuring new characters, such as Cartoon Jill Biden, Cartoon Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Cartoon Andrew Cuomo. ==Release== Marketing On December 18, 2017, Showtime released the first teaser trailer for the series. On May 30, 2018, a trailer for the additional seven episodes of season one was released. On October 31, 2018, a trailer for the \\"Our Cartoon President: Election Special 2018\\" television special was released. 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner On April 28, 2018, a special three-minute video created by the cast and crew of the series aired during the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner. Home media On December 18, 2018, the series was released on DVD by CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution featuring all eighteen episodes from season one and the mid-term election special. The release also includes numerous bonus features such as episode commentary tracks, a featurette looking at the animation process, footage from the table read for episode eleven, and clips from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert's 2016 Election Special, and The White House Correspondent's Dinner. ==Reception== The first season of Our Cartoon President has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 32% approval rating with an average rating of 5.17 out of 10 based on 25 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Sugar-coated satire, Our Cartoon President wavers between scathing social criticism and softball slings in a way that's as unsatisfying as it is uncomfortable.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 42 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Jack Nevins of The Guardian praised the show, calling it a farce that \\"nailed the Trump drama,\\" and contrasting the show's surreal workplace comedy approach with the more reality and headline-driven approach of other late night comedy shows. In contrast, USA Today critic Kelly Lawler reviewed Our Cartoon President negatively, describing it as \\"slight, dated and unsustainable\\". She also concluded that \\"Watching one episode is enough to get the point. Watching nine more feels unnecessary.\\" Ben Travers of Indiewire also reviewed the show unfavorably, calling it \\"a pointless, unfunny drudge\\" and criticized it for humanizing Trump. In a mixed review, Brian Lowry of CNN wrote that \\"While Our Cartoon President certainly has its moments, the best news for Showtime might be it's only stuck with this experiment in quick-turnaround animation, at least initially, for 10 weeks.\\" He also said that the show suffered from many of the same problems as That's My Bush!, a sitcom produced in 2001 satirizing the presidency of George W. Bush. Matt Wilstein of The Daily Beast was more favorable, writing that \\"The biggest surprise [of the show] is how hilarious it is\\" and praising the show for being \\"remarkably adept at boiling down characters to their core traits, from Trump and his family to members of his Cabinet and Congress to the Fox News personalities he spends most of his day watching\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American political comedy television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:2010s American workplace comedy television series Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:2020s American political comedy television series Category:2020s American satirical television series Category:2020s American workplace comedy television series Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American adult animated television spin-offs Category:American flash adult animated television series Category:Animated satirical television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Parodies of Donald Trump Category:Narcissism in television Category:Political satirical television series Category:Showtime (TV network) original programming Category:The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Animation based on real people Category:Cultural depictions of Bill Clinton Category:Cultural depictions of Hillary Clinton Category:Cultural depictions of Barack Obama Category:Cultural depictions of Angela Merkel Category:God in fiction ","title":"Our Cartoon President"},{"id":"56086963","text":"Muguerza may refer to: * (1936‚Äì2019), Spanish philosopher * Jos√© A.

For his novel Bari Badle Jay, he received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1988. He was also a recipient of the Rabindra Puraskar and several other awards. He won the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial International Prize in its inaugural year. Many of his works have been adapted into films, including the multiple-award-winning Kharij, directed by Mrinal Sen, and Ek Doctor Ki Maut, directed by Tapan Sinha. Chowdhury started writing during the Second World War. He was associated with Anandabazar Patrika for many years, and edited its Sunday supplement. His novels are marked by an economy of expression. He is one of the most well known short story writers in contemporary Bengali literature. ==Early life== Ramapada Chowdhury was born on 28 December 1922 in Kharagpur, Bengal Presidency, British India (now in the Indian state of West Bengal). His father worked in the railways, and the family often moved from one place to another. Thus young Ramapada was exposed to life in several different parts of India. Ranchi, Raipur, Bilaspur, Guwahati and Dibrugarh were some of the towns he lived in. All of these places figure in his early works of fiction. He completed his schooling from Kharagpur. Subsequently, he studied at Presidency College, Calcutta, and obtained his master's degree in English literature from the University of Calcutta. ==Career== Chowdhury wrote his first short story as a student, in response to a challenge from his friends. It was written sitting in a restaurant near his college, and was published in the newspaper Jugantar. After completing his Master's, he got a job with Anandabazar Patrika. Later he became Associate Editor of the newspaper, and edited its Sunday supplement Rabibasariya for many years. Chowdhury started writing short stories on a regular basis from the age of twenty-five. He published two collections of stories before the publication of his first novel Pratham Prahar (1954). Although an established writer in the 1950s, Chowdhury received wider recognition with his 1960 novel Banpalashir Padabali, which appeared in serial form in the well-known literary magazine Desh. He was awarded the Rabindra Puraskar in 1971 for his novel Ekhoni and the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1988 for Bari Badle Jay. In all, he has written around fifty novels and over one hundred short stories. He has also edited an anthology of stories originally published in Desh. In 2011, the Indian Institute of Planning and Management instituted the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial International Prize. Ramapada Chowdhury won the award in its inaugural year, for his novel Banpalashir Padabali. According to writer and scholar Surajit Dasgupta, \\"Banpalashir Padabali is a stunningly vibrant and intensely human work that serves to reaffirm his reputation as a master story-teller in the Bengali language.\\" The Sahitya Akademi, in its series of films on eminent Indian writers, has produced a film on Ramapada Chowdhury, directed by Raja Mitra. ==List of works (selected)== * Pratham Prahar (1954) * Dwiper Nam Tia rang * Banpalashir Padabali (1960) * Je Jekhane Danriye * Ekhoni (1969) * Kharij * Bari Badle Jay (1988) * Abhimanyu (1982) * Beej * Darbari * Lalbai * Harano Khata *Picnic *Bahiri *Chhad *Shesher Seemana *Aakash Pradeep ==English translations== * Nothing but the Truth (original title Kharij), translated by Enakshi Chatterjee, Vikas, New Delhi,1978. . * Second Encounter (original title Je Jekhane Danriye), translated by Swapna Dutta, Niyogi Books, 2016. . ==Films based on Ramapada Chowdhury's works== * Dwiper Nam Tiarang (1963), directed by Gurudas Bagchi * Ekhoni (1970), directed by Tapan Sinha * Picnic (1972), directed by Inder Sen * Banpalashir Padabali (1973), directed by Uttam Kumar * Je Jekhane Danriye (1974), directed by Agragami * Kharij (1982), directed by Mrinal Sen * Ek Din Achanak (1989) (in Hindi), directed by Mrinal Sen (based on Beej)) * Ek Doctor Ki Maut (1992) (in Hindi), directed by Tapan Sinha (based on Abhimanyu) * Sundari (1999), directed by Gul Bahar Singh (based on the short story Ahlaadi)) * Borunbabur Bondhu (2020), directed by Anik Dutta (based on Chhad) == Awards and honours == * Sahitya Akademi Award 1988 * Rabindra Puraskar 1971 * Ananda Puraskar 1963 * Rabindranath Tagore Memorial International Prize 2011 == References  External links == * * * Ramapada Chowdhury ‚Äì A Short Documentary Film ‚Äì Sahitya Akademi Category:1922 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:Bengali-language writers Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Recipients of the Ananda Purashkar Category:Recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Award in Bengali Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:Novelists from West Bengal Category:People from Kharagpur ","title":"Ramapada Chowdhury"},{"id":"56087000","text":"Nicolaas Duneas is a South African biochemist and developer of osteogenic biomaterials. He is the co-founder (with Nuno Pires) and CEO of Altis Biologics. The company developed the first injectable treatment for bone injuries that require grafting by using a pig-based growth material. == Education and career == X-ray of spinal fusion Duneas received a BSc in biochemistry in 1993 from the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) and he holds a MBA from WITS. He also holds a Ph.D. from the WITS faculty of medicine. From 1993 until 1997 he worked as research officer for the University of the Witwatersrand. In 2002 he founded Altis Biologics (a biotech company) together with Nuno Pires. Duneas was appointed CEO of Altis Biologics in 2002. The company focusses on bone regeneration. Traditionally, when repairing a severe bone break involving a void, new bone is taken from the hip and donated to the required site. This results in permanent disfigurement of the hip and complications such as hip displacement, buttock anaesthesia and severe infections during surgery. Altis Biologics developed a method to use pig bone which had been altered to make it human compatible and also make it injectable, removing the need for surgery. The method is particularly suitable for use in spinal fusion procedures. The research for this method began in 1994 and included pre-clinical and clinical studies (in collaboration with universities) that finally culminated in a product that was patented in 2006. In 2012 the method was approved by the largest South African medical aid (Discovery Health) and since then more than 1000 patients have been implanted with the bone graft. The tissue used in the bone grafts is manufactured in South Africa, removing the previous need to import bone graft material from the USA and Europe. From 2008 until 2010 Duneas also served as managing director of Altis Biologics. He has remained CEO since 2002. In 2014 Duneas was interviewed by Alec Hogg for The Rational Perspective (hosted on BizNews) on Sizing up African Technology Opportunities. At the 2017 Healthcare Innovation Summit Africa he presented on bone regeneration technologies. == Awards == In 2014 Duneas and Nuno Pires were awarded the Innovation Prize for Africa for the Altis Osteogenic Bone Matrix. This was the first injectable treatment for injuries requiring bone grafts using a porcine-derived regenerative biological implant. Duneas and Pires received US$100 000. == Selected publications == * Limited chondro-osteogenesis by recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta 1 in calvarial defects of adult baboons (Papio ursinus).

Planing mill opened in about 1882. The mill building contained a planing mill on the first floor and sash and door factory run by Duncan McKenzie and George Drury on the second floor. The planing mill and associated factory were major employers in the area at the end of the 19th century, as the lumbering trade wound down. The operation closed in the mid-1890s. In 1905, the building was leased to Gustave Marquardt and to use a pea mill, where peas were cleaned and sacked. In 1912, disease destroyed the local pea crop, and the business shut down. The mill building was eventually torn down, and as of 1987, only the chimney was left. As of 2017, the chimney was also gone. ==Description== The planing mill site sits in the woods near the shore of Lake Huron.

NOAA-20, designated JPSS-1 prior to launch, is the first of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's latest generation of U.S. polar-orbiting, non-geosynchronous, environmental satellites called the Joint Polar Satellite System. NOAA-20 was launched on November 18, 2017 and joined the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite in the same orbit. NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP, allowing important overlap in observational coverage. Circling the Earth from pole-to-pole, it crosses the equator about 14 times daily, providing full global coverage twice a day. This will give meteorologists information on \\"atmospheric temperature and moisture, clouds, sea-surface temperature, ocean color, sea ice cover, volcanic ash, and fire detection\\" so as to enhance weather forecasting including hurricane tracking, post-hurricane recovery by detailing storm damage and mapping of power outages. The project incorporates five instruments, and these are substantially upgraded since previous satellite equipment. The project's greater-detailed observations will provide better predictions and emphasize climate behavior in cases like El Ni√±o and La Nina. The project's satellite bus and Ozone Mapping and Profiler equipment, was designed by Ball Aerospace. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and the Common Ground System were built by Raytheon, and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder was by Harris. The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System instrument were built by Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. == Launch == The NOAA-20 launch was delayed several times. When the contract was awarded in 2010, launch was scheduled for 2014. By 2011, launch had slipped to 2016, and by 2012 that had slipped to 2017. In August 2016, following environmental testing, launch slipped from January 20, 2017 to March 16, 2017 due to problems with ATMS and the ground system. In January 2017, launch was delayed from March 2017 to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, or July to September for the same reasons. The launch was delayed from September 2017 to November 10, 2017 to provide extra time for engineers to complete testing of the spacecraft and electronics as well as the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS). It also experienced several brief launch delays in the final weeks before launch. Originally scheduled to launch on November 10, 2017, it was delayed to the 14th following the discovery of a faulty battery on the Delta 2 launch vehicle. The launch was then delayed to November 15, 2017 due to boats being in the launch safety zone minutes before the launch and due to a bad reading on the first stage of the launch vehicle. It was delayed a 3rd time to November 18 due to high winds. NOAA-20 successfully launched on November 18, 2017. It represented the penultimate, and 99th consecutive successful launch of the Delta 2 rocket. It was launched along with 5 CubeSats that conducted research in \\"3D-printed polymers for in-space manufacturing, weather data collection, bit flip memory testing, radar calibration and the effects of space radiation on electronic components\\". Between November 29, 2017, when ATMS produced its \\"first light\\" image and January 5, 2018 when VIIRS and OMPS produced theirs, the satellite went through activation, outgassing and decontamination on the path to operation. On May 30, 2018, after six months of on-orbit checkout, NOAA declared the spacecraft fully operational. == Instruments == NOAA-20 Sensors/Instruments: ;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS): takes global visible and infrared observations of land, ocean, and atmosphere parameters at high temporal resolution. Developed from the MODIS instrument flown on the Aqua and Terra Earth Observing System satellites, it has significantly better performance than the AVHRR radiometer previously flown on NOAA satellites.\\"The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite.\\" NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. Retrieved: June 22, 2017. ;Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS): will produce high-resolution, three-dimensional temperature, pressure, and moisture profiles. These profiles will be used to enhance weather forecasting models, and will facilitate both short- and long-term weather forecasting. Over longer timescales, they will help improve understanding of climate phenomena such as El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a. This is a brand-new instrument with breakthrough performance.\\"The Cross-track Infrared Sounder.\\" NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. Retrieved: June 22, 2017. CrIS represents a significant enhancement over NOAA's legacy infrared sounder‚ÄîHigh Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounders (HIRS) and is meant to be a counterpart to the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). ;Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS): a cross-track scanner with 22 channels, provides sounding observations needed to retrieve atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles for civilian operational weather forecasting as well as continuity of these measurements for climate monitoring purposes. It is a lighter-weight version of the previous AMSU and MHS instruments flown on previous NOAA and NASA satellites with no new performance capabilities.The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. Retrieved: June 22, 2017. ;Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS): an advanced suite of three hyperspectral instruments, extends the 25-plus year total-ozone and ozone- profile records. These records are used by ozone-assessment researchers and policy makers to track the health of the ozone layer. The improved vertical resolution of OMPS data products allows for better testing and monitoring of the complex chemistry involved in ozone destruction near the troposphere. OMPS products, when combined with cloud predictions, also help produce better ultraviolet index forecasts.\\"Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite.\\" NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. Retrieved: June 22, 2017. OMPS carries on a long tradition of space borne measurements of ozone beginning in 1970 with the Nimbus 4 satellite and continuing with the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV and SBUV/2), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) instruments on various NASA, NOAA, and international satellites. Over the more than 30-year period in which these instruments have been operating, they have provided a very detailed and important long-term record of the global distribution of ozone. ;Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES): senses both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. Cloud properties are determined using simultaneous measurements by other JPSS instruments such as the VIIRS and will lead to a better understanding of the role of clouds and the energy cycle in global climate change.\\"Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System.\\" NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.

In 1973 by the request of the descendants the house was granted to the state, and the museum was established as a branch National Gallery of Armenia. ==Collections== The house-museum collection is composed of both the museum's belongings and the works of artists' families. The works by Ara Sargsian are from the sculptor's family collections, photos of the works at student times, and gifted materials, as well as the artist's theatrical designs and graphic works. Hakob Kojoyan's works are displayed on the second floor of the building, as well as handicrafts and personal belongings. Some of the works presented are from the funds of the National Gallery of Armenia, the other part is a gift from the artist's heirs. ==Gallery== ’Ä’°’Ø’∏’¢ ‘ø’∏’ª’∏’µ’°’∂’´ ÷á ‘±÷Ä’° ’ç’°÷Ä’£’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’ø’∏÷Ç’∂-’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂ (20).JPGBackyard of the museum ’Ä’°’Ø’∏’¢ ‘ø’∏’ª’∏’µ’°’∂’´ ÷á ‘±÷Ä’° ’ç’°÷Ä’£’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’ø’∏÷Ç’∂- ’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂.JPGPlaque at the entrance of the museum ‘±÷Ä’° ’ç’°÷Ä’£’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’°’∑’≠’°’ø’°’Ω’•’∂’µ’°’Ø’®.jpgAra Sargsyan studio ’Ä’°’Ø’∏’¢ ‘ø’∏’ª’∏’µ’°’∂’´ ’°’∑’≠’°’ø’°’Ω’•’∂’µ’°’Ø’®.jpgHakob Kojoyan studio ’Ä’°’Ø’∏’¢ ‘ø’∏’ª’∏’µ’°’∂’´ ÷á ‘±÷Ä’° ’ç’°÷Ä’£’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’ø’∏÷Ç’∂-’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂ (17).JPGArtworks in the museum garden ’Ä’°’Ø’∏’¢ ‘ø’∏’ª’∏’µ’°’∂’´ ÷á ‘±÷Ä’° ’ç’°÷Ä’£’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’ø’∏÷Ç’∂-’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂ (21).JPGArtworks in the museum garden ’Ä’•÷Ä’∏’Ω’´’¥’° 1.jpgHiroshima Wikidata edit a thon at Ara Sargsyan & Hakob Kojoyan Museum (6).jpgWikidata edit-a-thon at Ara Sargsyan & Hakob Kojoyan Museum Wikidata edit a thon at Ara Sargsyan & Hakob Kojoyan Museum (5).jpgWikidata edit-a-thon at Ara Sargsyan & Hakob Kojoyan Museum ==References== Category:Museums established in 1973 Category:Biographical museums in Armenia Category:Museums in Yerevan ","title":"Ara Sargsyan and Hakob Kojoyan Museum"},{"id":"56087168","text":"Bezmialem Foundation University () is a private educational and health care organization located in Istanbul, Turkey founded in 2010.

Two major additions were constructed in 1882 and 1886, reflecting the switch in the local economy from lumbering to agriculture The original section of the mill was used for grinding small grist, buckwheat and feed, while the 1882 addition was used to mill flour. The 1886 additional included a grain elevator. The mill operated under the name StafforRoller Mills and Elevator until owner W.R. Stafford's death in 1916. Afterwards, Stafford's son and son-in-law operated it as the Stafford Milling Company. Flour milling halted around the time f World War I. By the 1980s, the mill did custom grinding of feed. and served as storage for grains and feed. The mill was demolished in the early 2000s. ==Description== The mill complex was an L-shaped, gable-roof, timber-frame structure, with a number of shed- roof extensions. There were three sections: A low structure at the north end of the complex (likely the original grist mill), a higher middle section from 1882, and a large 1886 elevator building. The two older parts were originally covered with vertical board and batten, the 1886 section with a veneer of dark red brick. Later, early 20th-century steel sheeting was applied to most of the exterior.

The program was the brainchild of Yamamoto Gombei, who would later become the Minister of the Navy and the eighth Prime Minister of Japan. The completion of the plan led to the emergence of Japan as a first-class naval power. Whereas during the war with China, the Japanese had gone into the conflict with a makeshift force of warships, they would now have a true battle fleet. ==Origins== After the First Sino-Japanese war there was a tide of popular enthusiasm for naval glory that was created by Japan's recent triumphs at sea. Domestically, the war and the favorable settlement were also tremendous political successes for both the government and the armed services. However, with the Triple Intervention on 23 April, the governments of France, Germany and Russia pressured Japan to renounce its claim to the Liaotung Peninsula. The Japanese were well aware of the naval power the three countries possessed in East Asian waters, particularly Russia. Without the diplomatic, political or military support of either Britain or the United States and consequently facing little choice the Japanese retroceded the territory back to China for an additional 30 million taels (roughly ¬•45 million). Although the victory against China had elevated Japan's status, it also further entangled the country in the imperial rivalries in East Asia and the Pacific. The Triple Intervention had also underscored the extent of Japan's maritime weakness in relation to the West. However this maritime weakness, combined with the political and popular capital gained as a result of the war with China, also subsequently encouraged popular and legislative support for naval expansion in the aftermath of the war. {  align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"font-size: 100%;\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey; color:black\\"  Japanese Naval Construction Program (1896‚Äì1905) - align=center rowspan=1Warship type  colspan=\\"1\\" align=center Number - First-class steel battleships 4 - First-class cruisers 6 - Third-class cruisers 3 - Torpedo gunboats 1 - Torpedo depot vessels 1 - Destroyers 23 - First-class torpedo boats 16 - Second-class torpedo boats 37 - Third-class torpedo boats 10 -   rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center Total Ships - Capital Ships 16 - Destroyers and torpedo boats 88 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center Total Cost ¬• 213,100,964 -  - } ==Plans== In May 1895, the Minister of the Navy Saig≈ç Tsugumichi asked Yamamoto Gombei to compose a study of Japan's future naval needs. Yamamoto, who had been newly appointed to his position as Chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau, sensed that a great opportunity existed to secure significant fleet expansion. Approaching his task with unrelenting enthusiasm, Yamamoto devised a revolutionary plan that would fundamentally transform the navy into a world-class military fleet. While Russia was perceived to Japan's most likely enemy in any future conflict, Yamamoto chose to consider other scenarios rather than simply preparations for a war with Russia. Yamamoto believed that Japan should have sufficient naval strength to not only to deal with a single hypothetical enemy separately, but to also confront any naval force from two combined powers that might be dispatched against Japan from overseas waters; this included Britain and to a lesser extent France in his calculations. Yamamoto assumed that with their conflicting global interests, it was highly unlikely that Britain and Russia would ever join together in a war against Japan. He considered that it was more likely that Russia or possibly Britain in alliance with a lesser naval power like France or Germany, would dispatch a portion of their fleet against Japan. Yamamoto therefore calculated that four battleships would be the main battle force that either Britain or Russia could divert from their other naval commitments to use against Japan and he also added two more battleships that might be contributed to such a naval expedition by a lesser hostile power. Yamamoto came up with six as the number of battleships that Japan would need have to have in order to achieve victory. The depth of the Suez Canal was at that time only and the largest warships then being built, which were Britain's 15,000-ton , had a mean draft of equal depth and therefore could not transit the canal. Such a fleet of warships would have to pass around the Cape of Good Hope, not only would this route take time but every European navy with the exception of the Royal Navy, would have to encounter considerable problems in coaling along the way. Furthermore, establishing repair and docking facilities along the route and in East Asian waters for the largest warships would be an enormous expense for any nation. Thus, for its minimum naval security Japan should have a force of six of the largest battleships supplemented by four armored cruisers of at least 7,000 tons. The centerpiece of this expansion was to be the acquisition of four new battleships in addition to the two which were already being built in Britain being part of an earlier construction program: the and . Yamamoto was not simply recommending the building of a battleship force, he was also advocating the construction of a balanced fleet. Just as in the army the infantry was supported by the artillery, cavalry, and engineers, so battleships should be supplemented by lesser warships of various types. Specifically, this meant the inclusion of cruisers that could seek out and pursue the enemy along with a sufficient number of destroyers and torpedo boats capable of striking the enemy in his home ports. The program also included the construction of twenty- three destroyers, sixty-three torpedo boats, and an expansion of Japanese shipyards and repair and training facilities. Given the changes in naval technology at the time as well as the rapidly shifting balance of naval strength among the maritime powers, no sooner had the 1896 naval expansion plan been authorized than it had to be amended. The program had originally called for the construction of four armored cruisers. Further consideration of Russian building plans led the Japanese to conclude that the six battleships authorized under the 1896 plan might not be sufficient after all, if the Russian navy should decide to concentrate in East Asian waters. Yet budgetary limitations simply did not permit the construction of another battleship squadron. However, as the new Harvey and KC armor plates could resist all but the largest AP shells, Japan could now acquire armored cruisers that could take the place in the battle line. Hence, with new armor and lighter but more powerful quick-firing guns, this new cruiser type was superior to many older battleships still afloat. Subsequently, in the 1897 revisions to the ten-year plan led to the four protected cruisers being substituted for two additional armored cruisers. And as a consequence \\"Six-Six Fleet\\" was born: six battleships and six armored cruisers. ==Implementation== Mikasa was one of the six battleships ordered as part of the program. The Six-six fleet was approved by the cabinet in late 1895 and funded by the Diet in early 1896. The proposed program for a 260,000-ton navy was to be completed over a ten-year period with the total cost being ¬•280 million, of this total warship acquisitions accounted for just over ¬•200 million, in two stages of construction. The first stage would begin in 1896 and be completed by 1902; the second would run from 1897 to 1905. The program was financed significantly from the Chinese indemnity secured after the First Sino-Japanese war. This was used to fund the bulk of the naval expansion, roughly ¬•139 million, with public loans and existing government revenue providing the rest of the financing required over the ten years of the program. Critically, this meant that there would no increase in the land tax needed to support naval increases, at least in 1895-96, which was crucial in securing widespread parliamentary support. The government did, however, propose a tax increase on sake and tobacco to pay for additional operating expenses that would accompany fleet expansion. Japan's industrial resources at the time were inadequate for the construction of a main battle force of armored warships domestically, as the country was still in the process of developing and acquiring the industrial infrastructure for the construction of major naval vessels. As a result, 90 percent of the 234,000 tons of naval construction contracted for under the ten-year beginning 1896-97 was to be foreign built, and when complete would comprise 70 percent of the Japanese fleet. Of this, the overwhelming majority was built in British shipyards. With the completion of the fleet, Japan would become the fourth strongest naval power in the world in a single decade. ==See also== Eight- eight fleet ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Imperial Japanese Navy Category:Naval history of Japan ","title":"Six-six fleet"},{"id":"56087329","text":"The SprA1/SPrA1as toxin/antitoxin system identified in Staphylococcus aureus, belongs to the Type I system encoding toxin protein: SprA1 and antitoxin RNA: SprA1as.

Sangnoksu unit is the first unit for the purpose of maintaining peace in South Korea. After joining the UN in 1991, Sangnoksu unit started its peacekeeping missions in Somalia from July 1993 to March 1994. From October 1995 to December1996, Sangnoksu unit performed its missions in Angola. Lastly, it was sent for peacekeeping operations in East Timor from October 1999 to October 2003. After 2003, Sangnoksu unit was disbanded. == Sangnoksu Unit in Somalia (1993. 7 ~ 1994. 3) ==  Symbol  The name of the Sangnoksu unit contains pure meaning. The name of the Sangnoksu unit, which has the historical records of the first UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) of South Korea in 1993, signifies that the desolate land will be replaced by the blue land. The background is red and the symbol of Korea army is depicted in white. The name of unit is inscribed.  Dispatch background  Somalia, located in the Horn of Africa, has a population of about 15.6 million people, but there are 1.5 million refugees because of long- term civil war. Somalian are major(85 percent of the population), but there is a multiracial group such as Helman, Arabs, and Indian. Somalia was originally an Islamic Emirate since the end of the 19th century, but it became independent from Britain and Italy on July 1, 1960. Although the coup regime assumed power in 1969, a large and small civil war continued to ensue. In January 1991, the United Somali Congress (USC), a group of Somali rebels, expelled the Barre regime of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP), which has continued to reign after the coup d'√©tat, which has continued its dictatorship and nepotism. But in the United Somali Congress (USC), conflicts between president Mahdi and chairman of Aidid have been getting worse and consequently the civil war of anarchy has been lasted. The United Nations established the United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I) in April 1992 for peace and reconstruction of Somalia under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 733. However, the civil war continued as the infighting continued, and the state of anarchy continued. In December 1992, the U.S.-led multinational force was dispatched to Somalia, and the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) was established in March 1993. In February 1993, South Korea decided to dispatch troops after a field survey and three related ministries‚Äô meeting in order to actively participate in the UN peacekeeping effort and enhance international status. On May 18, 1993, South Korea dispatched 516 members to carry out UN peacekeeping operations, which were held in Mogadishu from July 1993 to March 1994.  Activities  Sangnoksu unit served as a peacekeeping force to protect and repair various facilities, such as protection facilities, water and sewage, electrical facilities, roads, and bridges. In addition, it helped to restart the textile farms by allowing residents to cultivate about 5,000 hectares of farmland and reoperate cotton plants. The establishment of technology schools, which could instill national consciousness and independence, led to a high degree of responsiveness from local residents. Activity of Sangnoksu unit in Somalia was the first of activities as the UN peacekeeping operations to overcome various difficult conditions and exceeded expectations. Through this, Republic of Korea Armed Forces have become confident that it can successfully fulfill any mission in any part of the world. == Sangnoksu Unit in Angola (1995.10 ~ 1996.12) ==  Symbol  The background of the flag is red meaning military engineer and the castle and sword means a badge of military engineer. On the upper left side of the flag is the UN symbol, the other side is South Korea.  Dispatch background  Angola is a country in Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa. Since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975, the Civil War had begun between the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA)(Portuguese: Movimento Popular de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Although a peace treaty was concluded in May 1991, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which lost the referendum under the arbitration of the UN, caused the civil war again. In the process, the United Nations established United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA). In February 1995, the United Nations asked South Korea to participate in United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM). 201 people were dispatched on October 5, 1995, and 600 people were dispatched additionally by December 23, 1996.  Activities  The army, which was dispatched to Ruwanda Ovambo in Angola, actively implemented humanitarian relief efforts, as well as successfully carried out missions, repairs assigned by the United Nations. They recovered 8 bridges in the Chipipa, 2 airfields in the Ovambo and five sites including accommodation facilities and provided technical support. As the humanitarian relief activities, they actively provided support for diverse fields such as the establishment of a fountain, orphanages and cathedrals, schools. == Sangnoksu Unit in East Timor (1999.10 ~ 2003.10) ==  Dispatch background  East Timor, located in the eastern tip of the Indonesian island of Timor, is an area living in approximately 85 million people. East Timor had been under the control of Portugal for over 450 years since the 16th century and has been forced into Indonesia's 27th state in 1975. For the next 20 years, it continued to fight for independence from Indonesia, and eventually settled down independence by the referendum. On August 30, 1999, the referendum was held under the UN, and 98.6 percent of voters voted. While 78.5 percent of voters voted for their independence, the rebel militia turned out a bloody violence. There were many refugees in the process, and tens of thousands of people were killed. Even, the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) for helping the referendum fled to Australia. The Indonesian government declared a state of emergency of East Timor and sought to resolve the confusion, but eventually accepted the dispatch of multinational forces to secure the situation. On September 15, 1999, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted a resolution to approve the establishment of coalition forces, which undertook a mission to secure public peace in East Timor. On October 25, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) approved the establishment of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) through the Security Council Resolution 1272, and in February 2000, more than 8,300 U.N. peacekeepers were replaced by coalition forces. On September 15, 1999, South Korea decided to dispatch troops for the first time to contribute to UN peacekeeping operations, which the United Nations has imposed on coalition forces, and finally dispatched 430 people on September 28. They successfully conducted a mission granted to stabilize security and peace of East Timor by October 23, 2003.  Activities  Medical service by army surgeon of Sangroksu Unit for the local people. The Sangnoksu unit was assigned to maintain security, peace, civil operations, and rehabilitation assistance. Troops stationed in Lospalos carried out patrols in nearby areas, including roads and densely populated dwellings three times a day. They provided 24-hour vigilance within the area. They also provided security guards and escort services during a visit of the helicopter of coalition forces and the key personnel. In order to maintain peace, the squad conducted a patrol activity and policed potential threats such as illegal weapon holders. Also they tried to form trust with local residents by listening to opinions through daily interviews with village chief and principals. In addition, they had performed multiple activity in various diverse environments such as sudden changes in weather patterns, conflicts between militias and an army for national independence, and flow of refugees. Thus, the UN evaluated the Sangnoksu unit as the most exemplary troops of the UN peacekeeping operations. == References  External links == * Homepage of Ministry of National Defense of Rebulic of Korea about Somalia ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Íµ≠Î∞©Î∂Ä ÏÜåÎßêÎ¶¨ÏïÑ ÏÉÅÎ°ùÏàòÎ∂ÄÎåÄ * Homepage of Ministry of National Defense of Rebulic of Korea about Angola ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Íµ≠Î∞©Î∂Ä ÏïôÍ≥®Îùº ÌèâÌôîÏú†ÏßÄÌôúÎèô * Homepage of Ministry of National Defense of Rebulic of Korea about East Timor ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Íµ≠Î∞©Î∂Ä ÎèôÌã∞Î™®Î•¥ ÏÉÅÎ°ùÏàòÎ∂ÄÎåÄ Category:United Nations operations in Africa Category:United Nations operations in East Timor Category:Overseas deployments of South Korea armed forces Category:Military units and formations established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in South Korea Category:Military units and formations of the South Korean Army Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2003 Category:Military units involved in UN peacekeeping missions Category:East Timor‚ÄìSouth Korea relations ","title":"Sangnoksu Unit"},{"id":"56087356","text":"Longcase clock with a cone pendulum, by Joseph Kaspar Bollermann, W√ºrzburg, 1825 Joseph Kaspar Bollermann (1773 - December 21, 1839) was a German clockmaker active in W√ºrzburg.

It can be used both for birth control and for planning a family. The app is marketed as Natural Cycles, which is also the name of the company the couple founded to produce it in 2013. ==Biography== Born in 1984, Elina Berglund was raised in Malm√∂ in southern Sweden. Her father is a professor of medicine, but both he and her mother are entrepreneurs, running several companies together. She began to be interested in physics at the age of five when her father talked to her about the universe. She went on to study engineering physics at the Lund Institute of Technology, receiving a master of science degree in 2008. She then spent three years at the University of Geneva, culminating in a PhD in elementary particle physics in 2011. In parallel with her studies, she collaborated in the ATLAS project at CERN, working with a team that would win the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the Higgs boson particle at CERN. One month after the announcement of Higgs boson discovery in the summer of 2012, Berglund left CERN as the experiment facility was closing for an upgrade over the next two years. She married her physicist colleague Raoul Scherwitzl and the couple started to think about raising a family. After deciding to stop using the contraceptive pill, she began to analyse her body temperature in order to reveal the days when she was most fertile. \\"I wanted to give my body a break from the pill,\\" she explained, \\"but I couldn't find any good forms of natural birth control, so I wrote an algorithm for myself.\\" With her husband's encouragement, this led her to develop a fertility app, suitable for use by any woman. The couple gave up their physics jobs and moved to Sweden to concentrate on developing and marketing the app, founding the company Natural Cycles in 2013. They successfully used the app to plan the birth of their daughter. Although they began to market the product in 2014 with approval from the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency, they ran into trouble the following year when the agency revoked approval, forcing them to remove any reference to contraception in marketing the app. It was only in February 2017 that they finally received approval from the German inspection and certification organisation T√ºv S√ºd, allowing them to market the product throughout Europe. It was the first time a technical device of this type had been approved for contraception anywhere in the world. When asked by Mimmi Rito of Visma whether she intended to spend her life working on the app, she replied: \\"No, but I think I will always work with something involving data, analysing data, drawing conclusions, applying data to something or other. It does not need to be physical, it does not need to be contraception, but that's the common denominator now and I think it will always continue to be.\\" ==Awards== In 2015, Berglund received the Women in Tech Foundation's Entrepreneurial Award. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:People from Malm√∂ Category:Swedish nuclear physicists Category:Swedish women physicists Category:21st-century Swedish businesspeople Category:Swedish women in business Category:Women nuclear physicists Category:Lund University alumni Category:21st-century women scientists Category:People associated with CERN ","title":"Elina Berglund"},{"id":"56087391","text":"Return () is a 2018 South Korean television series.

He lived in a rural area and retired in 1963 at the age of 67. He only began to take interest in art as a retiree, using the material he had at his disposal like stones, trash and barbed wire. He felt that art could be made from anything if the artist had a vision. Alfredsson had difficulty relating to women, and consequently his art depicted a struggle between the sexes.

In astronomy, his most notable observations and measurements were of the solar disc and binary stars. ==Early life, education and family== Erck was born in Dublin to Caroline Minchin and John Caillard Erck. He was the oldest of four siblings. His first name came from his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Wentworth, niece of Sir John Wentworth, former governor of New Hampshire and lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia. His father was an Ecclesiastical Commissioner for Ireland and of Huguenot descent. He studied for a time at Rugby School. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1850, and was called to the bar the same year. In 1859, he completed his doctorate in law. He retained a boyhood interest in science, particularly astronomy. He married Charlotte Anne Kingston and they settled at Sherrington, Shankill, Dublin, near Bray, Co. Wicklow in 1870, not far from his lands and tenants. He was part of the Rathmichael Church of Ireland parish: he was at the consecration in 1864, was a member of the vestry in 1870 and was treasurer in 1877. He constructed an observatory at Sherrington. ==Astronomical career== For much of the time his main telescope was one with a 19 cm (7.5 inch) objective which was created by the American astronomer and artist Alvan Clark and formerly owned by British astronomer William Rutter Dawes. Much later he acquired a 38 cm (15-inch) reflector for which he designed an altazimuth mounting. He took a 9 cm (3.5 inch) telescope with him while travelling, very often to London, so that he could continue his observations.

From 1869 to 1888, he made notes and drawings of sunspots on the solar disc on most observable days, observations which increased in precision over time with improvements in his equipment. His next most common study was of binary stars: he made nearly two thousand measurements, contenting himself with measurement of the position angles of the pairs and not distances, considering the limitations of his telescope. He spent a fair amount of time observing comites of stars e.g. of Sirius A, Rigel and Procyon. He observed Saturn and its moons. He was the first person in Ireland or Britain to observe the moons of Mars, even missing their discovery by only two weeks (they were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall) with a 66 cm (26 inch) reflector); that he noticed them at all with his relatively small telescope was regarded as remarkable. In a letter to the Times, he estimated the diameter of Mars' outer moon, Deimos, as 20 miles (32 km), a little over twice its actual diameter and contradicting other correspondents whose estimates were more accurate.; his comments and the replies were good-natured. In 1878 he published a paper on the Martian satellites in the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society. In 1880 he became one of the first astronomers to notice the motion of the red spot of Jupiter against other surface details. He also observed and reported on comets such as the Great Comet of 1882; he published reports of his work, and corrections to it, in local newspapers and scientific journals, including Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (of which he became a Fellow in 1855), Nature and The Observatory. His articles included his equipment designs and improvements, for example an adjustable observing chair and a method for reducing heating at the eyepiece while looking at the Sun. Considering his astronomical endeavours he published very little. ==Official career== Erck exercised his duties diligently as a magistrate for Co.Wicklow, a poor law guardian and attending to his lands and tenants. He did not let this work be compromised by his astronomical practices. He turned down an opportunity to become a Conservative member of parliament. Arthur Rambaut (later Royal Astronomer of Ireland) stated that there was no doubt that his public duties affected his health and shortened his life, but he was a happy man of a kindly nature and good spirits and was highly respected. He died at his Sherrington home. ==See also== * List of Irish people ==References== Category:1827 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Irish astronomers Category:Irish judges Category:19th-century Irish landowners Category:19th- century Irish scientists Category:Fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society ","title":"Wentworth Erck"},{"id":"56087517","text":"View from the K√∂nigsberg in Southern Styria.The K√∂nigsberg is one of the archaeological sites in the Styrian micro-region Gro√üklein. ‚ÄúMonumentalized Early Iron Age Landscapes in the Danube river basin‚Äù Iron-Age-Danube is a cross-border project and is part of the Interreg Danube Transnational Programme of the European Union. In the Iron-Age-Danube project the early Iron Age landscapes in the Danube river basin are explored with the help of modern technology and traditional archaeological tools. The participating partners from Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia work together to promote the concept of archaeological landscapes beyond single archaeological sites in these countries. The project is funded by the European Union with about 2.169.200 EUR from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). These ERDF resources make 85% of the total project volume which is about 2.552.000 EUR. The Iron-Age-Danube project lasts from the 1st of January 2017 till the 30th of June 2019. == Goals of the project == The major goal of the project is to communicate a lively image of archaeological research and the Iron Age landscapes to the visitors and to raise the awareness for the importance of archaeological monuments for the human history. The project Iron-Age-Danube ignores borderlines between the countries and researches the remains of the Hallstatt period (Iron Age) in the Danube region. The data of this research will help to understand the way of living in the past and the needs of the heritage today. Another goal is the protection of the monuments and landscapes as well as their sustainable use for the tourism. To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: Gro√üklein and Strettweg (Austria), Jal≈æabet and Kaptol (Croatia), Po≈°tela and Dolenjske Toplice (Slovenia) and Sz√°zhalombatta, S√ºtt≈ë and Sopron (Hungary). == Project partners == The project partners and associated partners in Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia are: * LP (AT) Universalmuseum Joanneum (UMJ) * PP 1 (AT) University of Graz, Institute of Archaeology (Uni Graz) * PP 2 (AT) University of Vienna, Institute of Prehistoric and Historical Archaeology (UNIVIE) * PP 3 (SI) University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Arts, Department of Archaeology (Uni Ljubljana) * PP 4 (SI) Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia, Centre for Preventive Archaeology (IPCHS) * PP 5 (SI) University of Maribor, Faculty for Agriculture and Life Sciences (Uni Maribor) * PP 6 (CRO) Institute of Archaeology (IARH) * PP 7 (CRO) Archaeological Museum in Zagreb (AMZ) * PP 8 (HU) Matrica Museum and Archaeological Park (MM) (only 2017) * PP 9 (HU) E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, Faculty of Humanities, Institute of Archaeological Sciences (ELTEFHIAS) * PP 10 (HU) Archaeolingua Foundation (ARCHAEOLINGUA) * PP 11 (HU) Hungarian National Museum (HNM) * ASP 1 (AT) Federal Monuments Agency (BDA) * ASP 2 (SI) Regional museum Maribor (PoMuM) * ASP 3 (SI) Dolenjski museum Novo mesto (DM Novo mesto) * ASP 4 (SI) Slovenian Tourist Board (STO) * ASP 5 (CRO) Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia, Directorate for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (MinCultCro) * ASP 6 (CRO) Centre for Prehistoric Research (CPR) * ASP 7 (CRO) Vara≈ædin County Tourist Board (VCTB) * ASP 9 (SK) Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra (UKF) ==The project in 2018== On the 31st of January 2018 the European Year of Cultural Heritage was officially launched by the European Commission and the Iron-Age-Danube project was granted the honor to use the EYCH 2018 logo.

Springer. p. viii == Biography ==  Youth, education and early career  Malotaux was born in Delft in 1923, the son of Robert Nicolas Marc August Malotaux (1898-1984) and Alice Cesarine Michiels (1897-1975). He was named after his grandfather, Pierre Malotaux, who came from Valenciennes, France. He attended the Hogere Burgerschool, where he graduated in 1940. In that year he started to study aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology, where interrupted by the second World War he obtained his kandidaats exam in 1948 and his Engineering degree in 1951. After graduating, he started his career at the Koninklijke Hoogovens in IJmuiden in 1951 at the psychotechnical department. From 1953 to 1959 he was consultant at a consultancy agency for business economics.Malotaux et al. (1998, p 147) In 1959 he settled as independent business consultant, and participated in the working group on business administration at the Koninklijk Instituut van Ingenieurs.  Further career  In 1968 at the Delft University of Technology he was appointed Professor of Business Administration at the Department of General Science. The first Professor of Business Administration in Delft had been appointed in 1909 and Malotaux was the six professor in a row. He predecessor Jacob Louis Mey had served from 1964 to 1965. However, instead of appointed one successor, in 1968 three professors were appointed: Malotaux, Jan in 't Veld, and Henk Lombaers. Malotaux was to focus on general aspects of business theory, In 't Veld on industrial organization and Lombaerts on Operations research.Malotaux et al. (1969) In cooperation with Jan in 't Veld and several other engineers and social scientists, Malotaux developed a specific systems approach to organizational problems, which is called the Delft Systems Approach. In the 1980s Malotaux was initiator of the national network on Reliability, Maintenance management and Maintenance technology company. Their publications on this subject gave a start on life cycle thinking about technical systems in the Netherlands.D.C. Kooijman, H.L. Swets, & Hugo Priemus.

He stands on top of a mountain called Borg√•sen, in K√§lltegen, Blomskog, √Örj√§ng, Sweden. Why he was put there is unknown, but rumor has it that he was put there to frighten off enemies. It was supposed to give those attacking a vision of a living guard post. It was built in times of war between Sweden and Norway around 1600-1700. Many believe that the stone statue was made by soldiers called caroleans, soldiers that served in the army under the Swedish King Charles XII's rule. Charles and his soldiers were passing by and were on their way to Fredriksten fortress in Norway when they stopped in Blomskog. To celebrate the millennium, the people of Blomskog made a new memorial and gave Borg√•sgubben a 3.5-foot- tall wife; she is located on another hill, called \\"K√§llte kuel\\" a mile away. She is called Stenfrun - The Stonelady. Later on some unknown tourist gave them a son; there is no name and no date of when he was built. You can find him next to the Stonelady. == History of Borg√•sen == The area around Blomskog, and the whole of V√§rmland has a lot of history. In the 16th-century it was very poor, and a war-feud between Sweden and Norway (under Danish rule) led to the border towns on the Swedish side being burned down several times. There is a book by Olle H√∂gstrand printed in 1979 called \\"N√§r hela socknen brann\\" which describes how society looked then when the statue was made. During the ensuing years people have used the hill as an escape allowing refugees to feel safe and protected.  Ancient castle  Borg√•sgubben stands in the middle of an ancient castle that measures 110*55 meters. But the only thing still remaining is a 50 meter long low stone wall on the mountain's southern slope, where the entrance is. The steep mountain sides have served as a natural protection. It is considered that most ancient castles were built during the early Iron Age (400 - 1050 AD). In times of sacrifices places like this have been used by refugees. People also used it to guard roads and sea transports. Another possibility is that they may have served as permanent residences. It has an ancestral number 39: 1 in Blomskog Latitude: 59.2884 degrees north, longitude: 12.0852 degrees east (WGS84). List of others ancient castle ruins in V√§rlmand.  Charles XII  The area of √Örj√§ng has since ancient times been important, here lies one of the country's main roads across the border to Norway. The significance was particularly prominent during Karl XII's time, which left many trails in the country. Rumor has it that it was Charles XII caroleans who built Borg√•sgubben.  WW2  During World War II there was a watchtower located on the mountain. The post was guarded around the clock and on the lookout for attacks from German aircraft. While standing in that tower looking at the forest west of Lennartsfors one is able to see Norway. On K√§lltegen's mountain you can find two wheeled crosses engraved, they were made by guards who were stationed there. == Nowadays == Nowadays you could say that Borg√•sgubben is the hallmark for the people of Blomskog. For a part of the local population, the old man is more meaningful for others. If you have your roots here, the story of the mountain, the castle and the stone statue is part of their legacy. Tourist visit the figure Borg√•sgubben, not just because of him, but for the incredibly beautiful nature around him. On the hilltop you have a great view of Lake V√§stra Silen. What we know about the mountain and its history is just the tip of the iceberg. Locals residents have found names engraved from both soldiers and people who used to live in the neighborhood. It's expected that more could be found. == How to get there == Directions from √Örj√§ng: Drive road 172 towards Bengtsfors about 12 km, turn right at the sign Blomskog. Continue about 2.5 km. The figure is visible a long way before reaching the height where a ladder rises to the left. There is a small parking lot here at the beginning of the mountain slope. You can park your car here and then you have to walk by foot to reach Borg√•sgubben.

Her mother, Charlotte Glyde, had six children and they all became involved in politics. Her mother was a servant. In 1907 she started a partnership with William James Jenkins, they never married, but they had three children.Brooke, S. (2006-05-25). Jenkins [n√©e Glyde], Alice Brook (1886‚Äì1967), abortion campaigner. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 22 Dec. 2017, see link. On 17 February 1936, Jenkins along with Janet Chance and Stella Browne began the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA). At the end of their first year they had 35 new members, and by 1939 they had almost 400. The membership were gathered from the working class using labour groups and women‚Äôs branches of the co-operative movement. These women wanted the privileges that ‚Äúmoneyed classes had enjoyed for years.‚Äù The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They were in the frame when a member of the ALRA‚Äôs Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and she received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA. Jenkins wrote an important book titled \\"Law For The Rich\\" which was published in 1960. He book drew attention to the double standards that faced women with unwanted pregnancies. Abortion was nominally illegal so many women had to give birth to unplanned children, however rich women could persuade their private doctors that their mental health was at risk. The doctors were then able to carry out an abortion that was denied to most women in Britain. The ALRA's major victory was to gain the support of the liberal politician David Steel. He was a liberal M.P. who had been lucky enough to win a third chance of placing a private members bill through the house of commons. He rejected a call to amend the rights of plumbers and homosexuals and decided to reform the laws of abortion. He cites Alice Jenkin's argument in her book \\"Law For The Rich\\" as being pivotal in his decision. Steele put forward a private members bill that was backed by the government and it resulted in the 1967 Abortion Act. == Death and legacy == Jenkins died on Christmas Day 1967.Stephen Brooke, ‚ÄòJenkins , Alice Brook (1886‚Äì1967)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006; online edn, May 2008 accessed 24 Oct 2017 She was the only surviving member of the original ALRA executive and she did see the act pass into UK law eight days before she died. ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1967 deaths Category:People from Ilkley ","title":"Alice Jenkins"},{"id":"56087750","text":"Karak√∂y is a station on the historic T√ºnel funicular railway in Beyoƒülu, Istanbul. Located on Tersane Avenue, just north of the Golden Horn, it is the southern and lower terminus of the railway. The station is located at the ground floor of the IETT General Headquarters Building. ==Overview== Karak√∂y station is located at Tersane Avenue No:9 and is on the ground floor of the IETT General Headquarters Building. The entrance to the station is located on the southeast corner of the building, while the exit is located on the west side of the building. The station is at-grade at the base of Galata hill. The tunnel begins at the northern end of the platforms, as the track head straight into the hill and up to Beyoƒülu. Like its counterpart station, Beyoƒülu, the Spanish solution is used at Karak√∂y, as the east platform us for boarding passengers and the west platform is for exiting passengers. The station is integrated within the citywide smartcard system, Istanbulkart, and turnstiles are located at the station's entrance. Connection to the T1 line of the Istanbul Tram to Kabata≈ü or Baƒücƒ±lar is available along with ferry service from the two piers in Karak√∂y. Municipal ferries, operated by ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ±, depart from Karak√∂y Pier located east of Karak√∂y station, on Rƒ±htƒ±m Avenue. Private ferries, operated by Turyol, depart from Turyol's Karak√∂y Pier located one block south of Karak√∂y station. Connection to several IETT city bus lines on Kemeraltƒ± Avenue are also available. ==History== Karak√∂y station, along with Beyoƒülu station, is one of the oldest subterranean urban railway stations in the world. Construction began in the summer of 1871 and was completed in 1874, along with the rest of the railway line. Karak√∂y station officially opened, along with T√ºnel, on 17 January 1875 as Galata station. The station was originally built with two tracks and two side platforms and powered by a steam engine. The station building was a two-story structure, built mostly from wood. On 25 August 1875, the cable carrying the northbound train snapped towards near Beyoƒülu and the car began to plunge backwards toward Karak√∂y. A major accident was averted as the driver was able to hit the emergency brakes and stop the train just short of Karak√∂y station. Karak√∂y station, along with the railway, was nationalized and bought by IETT in 1939, which continued to operate the railway. Karak√∂y station temporarily closed down in 1968 in order for IETT to modernize and electrify the railway. Since the steam engine was replaced by an electric engine, the wooden Karak√∂y station building needed to be replaced. The station was modernized and rebuilt into a stone structure and officially reopened on 2 November 1971. In 1981, the construction of the IETT General Headquarters Building began and was completed in 1983. This 7-story building was built on top of Karak√∂y station. Connection to Istanbul's modern tram network became available in 2005, when the T1 line was extended from Emin√∂n√º to Karak√∂y. ==Nearby Places of Interest== *Galata Bridge - The oldest bridge across the Golden Horn. *Bankalar Avenue - The financial center of the Ottoman Empire. ==References== Category:Rail transport in Istanbul Category:Railway stations in Istanbul Province Category:Railway stations opened in 1875 Category:Beyoƒülu Category:Funicular railways in Turkey Category:1875 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Karak√∂y (T√ºnel)"},{"id":"56087769","text":"Anders Linb√§ck, vicar and serial killer Anders Lindb√§ck (22 December 1803 ‚Äì 20 November 1865) was a Swedish vicar who committed three murders; he is the first-known serial killer in Sweden. He was revealed and convicted in 1865.Carl-Olof Bernhardsson (red): Brottets kr√∂nika del II, Med√©ns f√∂rlags AB, Stockholm 1955 == Childhood and education == Lindb√§ck was born in Br√•landa. His father Sven Andersson (1774-1822) was a poor farmer in Dalsland and his mother Lisa Olsdotter (died 1821) was a housewife. During his childhood the whole family was moving from one parish to another asking for alms. At this time he read much, which gave him a nickname \\"reading-Anders\\". His parents died when he was a teenager and his wealthy uncle Johan Nordahl took care of him afterwards. In the year 1820 he helped him with the money for studies. Anders was studying in V√§nersborg first and starting from 1824 in Katedralskolan in Skara. The 2 February 1829 he came in to the University of Uppsala and there he was ordained a priest, 19 December 1831. It was a huge social mobility upward for that time. The first 30 years as a priest he spent in Dalsland, specifically in Sk√•llerud's parish. At the beginning of the 1860s he finally got a chance to be a vicar in the small parish Silbodal in V√§rmland. Silbodal parish was poorer than Sk√•llerud and that is why Anders's work was focused mainly on poverty and criminality in the region. During his stay in Sk√•llerud he started a campaign against alcoholism and continued with it when he moved to Silbodal. == Time in Silbodal == He was accepted as a vicar in Silbodal in 1861. He got more power in this position: an opportunity to go through with his own conceptions and ideas. The main goal was to create a parish free from poverty, full of hardworking people who has education opportunities. His vision was about making an order in both economy and existence of poor people in the parish. At that time there were 40 people that the church was supporting and it was a heavy burden for such a small parish. Lindb√§ck wanted to minimize the costs that the church was bearing. He established an advice board of nine people and together with them he set new strict rules about taking care of the poverty in the region. One of the decisions they made was that only their own parishioners could receive help from the church. In general, the rules which frames the list of those who could receive the help became more strict, some of them might have been even illegal. == Murder series == Lindb√§ck had the idea that poor and ill people are too costly for the commune. He came up with the solution that was economically beneficial and at the same time minimized the number of people who required the support. Lindb√§ck had a small bottle of wine, a cup, a sacramental wafer and an access to arsenic which he was adding to the wine. He was making many home visits to people to give them blessings and supper during autumn and winter in 1864. He made it look like an act of mercy. After a while after his visits some people felt even worse than before. The first person who died 19 October 1864 was a widow Karin Persdotter. Then, on 30 November Nils Pettersson, a farm-worker, died. The last person to die was Anders Lys√©n, who died 15 December 1864. Moreover, four other people were poisoned. == Disclosure == The last murder struck the killer. Anders Lys√©n was ill but not poor. He was a wealthy businessman(?) and his sudden death made his relatives suspect that something was wrong. At the beginning of 1865 Anders Lys√©n's brother demanded that the grave should be opened. In March 1865 on the request of the local sheriff it was concluded that Anders Lys√©n died because of an arsenic poisoning. More graves were opened and it was noted that two more parishioners died of arsenic poisoning. Anders Lindb√§ck was under suspicion partially because the funerals were made in a rush and another reason is because he had granted 10000 Swedish krons to estate. == Trial and death == After this, Lindb√§ck was brought to justice. A person named Daniel witnessed. Daniel's mother died after the priest's visit while Daniel himself had survived the poisoned supper five times. The reason may have been that he did not like wine. During the first trial, which was held by the District Court on 11 June in L√•ngelanda Courthouse, Anders Lindb√§ck confessed three murders and three murder attempts. In his long defense speech he explained that he had done this in order to free those people from plagues. This speech did not help him and he was sentenced to death. The case was passed on to the Court of Appeal, which gave the District Court more time to revise the case and the legal process. The District Court investigated the case again but the penalty remained the same. Before the sentence was executed, Anders Lindb√§ck hanged himself in the prison in Karlstad on 20 November 1865. ==References== Category:1803 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Swedish serial killers Category:Swedish people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Sweden Category:19th-century Swedish people Category:19th-century Swedish criminals Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Category:People sentenced to death Category:Suicides by hanging in Sweden Category:Poisoners Category:Male serial killers ","title":"Anders Lindb√§ck (vicar)"},{"id":"56087774","text":"Ruth Borgobello is an Australian-Italian film director and screenwriter.

Guggenheim Museum, Albert Gleizes, Composition for \\"Jazz\\", 1915, Accession number 38.817 ==Description== Composition for \\"Jazz\\" is a Gouache on cardboard, mounted on Masonite measuring 73 x 73 cm (28 3/4 by 28 3/4 inches), inscribed to the lower right 'Albert Gleizes / 15, N.Y.' A precursor to Crystal Cubism, Composition for \\"Jazz\\" consists of broad, overlapping planes of black, white and two primary colors, yellow and red, dynamically intersecting diagonal lines coupled with circular movements. Despite its highly abstract nature, two figures emerge, one in the 'foreground' and one towards the upper center of the composition. The principle figure, to the left, appears to be playing a banjo. The treatment of the paint is erratic, brushstrokes rapidly applied, almost expressionistic in placement. The composition is dynamic, not in time, but in spatial elements. Details such as the banjo strings and the hand strumming them are delicately yet nervously rendered. Facial features are reduced to mere lines crossing an arc shaped head. The head of the musician on the left is poised vertiginously on top of a mans body, as if disconnected, balanced somehow in unstable equilibrium. The lines, arcs, colors, and brushstrokes are together juxtaposed seemingly at random, as if the entire composition was an improvised memory of a jazz performance. ==Background== Around 1912 the four-string banjo and saxophones became popular in New York, with ensembles such as the Clef Club Orchestra playing music by black composers. They played at Carnegie Hall between 1912 and 1914. Their performances generated respectability in white society.Cary D. Wintz, Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance: K-Y, Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, Taylor & Francis, 2004, pp. 835, From around 1915, early jazz performances consisted primarily of small ensembles (four or five musicians) of exciting, wild, instinctual, and almost entirely improvised polyphony. Juliette Roche Gleizes gave an evocative description of the couple's first night in New York City and the spectacular experience that inspired Gleizes to work on the theme of jazz. Art historian Daniel Robbins recounts: > They arrived in the late afternoon, drove to the Albemarle Hotel on Forty- > fifth Street, and almost immediately set out for a long walk. After about > two hours they entered a restaurant in Harlem where a black jazz group was > performing with extraordinary vitality and force. It was an electrifying > experience, comparable, they felt, to the discovery of Stravinsky. Within a > few days Gleizes produced the present work, followed shortly afterwards by a > full-scale oil entitled Jazz [Jazz, 1915, oil on board, 100 x 75 cm, > Deroudille collection, Lyon]. In spite of its title, the Guggenheim picture > may represent a slightly different response to the same experience, rather > than a specific study for the Deroudille work.Daniel Robbins, unpublished > Ph.D. dissertation, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1975 Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Painted at the fortress city of Toul (Lorraine) while Gleizes served in the military during the First World War During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by Carlos Salzedo, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production, leading to abstract works virtually free of visual subject matter.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1915, from Le Cubisme en majest√©, Albert Gleizes, exhibition catalogue, Mus√©e Picasso, Barcelona; Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, 2001 Gleizes had been to Paris, Bermuda and Barcelona following a short stint serving the military at the fortress city of Toul, late 1914 early 1915, prior to his arrival to New York City. His arrival in Paris after his self-imposed exile saw the new style already underway. Yet independently, Gleizes had been working in a similar direction as early as 1914-15: Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire), 1914-15 (Solomon R.

These wartime works marked \\"the beginning of an attempt to preserve specific and individual visual characteristics while experimenting with a radically different compositional treatment in which broad planes, angled from the perimeter, meet circles.\\" (Robbins, 1964)Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964, no. 78, p. 55 Rather than based on the analysis of volumetric objects, the artist strove toward synthesis; something that originated in unity.Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914, La guerre, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15. Reprinted, Ampuis, 1997, written during the First World WarPeter Brooke, Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 2001, \\"Gleizes was tremendously impressed by New York City\\", writes Robbins, \\"but the earliest New York paintings continued without break the formal research advanced at Toul (nos. 71-75) even though the influence of new subject matter is apparent.\\"Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website) The period of profound reflection of which Composition pour \\"Jazz\\" is a precursor (viz. Crystal Cubism) contributed to the constitution of a new mindset; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The flat surface, wrote Gleizes in 1925, became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting.Albert Gleizes, L'Epop√©e, written in 1925, published in Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929. First published under the title Kubismus, 1928. English translation, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, by Peter Brooke Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' [\\"La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions\\"], while revealing the \\"basic elements\\" of painting, the \\"true, solid rules‚Äîrules which could be generally applied\\". It was Jean Metzinger and Juan Gris who, again according to Gleizes, \\"did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born\\". \\"But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done.\\" Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all.Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215 ==Exhibitions== * New York City, Solomon R.

Sixty-four teams participated in the competition, including all teams from the previous year's Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. The competition began on 9 August 2019 with the first of six rounds and ended on 4 July 2020 with the final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, a nominally neutral venue, which has hosted the final since 1985. The DFB-Pokal is considered the second- most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. The DFB-Pokal is run by the German Football Association (DFB). The defending champions were Bundesliga side Bayern Munich, after they defeated RB Leipzig 3‚Äì0 in the previous final. Bayern successfully defended their title, winning their 20th DFB-Pokal title after beating Bayer Leverkusen 4‚Äì2 in the final. With the win, Bayern completed their second consecutive and 13th domestic double overall, and therefore will play home (in a change of format; under old rules they would have played away as was the case the previous year) to 2019‚Äì20 Bundesliga runners-up Borussia Dortmund in the 2020 DFL-Supercup. Because Bayern qualified for the Champions League through the Bundesliga, the sixth-place team in the Bundesliga, 1899 Hoffenheim, earned qualification for the group stage of the 2020‚Äì21 edition of the UEFA Europa League, and the league's second round spot went to the team in seventh, VfL Wolfsburg. ==Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic== On 27 March 2020, the German Football Association (DFB) indefinitely postponed the semi-finals of the competition, originally scheduled for 21 and 22 April, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. On 24 April, the DFB also indefinitely postponed the final of the competition, originally scheduled for 23 May, with the goal of completing the competition by 30 June 2020. On 11 May 2020, the DFB Executive Committee approved a resumption of the competition, subject to political approval, using a hygiene concept similar to that implemented by the DFL in the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. The semi-finals would take place on 9 and 10 June, while the final would take place on 4 July 2020. However, the remaining matches were required to be played behind closed doors without any spectators. In addition, five substitutions were permitted for the remaining matches, with a sixth allowed in extra time, following a proposal from FIFA and approval by IFAB to lessen the impact of fixture congestion. ==Participating clubs== The following 64 teams qualified for the competition: {  - D6E2B3; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"width:33%\\"  Bundesliga the 18 clubs of the 2018‚Äì19 season  style=\\"width:33%\\"  2.

Participation The DFB- Pokal began with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, along with the top 4 finishers of the 3. Liga, automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots, 21 were given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the Verbandspokal. The 3 remaining slots were given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams, which was Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Westphalia. The best-placed amateur team of the Regionalliga Bayern was given the spot for Bavaria. For Lower Saxony, the Lower Saxony Cup was split into two paths: one for 3. Liga and Regionalliga Nord teams, and the other for amateur teams. The winners of each path qualified. For Westphalia, the winner of a play-off between the best-placed team of the Regionalliga West and Oberliga Westfalen also qualified. As every team was entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualified for the association cups, every team could in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Reserve teams and combined football sections were not permitted to enter, along with no two teams of the same association or corporation. Draw The draws for the different rounds were conducted as follows: For the first round, the participating teams were split into two pots of 32 teams each. The first pot contained all teams which had qualified through their regional cup competitions, the best four teams of the 3. Liga, and the bottom four teams of the 2. Bundesliga. Every team from this pot was drawn to a team from the second pot, which contained all remaining professional teams (all the teams of the Bundesliga and the remaining fourteen 2. Bundesliga teams). The teams from the first pot were set as the home team in the process. The two-pot scenario was also applied for the second round, with the remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) in the first pot and the remaining Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams in the other pot. Once again, the 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) served as hosts. This time the pots did not have to be of equal size though, depending on the results of the first round. Theoretically, it was even possible that there could be only one pot, if all of the teams from one of the pots from the first round beat all the others in the second pot. Once one pot was empty, the remaining pairings were drawn from the other pot, with the first-drawn team for a match serving as hosts. For the remaining rounds, the draw was conducted from just one pot. Any remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) were the home team if drawn against a professional team. In every other case, the first-drawn team served as hosts. Match rules Teams met in one game per round. Matches took place for 90 minutes, with two halves of 45 minutes. If still tied after regulation, 30 minutes of extra time were played, consisting of two periods of 15 minutes. If the score was still level after this, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. A coin toss decided who took the first penalty. The number of substitutes allowed on the bench was increased from seven to nine for the 2019‚Äì20 season. Initially, three substitutions were allowed during regulation, with a fourth allowed in extra time. From the round of 16 onward, a video assistant referee was appointed for all DFB-Pokal matches. Though technically possible, VAR was not be used for home matches of Bundesliga clubs prior to the round of 16 in order to provide a uniform approach to all matches. For the semi-finals and final, a maximum of five substitutions were allowed, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team only were given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half- time in extra time. Suspensions If a player would have received five yellow cards in the competition, he would have then been suspended from the next cup match. Similarly, receiving a second yellow card suspended a player from the next cup match. If a player receives a direct red card, they were suspended a minimum of one match, but the German Football Association reserves the right to increase the suspension. Champion qualification The winner of the DFB-Pokal typically earns automatic qualification for the group stage of next year's edition of the UEFA Europa League. If they had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League through position in the Bundesliga, then the spot would go to the team in sixth, and the league's second qualifying round spot would go to the team in seventh. The winner also typically hosts the DFL-Supercup at the start of the next season, facing the champion of the previous year's Bundesliga, unless the same team wins the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal, completing a double. In that case, the runner up of the Bundesliga takes the spot and hosts instead. ==Schedule== The Olympiastadion in Berlin hosted the final. All draws were generally held at the German Football Museum in Dortmund, on a Sunday evening at 18:00 after each round (unless noted otherwise). The draws were televised on ARD's Sportschau, broadcast on Das Erste. The rounds of the 2019‚Äì20 competition were scheduled as follows: {  - ! Round ! Draw date !

Built in 1864-65, its buildings are among the oldest in the city's North End, and a rare surviving example of a mid-19th- century facility for indigent women. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The buildings have been adapted to other uses. ==Description and history== The former Widows' Home is located in Hartford's northern Clay-Arsenal neighborhood, on the east side of North Main Street, opposite the Old North Cemetery between Mather and Pavilion Streets. It consists of two similar 3-1/2 story brick buildings, each covered by a side gable roof. Their facades are five bays wide, with sash windows set in rectangular openings that have brownstone sills and lintels. Each has an entrance at the center, sheltered by a rectangular hood with bracketed cornice. The doorways are framed by sidelight windows and a transom flanked by brackets. The buildings have retained some original interior features, including woodwork and fireplace surrounds. The Widows' Home was one of a significant number of social service welfare organizations established in Hartford in the mid-19th century. This charity was established with a bequest from Lawton Ives, a local textile manufacturer active in the city's civic, social, and religious affairs. He arranged for the land on which the structures were built to be transferred to the Pearl Street Congregational Church (which he helped found), and left a bequest for the cost of the buildings, which were completed in 1864 and 1865, before his death in 1867. The home was operated by a church committee until 1969, when changing demographics and increased maintenance costs prompted its closure. The buildings were acquired by the city, and have been converted into multiunit residences. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1864 Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Widows' Home"},{"id":"56087960","text":"Khadijeh Azadpour () is an Iranian female wushu athlete . == Wushu at the 2010 Asian Games == In Wushu at the 2010 Asian Games ‚Äì Women's sanda 60 kg Khadijeh Azadpour from Iran won the gold medal after beating W.

In 1878 he was in partnership with fellow architect Herbert Spurrell. During his time in Eastbourne he was responsible for the design of several local developments, including the Grand Hotel and the Leaf Hall. Leaf Hall, Eastbourne ==Major works== Leaf Hall in Eastbourne was designed and built in the continental gothic style in 1863‚Äì64 as a working men's institute for the philanthropist William Leaf. Its facilities included a coffee room, lending library and reading room, smoking room, skittle yard and a lecture room capable of seating 200 people. In the absence of a local theatre the hall was used for staging visiting shows, including General Tom Thumb in 1865. It now serves as a community arts centre and is a grade II listed building. Grand Hotel, Eastbourne The Grand Hotel at Eastbourne, built for local resident William Earp in 1877, is a 5-star luxury hotel with a 400-foot frontage facing the sea. It has 152 rooms, including 23 suites, 30 junior suites and 99 rooms and offers conference and banqueting facilities with 17 fully equipped conference and meeting rooms of varying size.

September bis 7. Oktober 1956, Katalog, Leipzig 1956. == Life ==  Provenance and training  Alfred Thiele was born in Leipzig. Carl Thiele (1859-1929), his father, was a book dealer. Alfred's initial training was in stonework and wood carving. Then between 1903 and 1908, he attended the Arts Academy (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst\\") in Leipzig. His teachers included Adolf Lehnert and Bruno H√©roux.  Artist  After a short stay in Munich Thiele returned to Leipzig and embarked on a career as a freelance artist. Starting in 1910, his work involved medallions and wall-mounted plaques. From 1911 he became more focused on figurines and participation in exhibitions. His early style reflected the naturalist and Jugendstil influences of the time, but during the 1920s he moved on through expressionism to so-called new realism. Influenced by Aristide Maillol and Wilhelm Lehmbruck, his artistic interest turned towards the presentation of physical movement and expressions of the human body. By 1928 he had become sufficiently well known to justify a newspaper headline that read \\"There is only one sculptor in Leipzig: Alfred Thiele!\\" (\\"Es gibt nur einen Bildhauer in Leipzig: Alfred Thiele!\\").Herwig Guratzsch (Hrsg.): Museum des bildenden K√ºnste Leipzig. Katalog der Bildwerke, K√∂ln 1999, S. 61. During the 1930s he began to apply the skills acquired working on small figures to much larger figures. Thiele applies his outstanding powers of observation, his sense for movement and other specialist abilities to developing a mastery of animal sculptures. Some of his designs were reproduced on an industrial scale by the Schaubach firm, offered as both glazed and unglazed porcelain figures. He also applied himself to statues other adornments for monumental grave stones.  Teacher  As a teacher, and later as director for sculpture classes at the Leipzig Arts Academy between 1921 and 1953, Thiele exercised a great influence. One example (among many) was setting up a close collaborative relationship between the academy and the city zoo which created a tradition of animal sculpture in Leipzig which endures to this day. His pupils, in both a narrow and a broader sense, included Max Alfred Brumme, Hellmuth Chemnitz, Kurt Kluge, Rudolf Oelzner, Alfred Sabisch, Fritz Zalisz, Walter Arnold, Elfriede Ducke, Gisela Richter- Thiele, Hans-Joachim F√∂rster, Bruno Kubas, Gunter Morgner, Rolf Nagel and Rolf Szymanski. == Output (selection) == Herfurthsche Villa Park, 1939 * 1917 Tanzender weiblicher Akt, Bronze auf Serpentinsockel * 1918 Portr√§trelief Karl Kaiser und K√∂nig von √ñsterreich-Ungarn, Bronze * 1919 Fliehende Daphne, Bronze auf Marmorsockel * 1919 Kriegerdenkmal, Leisnig * 1920 Majolikarelief Grabst√§tte Degener, S√ºdfriedhof Leipzig * 1921 Frauenkopf, fr√§nkischer Muschelkalk * 1921 Portr√§trelief Wilhelm Felsche, Bronze * 1924 Figur Seele, Bronze * 1924 Hockender Akt, Bronze * 1924 Trampeltier, Bronze * 1925 L√∂we, Bronze auf Marmorsockel * 1925 Sitzende, Bronze * 1925 Anbetende, Bronze auf Muschelkalksockel * 1926 Leopard, an der Pfote leckend, Bronze * 1927 Springender Hengst, Bronze auf Holzsockel * 1927 Portr√§trelief Arthur Hantzsch, Bronze * 1928 Laufendes Dromedar, Bronze auf Marmorplinthe * 1928 Bildnisk√∂pfe in Terrakotta mit leichter Einf√§rbung von Haar und Lippen * 1929 Schlafender L√∂we, Grabst√§tte Wetzold, fr√§nkischer Muschelkalkstein, S√ºdfriedhof Leipzig * 1929 Sinnende, Zementguss, Grassimuseum Leipzig * 1929 Schreitende, Bronze (from 2012: Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst, Leipzig) * 1932 Liegendes Gnu, Bronze * 1933 Lautenspielerin, Zementguss * 1933 Portr√§trelief Julius Klengel, Bronze * 1936 Johannisfigur am Johannishospital in Leipzig * 1937 Korbtragende Frau, Kolossalstatue, Wohnhaus Johannisplatz, Leipzig * 1938 Polospieler, Bronze * 1938 Nach abgeworfenem Speer, Bronze * 1938 Liegender Baisabock, Bronze * 1938 Panther, an Pfote leckend, Bronze * 1938 Liegender Tiger, Bronze * 1941 Der Morgen, Bronze * 1941 Pelikan, Bronze * 1942 Liegender Gepard, Bronze auf Muschelkalksockel * 1947 Stehende, Bronze * 1948 Witternder Tiger, Bronze * 1949 Kumpel vor der Einfahrt, Bronze * 1949 Laufende Giraffe, Bronze * 1950 Relief Arbeit und Handel, Messehofpassage Leipzig * 1953‚Äì55 Bauplastik, Ringbebauung Rossplatz, Leipzig * 1956 Liegendes Guanako, Bronze ==References== Category:Artists from Leipzig Category:German sculptors Category:1886 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig alumni ","title":"Alfred Thiele"},{"id":"56088087","text":"Francesco Caramora was the master goldsmith who gave rise to the successful artistic and artisanal tradition in Valenza. Caramora was born in Pavia in 1787. He learned the goldsmith's art in neighbouring Voghera and went into business with an uncle running a shop selling gold artefacts. In 1817 he married Giuseppa Tremolada and moved to Valenza, a quiet agricultural village at the time, where he set up his own business as a master goldsmith. In 1825 he registered the first mark in the history of Valenza goldsmithing at the Alessandria Trademark Office. The mark bore his initials separated by a drawing of the half-moon. In 1826 he purchased a farm surrounded by land, just outside Valenza: he lived here, and we assume he also had part of his workshop here. The building must be the ‚ÄúGoldsmith's Farm‚Äù we find recorded on the Napoleonic maps of 1875: in those days Francesco Caramora was the only goldsmith in Valenza, so it is more than likely that the nondescript farm became known as the ‚Äúcasceina d‚Äô urei‚Äù, the ‚Äúgoldsmith's farm‚Äù in local dialect. By opening his workshop and training two apprentices, he started a process that transformed Valenza into the world-renowned City of Gold. Francesco Caramora died prematurely in 1827, leaving insufficient assets to cover his debts. His estate was auctioned and was bought nearly entirely by his apprentice Piero Canti, who also took over from Francesco Caramora in his workshop. Continuing to establish Valenza's unique position in goldsmithing, he taught his art to other workers. == Sources == *Gioielli e gioiellieri di Valenza / Lia lenti.

The base is the current home of the B-2 Spirit bomber. ==History== World War II In 1942, the U.S. Army Air Corps selected the site of the present-day base to be the home of Sedalia Glider Base, a training base for WACO glider pilots. In May 1942, construction workers began building a railroad spur for the new air base in an area known to locals as the \\"Blue Flats\\" because of the color of the soil. The new railroad line was built by the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The base was officially opened on 6 August 1942. On 12 November 1942, the name was changed to Sedalia Army Air Field. After the end of World War II, operations at the airfield declined, and many of the buildings were abandoned. In December 1947, the base was put on inactive status. 340th Bomb Wing In August 1951, the base was renamed again, to Sedalia Air Force Base, as it was now part of the United States' newest military service branch, the US Air Force. In October 1952, the base was turned over to the 340th Bomb Wing. Improvements were made to the 1942 runway, as well as other base facilities, and Strategic Air Command (SAC) scheduled the base to receive squadrons flying the B-47 Stratojet and the KC-97 Stratofreighter. The first B-47 landed at the base in March 1954. On 3 December 1955, the base was renamed Whiteman Air Force Base in honor of 2nd Lt. George A. Whiteman, an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while attempting to take off from Bellows Field. Whiteman was born in Longwood, Missouri, and graduated from Smith-Cotton High School in Sedalia, less than 20 miles from the base that would bear his name. ICBM era In 1963, Whiteman AFB transitioned from being a bomber base to a missile base. SAC activated the 351st Strategic Missile Wing at Whiteman on February 1. On September 1, the remnants of the 340th Bomb Wing were transferred to Bergstrom AFB in Texas. The transition to missile base required a massive construction project. 867,000 cubic yards of earth and rock were excavated to make room for underground launch facilities and 15 launch control centers. 168,000 yards of concrete, 25,355 tons of reinforcing steel, and 15,120 tons of structural steel were used in the effort, and a vast underground intersite cable network was installed. The 351st employed the LGM-30 Minuteman weapons system, an ICBM capable of hitting targets up to 4300 miles away. In the mid-1960s, the Minuteman I missiles were swapped out in favor of the Minuteman II, an ICBM with increased range and an improved guidance system. In the 1980s, Whiteman AFB became the first missile base to field an all-female Minuteman missile crew, as well as the first male and female Minuteman crew. B-2 era At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a drawdown of nuclear arms via two treaties: the INF Treaty and START I. This would lead to the eventual phase-out of the Minuteman II systems at Whiteman, and put the future of the base in question. On Jan. 5, 1987, Ike Skelton, a Congressman representing Missouri's 4th district, announced that Whiteman AFB would be the home of the USAF's new Advanced Technology Bomber, which would eventually be called the B-2 Spirit. On Nov. 30, 1988, SAC announced that the 509th Bomb Wing would become the nation's first operational B-2 bomber unit. On Dec. 17, 1993, Whiteman's first B-2 touched down on the runway. 21 B-2s would eventually be produced, 20 of which are still operational. All 20 are based at Whiteman. == Based units == Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Whiteman, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.

The building was built between 1912 and 1914. The ground floor of the building contains the Beyoƒülu T√ºnel station, which is the northern terminus of the historic long funicular railway. The building gets its name from the railway itself; as Metro Han can be translated to Metro House or Metro Building. ==History== When Beyoƒülu station was under construction between 1871 and 1874, plans to construct a 5-story hotel building above the station were drawn out by chief engineer of the project, Eug√®ne-Henri Gavand. However, when Gavand's shares in the railway were bought out, his plans for a hotel were also scrapped. The ground floor of the Metrohan building was the original Beyoƒülu station structure, which opened in 1875. The original structure consisted of a wooden A-frame roof on top of the ground floor stone structure that exists today. In 1911, a Belgium company SOFINA bought the operating rights of the railway and needed a central office in Istanbul, known at the time as Constantinople. Plans to build a 6-story office building on top of Beyoƒülu station were drawn up in Charleroi, Belgium by Turkish-Armenian architect Mikayel Nurican and construction began in 1912. The original office building consisted of 4 floors (including the ground floor) with a smaller 2-story tower at the top. The building was completed in 1914 and became the headquarters of T√ºnel operations. In 1928, the 2-story tower was expanded as 2 extra floors and a 7th floor was constructed on top, bringing the building to its current height and shape. Istanbul Elektrik, Tramvay ve T√ºnel ƒ∞≈ületmeleri (I.E.T.T.) bought the T√ºnel railway as well as the Metrohan building and began using it as their own general headquarters. IETT kept their headquarters in the building until 1983, when they moved to a newer building on top of Karak√∂y station.

Accessed June 5, 2020. He holds an AB and a PhD in political economy and government from Harvard University, as well as an MA in economics from Stanford University. He teaches at New York University and is the co-author, with Martin L. Weitzman, of Climate Shock, a Top 15 Financial Times-McKinsey Business Book of the Year 2015. He is married to Siripanth Nippita, a gynecologist at Harvard Medical School. == Climate and energy policy == Wagner was an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund from 2008 to 2014 and lead senior economist from 2014 to 2016. While there he was a member of the faculty of the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, and he wrote Climate Shock (2015), a book emphasizing the importance of risk and uncertainty for prompting action on climate change. Wagner was a member of the six-person lead author team, including Suzi Kerr, that wrote the World Bank's Emissions Trading in Practice : A Handbook on Design and Implementation. \\"Risk\\" and \\"uncertainty\\" in climate change are often mentioned as reasons to delay action. Wagner's Climate Shock, joint with Martin Weitzman, emphasizes that the \\"known unknowns\\" and potential \\"unknown unknowns\\" instead increase the need for action. This contrasts with work done, for example, by economists Bill Nordhaus, Richard Tol, and others. Nordhaus, in turn, favorably reviewed Wagner and Weitzman's book in the New York Review of Books. Wagner's latest academic work on this topic, joint with Kent Daniel of Columbia University and Bob Litterman of Kepos Capital further emphasizes the importance of pricing climate risk and uncertainty. == Geoengineering == Wagner was the founding co-director, joint with David Keith, of Harvard's Solar Geoengineering Research Program founded in 2017. His geoengineering research focuses on economics, governance, policy, and public perception, including the chemtrails conspiracy theory. Together with Dustin Tingley, Wagner finds that in a U.S. public opinion survey conducted in October 2016, 30 to 40% of the U.S. public believed in a version of the conspiracy. The paper also describes what the authors call a \\"community of conspiracy\\" in online discourse, in particular on Twitter and other anonymous social media. On November 23, 2018, Wagner published an open-access article on \\"Stratospheric aerosol injection tactics and costs in the first 15 years of deployment.\\" The article was picked up in a questionable report by CNN, claiming that: \\"Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere.\\" == Books == Gernot Wagner has written three books: * 2003: Der Rest der Welt.

First public release. Second wave Circa Dec 2017. Current production version. Changes from the first wave include: ambidextrous bolt release, redesigned upper receiver, redesigned brass deflector, redesigned BCL logo, redesigned bolt catch, addition of a trigger guard lowering gate, and flared magazine well. This wave also reportedly has a modified ejection window and dust cover that allows the operator to slide the cover open without having to pull the bolt backwards. At some later point (unclear date), the charge handle was replaced by an ambidextrous in-house model. The stock was also changed to a \\"Captain Hook\\" style. The barrel nut now has lightening holes in it. Third wave No official details or plans as of Dec 2017. BCL has neither confirmed or denied any plans for future generations/iterations of the 7.62mm/.308 BCL 102.

He was a member of the ≈Åado≈õ Group also called as ≈Åado≈õ Group and played a crucial role in illegal manufacturing of thousands of Latin American passports to save Jews from the Holocaust. ==Early life and diplomatic career== Ryniewicz was born in Tarnopol, south-east Poland, today west Ukraine. He attended a secondary school in Lw√≥w. In the late 1920s, he married Zofia n√©e Zasadni. The couple had two sons: Jan Christian (1931-1989) and Tomasz Maria (1934-1983). The descendants of Ryniewicz live today in Argentina and the United States. In 1928 Ryniewicz began his work as an employee and then as head of the consular department of the Polish Legation in Bern, where he worked until 1933. After that, he was an employee in the office of Polish Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck and from 1935 to 1938 he was consul and head of the consular department of the Polish Legation in Riga, Latvia. On December 28, 1936, he was one of the passengers of PLL LOT's Lockheed Electra, which crashed near Susiec killing three people. Ryniewicz ‚Äì injured ‚Äì survived the accident. Between December 1938 and July 1945, he again worked in the Polish Legation in Bern - first as the First Secretary and then as Counsellor. In the years 1940-45 he was deputy head of mission and close collaborator of minister Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ. ==≈Åado≈õ Group and Latin American passport ‚Äòaffair‚Äô== Ryniewicz and his subordinates Konstanty Rokicki and Juliusz K√ºhl are supposed to have invented the Latin American passport scheme ‚Äì a way to rescue Jews stranded in the ghettoes in German-occupied Poland. They successfully convinced Jewish leaders from Switzerland ‚Äì Abraham Silberschein and Chaim Eiss to finance the operation. Thanks to the Paraguayan passports produced by the Polish diplomats, their owners were able to survive the dissolution of the ghettos - they were not taken to [Extermination camp extermination camps] but rather to internment camps in France and Germany, where they could be exchanged for Germans interned in Allied states. The blank passports were bought from the honorary consul of Paraguay, Bernese notary Rudolf H√ºggli. Juliusz K√ºhl would bring them to the Polish Consular Section at Thunstrasse 21, where they were filled out by viceconsul Konstanty Rokicki with the names of Polish, German and Dutch Jews. Passport details - the lists of names with photos - were smuggled by Silberschein and Eiss. Ryniewicz and his superior Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ provided diplomatic protection for the entire operation and intervened with the Swiss authorities and diplomatic corps.Julius K√ºhl‚Äôs interrogation, 22.05.1944, Federal Archives in Bern According to journalists Zbigniew Parafianowicz and Micha≈Ç Potocki, the German authorities did not investigate the operation until they had intercepted the last packet of forged passports following the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Another theory claims that one of the passport bearers tried to escape to Paraguay and alarmed its authorities which ‚Äì in their turn ‚Äì cancelled all passports signed by H√ºgli and informed in December 1943 the Nazi German government. The activity of the ≈Åado≈õ Group was probably known to the Swiss police already in late 1942. In January 1943 the Swiss police interrogated H√ºggli and after a few months also Eiss and Silberschein. They all admitted that the Paraguayan passports were produced by the legation of Poland and pointed at Ryniewicz and/or Rokicki.Rudolf H√ºgli‚Äôs interrogation, 1/18/1943, Federal Archives in BernChaim Eiss‚Äôs interrogation, 14.05.1943, Federal Archives in BernAbraham Silberschein‚Äôs interrogation, 9/1/1943, Federal Archives in Bern After the group was uncovered by the police, Ryniewicz intervened with the head of Swiss police Heinrich Rothmund, who, at that time, was considered the main architect of the Swiss refugee policy. Although Rothmund underlined his strongly negative attitude to the operation in an interview with Ryniewicz (\\"I have very energetically explained to him the dangerousness and untenability of passport maneuvers.\\").,Heinrich Rothmund‚Äôs note one meeting with Stefan Ryniewicz, 9/6/1943, Federal Archives in Bern Silberschein was released from custody and the Polish diplomats were not held accountable. The meeting between ≈Åado≈õ and the Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz could have also helped in the matter.note of Marcel Pilet- Golaz on exchange with A.Lados, 10/13/1943, Federal Archives in Bern In early 1944, the Germans deported most of the holders of Paraguayan passports from the internment camp in Vittel to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were murdered. Poland and the Holy See called on the government of Paraguay and other Latin American governments to temporarily recognize the passports. After a long hesitation Salvador and Paraguay responded positively to this request, which was probably crucial for rescuing hundreds of passport holders who were still in the Bergen-Belsen internment camp. The exact number of people rescued thanks to the ≈Åado≈õ Group, including Stefan Ryniewicz, is unknown. According to Agudat Yisrael, one can speak of \\"several hundred persons\\".Harry A. Goodmann‚Äôs letter to Polish MFA, 1/2/1945, the Sikorski Institute, London., while the journalists Zbigniew Parafianowicz and Micha≈Ç Potocki estimate the number of rescued to be 400 people.\\").Zbigniew Parafianowicz, Micha≈Ç Potocki: Forgotten righteous. How Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ saved lives of hundreds of Jews, \\"Dziennik Gazeta Prawna\\", 8/8/2017 These people were mostly religious Jews who barely had any chance of surviving in the Holocaust. The legend of the Latin American passports was widespread in the Warsaw ghetto and they were even the subject of the poem \\"Passports\\" by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szlengel. The role that the Polish Legation in Bern played in the production of passports was hardly known. The participation of Ryniewicz and Rokicki in the operation was only proven in August 2017 by the journalists of Dziennik Gazeta Prawna (Poland) and The Globe and Mail (Canada). ==Later life== When the Polish Embassy in Bern was taken over by the pro-communist Government of Poland, Ryniewicz resigned from diplomatic work and remained loyal to the Polish government-in- exile. Later Ryniewicz moved to Argentina, where he became the chairman of the Polish Club (Club Polaco) in Buenos Aires. At the same time he was a businessman and activist of the Polish diaspora. On December 31, 1972 Ryniewicz was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. The certificate signed by the President Stanis≈Çaw Ostrowski does not contain an explanation. Ryniewicz died in Buenos Aires in 9 March 1988 and was buried in the cemetery in Boulogne Sur Mer. ==Yad Vashem Controversy== In April 2019 the Yad Vashem's Righteous Among The Nations granted the title to Konstanty Rokicki and offered \\"appreciation\\" to Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ and Stefan Ryniewicz arguing that Rokicki headed the ≈Åado≈õ Group. The document erroneously called ≈Åado≈õ and Ryniewicz \\"consuls\\". The decision sparked outrage and frustration among the family members of the two other late Polish diplomats, and among survivors. Thirty one of them signed an open letter to Yad Vashem. Rokicki's cousin refused to accept the medal until two other Polish diplomats, Rokicki's superiors ≈Åado≈õ and Ryniewicz are recognized as Righteous Among The Nations, too. Polish Ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch who contributed to the discovery of Rokicki also refuted the Yad Vashem's interpretation stating that Rokicki worked under ≈Åado≈õ and Ryniewicz. ==See also== * ≈Åado≈õ Group * Raoul Wallenberg ==Literature== * Agnieszka Haska - Proszƒô Pana Ministra o energicznƒÖ interwencjƒô.

Litterman received a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1980. == Black-Litterman model == At Goldman Sachs Litterman developed the Black‚ÄìLitterman model together with Fischer Black in 1990. The model solves a seemingly simple yet perplexing problem: it is difficult to consistently estimate expected returns from various assets. The Black‚ÄìLitterman model solves this problem by making expected returns an output, rather than an input, in the model. The model combines information from market equilibrium with views about returns of assets or combinations of assets, in order to generate the expected returns. The Black‚ÄìLitterman model has become one of the standard models widely used by investors around the world to optimize portfolios. Litterman is the author of Modern Investment Management: An Equilibrium Approach, together with Goldman Sachs Asset Management's Quantitative Resources Group. == Climate policy work == Shortly after retiring from Goldman Sachs in 2009, Litterman moved, together with several other former Goldman partners such as Mark Tercek and Larry Linden, into the climate and environmental policy world. (Tercek is now the present and CEO of The Nature Conservancy. Linden is the founder of the Linden Trust for the Environment, donating to several climate and environmental causes.) Litterman serves as director of the World Wildlife Fund, Resources for the Future and Climate Central. He also serves on the economic advisory council of the Environmental Defense Fund, and he serves on the boards of the Julie Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University, the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University, the Heller Hurwicz Economics Institute at the University of Minnesota, the Commonfund, and the Climate Leadership Council, founded by Ted Halstead. Litterman is a staunch advocate for a carbon tax. He created the EZ Climate carbon pricing model, joint with Columbia University's Kent Daniel and Gernot Wagner. He leads the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-market- risks/u-s-regulator-to-report-on-climate-risks-to-markets-in-july- idUSKBN23I3AK == References == Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American economists Category:Goldman Sachs people Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Date of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Robert Litterman"},{"id":"56089396","text":"Afroedura langi, also known as Lang's rock gecko, Lang's flat gecko, or Lowveld flat gecko, is a species of African gecko found in South Africa and Mozambique. ==References== langi Category:Reptiles of Mozambique Category:Reptiles of South Africa Category:Taxa named by Vivian Frederick Maynard FitzSimons Category:Reptiles described in 1930 ","title":"Afroedura langi"},{"id":"56089419","text":"Campus is a 2004 Tamil teen film directed by Sharvi, who had previously directed the Malayalam film Gaandhiyan (1999).

From 1314, Louis IV was the Roman-German king. After 1340, however, the German electors increasingly distanced themselves from Louis and in 1346 elected Charles IV as counter-king. The election of Charles IV marked the beginning of a civil war between king and counter-king. On the side of Charles were the Archbishop of Trier, Baldwin, and the Archbishop of Cologne, Walram. Louis's allies included the Limburg dynasty of Gerlach and Reinhard of Westerburg. In the course of these disputes, Reinhard captured Grenzau Castle in the Westerwald mountains. When they attempted to recapture the castle, the troops of Koblenz were ambushed. Following the massacre of 172 Koblenz citizens, Reinhard had to escape and fled to Gerlach at Limburg Castle. Now the Lords of Limburg had the castle as a fiefdom, one third each from the Empire, the Landgrave of Hesse and the Archbishop of Trier. Baldwin advanced on the castle in Limburg and demanded that it was opened, citing the feudal treaty. But Gerlach rejected this, because he was only obliged to remain loyal to Baldwin if the feud did not go against the Reich, the Archbishop and the Landgrave. Baldwin withdrew, leaving it as unfinished business. == Literatur == * Hellmuth Gensicke: Selbstbehauptung im Westerwald. In: Franz-Josef Heyen (ed.): Balduin von Luxemburg.

Iwu herself had been sexually harassed in front of people at a political event where no one called out the behavior. Iwu approached her close colleague Samantha Corbin to help pen a bipartisan letter that was published on October 17, 2017 alongside an article in the Los Angeles Times. with over 140 signatories. The letter was signed by California Capitol staff, legislators, lobbyists, and political consultants. It brought attention to the culture of sexual harassment they faced at work. The We Said Enough letter became the first open statement by women working in politics calling out a pervasive culture of harassment and abuse within a capitol community. During the initial launch of its letter, We Said Enough organizers released a series of stories that victims and survivors of harassment and sexual violence had submitted to the We Said Enough website. We Said Enough has stated it wants to increase protections for victims and improve due process in order to hold those who harass others in the workplace accountable. We Said Enough has outlined several reforms to make the California Capitol a safer place to work. This includes asking for a confidential hotline for victims to report abuse and \\"whistleblower\\" protections for Capitol employees. Additionally, We Said Enough has also been asking questions about how the process of investigating sexual harassment are conducted.

Since July 2013, he has been the lead attorney of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. ==Education and personal life== Wizner was born in 1971 in New Haven, Connecticut, and grew up on the campus of Yale University, where his father, Stephen Wizner, is a professor of law at Yale Law School and his mother is a dean. He has described being drawn to social justice work from at least as early as high school; after graduating Harvard College in 1993, he worked for an organization that provided legal assistance to homeless and near-homeless people. At New York University School of Law, he planned to work in legal services for impoverished communities, and on capital punishment cases. After graduating, he clerked for judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. ==Career== Wizner began working for the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles in August 2001, initially focusing on prison reform. Following the September 11 attacks, Wizner's focus shifted to civil liberties issues relating to U.S. national security. Around 2004, he moved to the ACLU's headquarters in New York City. There, he argued legal cases relating to airport security, government watchlists, surveillance practices, targeted killing, extraordinary rendition, and torture. He made several trips to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Many of the cases Wizner took were dismissed; he later commented that \\"on the worst days, I believed that what we were doing ... wasn't litigation in the traditional sense. It wasn't trying to get a court to do something, it was creating a record so that ... people would be able to look back and decide whether it had been the right decision or a disastrous decision.\\" Starting in 2005, Wizner represented Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen arrested while travelling in Macedonia on suspicion of links to Al Qaeda, who was held by the CIA at a black site in Afghanistan for five months, despite evidence that he was the wrong person. El-Masri's suit was dismissed in the U.S. on grounds of state secrecy, though the CIA ultimately admitted to making a mistake, in a report released by the U.S. Senate. The European Court of Human Rights ruled against Macedonia in the case. In 2011, Wizner became director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Wizner is an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law. He is a contributor to the website Lawfare, has written for Time, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and several other media outlets, and has testified before the U.S. Congress. He has regularly appeared on television news and analysis programs, including Democracy Now!, Meet the Press, and Politicking with Larry King. Work with Snowden In 2013, Edward Snowden contacted journalist Glenn Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras, longtime acquaintances of Wizner, about releasing classified information on NSA programs. Poitras consulted with Wizner before travelling to meet Snowden in Hong Kong. Greenwald later put Wizner into contact with Snowden in July 2013, when Snowden was stranded in the transit zone in Moscow, his passport having been revoked by the U.S. Government. Wizner and Snowden exchanged encrypted communications during this time. Snowden's legal team also includes Jesselyn Radack, an advocate for whistleblowers; Wolfgang Kaleck, a European attorney; and attorneys with expertise in criminal and asylum law. The team works pro bono to ensure Snowden's continued freedom and ability to contribute to the public conversation he began with his disclosures. Wizner describes being a \\"gatekeeper\\" of media requests for Snowden. He has said that be believes Snowden will return to the U.S. eventually. Wizner has called the Snowden case \\"the work of a lifetime\\" and \\"not traditional legal work, by any means\\". He had previously spent a decade trying to bring cases against U.S. intelligence agencies, with these cases often dismissed for lack of standing. With Snowden's revelations about Verizon delivering metadata to the U.S. government, the ACLU had standing to sue. ==Public comments== Wizner has defended a right to privacy, and has been critical of the use of extensive surveillance to enforce law. He has highlighted the role of lawbreaking in positive social change, pointing to the LGBT civil rights movement and drug prohibition as areas where illegal activities have contributed to positive changes in the law and public opinion. In speaking on the U.S. intelligence apparatus, he has said that \\"the NSA is not uniquely evil, it's uniquely capable.\\" Wizner has forcefully defended Snowden against calls for his punishment, stating that he broke the law for the public good, and noting that no elected officials have been held criminally liable for torture and other human rights violations since 9/11. Following the April 2019 arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London's Ecuadorian Embassy, Ben Wizner said that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \\"for violating U.S. secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\\" ==References== Category:American Civil Liberties Union people Category:American civil rights lawyers Category:Edward Snowden Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:Harvard University alumni Category:New York University School of Law alumni Category:1971 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ben Wizner"},{"id":"56089813","text":"Plasmodium caucasica is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Sauramoeba.

Syria's Afrin District fell under the control of the People's Protection Units (YPG) around 2012 and an \\"Afrin Canton\\" (now Afrin Region) was declared in 2014. Afrin Canton in its latest form was established in 2017, however, as part of the reorganisation of Rojava's subdivisions. With Afrin as its administrative centre, the canton was part of the larger Afrin Region. As a result of Operation Olive Branch in early 2018, Afrin Canton became part of the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. The government of the Afrin Region now administers only the area around Tell Rifaat. == Demographics == The population of the Afrin Canton area was overwhelmingly ethnic Kurdish, to the degree that the canton had been described as \\"homogeneously Kurdish\\". The overall population of Afrin Canton, based on the 2004 Syrian census, was about 200,000. Cities and towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are Afrin (36,562) and Jindires (13,661). Throughout the course of the Syrian Civil War, Afrin Canton served as a safe haven for refugees of all ethnicities, fleeing violence and destruction from civil war factions, in particular the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the diverse more or less Islamist rebel groups of the Syrian opposition. According to a June 2016 estimate from the International Middle East Peace Research Center, about 316,000 displaced Syrians of Kurdish, Yazidi, Arab and Turkmen ethnicity lived in Afrin Canton at the time. ==History== According to Ren√© Dussaud, the area of Kurd-Dagh and the plain near Antioch were settled by Kurds since antiquity. Stefan Sperl says that there is reason to believe that Kurdish settlements in the Kurd Mountains go back to the Seleucid Empire, since those regions stood in the path to Antioch; Kurds in the early periods served as mercenaries and mounted archers. In any case, the Kurd Mountains were already Kurdish-inhabited when the Crusades broke out at the end of the 11th century. The area around Afrin developed as the center of a distinctive Sufi \\"Kurdish Islam\\". In modern post- independence Syria, the Kurdish society of the canton was subject to heavy- handed Arabization policies by the Damascus government. In the course of the Syrian civil war, Damascus government forces pulled back from the canton in spring 2012 to give way to the People's Protection Units (YPG) and autonomous self-governemnt under the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, which was formally declared on 29 January 2014. Until 2018, violence in Afrin was minor, involving artillery shelling by Islamist rebel groups as well as by Islamist-governed Turkey. Turkish soldiers and SNA fighters at the building in Afrin that had hosted the PYD-led government of the region, 18 March 2018 Afrin Canton was captured by the Turkish Land Forces and Syrian National Army (SNA) as result of the 2018 Afrin offensive. Tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees fled from Afrin City before its capture by the SNA in March 2018,https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/kurds-locked-out-afrin-ghouta- refugees-take-their-placehttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/too- many-strange-faces-kurds-fear-forced-demographic-shift-in-afrin and the YPG vowed to retake it. The YPG subsequently announced its intention to start a guerrilla war in Afrin Canton, leading to the SDF insurgency in Northern Aleppo. == Economy == Aleppo soap A diverse agricultural production was at the heart of the Afrin Canton's economy, traditionally olives in particular, and more recently there was a focus on increasing wheat production. A well-known product from the area is Aleppo soap, a hard soap made from olive oil and lye, distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil. While Afrin Canton has been the source of olive oil for Aleppo soap since antiquity, the destruction caused by the Syrian Civil War to other parts of Aleppo governorate increasingly made the entire production chains locate in Afrin Canton. At the height of the fighting for Aleppo, up to 50 percent of the city's industrial production was moved to Afrin Canton. As of early 2016, two million pairs of jeans were produced per month and exported across Syria. In January 2017, 400 textile industry workshops counted 17,000 employees, supplying the whole of Syria. Afrin Canton was under a blockade imposed by neighbouring Turkey, which placed high burdens on international import and export. For example, transportation of Aleppo soap to international markets, as far as possible at all, had at least four times the transportation cost as compared to pre-war years. In 2015 there were 32 tons of Aleppo soap produced and exported to other parts of Syria, but also to international markets.  Tourism  Afrin District also served as a center for domestic tourism due to its beautiful landscapes. Syrians continued to travel to the region for recreational purposes after the formation of Afrin Region, and later Afrin Canton. The tourism was however somewhat constricted due to the YPG's tight control of the borders, and the war; local tourism mostly collapsed during the Turkish invasion of 2018. == Education == Like in the other Rojava cantons, primary education in the public schools is initially by mother tongue instruction either Kurdish or Arabic, with the aim of bilingualism in Kurdish and Arabic in secondary schooling. Curricula are a topic of continuous debate between the canton' Boards of Education and the Syrian central government in Damascus, which partly pays the teachers. The federal, regional and local administrations in Rojava put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities. Afrin Canton had an institution of higher education, the University of Afrin, founded in 2015. After teaching three programs (Electromechanical Engineering, Kurdish Literature and Economy) in the first academic year, the second academic year with an increased 22 professors and 250 students has three additional programs (Human Medicine, Journalism and Agricultural Engineering). The university was closed after the Turkish invasion; its students were able to follow up on their studies at the Rojava University in Qamishli. ==See also== *Federalization of Syria *Rojava conflict *Rojava *Afrin Region *Jazira Region ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Map of majority ethnicities in Syria by Gulf2000 project of Columbia university Category:Afrin Region Category:Autonomous regions Category:Aleppo Governorate Category:States and territories established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in Syria Category:States and territories disestablished in 2018 ","title":"Afrin Canton"},{"id":"56089870","text":"Us with Italy (, NcI) is a centre-right, Christian-democratic, liberal- conservative federation of political parties in Italy.

(Fare), Popular Construction (CP) and the Movement for the Autonomies (MpA). Other centre- right parties, notably including IdeA, chose not to join. On 29 December 2017 NcI signed a pact with the Union of the Centre (UdC). On 5 January 2018 it was the turn of IdeA, which was convinced to join by enhancement of the federative character and the Christian-democratic identity of NcI. On 11 January a new symbol of NcI, containing also UdC's crossed shield, was unveiled. In the election NcI obtained a mere 1.3% of the vote and four deputies from single- seat constituencies: Costa, Lupi, Alessandro Colucci and Renzo Tondo. The first three were former members of AP, while the fourth was a member of Responsible Autonomy, a party in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and DI. The list also featured four senators elected, three of the UdC and one of IdeA. Soon after the election, both the UdC and IdeA left the alliance to form a pact with FI. In mid April 2018 Costa also left the NcI and re-joined FI. In December 2018 Fitto led DI out of NcI, announcing its end. However, NcI continued to exist as a sub-group within the Mixed Group of Chamber of Deputies. ==Composition== Founding members {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - !colspan=2Party !Main ideology !Leader/s -  bgcolor=   Direction Italy  Liberal conservatism  Raffaele Fitto -  bgcolor=   Civic Choice  Liberalism  Enrico Zanetti -  bgcolor=\\"#FFFA00\\"   Act!

As a painter Aravindan has drawn out his early childhood memories and Varada uses it to find clues to the whereabouts of Aravindan's mother. Janaki reveals to Varada that for a new dance show in the U.S, the theme would be motherhood, which makes Varada suspicious as her previous themes were based on Faith and Love. Varada finds out from a student that Janaki was married at a very young age and also had a son. She left her husband as he forced her to stop dancing. Whereabouts about her son are unknown. Varada finds clues from Janaki's past in Udupi, where Aravindan is supposed to hail from.

Varada discovers that Geetalakshmi is married now to another family and is not willing to take back her son, even though she is resentful about leaving him at a Children's home (from where Aravindan strays away in search of his mother) before leaving for home, as she was then a student from a low class family and whose parents refused to accept that she has a child. The story climaxes when Geetalakshmi visits Mookambika with her family in secret search for Aravindan and making it possible for Aravindan to see the Mookambika Goddess for the first time with his mother while Varada is performing her debutante dance. == Cast == *Vineeth Sreenivasan as Aravindan *Sreenivasan as Madhavan *Nikhila Vimal as Varada *Urvashi as Girija, Varada's Mother *Shanthi Krishna as Geethalakshmi, Aravindan's Mother *Aju Varghese as Rasheed *Premkumar as Venu, Varada's Uncle *K.

Overall she stated, \\"the composer plays around with many new voices too in the soundtrack, and all of them sound promising as well\\". ==Release and reception== Aravindante Athidhikal was released across theaters in India on 27 April 2018.

Sify has written that \\"Aravindante Athidikal is a nice journey that would make the viewer come out of the theatres with a smile\\", and praised the cinematographer and music director, saying that \\"the film succeeds in giving an experience of visiting the holy temple and the premises, with its nice visuals\\" and \\"one of the highlights of the film is its superb music by Shaan Rahman\\". Deepa Soman of The Times of India gave the film a rating of three out of five and has written that \\"Aravindante Adhithikal can impress those looking for a nostalgic, vintage- style movie and those who strongly believe that a story doesn‚Äôt have to raise further questions\\". She stated that Vineeth performs \\"his usual self in the film\\", Nikhila \\"gives a good performance, especially in the subtly comical scenes\\", and praised Urvashi, saying that her \\"performance gives out such a feel in certain instances\\". Amrutha Menon of Malayala Manorama rated the movie three and a half out of five, and praised the music stating \\"Shaan Rahman's mellifluous music that largely breathes life into the plot is also something worth mentioning\\". She said, \\"Aravindante Athidhikal is a feel good-movie with good story line and beautiful frames. The film will keep you engrossed as it shares with us a small, yet a beautiful story, captured in an emotional way that touches the viewers\\". Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost wrote, \\"Aravindante Athidhikal‚Äôs lack of inventiveness gives it a dated feel that is redeemed somewhat by the music. To be fair, the film is not unpleasant. It is simply plain.\\" K. R. Rejeesh of Nowrunning gave the film a rating of two and a half out of five, saying \\"Aravindante Athidhikal has a feel good feel throughout and it starts as light and innocuous fun before heading to the sentimental conflict zone\\".

The property also includes a contributing one-story stone building with a cellar, and a non-contributing wood-frame garage.

Built in 1929, the tower was named a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 2006 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. At the time of construction, it was the city's tallest commercial structure and Austin's first fully air- conditioned office building, and the adjoining parking structure was the city's first self-parking ramped auto garage. The tower remains Austin's only Gothic Revival high-rise building. ==History== In the early 1920s, Austin, Texas financier Ollie Osborn Norwood decided to build a large new office tower to provide professional space for the growing city. At the time, the only tall commercial buildings in Austin were the Scarbrough Building and the Littlefield Building; Norwood planned a cutting-edge professional complex, with central air conditioning in every office (an Austin first) and an integrated parking garage. In 1925 he acquired a downtown parcel, where he first built a parking structure which he called the \\"Motoramp Garage\\" at a cost of $250,000 (). The garage was the city's first ramped multi-story garage, which permitted self-parking by drivers. When the garage was completed in January 1928, Norwood demolished a pre-existing residence on the lot and began building an office tower on the site, at a cost of $750,000 (). Construction was completed in the summer of 1929, after which the Norwood Building was occupied by medical, legal and financial offices, as well as retailers and government agencies. At the time, it was the city's tallest commercial building, and the third tallest structure, after the Texas State Capitol and the Stephen F. Austin Hotel. Capital National Bank Building Beginning in January 1934, Capital National Bank of Austin occupied the ground floor of the Norwood Building. In 1944 the bank purchased the building and renamed it the \\"Capital National Bank Building.\\" The bank modified the adjoining garage in 1951 to allow ground-level commercial banking facilities to be extended into the garage building. Over the decades, CNB occupied progressively more and more of the building, until the bank eventually moved its headquarters to a larger building in 1981. Norwood Tower The building came under new ownership after CNB relocated in 1981. The new owners changed the building's name to the \\"Norwood Tower\\" and undertook major renovations between 1982 and 1983 at a cost of $5 million (). During this time the tower's exterior and lobby were repaired and restored, and the building was brought into compliance with modern building codes. The tower was named a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 2006, and on February 7, 2011 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==Clarence Odie Williams== From the building's completion in 1929 until 1964, the Norwood Tower's maintenance engineer was Clarence Odie Williams, an African-American Austinite. Williams had a private office in the tower, with its own restroom, which he made available for public use. During the Segregation Era before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Williams's office was the only public restroom in downtown Austin open to \\"colored\\" guests, and it was regularly visited by African Americans who had business downtown. ==Architecture== The Norwood Tower is a sixteen- story steel-frame building clad with precast concrete panels. Its design exemplifies the Gothic Revival (or \\"Commercial Gothic\\") architectural style common among 1920s-era Texas high-rise buildings, with its vertical lines, Gothic tracery, pinnacled roof line and gargoyles; the tower remains the only high-rise building in Austin built in this style. The building was designed by local architects Bertram Giesecke and August Watkins \\"Watt\\" Harris. The general contractor for its construction was Frank Barron. The first thirteen floors of the tower hold commercial and office space. The fourteenth and fifteenth levels form a two-story penthouse apartment with rooftop gardens on the corners, while the sixteenth floor is a mechanical level, housing the building's elevator machinery. Exterior The tower rises vertically from a square base, maintaining its square cross section for the bottom thirteen stories. Above the thirteenth level the corners are set back, giving the penthouse on the fourteenth and fifteenth stories a cruciform floor plan. Above the fifteenth level the sides are also stepped back, giving the sixteenth level a narrower rectangular floor plan. The adjoining garage covers the bottom five stories of the tower on its north and west sides. The main entry is in the south facade, which features seven arched openings at ground level, with entrance doors behind the central three and glazing over the outer four. The seven bays are separated by square piers, which become pilasters running vertically up the face of the tower above the first story. Between the pilasters, narrow vertical ribs divide each bay into thirds, with three narrow vertical windows in each bay at each level. The spandrels between the first and second levels are decorated with blind tracery depicting organic patterns in relief, and those between the second and third levels are wrapped in a band of open-tracery quatrefoils, topped by a row of twenty-seven small gargoyles at the level of the third-story window sills. The spandrels between the twelfth and thirteenth levels are engraved with images of the Scales of Justice and the Caduceus, representing the legal and medical professionals who were the tower's first tenants. At the top of the central bay, immediately below the roof line, is a large clock (no longer operating) with its face designed in the style of a rose window, surrounded by panels of blind tracery. At the various roof lines creating by the multiple setbacks, the pilasters and ribs terminate in elaborate decorative finials and gargoyles that combine to give the tower a pinnacled and complex silhouette. The other elevations of the building are similar to the south facade, though without the arched entry, lower gargoyles and clock face. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Travis County, Texas *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Travis County ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Austin, Texas Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks Category:City of Austin Historic Landmarks Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1929 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Austin, Texas Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Texas ","title":"Norwood Tower"},{"id":"56090852","text":"The Euphrates spring minnow (Pseudophoxinus firati) is a species of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae.

It was perhaps the first recorded to contain all elements of what would come to be called rock and roll, and has been described as the first song of that genre. ==Historic song== Rock and roll evolved gradually out of boogie woogie, itself a fusion of blues, early ragtime-style jazz, religious and dance music like honky tonk. \\"Crazy About My Baby\\" contained all key elements of 1950s rock and roll, over two decades earlier. For example, it is a song with accelerated blues guitar riffs and a danceable back beat, recognized as foreshadowing Chuck Berry compositions. It is therefore on a short list along with \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\" (which coined the name for the genre) as \\"the first rock and roll recording\\". In 1929, Le Moise \\"Blind Roosevelt\\" Graves and his brother Uaroy began recording boogie woogie music, a style that had acquired its name from the Pinetop song a year earlier. Among their early songs are the first known recording of \\"Guitar Boogie\\", and \\"Crazy About My Baby\\". They were generally credited either as \\"Blind Roosevelt Graves and Brother\\" or the \\"Mississippi Jook Band\\". The song is in the \\"blues in B flat\\" mode typical of 1950s rock, with Graves on guitar and vocals, session musician William Ezell on piano, Graves' brother playing tambourine, and Baby Jay James playing cornet. ==References== category:boogie- woogie songs Category:1929 songs Category:Rock-and-roll songs ","title":"Crazy About My Baby"},{"id":"56090915","text":"Franck Lestage (born 20 April 1968) is a French athlete.

It is the largest library, and only research library, of 54 library branches in the Free Library system. The library opened on Vine Street, Philadelphia in 1927. Four stories and the ground floor are open to the public. The main entrance steps are on Vine Street, between 19th and 20th Street. ==History== Founding William Pepper secured initial funding through a $225,000 bequest from his wealthy uncle, George S. Pepper, and chartered the Free Library of Philadelphia in 1891 as \\"a general library which shall be free to all\\". The first public library in Philadelphia was opened in March 1894. The initial library was located in three cramped rooms at City Hall, but moved on February 11 of the following year to the old Concert Hall at 1217-1221 Chestnut Street. Library officials criticized this second facility as \\"an entirely unsuitable building, where its work is done in unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded quarters, temporary make-shifts\\". Fifteen years later the Library was moved again, on December 1, 1910, to the northeast corner of 13th and Locust Streets. Opening Pediment Of The Central Library Parkway Central Library had been planned for its current location since 1911; various obstacles, including World War I, held up progress. Construction started in 1917 and was completed in 1927. The grand Beaux-Arts building was designed by Julian Abele, chief designer in the office of prominent Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer. Its design, that of the adjacent Philadelphia Family Court building, and their placement on Logan Circle closely follow that of the H√¥tel de Crillon and the H√¥tel de la Marine on Paris's Place de la Concorde. In addition to being the main library, the building serves as the system's administrative building. The library opened on June 2, 1927 at its present location on 1901 Vine Street. ==Library== The 4th level books stacks prior to its relocation to the Regional Operations Center Four stories and the ground floor are currently open to the public. Until 2016, the library used an elevator system, similar to one used by the New York Public Library system, to retrieve books from large collections housed in the storage stacks. In 2014, books located in storage were transferred to the Regional Operations Center (ROC) which is open only to staff. Philbrick Hall Philbrick Hall, located on the first floor, is the fiction, popular culture and central circulation department of the library. The department contains the Teen Center which provides young adult fiction and non-fiction. Pepper Hall Pepper Hall in 2008 Pepper Hall houses both the literature department which contains over 100,000 volumes and the art department which maintains a collection of over 60,000 books on fine arts, crafts, collectibles and photography. Culinary Literacy Center After renovations, the 4th floor currently contains the Culinary Literacy Center, a commercial-grade kitchen used as a classroom and public education dining space which opened in June 2014. The concept came from Free Library of Philadelphia's President and Director, Siobhan Reardon who wanted to \\"create a space to advance literacy through food and cooking around a communal table\\". The other section holds the Skyline Terrence which includes a green roof. Another section of the floor is used as event spaces and meeting rooms. ==Special collections== Children's Literature Research Collection The library's Children's Literature Research Collection maintains a research collection of children's literature published after 1836. The CLRC archive holds of the one the largest collections of primary source material for children‚Äôs literature in the country. The collection includes a range of original artwork, manuscripts, and ephemera from children‚Äôs literature. Rare Book Department The Rare Book Department features the Charles Dickens‚Äô collection, with first editions, personal letters, and Dickens‚Äô stuffed raven, Grip, among illuminated manuscripts, Americana, Beatrix Potter, early children‚Äôs books, Edgar Allan Poe, and Pennsylvania German folk art. The John Frederick Lewis Collection of European Manuscripts contains over 200 illuminated manuscripts from the 11th to the 16th centuries, and approximately 2,300 cuttings and manuscripts leaves. There are over 50 Books of Hours, numerous bibles, liturgical texts, and psalters, including the Lewis Psalter from the reign of Saint Louis. Works of secular literature are represented including Lewis' illuminated manuscripts from the Widener Collection. There is collection of approximately 800 incunabula, of which 500 come from the P.A.B. Widerner bequest of 1899. The collection of eastern Asian manuscripts, from John Frederick Lewis are in the library. The 153 East Asian manuscripts provide physical formats, including books, scrolls, accordion books, and palm-leaf books. Music The library music department contains the Edwin A. Fleisher Collection of Orchestral Music, the world's largest lending library of orchestral music consisting of over 21,000 titles and offers a research center into the lives of composers and conductors in the 19th and 20th century. The department holds the Drinker Collection which contains over 900 works of sacred and secular music for choral performances. Others Parkway Central Library's Automobile Reference Collection maintains an extensive automobile catalog. The library holds over 130,000 maps from around the world, both historic and current as a part of their Map Collection. Items in the special collections have been digitized and can be viewed online. ==2019 renovations== In April 2019, three new sections opened in the library after over a decade of renovations. Business Resource and Innovation Center On April 12, 2019, the Business Resource and Innovation Center which opened in 2016 was moved to the newly renovated space on the ground floor of Parkway Central Library. The Business Resource and Innovation Center focuses on helping people find new employment opportunities, helping small business growth and assistance in grant finding for non-profit organizations including prospect research. The center also offers assistance in intellectual property protection and is one of three locations in Pennsylvania to be designated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a Patent & Trademark Resource Center. Marie and Joseph Field Teen Center Also located on the ground floor is the 4000-square-foot Marie and Joseph Field Teen Center which is designed as a teen oriented activity center where young adults can form study groups and have access to young adult non-fiction and fiction. The Robert and Eileen Kennedy Heim Center for Cultural and Civic Engagement The Robert and Eileen Kennedy Heim Center for Cultural and Civic Engagement, located on the first floor directly above Business Resource and Innovation Center, is designed as a center for \\"engagement and interaction, intellectual discourse, and grassroots problem solving\\". ==See also== *List of libraries in 19th-century Philadelphia *List of Carnegie libraries in Philadelphia *Benjamin Franklin Parkway ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Libraries in Philadelphia Category:Library buildings completed in 1927 Category:1927 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Logan Square, Philadelphia ","title":"Parkway Central Library"},{"id":"56090967","text":"John Grimshaw (May 2, 1842 - November 30, 1917) was an American businessman and politician.

It consists of a plateau with a number of cinder cones and volcanoes, the last of which was active about 810,000 years before present. == Geography and geomorphology == The Vitim Plateau lies along the headwaters of the Vitim River. It covers a surface area of , and is heavily forested. About five circular groups of volcanoes occur in the field, which is in turn subdivided into two major provinces. Both central volcanoes and cinder cones occur in the volcanic field, with the largest volcanoes reaching heights of and diameters of . == Geology == Since the Oligocene and especially the Pliocene, the Asian Plate has been rifting apart in the Baikal Rift where the Siberian craton and a Paleozoic assembly of terranes (ancient microcontinents) form a contact zone. This rifting process is associated with volcanism in the neighbourhood of the rift zone, and this volcanism has produced about of volcanic rock in several volcanic fields, including the Udokan Plateau and the Vitim Plateau which are the largest volcanic fields of the Baikal Rift. The reasons for the rifting process aren't well known. One theory holds that the collision between India and Asia and other tectonic processes triggered the pull-apart in the Baikal Rift. Another one postulates the existence of thermal anomalies such as a mantle plume beneath the Baikal Rift as the driving force of the rifting. The basement beneath the Baikal Rift is granitic and up to thick. It may be of Paleozoic age. Other rocks in the region are sediments close to river valleys and Mesozoic volcanic rocks.  Composition  Vitim Plateau volcanic rocks are mainly alkaline to subalkaline basalts, nephelinites and melanephelinites, with phenocryst phases containing clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase. Younger rocks have a tendency towards alkaline compositions. The melts that give rise to Vitim Plateau magmas appear to originate in the lithospheric mantle, starting from garnet pyroxenite and peridotite and leaving phlogopite as residual phase when starting from pyroxenite. Petrology indicates that a complex magma production process takes place beneath the Vitim Plateau, including remelting and crystallization. == Eruption history == Two volcanic phases have been identified in the Vitim Plateau. The first took place during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 10.65 - 6.6 million years ago. The second occurred during the Pleistocene with the most recent eruption dated 810,000 years ago. Later volcanic activity was concentrated in river valleys and cones on the surface of the plateau. == References ==  Sources  * Category:Pleistocene volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Russia Category:Plateaus of Russia ","title":"Vitim Plateau"},{"id":"56091137","text":"Yang Juan (born 5 September 1969) is a Chinese athlete.

He currently holds the title of Archbishop-Bishop Emeritus of Aversa, having been granted the personal title of archbishop, and is the former Archbishop of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Conza-Nusco-Bisaccia. == Biography == Mario Milano was born on 23 April 1936 in Lamezia Terme, a comune in the Province of Catanzaro and the region of Calabria in Italy. He was ordained a priest on 3 July 1960.  Archbishop of Sant'Angelo  On 14 December 1989, he was elected the Archbishop of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Conza-Nusco-Bisaccia, and was consecrated a bishop on 6 January 1990 by Pope John Paul II with then- Archbishop Giovanni Battista Re and Archbishop Myroslav Marusyn acting as co- consecrators. As bishop, he took the Latin motto \\"cum Maria Mater Jesu, cum Petro et sub Petro,\\" which translates as \\"with Mary, Mother of God, with Peter and beneath Peter.\\" During his reign, numerous churches and other structures in the archdiocese that were damaged by the Irpina earthquake of 1980 were reopened or rebuilt.  Bishop of Aversa  On 28 February 1998, Milano was transferred to the more populous Diocese of Aversa, where he retained the title of archbishop ad personam. His title, therefore, was Archbishop-Bishop of Aversa. During his tenure, the diocese was plagued by serious crime, and his time was marked by the celebration of a Eucharistic Congress and a diocesan synod. However, this episcopate in Aversa was not without controversy. The press characterized Milano as \\"too soft on the Camorra.\\" This was due, especially, to his refusal to initiate the process for the beatification of Giuseppe Diana, a priest of the Diocese of Aversa killed by the Camorra in Casal di Principe in 1994. In 2007, Milano forbade the presentation of The Cost of Memory (), a biography of Diana that criticized the reluctance of the diocese to condemn Camorra killings. On the day of the inauguration of a pastoral center in San Cipriano d'Aversa dedicated to the entrepreneur Dante Passarelli, who died while on trial for associations with the Camorra, Milano stated \\"If Passarelli was wrong, we do not care; we must love even more he more errs\\" (), but then requested the removal of the dedication plaque. In 2008, some commentators condemned Milano's failure to take a public stance on a priest arrested and subsequently sentenced for pedophilia. Similarly, the suppression of pastoral initiatives aimed at homosexuals, parents of the disabled, drug addicts, and young people in crisis provoked some negative comments. Significant controversy stemmed from the eviction and threatened secularization of several elderly cloistered nuns at the Capuchinesse convent in Aversa ordered by Milano. On 14 December 2010, a few months before his 75th birthday, Milano announced his resignation as Bishop of Aversa for health reasons, although some press reports attributed his resignation to pressure from the Vatican. On 15 January 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Angelo Spinillo as his successor. Milano, as archbishop emeritus, took up residence in Frattamaggiore in the rectory of the Basilica di San Sossio Levita e Martire. == References  External links == * Diocese of Aversa * Archdiocese of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Conza-Nusco- Bisaccia * Profile on Catholic-Hierarchy.org Category:Living people Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Roman Catholic archbishops in Italy Category:Bishops of Aversa Category:Archbishops of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi- Conza-Nusco-Bisaccia Category:1936 births Category:People from Lamezia Terme Category:20th-century Italian people Category:21st-century Italian people ","title":"Mario Milano (archbishop)"},{"id":"56091398","text":"White Dew () is a Soviet 1983 comedy film directed by Igor Dobrolyubov.

He served as Communist Party Chief of Hainan Province from June 1990 to January 1993, and prior to that, as Party Chief of his native city Wuxi and Deputy Party Chief of Jiangsu Province. His tenure in Hainan was marked by his fierce clash with Governor Liu Jianfeng. ==Early life and career== Deng was born in January 1931 in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1947 while a student at Kunshan High School, and participated in underground Communist activities. He entered Jiangnan University in 1949 and graduated in 1952 with a degree in industrial management and engineering. After graduating from university, he was sent to Northeast China to work as an engineer and cadre, first at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and after 1955, at the Benxi Iron and Steel. During the Cultural Revolution, he was sent to perform manual labour in Dafeng County, Jiangsu from 1967 to 1972. He was transferred to the Zhenjiang Coking Plant in 1972, and later became its general manager. He was appointed Mayor of Zhenjiang City in 1983, and a year later, Communist Party Chief of Wuxi City. In 1989, he was promoted to Deputy Party Secretary of Jiangsu Province. ==Hainan and later career== In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the top leaders of Hainan Province, Xu Shijie and Liang Xiang, were dismissed because Liang was an ally of the reformist national leader Zhao Ziyang and Xu supported Liang's policies. In June 1990, Deng was appointed Party Chief of Hainan to replace Xu, ostensibly because of his \\"rich experience in party and government leading positions\\" and \\"his familiarity with economic work\\", but it is commonly believed that his promotion was linked to his relationship with the central government leaders Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, the latter reportedly a close friend of his. Deng was expected to bring his advanced experience in economic work to the fledgling province of Hainan, as he had worked in Southern Jiangsu, whose economy had been growing rapidly since the late 1970s. However, instead of focusing on economic reform, Deng emphasized \\"cadre building\\", citing Mao Zedong's quotations as justification. He brought to Hainan many of his followers and friends from Jiangsu, and forbade local cadres to build their own private houses. These acts alienated native officials and earned him a reputation for being anti-Hainan. Moreover, Deng proved unable to work with Governor Liu Jianfeng, an associate of Premier Li Peng. From 1990 to 1992, the two top officials of Hainan clashed fiercely, hindering the province's development. By the end of 1992, Deng and Liu were trying to drive each other out of the province. A high-ranking official, Li Shanyou, accused Liu of visiting a prostitute. Li was imprisoned after the accusation was proven false, and Liu launched a counter-investigation to find the instigator, rumoured to be Deng. Their infighting became an embarrassment to the central government, which transferred both of them to Beijing in January 1993, and replaced them with a single official, Ruan Chongwu. In Beijing, Deng served as Deputy Director of the Development Research Center of the State Council from 1994 to 1998. He was an alternate member of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 14th Central Committee. He also served as a member of the Standing Committee of the 9th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Deng retired in April 1998. He died on 21 December 2019 in Wuxi, aged 88. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Political office-holders in Hainan Category:Politicians from Wuxi Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Jiangsu Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Jiangsu Category:Engineers from Jiangsu Category:Alternate members of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Deng Hongxun"},{"id":"56091423","text":" The D.K.D.3 was a Polish, single seat, parasol-wing sports aircraft first flown in 1927. Only one was built but flew in demonstrations and in national competitions into the early 1930s. ==Design and development== Early in the summer of 1927 the Dzia≈Çowski brothers, Stanis≈Çaw and Mieczys≈Çaw, moved their aircraft building activities from Bydgoszcz to Krak√≥w-Rakowice where the military unit was much more sympathetic to amateurs and allowed the use of their workshops. They also brought with them the remains of the Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.1 which had crash landed near Warsaw after attending an exhibition. Their next design was the D.K.D.3, a parasol-wing single-seater which reused the wing and empennage of the D.K.D.1, combining them with a new engine, fuselage and undercarriage. The wing was built around two spars and fabric covered and the primary bracing was a parallel pair of struts on each side from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars. Centrally the wing was braced over the fuselage on a transverse pair of steel inverted V-struts from the spars. The generous balances on its ailerons extended beyond the squared wing tips. The D.K.D.3 had a more powerful engine than its predecessor, a six cylinder Anzani 6 radial engine mounted completely exposed for cooling and with duralumin fuselage covering immediately behind. Further aft the fuselage structure was a rectangular section, welded steel tube girder, with wooden frames, stringers and fabric covering producing an oval cross-section apart from a flat underside. Its open cockpit was under the trailing edge cut-out. Both fin and tailplane, the latter located on top of the fuselage, were small and rectangular in shape, mounting large, balanced control surfaces. These were also approximately rectangular but the bottom of the rudder was cut at an angle to allow the one-piece elevator to operate. All the rear surfaces were wooden framed and fabric covered. Its undercarriage, much taller than that of the D.K.D.1, was fixed and of the tailskid type, with mainwheels with rubber cord shock absorbers on a single axle. The axle was mounted on steel tube V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons at the bases of the wing bracing struts and transversely braced with a V-strut from the forward strut bases. ==Operational history== Construction in just nine weeks and a first flight on 3 October 1927, flown by its designer, allowed the D.K.D.3 to compete in the First National Lightplane Contest at Warsaw, flying there from Krak√≥w on 4 October. It was well placed after early tests but during a cross-country flight a magneto failed and the time lost dropped the D.K.D.3 to a final fourth place out of six. The following year Dzia≈Çowski received funding from Mielec, his home town, to maintain and develop the D.K.D.3. With their crest on the fin and assisted by the LOPP, he flew it in a series of local demonstrations to raise funds for the Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.4, a new aircraft which won the 1928 second National Lightplane Contest. The D.K.D.3 also competed in the 1928 competition and came third from twelve. It continued to demonstrate and compete at least to 1930, when it took part in the third National Lightplane Contest but once again dropped out during a cross-country test and was damaged. Over its career the D.K.D.3 made some 1,800 flights and logged 431 flying hours; on 1 July 1933 SP-ACR, its final Polish civil registration, was withdrawn from use. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:Parasol- wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:1920s Polish sport aircraft ","title":"Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.3"},{"id":"56091447","text":"Municipal elections were held in Prague in on 5 and 6 October 2018 as part of nationwide municipal elections. All 65 seats of the Prague Assembly were up to elect. Full results were presented a day later, on 7 October 2018. The result was a narrow victory of conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS), which received 17.9 per cent of votes and 14 seats. The ODS won for the fifth time in Prague. Followed by liberal Czech Pirate Party (Pirates), receiving 17.1 per cent (almost 12 per cent more than in 2014 election), and 13 seats. Praha sobƒõ (\\"Prague Together\\", 16.6 per cent) and the United Forces for Prague (16.3 per cent) won 13 seats as well. Centrist populist ANO, the strongest party of the Czech Republic at that time, as well as the strongest party in Prague, lost 5 seats and 6.7 per cent of votes, receiving 12 seats and 15.4 per cent of votes. The Freedom and Direct Democracy received only 3.5 per cent, failed to reach 5% threshold. The Communist Party received 3.3 per cent, and the Czech Social Democratic Party received 2.9 per cent, both failed to reach the threshold for the first time.

The club was founded in 1899. Viking have played in the top division since the league was established in 1937, except for the years 1966‚Äì67, 1987‚Äì88 and 2018. In total, Viking have played 68 seasons in the first tier and 5 seasons in the second tier of Norwegian football. No other clubs have played more seasons in the top flight. The club has never played lower than the second tier. The 2019 season will be Viking's 69th season in the top flight. In the first years, Viking played predominantly friendly matches against local clubs. Starting around 1910, Viking played in regional leagues in Rogaland until 1937. Common opponents in these years were fellow Stavanger clubs FK Vidar, IL Brodd and Stavanger IF. Viking were the dominating team in the region during the 1930s. The 1937‚Äì38 season was the first national league season. However, the league was still split into several regional groups. The winner from each group would qualify for a knockout tournament at the end of the season to decide the champion. Viking qualified for this knockout tournament twice, in 1937‚Äì38 and 1947‚Äì48. In the 1948‚Äì49 season, the league was split into only two groups. The two group-winners would then play each other to decide the winner. Viking won the league for the first time in 1957‚Äì58, after beating Skeid 2-0 in the championship final. Viking also won the Norwegian cup twice during the 1950s. The 1963 season was the first regular league season with only one group. Viking struggled in the first seasons with the new league structure, and were relegated in 1965, but were promoted back two years later. The 1970s were the club's most successful period, winning the league five times, reaching the Norwegian cup final twice, winning it once, and participating in European competitions several times. Viking won the double in 1979. The success continued into the 1980s with another league title in 1982 and being runner-ups in the league in 1981 and 1984. But in 1986 Viking were relegated for the second time in the club's history, and in 1987 they suffered their worst league position of all time, finishing in 8th place in the second tier. The next season, Viking were promoted back to the top division, and won the cup the following season. In 1991, Viking won their last top division title. ==Key== ;League table key * Pos = Final position * Pld = Matches played * W = Games won * D = Games drawn * L = Games lost * GF = Goals for * GA = Goals against * Pts = Points * Att = Average home attendance ;Position key * W = Winners * RU = Runners-up * SF = Semi-finals * QF = Quarter-finals * GS = Group stage * R4 = Fourth round * R3 = Third round * R2 = Second round * R1 = First round * QR2 = Second qualifying round ;Key to colours and symbols: {  bgcolor=\\"gold\\" 1st or W  Winners - bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\" 2nd or RU  Runners-up - bgcolor=\\"#deb678\\" 3rd  Third place -  1st  Winners of group -  2nd  Runners-up of group -  3rd  Third place in group - bgcolor=\\"#DDFFDD\\" ‚Üë  Promoted - bgcolor=\\"#FFCCCC\\" ‚Üì  Relegated - style=background:gold ‚ô¶ Top scorer in the whole league -   Not available or unknown } ==Seasons== 1910‚Äì1937 {  center;\\" ! scope=col rowspan=\\"2\\"  Season ! scope=col colspan=\\"2\\" class=unsortable  Regional league ! scope=col rowspan=\\"2\\"  Cup - !Division ! - 1910 Kretsserien (Vestlandske)   - 1911 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"2nd  - 1912 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"2nd  - 1913 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"2nd  - 1914 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"2nd  - 1915 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right4th  - 1916 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#deb678\\"3rd  - 1917 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right4th  - 1918 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right4th  - 1919 Kretsserien (Vesterlen) align=right bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"2nd  - 1920 Kretsserien (Rogaland)  R3 - 1921 Kretsserien (Rogaland)   - 1922 Kretsserien (Rogaland)   - 1923 Kretsserien (Rogaland)   - 1924 Kretsserien (Rogaland)   - 1925 Kretsserien (Rogaland)  SF - 1926 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st R3 - 1927 Kretsserien (Rogaland)  R4 - 1928 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st R4 - 1929 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st R4 - 1930 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st QF - 1931 Kretsserien (Rogaland)  R4 - 1932 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st  - 1933 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st bgcolor=\\"#ddd\\"RU - 1934 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st R3 - 1935 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st SF - 1936 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st R3 - 1937 Kretsserien (Rogaland) align=right bgcolor=\\"gold\\"1st QF } Since 1937 {  center;\\" ! scope=col rowspan=\\"2\\"  Season ! scope=col colspan=\\"11\\" class=unsortable  League ! scope=col rowspan=\\"2\\"  Cup ! scope=col colspan=\\"2\\"  Other ! scope=col colspan=\\"2\\"  League top goalscorer - !Tier !Division ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !Competition !Round !Player !Goals - 1937‚Äì38 scope=col rowspan=\\"3\\"  1 Norgesserien (Dist.

It was based near Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. After Paul Weyrich's death in 2008, the Foundation was headed by former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore. Under Gilmore's leadership, the Free Congress Foundation was refocused on economic issues and not social issues. Eventually, the entire organization was renamed to American Opportunity, and is now based in Alexandria, Virginia. ==Origin== FCF founder Paul Weyrich. In the 1960s and 1970s, the labor union-backed National Committee for an Effective Congress was highly influential. In 1974, in part to counteract its influence, Weyrich founded the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress (CSFC), whose name implied that the United States Congress should stop being dominated by labor and other liberal-leaning interest groups. The CSFC was organized as a grassroots organization focused on elective politics. It had some success and was a pioneer in political direct mail fundraising. It complemented in a respect the activities of the Heritage Foundation, which Weyrich had also co- founded, which researched tax and regulatory issues. However, Weyrich wanted an organization that would focus on conservative social values. The CSFC thus became a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation. It also has a sister organization, Coalitions for America, which, as a 501(c)(4), is permitted to lobby, and a political action committee, the Free Congress PAC, that is permitted to directly endorse and contribute to political candidates. ==Activist training== Since its inception, FCF has trained conservatives in basic techniques of activism and election campaigns. In 2001, the Foundation published The Integration of Theory and Practice, an activist strategic plan which called for a new approach to activism and the creation of conservative parallel institutions as a counter to existing institutions, which it argued were dominated by the Left.The Integration of Theory and Practice: A Program for the New Traditionalist Movement FreeCongressFoundation.org, July 2001. Via Internet Archive. ==Krieble Institute== Another initiative taken on by the foundation was the training of anti-communists in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This Institute bore the name of Robert Krieble, the primary donor to these activities. Through the Krieble Institute, \\"Bob [Krieble] produced the first political commercials ever run on Ukrainian television. They promoted Ukrainian independence. And when 89 percent of the voters agreed with that message, their democratic will drove the last nail into the Soviet coffin.\\"Mike Pence, June 7, 2004, Heritage Foundation, Renewing Our Commitment to Limited Government ==Privacy== The foundation's Center for Technology Policy and Coalition for Constitutional Liberties has opposed the USA PATRIOT Act, ECHELON, a national ID card and other measures often supported by conservatives for fighting crime, terrorism and illegal immigration. ==Judicial nominations== FCF has been involved in the judicial nominations battles since the early 1980s. Its Center for Law and Democracy and its Coalition for Judicial Restraint have criticized Republican Senators for not being aggressive enough in blocking liberal nominees or in confirming certain conservatives. The CLD has also researched and publicized information about nominees' decisions and writings, either to attack or defend them. The FCF has promoted what it sees as a philosophy of judicial restraint, in which judges largely defer to the elected branches of government on controversial political and cultural decisions. The individual most closely associated with this philosophy-and the chief exponent for the Free Congress Foundation's views on this subject for many years-is Thomas Jipping, who has made numerous appearances on television and radio, as well as in both print and online media, supporting conservative judicial nominations put forward by the Bush administration and conversely, opposing what he considered liberal nominees chosen by the previous Clinton administration. ==Cultural conservatism== According to FCF leader Weyrich, the counterculture is now mainstream. Hence, traditional values cannot be restored through politics, but they may be promoted by alternative institutions. The image depicts participants in the Woodstock festival in 1969. FCF played a founding role in galvanizing religious conservative political activism. By the late 1990s, Weyrich declared that social conservatives were no longer a majority having a liberal agenda forced on them by an elite but rather are a dwindling minority that have lost control over the culture; that traditional culture and the counterculture have traded places. He acknowledged the need for continued political involvement as a matter of self-defense but stated that politics could not restore traditional values or, in his views, hopeless efforts to recapture institutions such as prestige media, academia and mainline churches that had been lost to the left. Instead he urged conservatives to invest their time and money in alternative institutions, which would, in his viewpoint, eventually become the norm due to the superior efficacy of traditional values. This sparked a firestorm of criticism from other conservatives, who accused Weyrich of giving up. The ideas on \\"Cultural Marxism\\" promoted by the FCF influenced Anders Behring Breivik, who was responsible for the 2011 Norway attacks. ==Foreign policy and defense== President Reagan delivering his Strategic Defense Initiative speech. FCF strongly supported the Strategic Defense Initiative, but have been moderate in their support of defense expenditures and opponents of the war on terrorism. FCF took a hard-line anti-communist stance in the Cold War, rejecting d√©tente and arms control and supporting efforts to overthrow communist governments. However, other than Strategic Defense Initiative which it strongly backed, FCF did not fully endorse the Reagan program of spending on expensive weapon systems, a stance it continues to this day. It remains hostile to Communist China. FCF has been friendlier to post-communist Serbia and Russia than most contemporary conservatives. It was against US intervention in the Balkans, leaning more toward the Orthodox Christian Serbs than the Muslim Bosnians and Albanians. ==Economics and trade== FCF departs from other conservative institutions in endorsing a protectionist approach on international trade. Furthermore, it is not as purely free-market, supporting government efforts in mass transit and privacy protection. These included its publishing a quarterly magazine, The New Electric Railway Journal, from 1988 to 1996, with FCF's Paul Weyrich and William S. Lind being its Publisher and Associate Publisher, respectively.Weyrich, Paul M. (Autumn 1993). \\"Righting the Rails\\". TNERJ, pg. 4. (The headline was a play on words, as the column explained why Weyrich felt it made sense for those on the political \\"right\\" [conservatives] to support rail transit.) Kunz, Richard R. (Spring 1996). \\"From the Editor: Cutting the Cord\\". The New Electric Railway Journal, p. 2. However, it also supports mainstream conservative views on fiscal policy, calling for reduced spending and taxes. ==Broadcast efforts== Weyrich promoted a view that the mainstream news and entertainment media exhibit a liberal bias. In response, in 1993, FCF launched a Washington, D.C.-based satellite television station called National Empowerment Television (NET). Its logo featured a square of nine dots, referring to a puzzle that cannot be solved without drawing lines \\"outside the box.\\" Logo of National Empowerment Television. NET served in part as a platform for FCF and Weyrich's views and interests. For example, Weyrich was a supporter of rail and Amtrak had a program on the channel called America on Track; another program, The New Electric Railway Journal (an extension of the magazine), covered light rail. Other programs focused on FCF activity: Endangered Liberties discussed privacy issues; Legal Notebook emphasized judicial nominations, and Next Revolution covered FCF's take on social conservatism. A popular program was Direct Line with Paul Weyrich, in which the host interviewed lawmakers and other prominent figures live, permitted the public to call in directly with questions and comments and delivered a commentary in the final segment. NET was also a broader resource for the conservative and free market movement. Many organizations bought the rights to air programs on the channel, including the National Rifle Association, the Christian Coalition, the Cato Institute, Accuracy in Media and others. The channel featured high production values and cost a great deal and in response to donor and investor pressure for a clear focus, FCF dropped all programs not directly related to public policy and conservative activism, and rebranded the channel as NET: The Conservative NewsTalk Network, with the initials NET no longer standing for anything and the nine-dot logo replaced with one evoking the US Capitol dome. It also began news reports and updates, and a full- fledged investigative journalism program. FCF planned to make NET a self- sustaining, even profitable commercial enterprise, rather than a money-losing tool of outreach but was unsuccessful. In a decision he later came to regret bitterly, Weyrich turned over day-to-day operation of the channel to an industry veteran who had been successful with other startups. After a power struggle which Weyrich lost, NET was rebranded again into \\"America's Voice\\", and the channel abandoned all conservative identity, marketing itself merely as a non-ideological way for the public to make its views known to policymakers. FCF had to pay to retain its four programs on the channel and after controversy over their content, even those were removed. Viewer support collapsed, and Dish Network dropped it. Eventually America's Voice was sold, becoming \\"The Renaissance Network\\" (TRN), airing on a few broadcast stations, mainly UHF and low-power channels. Facing ruin, TRN brought back FCF content but it was too little, too late, and the channel folded. FCF also experimented with radio broadcasting, airing weekly taped programs on the Liberty Works Radio Network and other outlets. ==Center for Cultural Conservatism== Part of the larger Free Congress Foundation, the Center for Cultural Conservatism was headed by William S. Lind. ==Funding== The Free Congress Foundation's revenues for the fiscal year ending 12/31/12 were $574,292 against expenses of $515,329; for the fiscal year ending 12/31/11 were $494,652 against expenses of $776,081; for the fiscal year ending 12/31/10 were $338,560 against expenses of $888,538.Free Congress Research and Education Foundation IRS Form 990, available at www.guidestar.com ==NotesExternal links== *Official website *Entry on FCF from SourceWatch *Entry from People for the American Way *Recipient Profile from Media Transparency *http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/picks/0028.html Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States Category:New Right organizations (United States) Category:1977 establishments in Washington, D.C.

After Le Pen successfully challenged the suspension in court, an extraordinary party congress was held in August 2015, and he was expelled from the party. After considering the creation of a \\"blue-white-red gathering\\" in order to \\"act in the same direction as the national Front\\" without necessarily belonging to it, he announced, in March 2016, the creation of the Comit√©s Jeanne, named after Joan of Arc, whose slogan is \\"Jeanne, au secours!\\" (\\"Joan, help!\\" in English), to weigh on the political line of the FN, and planned to present candidates under this label in the legislative elections of 2017, including against FN candidates. He called on supporters to vote for the FN in the regional elections of 2015 and indicated that the fund-raising organization \\"Cotelec\\" had lent six million euros to the FN for the presidential campaign of 2017. On 17 November 2016, a court of justice in France validated the exclusion of Jean-Marie Le Pen from the National Front without questioning his status as honorary president, thus retaining his right to be summoned to all the party's meetings. == Ideology == French political commentators have placed Comit√©s Jeanne on the far-right of the left‚Äìright political spectrum.https://www.france- politique.fr/wiki/Comit%C3%A9s_Jeanne_(CJ) The party espouses nationalist rhetoric that is staunchly anti-globalist, anti-Zionist and anti-immigration.

Its unusual property is that it contains copper in both of its common oxidation states. It is insoluble in water and stable in air. What was known as Rogojski's salt is a mixture of Chevreul's salt and metallic copper. ==Preparation== Chevreul's salt is prepared by treating aqueous copper sulfate with a solution of potassium metabisulfite. The solution changes colour from blue to green immediately. The identity of the green species is unknown. Heating this solution produces a reddish solid precipitate: 3 CuSO4 \\\\+ 4 K2S2O5 \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí Cu3(SO3)2‚Ä¢2H2O + 4 K2SO4 \\\\+ 4 SO2 \\\\+ H2SO4 When sodium ions are present in the solutions that form the salt, sodium can substitute for some of the copper (I), as the ions have the same charge and similar sizes. ==Reactions== Chevreul's salt exhibits properties of both copper(I) and copper(II). Hydrochloric acid produces a white solid of copper(I) chloride. If too much acid is added, the precipitate dissolves. If an ammonia solution is added to the product, it is dissolved and a deep blue color appears - the presence of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ complex. On heating in an inert atmosphere it is stable to 200 ¬∞C. It gives off water and sulfur dioxide to give CuSO4‚Ä¢Cu2O and CuSO4‚Ä¢2CuO. At 850 ¬∞C CuO is formed and from 900 ¬∞C to 1100 ¬∞C Cu2O appears. Heating in air or oxygen yields CuSO4, CuSO3, and ultimately CuO (cupric oxide) ==Properties== The infrared spectrum of Chevreul's salt contains strong bands with maxima at 473, 632 cm‚àí1, medium ones at 915, 980, and 1025 cm‚àí1, and a weak band at 860 cm‚àí1. 980 cm‚àí1 is due to symmetric stretch of the sulfite group, 632 cm‚àí1 due to symmetric bend, 915 due to asymmetric stretch, and 473 cm‚àí1 is due to asymmetric bend. The absence of splitting in these bands indicates that the sulfite group is not distorted by the other components in the compound. The optical reflectance spectrum shows absorption around 425 nm with a shoulder to 500 nm. This is due to a cuprous sulfite chromophore. An absorption peaking at 785 nm with a shoulder to 1000 nm, in the near infrared, is due to Jahn-Teller splitting in cupric ions. Maximum reflectance is around 650 nm in the red part of the spectrum. In the infrared range the band gap is 0.85 eV. Chevreul's salt is a representative member of an isomorphic series of double salts with formulae Cu2SO3‚Ä¢FeSO3‚Ä¢2H2O, Cu2SO3‚Ä¢MnSO3‚Ä¢2H2O, and Cu2SO3‚Ä¢CdSO3‚Ä¢2H2O. The properties of these salts show the effect of ionic radius and ion hardness. Another analogue, Cu2SO3‚Ä¢NiSO3‚Ä¢2H2O, is brick-red in colour. It is made by bubbling sulfur dioxide through a nickel sulfate, copper sulfate mixed solution, heating to 80¬∞C and changing pH to 3.5 to precipitate the salt. The thermal conductivity of Chevreul‚Äôs salt is 0.1 kWcm‚àí1K‚àí1. Heat capacity is 0.62 Jcm‚àí3K‚àí1, and thermal diffusivity is 0.154 cm2s‚àí1. The specific susceptibility is 3.71√ó10‚àí6 emu/g. In Chevreul's salt crystals there are two environments for copper. The +1 oxidation state copper is in a distorted tetrahedral space surrounded by three oxygens and a sulfur atom. The +2 oxidation state copper (or other metal in the isomorphic series) is in a distorted octahedral coordination surrounded by four oxygen atoms and two water molecules. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Chevreul's salt shows peaks at 955.6, 935.8, 953.3 and 943.9 eV that correspond to Cu(II) 2p1/2, 2p3/2, Cu(I) 2p1/2, 2p3/2. There are also secondary peaks for copper at 963.7, and 943.9 eV. Sulfur 2p causes a peak at 166.7 eV and oxygen 1s causes a spike at 531.8. ==Application== Chevreul's salt is used in a hydrometallurgical process to extract copper from ore. Firstly the ore is oxidised, then extracted with an ammonium sulfate-ammonia solution. This is then injected with sulfur dioxide resulting in the precipitation of Chevreul's salt. pH must be between 2 and 4.5 for the precipitation to take place. Chevreul's salt is formed as a corrosion product on copper metal in the presence of humid air contaminated with sulfur dioxide. When first formed the salt has an unstable orthorhombic form with a = 5.591, b = 7.781 and c = 8.356 √Ö, which changes to the normal monoclinic form over a month, or faster when heated. == References == Category:Copper compounds Category:Sulfites ","title":"Chevreul's salt"},{"id":"56091888","text":"The European Union‚ÄìMoldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area or EU‚ÄìMoldova DCFTA is a free trade area between the European Union and Moldova. The DCFTA is a part of Moldova's EU Association Agreement. It allows Moldova access to the European Single Market in selected sectors and grants EU investors the same regulatory environment in the associated country as in the EU. The first countries to ratify the agreement with the EU were Moldova and Georgia, thus the agreement officially entered into force in July 2016, although parts of them were already provisionally applied. However, because of political instability in the Ukraine, the agreement with the Ukraine was provisionally applied on January 1, 2016. Only after almost one year after the agreement officially entered into force in Moldova and Georgia, the agreement finally entered into force on September 1, 2017 in Ukraine. The main goal of DCFTA is to offer closer and stronger relations between the EU and countries that have ratified the agreement in the EU Single Market. The DCFTA is supposed to offer the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Movement of people, however, takes the form of a visa-free regime for short stay travel, while movement of workers remains within the remit of the EU Member States. The DCFTA is an \\"example of the integration of a Non-EEA-Member into the EU Single Market\\".EU-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area ==Background== Since 2009, the Republic of Moldova has intensified its relations with the European Union, especially after the April 7, 2009 protests triggered by the falsification of parliamentary votes by the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova government.Alegeri Fraudate This resulted to the accession of the Democrats to power. Thus, with a new parliament, Moldova started to build closer relations with the European Union. Despite the crackdown of the protests, the European Parliament announced that the Republic of Moldova would participate in the Eastern Partnership summit in Prague on May 7, 2009. This is one of the first steps to upgrade relations between Moldova and the EU.Moldova welcome at EU summit The same year, Moldova joined the EU's Eastern Partnership and the EU-Moldova Association Agreement entered into force on July 1, 2016. Through this process, the Deep and Comprehensive Freed Trade Area (DCFTA) officially took effect.EU-Moldova relations ==What is DCFTA?== The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) is an arrangement between the EU and the Republic of Moldova that foresees a preferential trade relationship, based on mutually advantageous treatment, between the signatories. It gives each other better access to their respective markets, which are more comprehensive than that offered to other trading partners.Ce este DCFTA This entails the elimination of the tariffs for numerous goods. It further provides for removal of obstacles to trade in services and better access for companies seeking to establish in respective markets. The DCFTA includes a number of provisions aimed at reforming the trade and trade policies of the Republic of Moldova in line with the acquis communautaire. This aims to modernise the Moldovan economy, attracting the EU investment in the country, and giving it more predictable policy environment. Trade only obligations * Tariff Obligations Complete elimination of all import duties and the ban on export taxes for all EU products. Only a few agricultural goods (most of them being animal origin, sugar and grain products), which are considered sensitive in the EU, will be subject to the monitoring of trade flows. This monitoring ensures that imports of products manufactured in Moldova are in line with the country's production capacity and that there is no circumvention of taxes on products originating in other countries. In addition, a limited category of fruit and vegetables, which are subject to the EU entry price, will be liberalized (ad valorem free) under tariff quotas covering traditional trade flows. As far as the Republic of Moldova is concerned, it is expected to eliminate all import taxes for the vast majority of products. A process liberalization phase (between 3 and 10 years, depending on the product) is foreseen for the Republic of Moldova for certain sensitive products (most agricultural, such as wine, certain processed agricultural products, meat products, fruits/vegetables, textile products). Certain products remain unaffected and are managed under tariff quotas (poultry and pig meat, certain dairy products, processed or sugar products and the like). However, the tariff quota covers traditional trade flows between the EU and the Republic of Moldova. The general liberalization of trade in agricultural products can be revised by the parties with a view to accelerating it in the third year after the entry into force of the Agreement. A possibility to resort to a general protection measure for all products (agricultural or industrial) has been requested by the Republic of Moldova for a period of 10 years. The existing mechanisms allow for a gradual liberalization of trade from Moldova, with the necessary transition periods related to the internal reform process and strengthening the competitiveness of the local industry before allowing full market opening for the EU products.Regulile Trade Only\\" * Rules of Origin The Republic of Moldova will apply the rules of origin that will make it possible to join the Pan-EuroMed (PEM) Convention as a cumulative manufacturing process area with the EU and other EMP countries, and favoring the regional economic integration of commodity trade. However, in order to ease the transition from the autonomous trade regime to the DCFTA by the end of 2015, the Autonomous Trade Preferences system for the Republic of Moldova will continue to be applied on the basis of the applied rules of origin (to benefit from these preferences rather than the DCFTA). * Services and establishment The EU and the Republic of Moldova offer each other market access for cross-border services in a wide range of areas, among other commitments included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services. In addition, the parties have agreed to widen access to the right of establishment in a wide variety of sectors, providing the right of qualified personnel to temporary work in the EU or the Republic of Moldova. ==Supposed Benefits of DCFTA== DCFTA can be advantageous on the national level or for certain companies. Theoretically, DCFTA is supposed to benefit Moldova in four ways: # DCFTA is beneficial for the Republic of Moldova in terms of increasing national income. In the short run, with the DCFTA contribution, an income increase of 75 million is expected for Moldova. However, in the long run the estimated increase for Moldova would be about twice as high (142 million euro). The relative changes in Moldova's national income would lead to a 5.4 percent GDP growth in the long run. Therefore, this increase will be the result of a reduction in sanitary and phytosanitary measures and trade barriers, which is 62 million euros. The second major contribution for the Republic of Moldova, in the short term, comes from the liberalization of trade in services, the value of which represents EUR 28 million.Benfeciile pentru Moldova\\" # It would boost trade between the EU and the Republic of Moldova. An increase in exports of 15 percent and 16 percent is expected in the short run and imports would increase by 6 percent and 8 percent in the long run. It is, therefore, expected that the DCFTA would contribute to a relative improvement of the trade balance for the Republic of Moldova in the short run. In the long run, the reduction of non-tariff measures should result in a 283-million-euro benefit to the Republic of Moldova. # Tightening up internal rules would improve the safety of consumer products. DCFTA, by providing a more stable and predictable trade system based on the EU law, expects to stimulate the flow of the European FDI into the country, create more businesses, and strengthen the competitiveness of the economy and its sectors. # Salaries in Moldova would increase by 3.1 percent in the short run and by 4.8 percent in the long run. At the same time, consumer prices are expected to fall by around 1 percent in the short run and 1.3 percent in the long run, mainly due to increased competition from imports. ==Outcome== Even though Moldova ratified the agreement with the EU, DCFTA does not limit Moldova's ability to export its products to other countries. Moldova also retains full sovereignty in its decisions on trade policy since it is not a member of any customs union. DCFTA is compatible with all other free trade agreements that Moldova is part. Domestic reforms in Moldova, together with the EU support, will upgrade the quality of Moldovan products and services. This will open trade opportunities well beyond the EU market and bring growth and jobs to Moldova.Compatible with other trade Agreements\\" On 1 September 2014, the Association Agreement with the EU entered into force provisionally. Thus, just after two months since it entered into force, the Republic of Moldova starts to see good results from the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU (DCFTA). Even if the Association Agreement involves medium and long-run benefits (5-7 or even 10 years), it has already brought some tangible effects within the first two months of implementation. It is important that these benefits have been felt by the agro-industrial sector, which is considered the most sensitive to the liberalization of trade with the EU. In fact, it is remarkable that an impressive increase of 26 percent acquired in wine exports, apples increased by 2.7 times, plums by 8.1 percent, and table grapes by 5.8 percent, frozen sweetcorn over 3 times and cereals by 77 percent during the September‚ÄìOctober 2014 time period. The increases were expressed over the previous year, thus eliminating the seasonal factor. Moreover, exports have grown so impressive despite the fact that 2014 was a less fruitful year than 2013, which posted less exports figures.Progresul dupa implimentare a DCFTA\\" 2014-2015 The total volume of Moldovan exports dropped by 14.8 percent between August 2014 and September 2015. Compared to the same period last year, the exports to the EU dropped by only 1.4 percent. Moreover, export of agricultural-food products to the EU increased by 10.8 percent, partly offsetting the decrease in exports to other destinations, especially Russia, where the fall was about 73 percent.Progresul dupa un an\\" The increase of exports exceeded expectations, and in the case of grapes, plums, and barley, the volume of exports increased by up to five times. However, the volume of exports of non-food industrial products in the EU decreased by 6.9 percent - a significantly lower rate than the decrease in exports to CIS and other countries. Thus, the EU has strengthened its main destination for exports from the Republic of Moldova, the share of which increased from 51 percent before the DCFTA to 59 percent after the first year of implementation of the agreement. In addition, Moldovan expanded its influence onto completely new markets like Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Greece and Latvia. 2016‚Äìpresent According to the European External Action Service(EEAS), European Union's imports from Moldova increased by 7.7 percent in 2016, to the value of ‚Ç¨1.3 billion, an increase of 13.5 percent since 2014, the year in which the DCFTA entered into force. The European Union is Moldova's first trading partner and the first investor in the country, accounting for 66 percent of total Moldovan exports and 55 percent of total trade. The value of certain EU imports from Moldova grew more strongly, for example, agricultural imports which grew by 21 percent in 2016, worth ‚Ç¨456 million. Data for the first half of 2017 confirms the positive trend of growth in Moldovan exports to the EU, in particular for a number of products such as sunflower seeds, nuts, grapes, dried fruits, wheat, barley, sugar, certain types of paper, textile and bedding articles. Overall, bilateral trade between the EU and Moldova has increased by 1.5 percent in 2016 to ‚Ç¨3.3 billion.Trade Relations\\" Johannes Hahn, a commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, in a 2018 EU report, published on April 5, 2018, said :\\"Since the Association Agreement including the DCFTA entered into force, the EU's share in Moldova's exports has increased and accounts now for more than half of Moldova's total trade.....This is just one of many examples showing why the EU matters to the Republic of Moldova and why our partnership is beneficial to the lives of its people. Access to the European markets and benefits from the DCFTA will further increase once Moldova has aligned its health and safety standards to those of the EU. The food safety reform will enable Moldova to export its agricultural products, notably animal products, whose safety for consumers is strictly controlled in the EU. Overall, if reforms are completed, the DCFTA is expected to boost Moldova's GDP by 5.4 percent annually. ==References== Category:Free trade agreements Category:Free trade areas Category:Moldova‚ÄìEuropean Union relations ","title":"European Union‚ÄìMoldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area"},{"id":"56091890","text":"Josiah Chorley (1652-1719) was an English Presbyterian minister. ==Life== He was a great-grandson of Richard Chorley of Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire,Munimenta Alme Universitatis Glasguensis. Records of the University of Glasgow, from its foundation till 1727 p.xxii and second of six sons of Richard Chorley of Preston. His father's house was, as he noted, \\"the receptacle of persecuted ministers.\\" After a preparatory education in several good grammar schools, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1669, but his residence there was not long, because of \\"the terms of conformity being strait.\\" He then turned his thoughts to Scotland. His gave his account of his sojourn at the University of Glasgow in a little note-book, which he called \\"Chorleyana, or a Register commemorating some of the most remarkable passages of Clod's providence towards me from my nativity, by Josiah Chorley.\\" The first part of this \\"Register\\" was written at Glasgow in 1671-2. He later received the degree of M.A. Chorley succeeded John Collinges as one of the ministers of the Presbyterian congregation at Norwich. The baptismal register of the congregation begins in September 1691 with an entry by Chorley. Chorley's ministry in Norwich was marked by his zeal in catechetical instruction, which gave rise to his very curious compendium of the Bible in verse. In January 1719 he was succeeded by John Brook from Yarmouth (afterwards of York, where he died in 1735). Chorley baptised a child of Brook's on 3 September 1719, and is believed to have died soon after. He is said to have bequeathed a large sum of money, to be divided between the Presbyterian minister and the poor at Preston, but nothing is now known of this endowment. ==Works== Chorley published A Metrical Index to the Bible, (1711). This aid to the memorising of the contents of chapters is dedicated Deo Trin-Uni O.M. Ecclesi√¶q; vere Catholic√¶. At the end is A Poetical Meditation.

It incorrectly gave Chorley's name as Joseph. ==Family== Chorley has been confused with his son (according to Browne, his nephew) Richard, who was educated in the academies of Frankland at Rathmell Academy (entered 3 April 1697) and John Chorlton at Manchester (entered 16 March 1699), and ministered at Filby near Yarmouth (till 1722) and Framlingham (till 1731). He afterwards lost his sight, and (about 1757) ceased to identify himself with dissent.

Unlike an air displacement pipette, which dispenses liquid using an air cushion in the pipette tip, the piston in a positive displacement pipette makes direct contact with the sample, allowing the aspiration force to remain constant. == Applications == Since the piston makes direct contact with the sample, the aspiration force in a positive displacement pipette is unaffected by the sample's physical properties. Several liquid handling companies suggest that positive displacement pipettes can be used to accurately pipette very viscous, volatile, hot or cold, or corrosive samples. Viscous liquids Viscous liquids, such as glycerol, flow very slowly. Glycerol has high dynamic viscosity, and if a researcher aspirates a sample of glycerol too quickly with an air displacement pipette, It will draw up air bubble. When a researcher attempts to dispense the liquid, some of it will stick to the pipette tip wall, dispense very slowly and remain in the tip. Surfactants also produce this effect, but the remaining liquid film is thinner. In a positive displacement pipette, the aspiration strength remains constant, so the tip fills evenly. Also, the piston slides along the internal sides of the pipette tip and pushes the total volume out, so no liquid is left behind. Volatile liquids Volatile liquids such as acetone, hexane, and methanol, evaporate continuously in air displacement pipettes. Some volatile liquids expand so quickly that they expand the air column in the pipette, which causes leakage: The pipette will lose drops and dispense liquid imprecisely. As drops leak out, they can contaminate the bench, ultimately causing cross-contamination from sample to sample. These drops can also produce a health hazard. Because there is no air cushion in a positive displacement pipette, liquids do not evaporate or leak. Drops will not fall from the tip, and vapors will not contaminate the internal parts of the pipette. Also, the capillary/piston (CP) tips used for positive displacement pipetting are disposable. Hot or cold liquids In an air displacement pipette, the ambient temperature is correlated with the volume of the air cushion and affects the aspiration volume. Cold liquids, such as a suspension of restriction enzymes, which are usually handled at 0¬∞C, cause the air cushion to shrink and the pipette to aspirate more liquid than expected, making the pipette over-deliver. Hot samples, such as mammalian cell cultures at body temperature or polymerase chain reaction solutions at 60¬∞C or higher, will cause the air cushion to expand, causing the pipette to aspirate less liquid than expected and making the pipette under-deliver. Positive displacement pipettes do not have an air cushion and are less affected by liquid temperature, yielding greater pipetting accuracy. Corrosive and hazardous liquids Corrosive and radioactive liquids may damage the piston, seal, and tip holder in an air displacement pipette. Positive displacement pipettes use a disposable capillary/piston (CP) tip, so the pipette is not affected by corrosive samples over its lifetime. Since there is no contact between the sample and the pipette, there is little risk of contamination. == Pipetting technique == Positive displacement pipettes operate very similarly to air displacement pipettes. Steps for operating a positive displacement pipette # Set the pipetting volume. # Attach a CP tip onto the pipette. # Hold the pipette vertically and press the plunger to the first stop. # Put the CP tip into the sample and slowly release it, moving the button to the home position. # Press the plunger to the first stop again to dispense the sample. # Press the plunger to the second stop to eject the CP tip. == References == Category:Laboratory equipment Category:Volumetric instruments ","title":"Positive displacement pipette"},{"id":"56092006","text":"Si Juki is an Indonesian comic series created and authored by Faza Ibnu Ubaidillah Salman or Faza Meonk. Originally published as webcomic in 2010, the comics follow its namesake character Juki, a deviant young adult male throughout a variety of humorous scenarios and adventures. Published in both print and WEBTOON in addition to various social media platforms, an animated movie has been released based on the series in 2017. ==Publication history== In 2010, Faza created his first comic, initially titled DKV 4 in form of a 4-panel comic. In these early publications, the main character was named Marzuki (from which the nickname Juki was derived). At that time, he was a student of visual communication (Indonesian: Desain Komunikasi Visual) at Bina Nusantara University, and the comic was a satire of student life in said faculty. After his work gained popularity on his own Facebook page and in the online community Kaskus, Faza decided to put his comic to print in 2011, titling it Ngampus!!! Buka-bukaan Aib Mahasiswa. The comic was well-received and Faza went on to focus on the series, publishing several books and extending its social media reach. By the end of 2016, Si Juki had had 20 titles, 15 of them in print. Due to the title's popularity, WEBTOON contacted Faza to publish Si Juki in 2015. The first title released on the site was Si Juki Lika Liku Anak Kos. Later that year, Si Juki won the Global Popularity Award for non-Korean webtoons on the platform. In 2016, it was revealed that the series was to be adapted into an animated movie featuring high-profile voice actors such as Bunga Citra Lestari and comedian Indro Warkop. The movie, titled Si Juki The Movie: Panitia Hari Akhir, was released on 28 December 2017. ==Style== Initially taking manga drawing courses in junior high school, Faza later studied to be an animator and his designs were initially made through graphic software instead of with pen and paper. Juki's bucktoothed, large-eyed design was meant to make him an iconic, easy-to-recognize character. In the comic, Juki's behavior and style are commonly described as \\"anti-mainstream\\", which is also commonly used to describe the series. In an interview with SWA, Faza stated that he wanted to create a unique style, distinct from both western-style comics and local titles such as Si Unyil. According to Faza, he based the humor in Si Juki on SpongeBob SquarePants' all-age humor. ==Reception== Si Juki's first title on WEBTOON, Lika Liku Anak Kos, had over 600,000 followers. As of 2018, 5 Si Juki titles are accessible in WEBTOON. Two of the printed books Berani Beda and Berani Gagal sold over 100,000 copies altogether. Faza stated in 2015 that his nine-man team earned about Rp 60 million (USD 4,250) per month from the comic. Si Juki The Movie received over 300,000 audiences in its first four days of screening. Si Juki- themed stickers has also been released for Facebook Messenger and LINE, the latter receiving over a million downloads within two days. An inspired mobile game for iOS and Android was released in 2016. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Faza Meonk's works on WEBTOON *Si Juki on Twitter *Si Juki on Instagram Category:2010 webcomic debuts Category:2010s webcomics Category:Indonesian comedy webcomics Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Webcomics in print ","title":"Si Juki"},{"id":"56092011","text":"Suzanne Aspden is professor of music at Jesus College, University of Oxford.

NGC 4522 is losing its molecular gas though ram-pressure stripping as it plows though the cluster at a speed of more than 10 million kilometres per hour. The galaxy was discovered by astronomer John Herschel on January 18, 1828. ==Ram-pressure stripping== The selectively disturbed interstellar medium (ISM) of NGC 4522, together with a normal-appearing stellar disk, strongly suggest that the galaxy is undergoing ram-pressure stripping caused by an interaction between the intracluster medium (ICM) of the surrounding Virgo Cluster with the ISM of the galaxy itself. However at NGC 4522's projected distance from Messier 87 ( ‚àº1 Mpc), and assumption of a static smooth ICM and other \\"standard values\\", the force of the ram-pressure stripping exerted at the galaxy's location appears to be an order of magnitude less to cause the observed truncation of the galaxy's gas disk. Despite this, NGC 4522 may have recently passed through a region of enhanced ICM density. Possibly, the infall of the Messier 49 group into the Virgo Cluster has stirred up the ICM of the cluster, locally enhancing the ram pressure exerted on NGC 4522. GALEX image of NGC 4522 showing the gas in the galaxy being stripped. ==Features== In NGC 4522, there are several features that have been suggested to be attributes of ram-pressure stripping. The Northeast region of NGC 4522, contains a large, continuous dust lane that curves out of the disk of the galaxy that is known as \\"The dust upturn‚Äù. The region also contains a wide lane of stars, including many young blue stars that has been named \\"The stellar upturn\\". At the top of the upturn, there are a couple of distinct HII regions. The Southwest region features a number of decoupled extraplanar dust clouds and an arm structure containing a number of HII regions and groupings of bright young blue stars. Hubble Space Telescope image of NGC 4522 showing a number of newly formed star clusters that formed in the stripped gas. ==Star Formation== As a consequence of ram- pressure stripping, NGC 4522 has a shrunken star forming disk with an enhanced rate of star formation in the inner regions while there is lack of star formation in the outer disk. Some of the newly formed stars in NGC 4522 are forming in H II regions in filaments of stripped gas rising from the star forming disk of the galaxy. These stars may enter the halo of NGC 4522 or escape into intergalactic space. ==See also== * List of NGC objects (4001‚Äì5000) * NGC 4402 * NGC 4330 * ESO 137-001 == References External links== Category:Virgo (constellation) Category:Spiral galaxies 4522 41729 7711 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1828 Category:Virgo Cluster Category:Discoveries by John Herschel ","title":"NGC 4522"},{"id":"56092050","text":"The 2011 S√£o Tom√© (Island or Regional) Second Division took place that season.

She studies gas giant planets in the solar system and exoplanets. She is a member of the research team of Juno, a probe to study the planet Jupiter. In 2015, she accurately calculated Saturn's rotational period together with Eli Galanti and Yohai Kaspi of the Weizmann Institute of Science. In 2015, selected among the 50 most influential women of Forbes Israel. == Biography == She completed her bachelor's degree in science at Tel Aviv University in 2004. She continued her doctoral studies at Tel Aviv University, which she completed in 2007. Her PhD work was on giant planet formation. From 2007 to 2009 she was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California Los Angeles in the Department of Planetary Science. In 2009, she was appointed a research fellow. During her time at the University of California, she studied the influence of planetesimals on the formation of gas giants, and modelled the outer planets in the solar system. In 2011 she was appointed Senior Lecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences of Tel Aviv University. In 2015, she was appointed Associate Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences. In 2016 became a professor at the Institute for Computational Science at the University of Zurich. She is a member of the UZH Space Hub. Helled is part of the scientific team of the NASA Juno probe, which is investigating the planet Jupiter. She is also one of the chief scientists of the European Space Agency's JUICE Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer and also the research team of the European Space Agency's Space Telescope PLATO (spacecraft) which is scheduled to be launched in 2024. == Research == Planetary formation Helled's research deals with the formation and evolution of planets in the solar system. The study examines the relationship between the formation of the planets and their internal structure, for the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. The processes that lead to the formation of planets in our solar system are compared to the formation of exoplanets. The study also examines whether a uniform mechanism can be found predicting the formation of the planets, and the differences between different planetary systems and the physical processes that influence the formation of planets in a particular system.The formation and development of planets, and the internal models of planets Research topics of Ravit Helled at the Tel Aviv University site, March 15, 2015  Internal structure of planets and time of internal rotation  Helled's research group also examines the internal structure of the planets and their composition. In the study, computational models are developed to predict the dynamic behaviour of the planet and compare it with existing observations. In the study, the team is investigating the velocities of the gas giants' internal-rotation and whether the structure can be related to the atmospheric movement of these planets.  Calculating the rotation periods of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune  In 2010, Helled and collaborators suggested that the rotation periods of both Uranus and Neptune are in fact unknown. They suggested that the length of day on the ice giants are ~16.58 hr (Uranus) and 17.46 (Neptune). In 2015, Helled and collaborators accurately calculated Saturn's rotation time (10 hours, 32 minutes, 45 seconds). The previous calculation was based on measurements of the Voyager 2 probe in 1981. However, calculations from the Cassini probe showed that there is a discrepancy in numbers and there is a gap in the understanding and calculating of the Saturn's rotation time. The problem is that the components of Saturn's atmosphere, especially hydrogen and helium, travel at different speeds and do not attest to Saturn's own rotation. Therefore, Helled's research was based on calculating the speed of rotation by measuring Saturn's gravitational field and calculating its density and oblateness (the fact that its polar diameter is smaller than its equatorial diameter).  Obstacles to the movement of winds in Uranus and Neptune  Together with Yohai Kaspi and Oded Aaronson of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Adam Schumann, and Bill Hubbard of the University of Arizona, Helled succeeded in calculating that the strong winds blowing over Neptune and Uranus are limited to an atmosphere layer whose depth is not more than 1,000 km.Yohai Kaspi, Adam P. Showman, William B. Hubbard, Oded Aharonson & Ravit Helled, Atmospheric confinement of jet streams on Uranus and Neptune Nature 497, 344‚Äì347 (16 May 2013) doi:10.1038/nature12131, Weizmann Institute In Neptune, these winds blow at speeds of about 2,000 km/h, with storms and strong jet currents. Since the discovery of these winds by the Voyager 2 probe, researchers have been trying to find out the extent of the phenomenon of wind, in order to better understand the composition of these ice giants. The team modelled the influence of the winds on the gravitational field of the planets and to show that the jet currents constitute only a small percentage of the planet's mass. The movement of the winds changes the momentary mass of the planet and thus a fluctuation in its gravitational field. By calculating the relationship between the pressure and density for the wind pattern and measuring the torque, they proved that the wind layer is limited to 1,000 km and constitutes only a few percent of the planet's mass. The researchers were able to create a map of the gravitational field of the planets based on wind data. == Selected publications == * Ravit Helled, John D Anderson, Gerald Schubert, Morris Podolak.

During the Cold War it was a training formation of the Soviet Ground Forces. It was originally formed as the 80th Guards Rifle Division on the 1st of March 1943 from the second formation of the 298th Rifle Division after the Battle of Stalingrad. After which it remained in reserve until August, when it joined the 4th Guards Army, taking part in the Battle of the Dnieper, Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive, and the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. The division became part of the Central Group of Forces after the end of the war. On 1 November 1945, it was converted into the 16th Guards Mechanized Division, before relocating to Samarkand in the Turkestan Military District. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered as the 80th Guards, restoring its World War II designation. In May 1970, after the Central Asian Military District was formed, the 80th Guards Training Motor Rifle Division () transferred to Otar-2 (renamed Gvardeysky) near Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan and became part of the new district. In 1987, the division was renamed the 210th Guards District Center when all training divisions became training centers. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the center became part of the Kazakh Ground Forces in 1992. == World War II == It was originally formed as the 80th Guards Rifle Division on 1 March 1943 from the second formation of the 298th Rifle Division in honor of the \\"exemplary fulfillment of combat missions\\" of the latter during the Battle of Stalingrad. The 886th, 888th, and 892nd Rifle Regiments became the 217th Guards, the 230th Guards, and the 232nd Guards, respectively; the 828th Artillery Regiment became the 171st Guards, and the rest of the division's units also became Guards units. The division remained in reserve, receiving reinforcements and reequipping, until early August, when it joined the 4th Guards Army, concentrated in the forests southwest of Stary Oskol. Between 8 and 13 August the 80th Guards moved forward to the front line at Grayvoron. In a period of two and a half months, the division marched around at night. Joining the Voronezh Front, the 4th Guards Army was concentrated east of Akhtyrka. During the Battle of the Dnieper, the troops of the front broke through the German lines at Akhtyrka and crossed the Vorskla River at Kuzmino. The army's 68th Guards Rifle Division captured Mikhailovka. After being pushed back, the German troops held positions on the line of Bilsk on the Kotelevka River, but began retreating on 22 September. In two days, the 80th Guards advanced against the German rear guard, reaching positions west of Poltava. In early October, the division, along with the rest of 21st Guards Rifle Corps, began crossing the Dnieper. The 80th Guards, under the command of Colonel A.E. Yakovlev, were tasked with the main crossing on the night of 5‚Äì6 October. The first to cross the river were soldiers of Colonel Pyotr Kamishnikov's 230th Guards Rifle Regiment's 3rd Battalion, under the command of Captain Nikolay Zaryanov. At 20:00 hours on 5 October, a submachine gun company led by Lieutenant Alexey Priglebov launched its boats from Koldovoy Island. The crossing was met by a hail of German fire, but the battalion managed to establish a bridgehead on the opposite bank. The bridgehead was reinforced and expanded despite multiple German counterattacks by the rest of the division; Zaryanov and Priglebov were made Heroes of the Soviet Union for their actions. By the morning of 6 October, the entire 230th Regiment was across the river, and the division continued its westward advance. The division fought in the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive, encircling a German pocket, in January and February 1944. In the spring it helped capture Zvenigorodka, and on 5 March attacked at Olkhovets during the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive, advancing through the mud of the spring rasputitsa. The division, alongside the rest of the army, opened a penetration in the Axis line, and advanced west. == Postwar == The division, with the army's 20th Guards Rifle Corps, became part of the Central Group of Forces after the end of the war. On 1 November 1945, it was converted into the 16th Guards Mechanized Division, before relocating to Samarkand in the Turkestan Military District and becoming part of the 119th Rifle Corps. The 16th Guards included the 53rd, 54th, and 55th Guards Mechanized Regiments, as well as the 127th Guards and 13th Tank Regiments, the latter of which was disbanded. The 127th Guards were redesignated from the 98th Separate Tank Regiment on 29 June 1945 and joined the division on 1 November. After the division left for Samarkand, the regiment became separate again, but rejoined the 16th Guards in August 1949, replacing the 96th Tank Regiment. The 96th Tank Regiment was formed from the 96th Tank Brigade on 1 November, and briefly was part of the division, but later transferred to the 10th Mechanized Army before it was disbanded on 1 June 1946. The 13th Self-Propelled Heavy Tank Regiment was formed from the 27th Separate Tank Regiment on 1 November, disbanding in the spring of 1957. The 53rd Guards were formed from the 217th Guards Rifle Regiment, the 54th Guards from the 230th, and the 55th Guards from the 232nd. Each mechanized regiment included a separate tank battalion: the 53rd Guards had the 127th Guards, the 54th Guards the 135th Guards, and the 55th Guards the 136th Guards. These battalions were converted into regular numbered battalions of the regiments in the fall of 1953. In September 1949, after the 119th became a mountain rifle corps, the division transferred to the newly formed 17th Rifle Corps. On 25 June 1957, it became the 90th Guards Motor Rifle Division. Around the same time, the corps became the 17th Army Corps. Its mechanized regiments became the 372nd, 54th, and 55th Guards Motor Rifle Regiments, respectively. The 90th Guards became the 90th Guards Training Motor Rifle Division on 24 May 1962, directly subordinated to the district headquarters. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered as the 80th Guards, restoring its World War II designation. In May 1970, after the Central Asian Military District was formed, the 80th Guards transferred to Otar-2 (renamed Gvardeysky) near Alma- Ata in Kazakhstan and became part of the new district. Gvardeysky became a military town, housing the families of the division's personnel. In 1987, the division was renamed the 210th Guards District Center when all training divisions became training centers. The training center included the 55th Guards and 372nd Guards Training Motor Rifle Regiments, the 127th Guards Training Tank Regiment, the 171st Guards Training Artillery Regiment, and the 1289th Training Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, all stationed at Gvardeysky. The center's 66th Training Motor Rifle Regiment was at Arys. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the center became part of the Kazakh Ground Forces in 1992. It was renamed the 210th Guards Training Center for Junior Specialists, and on 6 October 1998 received the honorific named for Karasai Batyr. It was eventually renamed the Training Center for Junior Specialists of the Kazakh Ground Forces named for Karasai Batyr (Military Unit Number 30212). == References ==  Citations   Bibliography  * * Category:Military units and formations of Kazakhstan Category:Army training units and formations ","title":"Training Center for Junior Specialists of the Kazakh Ground Forces named for Karasai Batyr"},{"id":"56092654","text":"Mary Giuliani Stephens (born June 23, 1955) is an American attorney and the former mayor of Woodbury, Minnesota.

The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and reddish-brown with three to five darker markings. The lateral sepals are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are linear, long, about wide and reddish-brown with pale edges. The labellum is cream-coloured to whitish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards through about 90¬∞ near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum having crinkled, wavy edges and there is a shiny green, channelled callus in its centre extending just past the bend. Flowering occurs from late October through November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Prasophyllum pulchellum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected on South Bruny Island and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (pulchellum) is a Latin word meaning \\"beautiful\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The pretty leek orchid is only known from a six sites in the north and south of Tasmania. It grows in heath which often becomes very dense in the absence of fire, making the orchid difficult to locate. ==Conservation== The population of P. pulchellum has been estimated as fewer than 150. It is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are urban development, inappropriate fire regimes and loss of population due to the loss of scattered individual orchids. ==References External links == * pulchellum Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1998 ","title":"Prasophyllum pulchellum"},{"id":"56092787","text":"The 2003 Regal Scottish Open was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place between 5‚Äì13 April 2003 at the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, Scotland.

She moved to the United States around 1842 during the industrial and Victorian eras. Cridge was an author who wrote primarily about women's rights and spiritualism. In the mid-nineteenth century, spiritualism was considered the only religious group that recognized the equality of women. Anne Braude, in her book, Radical Spirits, defines spiritualism as ‚Äúa new religious movement aimed at proving the immortality of the soul by establishing communication with the spirits of the dead‚Ä¶ It provided an alternative to the established religious order. It held two attractions to thousands of Americans: rebellion against death and rebellion against authority‚Äù. == Biography == Annie Denton Cridge was born Annie Denton, in England in 1825. In the 1840s she and her brother William emigrated to America, where she married Alfred Cridge. Cridge and her husband lived in Dayton, Ohio, and published a newspaper called the Vanguard. The Vanguard was dedicated to ‚Äúspiritualism, positive reform, and progressive literature‚Äù. It was published during the crisis of faith which emerged in the nineteenth century in response to the break away from romanticism and the emergence of scientific developments. Cridge underwent her own crisis of faith, which was marked by two incidents in her early twenties that transitioned her into the literary and political spheres. When Cridge was twenty-two, she began an autobiographical series of articles titled ‚ÄúMy Soul‚Äôs Thraldom and Its Deliverance.‚Äù A portion of the work was published in each edition of the Vanguard. The series discusses her rejection of her Evangelical upbringing in England, which was how her parents raised her. She said that her parent's Methodist doctrines ‚Äúmade heaven into hell‚Äù. In chapter six of her autobiography, she writes, ‚ÄúReligion! call it not by that name: 'tis the demon of misery. What else could blight the silvery laugh of youth, freeze the gushings of joy and chain the soul in everlasting night!‚Äù. She struggled to find the spiritual truth, fluctuating among different perceptions of the religious practices of the day. Additionally, she underwent a life-changing occurrence in 1857, when she was twenty-three. She gave birth to a baby boy, but he only survived a few months. After her son's death, it is recorded that Cridge ‚Äúsaw the spirits of her own dead parents above his couch, waiting to bear his sweet spirit away. She watched her baby‚Äôs spirit withdraw from his body and assume a spiritual body, with the help of his [deceased] grandparents‚Äù. During the 1860s the Cridges worked as reformers in Washington DC. (Alfred later wrote the book \\"Proportional Representation including its relationship to initiative and referendum,\\" published in 1904.)ABEBooks listing Jan 2020 By 1870 she was living in Pennsylvania. Cridge had a surviving son, Alfred Denton Cridge, who wrote a science fiction work: Utopia; Or, the History of an Extinct Planet, Psychometrically Explained (1884), one of the earliest U.S. science fiction novels . == Notable Works ==  \\"Man's Rights; Or, How Would You Like It? Comprising Dreams\\"  Cridge published Man's Rights, a work of utopian science fiction and satire, in 1870. It is the first known feminist utopian novel written by a woman. The text features nine dreams experienced by a first-person female narrator. In the first seven dreams she visits the planet Mars, finding a society where traditional sex roles and stereotypes are reversed. The narrator witnesses the oppression of the men on Mars and their struggle for equality. Although initially confined to the home and strictly controlled, they can start working towards their liberation after technological advancements free them from some of their grueling domestic chores. In the last two dreams, the narrator visits a future United States, ruled by a woman president and with an equal balance of men and women in the House and Senate. Legislators have begun to stop fining and imprisoning female prostitutes, and it is now the male clients who get arrested and sent to reformatories. A large number of women have taken up farming, and the nation has a promising economic future. The narrator concludes by asking whether this dream might not, after all, be a prophecy?  Other Notable Works  Cridge also wrote a fictitious children's novel, titled The Crumb-Basket (1868). This book contains dozens of short stories, only a few pages each, in which she discusses science, religion, and feminism at a very basic level. She writes as a first-person narrator, asking the children about women's rights, children's rights, and spiritualism. One of her stories, titled,‚ÄúTo My Boy Friends,‚Äù is directed toward young boys. She asks them: > Probably you have heard of women‚Äôs rights. First, think of your merry sister > and cousin, Lizzie or Emma, with their bright eyes and musical voices; and > then tell me if you would not like them to be as happy and as free as you > are when you are men and they women. Don‚Äôt you think they ought to be > educated as well as you; to earn as much money, and have the right to use it > as their own? Don‚Äôt you think they should assist in making the laws by > which they are to be governed, or to say who shall go to Congress, as much > as men? Cridge also wrote autobiographical nonfiction, such as ‚ÄúMy Soul‚Äôs Thraldom and Its Deliverance‚Äù (1856), and other serial pieces, such as ‚ÄúLaws of Friendship,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Story from Real Life,‚Äù and obituaries about her son's death. Many of her articles can be read in the archived issues of Vanguard found at The International Association for the Preservation of Spiritualist and Occult Periodicals. == Literary significance ==  Literary elements  In the spirit of the Victorian era, two literary elements Cridge used in her work are psychological realism and stream-of-consciousness. She writes through stream- of-consciousness in Man‚Äôs Rights by writing a series of dreams in a first- person narrative, interrupted by her own thoughts within the dream, and also discusses her literal writing of the dream outside the narrative. For example, after inscribing her dream, she writes, ‚ÄúI awoke: it was all a dream. My husband stood at my bedside. ‚ÄúAnnie, Annie!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAwake Annie! That new girl of yours is good for nothing. You will have to rise and attend to her, else I shall have no breakfast.... I arose: and, as my husband ate his breakfast, I pondered over my strange dream‚Äù, relaying her stories through a realistic rather than romantic means. Her sense perceptions, conscious and unconscious thoughts intermingle, uninterrupted by a forced narration. Additionally, Cridge focuses on the motivations and internal thoughts of characters in Man‚Äôs Rights and The Crumb-Basket. Psychological realism is, therefore, discovered in her story-telling method. Cridge also practices several elements of modern writers: writing embedded in the present culture and creative-writer-as-critic. T.S. Elliot writes that creative writing should be aware of the present culture. All of Cridge's fiction and nonfiction debates the most current issues of the time, pushing her toward the modern and further away from romanticism. Additionally, a quality of Virginia Woolf's writing is used by Cridge, creative-writer as critic. While Cridge tells children's stories that are fictional, each story has a political message embedded in her story-telling language. She appeals to children, asking them how they feel about inequality between men and women, and criticizes traditional gender stereotypes of female domesticity and fragility and male oppression of emotion. In one of her stories, she tells women to ‚Äúromp, shout and dance merrily; you have two hundred and nine muscles that must be exercised. Run, and shout too; for your lungs need full breath and pure air, as much as the flowers need the dews and sunshine‚Äù merging women's rights topics with descriptive language.  Literary precepts  The works of Annie Denton Cridge can be critically categorized with feminist writing both before and after her time. Cridge shares similarities with Christine de Pizan, a medieval creative writer who wrote a Utopian story, The Book of the City of Ladies. She wrote as a creative writer as critic, utilized satire, and interlaced religious belief into her work. Both Pizan and Cridge joined a male-dominated literary community before their time, and contributed to female Utopian literature. Lee Cullen Khanna, a feminist utopia critic, wrote that ‚Äúutopias can be spiritual or religious in their effect‚Äù as they symbolize a changed society. Utopias by women ‚Äúfrequently mirror what women lacked and what women wanted at the time when the books were published‚Äù. In their utopian societies, women typically focus on intangible features of human existence, such as family, sexuality, and marriage. However, Cridge was writing in the ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù phase between 1790 and 1880. Characteristically of feminist writers of the era, she denied her place as an ‚Äúangel of the house,‚Äù and joined writers such as Ann Radcliffe, Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen as writers of the novel. However, her writing was transitional, crossing over into the feminist and female phases. She was a less-progressive precursor to Mina Loy's Feminist Manifesto during the feminist era between 1880 and 1930. Their primary connection was a focus on marriage reform. Loy writes, ‚ÄúThe value of man is assessed entirely according to his use or interest to the community, the value of woman depends entirely on chance, her success or in success in maneuvering a man into taking the life-long responsibility of her.\\" Similarly, Cridge writes about degraded women whose only ‚Äúbusiness is to get married,‚Äù and in her satiric Men's Rights, in which Victorian roles of men and women are reversed, a father tells his son that all he has to do is ‚Äúlearn to be a good housekeeper; for you will be married one day and have to attend to your children.\\" Cridge asks herself ‚Äúwhy are they in this pitiable condition?‚Äù presenting her stance on marriage through fiction rather than pure criticism. Furthermore, Cridge was a precursor to Virginia Woolf of the female phase, from 1930 to today, as Woolf believed that masculine and feminine writing is inherently different. Cridge wrote ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù fiction rather than ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù journalism, and explored domestic, marriage, and single life for women in comparison to men -- all focuses of Woolf's criticism. Also, Cridge and Woolf both write as creative-writers-as-critics and use the stream-of- consciousness technique. == References == Category:American suffragists Category:1825 births Category:1875 deaths Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:People from Dayton, Ohio Category:19th-century American newspaper publishers (people) ","title":"Annie Denton Cridge"},{"id":"56092796","text":"Constantina \\"Connie\\" Allen (September 24, 1926 ‚Äì August 30, 1991) was an American singer and musician.

He oversaw the deportation and relocation of ethnic groups from the North Caucasus, which was planned and organized by Lavrentiy Beria and approved by Stalin. Mikhail Gvishiani is particularly known for his involvement in the burning of some 700 civilians in what would later become known as the Khaibakh massacre. == Early life == Mikhail Givishiani was born into a Georgian farmworker's family. He graduated school and became active as assistant-chef, assistant driver and also watchmen for a hospital in Akhaltsikhe. In 1924 he began to work as a clerk and deputy department manager in a sub-branch of the Soviet Ministry of Finance. After entering the Red Army in 1928, Gvishiani was assigned to the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU) and posted for matters concerning the Far East of the Soviet Union, until 1938. == NKVD career == From 1928 to 1938 lieutenant Gvishiani was assigned to and took charge of various divisions and departments of mainly Georgian branches of the Soviet secret police apparatus NKVD. He got promoted to major in 1936 and two years and two promotions later in 1938 was deployed as chief to 3rd Special Division of the First Main Directorate in the Novosibirsk Oblast where he served as a Commissar of State Security 3rd Class. During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 Givishiani was awarded several decorations for repatriating all industrial assets from Manchuria to the Soviet Union, for which he was promoted to lieutenant general the same year. == Operation Lentil == On February 27, 1944 Colonel Gvishiani ordered the killing of over 200 Chechen civilians via telegram in what is known as the Khaibakh massacre. In 2014 the Russian Ministry of Culture dismissed any claims of a massacre in Kaibakh as \\"historical falsification\\", even though an overall consensus of other sources consider the massacre historical fact. The Russian Ministry of Culture did not dispute that he took a significant role in the deportations of ethnic groups during Operation Lentil.Salamat Gayev, Musa Hadisov, Tamara Chagaeva. –•–∞–π–±–∞—Ö: –°–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è Grozny, 1994. pg 352 == Ousting and discharge == With Berias downfall in 1953 Gvishiani lost his patron and as a political consequence was discharged, officially due to a conflict of authority, and deemed unworthy to hold the rank of a general officer. However, he was neither imprisoned nor stripped of his rank.

It centers on the story of Annie (Rose Byrne), and her unlikely romance with singer-songwriter Tucker Crowe (Ethan Hawke), who is also the subject of her boyfriend's (Chris O'Dowd) long-time music obsession. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2018. ==Plot== Annie Platt contemplates escaping her hometown of Sandcliff, England, her job as a curator in a local museum, and her unhappy relationship with Duncan, a college teacher obsessed with Tucker Crowe, an American musician last heard from in 1993. An album titled Juliet, Naked arrives in the mail, containing acoustic demos from Crowe‚Äôs breakthrough album Juliet. Annie and Duncan argue over its quality, and Annie writes a negative review on Duncan's fan site dedicated to Crowe. Crowe himself emails Annie, thanking her for her honesty, and they strike up a correspondence. Crowe shares his regrets at being a poor father to four children from three different mothers (later revealed to be five children with four different mothers), and Annie discloses her disappointment at not having children. Crowe lives on his ex‚Äôs property to be near his youngest son Jackson in America. Lizzie, his pregnant daughter from another relationship, visits from London; it is revealed Crowe also has twin sons from yet another relationship. Before leaving, Lizzie offers him the phone number of his other daughter Grace, whom he has never met. Duncan invites Gina, a new teacher at his college, over to hear the album, and they sleep together. He confesses this to Annie, who breaks up with him and asks him to move out. When Lizzie has her baby prematurely, Crowe takes Jackson with him to London to check on her. Crowe and Annie agree to meet, but he suffers a heart attack. Annie visits him in the hospital, where she meets Jackson, Lizzie, and most of Crowe‚Äôs exes and other children who have flown to his bedside. Crowe asks to see Sandcliff, and he and Jackson come to stay with Annie. Duncan runs into Annie and Crowe, who introduces himself, but Duncan does not believe him. Annie discovers Duncan lurking outside her home, and Crowe proves his identity with his passport. Duncan stays for dinner, but his obsession with Crowe‚Äôs work annoys Crowe, who declares that he thinks 'Juliet' is worthless. Duncan leaves, asserting that art may mean more to the audience than the artist, and how important the album has been to him. Crowe tells Annie why he left music 25 years ago: Julie, his ex whose breakup inspired Juliet, visited him at his concert with their child, Grace. Left holding the baby, Crowe panicked, leaving her in the restroom and walking away from the concert and music entirely. Crowe calls Grace, but she wants nothing to do with him. At Annie‚Äôs museum exhibition, she confesses her romantic interest in Crowe, who reciprocates. The town‚Äôs mayor has Crowe sing for the exhibition, and he reluctantly performs ‚ÄúWaterloo Sunset‚Äù by The Kinks. That night, Annie and Crowe attempt to have sex, but are interrupted by an ill Jackson, who wants to go home. Annie drives Crowe and Jackson to the home of Lizzie, who has been abandoned by her son‚Äôs father, and Annie says farewell. Back home, Annie is at a bar when Duncan pleads for a fresh start together, but she declines. A year later, Annie emails Crowe, explaining that she has moved to London and decided to have a child on her own; they agree to meet. During the credits, a video of Duncan from his site reveals that Crowe has released a new album So Where Was I?, inspired by Annie. The album‚Äôs song titles, and Duncan's scathing critique, suggests that Crowe and Annie are living happily together, much to Duncan‚Äôs chagrin. ==Cast== * Rose Byrne as Annie Platt * Ethan Hawke as Tucker Crowe * Chris O'Dowd as Duncan Thomson * Azhy Robertson as Jackson, Tucker‚Äôs son * Lily Brazier as Ros Platt, Annie‚Äôs sister * Ayoola Smart as Lizzie, Tucker‚Äôs daughter * Lily Newmark as Carly * Denise Gough as Gina * Eleanor Matsuura as Cat, Tucker‚Äôs ex * Megan Dodds as Carrie, Tucker‚Äôs ex *Emma Paetz as Grace * Jimmy O.

It is endemic to New Zealand. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1923. George Hudson in The Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand treated A. dentata as a synonym of Aletia cuneata. Philpott argued against this. Philpott was of the opinion that A. dentata was a separate species as it was darker and smaller than A. cuneata. However he felt unable to confirm this through genitalia examination as no male specimens were available at that time. The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the genus Aletia is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. It is likely that this species will be removed from the genus Aletia and be placed within one of the following genera: Physetica, Graphania, Tmetolophota or Ichneutica. As such the species is currently also known as Aletia (s.l.) dentata. ==Description== Philpott reported that the species had a 34-36mm wingspan. He described the species as being similar to Aletia cuneata but distinguishable as A. dentata has darker colouring and ochreous cilia on its hind wings. == Distribution == A. dentata was discovered by J. G. Myers at Tongariro, in the North Island of New Zealand. Myers observed the species resting on rocks during the day as well as deceased specimens within a tramping hut. == Ecology and habitat == Adults can be active during the day and frequent montane and alpine areas. == References External links== *Holotype specimen of A. dentata Category:Moths described in 1923 Category:Hadeninae Category:Moths of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand ","title":"Aletia dentata"},{"id":"56093407","text":"Rudolf Klimmer (17 May 1905 ‚Äì 26 July 1977) was a German psychologist and sexologist who was an early gay activist, most notable for his work in the German Democratic Republic. ==Biography== Klimmer was the son of renowned veterinary professor Martin Klimmer, and attended medical school at the University of Leipzig. In 1926, he joined the Communist Party of Germany while continuing his studies, and he earned his doctorate in 1930. His career was cut temporarily short when the Nazis rose to power in the early 1930s, and he worked for a time as a ship's doctor for the Hamburg America Line in the Americas and Asia. He returned to Germany in 1934 and became the senior physician at the Bethel Institution in Bielefeld. Due to his political affiliations, however, he was jailed twice by the Nazi regime in 1938 and 1941, for sentences of five months and a year, respectively, and was banned from medical practice. Nonetheless, he continued to perform medical research for Schering AG throughout the duration of the war.Bernd-Ulrich Hergem√∂ller: Mann f√ºr Mann. Ein biographisches Lexikon, suhrkamp taschenbuch, Frankfurt am Main 2001, S. 557f. He married a lesbian in the 1930s to avoid the persecution of gay people in Nazi Germany.McLellan, Josie. Love in the Time of Communism: Intimacy and Sexuality in the GDR. Cambridge University Press, 2011. After the war, Klimmer opened up a psychiatric practice in Leipzig, and joined the Socialist Unity Party, the ruling party of the newly formed East Germany. Using his political ties, he attempted multiple times to repeal Paragraph 175 from the criminal code, which prohibited homosexuality. In 1954 Klimmer personally asked Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to decriminalize homosexuality and repeal Paragraph 175, to no avail. He became director of a sexual health institute and formed a committee to lobby in the Volkskammer. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he wrote pro-gay works, but had to publish them in Hamburg due to publishing restrictions in the East. Thanks to his tireless work, no more convictions were made in the East under Paragraph 175 after 1957, and his efforts, along with those of Kurt Freund, pushed the GDR to fully decriminalize homosexuality in 1968, a year before West Germany.Manfred Herzer, J. Edgar Bauer (Hrsg.): Hundert Jahre Schwulenbewegung, Verlag rosa Winkel, 1998, , p. 55.

The role of Civil Governments has become smaller since their creation in 1835. At first they had broad powers of representation of the central government and the responsibility to coordinate all State services within the District; currently, they serve as, in practice, local delegations of the Ministry of Internal Administration, charged with issuing passports, public safety, and electoral procedure. In 2011, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho de facto abolished all Civil Governments with Decree-Law No. 114/2011 of 30 November, that transfers all competences of the Civil Governments to other administrative bodies (such as the Municipal Chambers, the Police, the National Republican Guard, and the National Authority for Civil Protection).

It runs from Store Kongensgade in the southeast to Rigensgade in the northwest and is closed to through traffic at Sankt Pauls Plads. ==History== Gedde's district map of Sankt Ann√¶ Vester Kvarter Gernersgade traces its history back to Christian IV's foundation of the Nyboder naval barracks in 1631 but different sections of it were originally known under individual names. The section from Store Kongensgade to Borgergade is on Gedde's district map of Sankt Ann√¶ Vestre Kvarter called Hinde L√¶ngden (The Doe Row) while the section from Borgergade to Adelgade was called Gamle Gade (Old Street) and the section from Adelgade to Rigensgade is called Meriangade /Marjoram Street). Two of the names follow the general naming practice of Nyboder where the streets in the eastern part of the quarter is named after animal species and streets in the western part is named after herbs and medical plants. Hinde L√¶ngden was later renamed Nygade (New Street) while Gamlegade was renamed Kanelgade (Cinnamon Street). In 1859 Nygade was renamed Gernersgade to commemorate the naval officer and shipbuilder Henrik Gerner. Kanelgade and Meriangade was included in Gernersgade in 1893. ==Notable buildings and residents== A Grey Row to the left (No. 17-31) and the formerGernersgade Barracks on the right The Nyboder houses that now line part of the street do not date from Christian IV's time but are later models. The yellow, two-storey terrace at No. 2-18 is an example of the houses that now dominate the quarter. They date from the 1850s and were designed by Philip de Lange. The terraces at No. 17-31 and No. 24-44 are examples of the so-called Grey Rows that were built between 1886 and 1893 to design by Olaf Schmidt with inspiration from Arbejdernes Byggeforening's building society houses. Norgergade 144: Building from 1854 Bygningskulturens Hus, a centre dedicated to historic architecture, is located at the corner with Borgergade. The building was originally constructed as a girls' school for daughters of personnel of the Royal Danish Navy but was later converted into a naval cadet academy and then army barracks. Realea (now Realdania Byg) acquired the building in 2003 and it was subsequently put through a comprehensive refurbishment which adapted it to its current use. The building at the opposite corner with Borgergade (Borgergade 144) is from 1854 and was possibly designed by Peter Christoph Hagemann. It was listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1978. The townhouses at No. 49-67 were built in 1870-72 by Frederik B√∏ttger for Arbejdernes Byggeforening to provide affordable, good-quality homes for workers at the B&W; shipyard. More of the same type of houses are located in the neighbouring street Krussemyntegade. St. Paul's Church, whose chancel faces Gernersgade, is from 1877 and was designed by Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Gernersgade at indenforvoldene.dk Category:Streets in Copenhagen ","title":"Gernersgade"},{"id":"56093788","text":"Mirage is an album by vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson featuring performances recorded in 1991 and released on Orrin Keepnews' Landmark label.Fitzgerald, M., Landmark Records listing accessed December 20, 2017Bobby Hutcherson Catalog, accessed December 20, 2017Jazzlists: Landmark 1500 series discography, accessed February 4, 2019 ==Reception== On Allmusic, Scott Yanow observed \\"This quartet date by Bobby Hutcherson works quite well due to the chemistry between the vibist and pianist Tommy Flanagan. ...

Adam Levine and Blake Shelton returned for their fourteenth season as coaches. Meanwhile, Alicia Keys returned for her third season after a one-season hiatus, alongside new coach Kelly Clarkson replacing Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson. This season featured two new elements: the Block, added during the Blind Auditions, allows the coaches to block one coach from getting an artist the coach turned around for. The Save, added during the Knockouts, allowed a coach to save an artist from elimination; However, if another coach also pressed his or her Steal button, the contestant could then decide whether they wanted to go to a new team or stay with their coach. On May 22, 2018, Brynn Cartelli was crowned the winner of The Voice. At age 15, Cartelli became the youngest winner in the show's history surpassing Sawyer Fredericks & Danielle Bradbery at 16; Clarkson became the 1st new coach to win on her 1st attempt, & the 3rd female winning coach to win a season (after Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera). Additionally, runner-up Britton Buchanan became the highest-placing artist who advanced via an Instant Save, following Joshua Davis of season eight & Chris Jamison of season seven, who both placed 3rd. ==Coaches and hosts == The coaching lineup changed once again for the fourteenth season. Adam Levine and Blake Shelton returned as coaches, making them the only members of the coaching panel to be part of all fourteen seasons. Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson were replaced by new coaches Kelly Clarkson, who was Team Blake's battle advisor in the second season and key advisor for the Knockout Rounds in the thirteenth season, and Alicia Keys who returned to the panel, Carson Daly returned for his fourteenth season as host. This season's advisors for the Battle Rounds were Julia Michaels for Team Adam, Shawn Mendes for Team Alicia, Hailee Steinfeld for Team Kelly, and Trace Adkins for Team Blake. The coaches perform a medley set in vintage Las Vegas in the promo. Adam Levine and Blake Shelton duet on \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", Kelly Clarkson and Alicia Keys perform an amazing version of \\"Feeling Good\\". ¬∑ Notes: At 19, Shawn Mendes became the youngest advisor on the American version of this show's history. ==Teams== Color key {  style=\\"text- align:center; width:100%;\\" + - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15%;\\"  Coaches ! colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"width:85%\\"  Top 48 artists - ! rowspan=\\"4\\"  Adam Levine  colspan=\\"6\\" 555;\\" -  width=\\"14%\\" E8CCD7\\" Rayshun LaMarr  width=\\"14%\\" E8CCD7\\" Jackie Verna  width=\\"14%\\" E8CCD7\\" Sharane Calister  width=\\"14%\\" FF9999\\"Mia Boostrom  width=\\"14%\\" FF9999\\" _Drew Cole_  width=\\"14%\\" FF9999;\\"Reid Umstattd -  BFFFC0;\\" ~~Gary Edwards~~  BFFFC0;\\" ~~Jackie Foster~~  A8E4A0;\\" Jordyn Simone  FFFDD0;\\" ~~Miya Bass~~  FFFDD0;\\" ~~Keys~~  FDFD96\\" Angel Bonilla -  FDFD96\\" Stephanie Skipper  FDFD96\\" Genesis Diaz  FDFD96\\" Davison  ccc;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" - ! rowspan=\\"4\\"  Alicia Keys  colspan=\\"6\\" 555;\\" -  b0e0e6;\\" Britton Buchanan  E8CCD7;\\"Jackie Foster  E8CCD7;\\" _Christiana Danielle_  FF9999;\\"Johnny Bliss  FF9999;\\"Terrence Cunningham  FF9999;\\"Kelsea Johnson -  BFFFC0;\\" ~~Sharane Calister~~  A8E4A0;\\" Dallas Caroline  A8E4A0;\\" Miya Bass  FFFDD0\\" ~~Jaclyn Lovey~~  FFFDD0\\" ~~Jordyn Simone~~  FDFD96\\" Livia Faith -  FDFD96\\" Megan Lee  FDFD96\\" Shana Halligan  FDFD96\\" Jamai  ccc;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" - ! rowspan=\\"4\\"  Kelly Clarkson  colspan=\\"6\\" 555;\\" -  style=\\"background:yellow;\\" Brynn Cartelli  E8CCD7;\\"Kaleb Lee  E8CCD7;\\" D.R.

This week's theme is \\"Duet Medley Songs\\". In the semifinals, three artists automatically moved on to next week's finale, the two artists with the fewest votes were immediately eliminated and the middle three contended for the remaining spot in next week's finale via the Instant Save. iTunes bonuses were awarded to Jade (#2), Buchanan (#3), Cartelli (#4), Kaleb Lee (#5), Baird (#7) and Spensha Baker (#10). In addition to their individual songs, each artist performed a duet with another artist in the competition, though these duets were not available for purchase on iTunes. With the elimination of Rayshun LaMarr, Levine no longer had any artists remaining on his team, making it the first time since the fourth season (and the third time since the third season) none of his artists represented in the finale. With the advancement of Cartelli to the finale, Clarkson became the third new coach to successfully get an artist on their team to the finale on their first attempt as a coach, the second being Alicia Keys, who coached W√© McDonald all the way to the finale of the eleventh season, and the first being Usher, who coached Michelle Chamuel all the way to the finale of the fourth season. This also marked the first time ever that two female coaches were represented in the finale. {  center; width:100%;\\" + ! style=\\"width:10%;\\"  Episode ! style=\\"width:10%;\\"  Coach ! style=\\"width:05%;\\"  Order ! style=\\"width:15%;\\"  Artist ! style=\\"width:21%;\\"  Song ! style=\\"width:17%;\\"  Duet Song ! style=\\"width:09%;\\"  Results - ! rowspan=\\"8\\" Episode 25  Kelly Clarkson 1  Brynn Cartelli  fedf00;\\" \\"What the World Needs Now is Love\\"  \\"FourFiveSeconds\\"/\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"  fdfc8f;\\" Public's vote -  Alicia Keys 2  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Jackie Foster  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  \\"Here I Go Again\\"  style=\\"background:pink;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" \\"Believer\\"/\\"Radioactive\\"  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Eliminated -  Adam Levine 3  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Rayshun LaMarr  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  \\"Imagine\\"  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Eliminated -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Blake Shelton 4  Spensha Baker  fedf00;\\"  \\"My Church\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" \\"What's Going On\\"/\\"Rise Up\\"  fdfc8f;\\"  Public's vote - 5  Kyla Jade  fedf00;\\"  \\"Let It Be\\"  fdfc8f;\\"  Public's vote -  Kelly Clarkson  6  Kaleb Lee  fedf00;\\" \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" \\"Hillbilly Bone\\"/\\"Hillbilly Deluxe\\"  b0e0e6;\\" Middle Three -  Blake Shelton  7  Pryor Baird  fedf00;\\" \\"Change the World\\"  b0e0e6;\\"  Middle Three -  Alicia Keys  8  Britton Buchanan  fedf00;\\" \\"The Rising\\"  \\"FourFiveSeconds\\"/\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"  b0e0e6;\\" Middle Three -  colspan=\\"7\\" 555;\\"  - ! colspan=\\"7\\"  Instant Save Performances - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" scope=\\"row\\"  Episode 26  Blake Shelton  1  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Pryor Baird  style=\\"background:pink;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  \\"Soulshine\\"  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Eliminated -  Kelly Clarkson  2  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Kaleb Lee  style=\\"background:pink;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  \\"Simple Man\\"  style=\\"background:pink;\\"  Eliminated -  Alicia Keys  3  00FA9A;\\"  Britton Buchanan  00FA9A;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" \\"Dancing on My Own\\"  00FA9A;\\"  Instant Save - } {  center;\\" + Non-competition performances - !

Finalists performed a solo cover song, a duet with their coach, and an original song. iTunes bonuses were awarded to Buchanan (#1 and #10), Cartelli (#3 and #6), Baker (#4) and Jade (#9). Buchanan's \\"Where You Come From\\" and Cartelli's \\"Walk My Way\\" are the only songs that charted #1 on iTunes. This is the first time that an artist who won the Instant Save in the semifinals did not finish in the bottom two in the finals (Buchanan finishing 2nd). With Buchanan and Cartelli making it to the Top 2, this marked the first time in which the final results came down to two artists who have neither represented Shelton nor Levine, but two female coaches (Buchanan representing Alicia Keys, and Cartelli representing Kelly Clarkson). {  style=\\"text- align:center; width:100%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"13%\\"  Coach ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"15%\\"  Artist ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"02%\\"  Order ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"19%\\"  Solo Song ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"02%\\"  Order ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"18%\\"  Duet Song (with Coach) ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"02%\\"  Order ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"18%\\"  Original Song ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Result -bgcolor=#B2EC5D  Blake Shelton  Kyla Jade  1  \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"  9  \\"Only Love\\"  6  fedf00;\\"  \\"The Last Tear\\"  Third Place - -bgcolor=#b0e0e6  Alicia Keys  Britton Buchanan  10  fedf00;\\"  \\"Good Lovin'\\"  5  \\"Wake Me Up\\"  2  fedf00;\\"  \\"Where You Come From\\"  Runner up -bgcolor=yellow  Kelly Clarkson  Brynn Cartelli  12 fedf00;\\"  \\"Skyfall\\"  3  style=\\"background:\\"yellow;\\" \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\"  8  fedf00;\\"  \\"Walk My Way\\"  Winner -bgcolor=#fbceb1  Blake Shelton  Spensha Baker  4  \\"Merry Go 'Round\\"  7  \\"Tell Me About It\\"  11  fedf00;\\" \\"Old Soul\\"  Fourth Place } {  center;\\" + Non-competition performances - !

He participated in the early Chetnik struggles to liberate Old Serbia from Ottoman, Albanian and Bulgarian treachery (1903‚Äì1912), the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) and the Great War (1914‚Äì1918). ==Early life== Petroviƒá was born in the nearby village of Gradac, just outside of the town of Ra≈°ka, in 1871. His mother died when he was a youngster and his father, a military man, was killed in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885. As a 14-year-old he went to Belgrade to live with his uncle Stanojlo Petroviƒá and aunt Draginja, who carefully tended to his education. Mihailo graduated from the Faculty of Theology (Bogoslovija) at the Grandes √©coles (University of Belgrade) in 1895. That same year he married Leposava Obradinoviƒá, the daughter of a wealthy Belgrade industrialist, and then joined the priesthood in the ranks of married man. He settled first at Ivanjica, where he had distant relatives. There he officiated the funerals of Mihailo Mihailoviƒá in 1905 and Smiljana Mihailoviƒá (n√©e Petroviƒá) five years later, the parents of Dragoljub Mihailoviƒá. Later, he was transferred to a parish in Ra≈°ka where he remained a priest until retirement. In 1904 when King Peter I was crowned, Very Reverend Mihailo Petroviƒá was an invited guest of the new king at the grand reception in Belgrade. During the Serbian uprising of 1904 in Old Serbia, the Balkan Wars (1912 and 1913), and the Great War, he served as a military pastor to the fighting men at the front lines. He started writing for the Glasnik (Herald) of the Serbian Orthodox Church as a regular contributor soon after becoming a priest. Among his colleagues at the time were Milan Rakiƒá, Jovan Duƒçiƒá and other prominent Serbian men of letters, theologians, and politicians. == Serbian Chetnik Organization == He joined early the Serbian Chetnik Organization, formed to rid the Turk from the Balkans and consequently mainland Europe. Petroviƒá was also a member of the Association of Reserve Officers and Warriors that commissioned a number of monuments to the fallen Chetnik fighters in the mid-1920s. It was an opportunity to praise the Chetnik leaders' effort for the liberation of Old Serbia and to criticize the post-war neglect of Serbian war veterans, to attack those who too easily forgot the great sufferings the Serbian people in their plight for emancipation. The first reliable data about early Chetnik activity came with the fall of Communism in the 1990s, written by Vladan Virijeviƒá, a professor from Kosovo-Metohija, who mentions archpriest Mihailo Petroviƒá \\"as an old warrior\\" who came to bless Chetnik standards, banners and flags in villages and towns throughout Ra≈°ka in 1937 at a time of the Concordat crisis in Yugoslavia. Petroviƒá was a representative of the Bishop of Zicha, Dr. Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá and an archpriest and administrator of the Diocese of Studenica with its seat in Ra≈°ka. As a contributing editor to the Glasnik (Herald) of the Patriarchate of Belgrade, Petroviƒá often emphasized in his articles the continued security threats Serbs faced in the region, writing about the need to organize armed or paramilitary defenses against those national threats. Petroviƒá was calling for a continued role for the Chetniks in the southern regions of Serbia through the 1930s, if not before. == Family == During World War II his four sons, Ljubi≈°a (1899‚Äì1975), Dragi≈°a (1902‚Äì1967), Milan (1914‚Äì2002) and Aleksandar (1917‚Äì1944) remained loyal to the Old Order (God, King, and Country). Father Mihailo's married daughter Vidosava and her husband Very Reverend Svetozar Milenkoviƒá, with the help of her younger brother Aleksandar, saved a Jewish family from the Nazis in the early years of the war. They are Righteous Among the Nations, and are known collectively as the Milenkoviƒá family. ==See also== * List of Chetnik voivodes == References == * Vladan Virijeviƒá on V. Rev.

After graduating from Belgrade's Grandes √©coles, he went abroad to pursue further studies in geology and palaeontology. Upon his return to Serbia he was offered the post of director of the Museum of Natural History. == Geology in Serbia == The study of modern geology in Serbia began to develop in the first half of the 19th century mainly for two reasons: the endeavours of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá to expand the national economy (including mining) and the interest shown by European scientists for a country, newly liberated from the Ottoman yoke. When in 1880 Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá became the professor of geology and mineralogy at the Grandes √©coles in Belgrade, as the first Serbian geologist who studied in Belgrade and Paris, the development of geology in Serbia was strongly increased. Zujoviƒá's successors: Sava Uro≈°eviƒá (mineralogy, petrology), Svetolik Radovanoviƒá (palaeontology), Petar Pavloviƒá (palaeontology), Vladimir Petkoviƒá (regional geology), Jelenko Mihailoviƒá (seismology) and others continued geological investigations in Serbia. == Legacy == It could well be said that the museum was Petar Pavloviƒá's life's work, after all, he had spent three decades as its manager. Pavloviƒá studied Tertiary period in Serbia and wrote some 200 scientific papers. He described two genera (Beogradica and Odonthohydrobia) and 150 species of mollusca which had been unknown to science. Apart from his scientific work, he was dedicated to educating young scientists. He was a member of a board which prepared the first Law of Museums in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (as the country was called at the time). This Law of Museums was passed in 1925. During his tenure, the museum expanded its collection funds through organized field collection trips and gifts from donors. In the course of the First World War, many collections were damaged or destroyed, and many unique objects of scientific and historical value were lost. In the aftermath of the war, the museum attempted to mitigate the effects of destruction, and create conditions for the work to be continued. Despite many difficulties, success followed in the domain of scientific work, and a number of scientific papers were published in international journals. The museum was also active in organizing field research and collection trips throughout Serbia and Macedonia. At this time, the museum had an important role in educating university and high school students, which was achieved by organizing their scientific excursions and equipping school laboratories and libraries, all through Pavloviƒá's initiative. ==See also== * Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá * Jovan Cvijiƒá * Stevan Karamata * Marko Leko * Aleksandar Popoviƒá Sandor * Vladimir K.

As a scholar of universal erudition, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at State University of New York, College at Buffalo, Tomashevich was an eloquent speaker and greatly in demand among Serbian Americans and Serbian Canadians. Tomashevich belonged to a distinguished Serbian family in Slavonia which had taken refuge in Belgrade from the World War II persecution of Serbs at the time when Ante Paveliƒá founded and led the Independent State of Croatia during the Axis occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. In Belgrade many Serbs from Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kossovo, Macedonia and Montenegro found a safe heaven under the protection of Milan Nediƒá's government in German- occupied Serbia. He was a most liberal-minded man, both in politics and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher. He took great interest in the struggle of the Serbs for independence and strongly favoured the establishment of a monarchy (along British lines) which came about in 2002 when Crown Prince Alexander Karageogeviƒá decided to return home to his ancestral roots. Tomashevich was a member of Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia‚Äôs Privy Council. He was also a member of The Serbian Heritage Academy of Canada, based in Toronto, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in Belgrade, and the Nikola Tesla Memorial Society of New York. He came to the United States shortly after World War II. He received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Roosevelt University and his master's and doctoral degrees in anthropology from the University of Chicago. He came to Buffalo in 1968 to teach anthropology at Buffalo State College and retired in 1995. His distinguished academic career, including many books, articles and public lectures, contributed to the fields of Anthropology, Sociology, History, Philosophy, Philosophy of History, History of Philosophy and Science, Comparative Religion, Mythology, Linguistics, Folklore and Literature. Prof. Tomashevich, who was born in Vochin, former Yugoslavia, was a survivor of a concentration camp run by Croatian authorities during the Second World War. This harrowing experience stayed with him, and influenced his academic work, for the rest of his life. As a scholar and poet, he wrote movingly on universal human topics, as well as on achievements of Serbian art, history and culture. == Work == His book The Millenniad: Humanity's Road to Maturity, was described as universal in scope, and unusually diversified in content; this work encompasses human efforts, struggles, and concerns from cosmology to sociology. Suffused with benevolent irony and, at times, sardonic humor, it depicts our species's struggle against early ignorance, fear, and superstition, often institutionalized into powerful and controlling bodies seeking to monopolize the interpretation of the unknown. The whole work is in the form of a poem divided thematically into twelve cantos. It touches upon ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy in relation to concomitant developments in science and technology as they gradually reveal the nature of the universe, its material substance, as well as the problems of life, consciousness, and self-awareness. From the beginning, it also deals with major problems of politics, economics, morality and religion. From the subjective nature of the introductory parts, to the epilogue, the whole work is a portrayal of a modern intellectual's immersion in, and confrontation with contemporary reality and its open questions. The Millenniad is a massive, erudite, and thought-provoking effort worthy of serious reading and critical contemplation. == References == * Serbica Americana: http://eserbia.org/people/literature/718-george-vid-tomashevich Category:Serbian classical scholars Category:Serbian male poets Category:Serbian anthropologists Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:1927 births Category:2009 deaths Category:20th-century anthropologists ","title":"George Vid Tomashevich"},{"id":"56093895","text":"Frederick Vettese (born 1953) served as the chief actuary of Morneau Shepell and is author of several books exploring Canada's retirement system.

He was the principal founder of Byzantine Studies as an independent academic discipline at the University of Belgrade in 1906. His work is considered a significant contribution to the study and understanding of John Skylitzes and the history of the origin and development of the Bulgarian Empire under Samuel of Bulgaria. Also, he was the director of the National Archives of Serbia at the most difficult time, the Balkan Wars and the First World War that followed. ==Biography== After graduating from Belgrade's Grandes √©coles, Prokiƒá went to the University of Paris to further his studies. In 1892 he was invited to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he collaborated in Byzantine Studies with Karl Krumbacher. At the time Krumbacher was being appointed to the newly-established chair in Byzantinistik at the university. Krumbacher and his associates began establishing Byzantine Studies as an independent academic discipline in modern universities. Bo≈æidar Prokiƒá was named professor of Medieval History at the Grandes √©coles shortly after his arrival from Germany in 1892. Thirteen years later that institution of higher learning became the University of Belgrade in 1905. His most important work is Die Zus√§tze in der Handschrift des Johannes Skylitzes, published in 1906. A second edition was published later. The value of the work was greatly enhanced by its bibliographies and it remained a standard textbook for Byzantine studies for many years to come. From 1892 until 1905 he taught at his alma mater until it became the University of Belgrade. Then he tried to convince the governors to establish a chair in Byzantinistik, like his colleague Krumbacher did in 1892 in Munich, but not fully satisfied with the university's transformation and the post he was offered, he resigned soon after. From 1911 he was the director of the National Archives of Serbia in Belgrade. == Legacy == One might consider Bo≈æidar Prokiƒá, the father of southern Slavic Byzantology, since he trained and inspired the first generation of Byzantists, including Dragutin Anastasijevic.

Petroviƒá-Seljanƒçica (Velika Ivanƒça, 26 July 1875 ‚Äì Belgrade, 17 April 1921) was a Serbian poet, playwright and soldier. Many of his poems were turned into songs. == Biography == After finishing teacher's college in Aleksinac, Milorad Petroviƒá became a high school teacher. He married his high school sweetheart, Ru≈æa (Rose) Kne≈æeviƒá, who was also a teacher. They both taught in village school in Krƒçmar, Stojnik (Sopot), Raniloviƒá, and Mladenovac (village). Then married with children, he finally established himself in Belgrade and, at the age of thirty-two, after having authored several books of poetry, began writing for the stage. Between 1907 and 1912 he wrote more than 300 poems that were transcribed into lyrical songs for the theater and became the most conspicuous poet of the day. His copiousness and speed of composition‚Äîtogether with his bohemian habits‚Äîbecame proverbial: the writer Janko Veselinoviƒá recalled how proudly Milorad Petroviƒá wore his Serbian national costume, then only worn by peasants and not city folk (hence, the nickname \\"Seljanƒçica\\"). Everything he wrote was set into music and composers and singers adored Petroviƒá's songs. Furthermore, his songs are swayable to such an extent that they have become a musical inspiration to all contemporary composers. The list is long; Isidor Bajiƒá, Kosta Manojloviƒá, Petar Krstiƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá, Stevan Hristiƒá, Stevan Mokranjac, Stanislav Biniƒçki, Davorin Jenko, Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Josif Marinkoviƒá, Petar Konjoviƒá, Bozidar Joksimoviƒá, Dragutin Jelaƒçiƒá, Robert Tolinger, and others. After all, his poems painted a picture of their time and place. With the on-set of the First Balkan War of 1912 he joined his fellow Serbs against the ancestral enemies of his country. He did the same a year later when the Bulgarians provoked the Second Balkan War of 1913 and the tragic Great War that followed. After the conflicts, separated from his wife and children, he lived in Kru≈°evac and Belgrade where his health suddenly began to deteriorate drastically. Although his health had been failing since his mid-thirties while fighting on the battlefields (1912‚Äì1915), retreating over the Albanian mountains (winter, 1915‚Äì1916), and continued fighting (1917‚Äì1918). After victory was declared, Petroviƒá somehow found the energy to live for a few more years. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 46 on the 17th of April 1921. Strangely enough, predicting the exact date of his own death on the 3rd of March 1921 to his wife Ru≈æa, who was at his bedside throughout his last few weeks. –û—Ç–∫—Ä–∏–≤–µ–Ω–∞ –±–∏—Å—Ç–∞ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫—É –∏–∑ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–µ –ò–≤–∞–Ω—á–µ, –∞—É—Ç–æ—Ä—É –ø–µ—Å–º–µ ‚Äû–ò–≥—Ä–∞–ª–µ —Å–µ –¥–µ–ª–∏—ò–µ‚Äú (‚Äû–ë–ª–∏—Ü‚Äú, 12. —ò—É–ª 2013) == Works == In the group of works, the cycle Seljaniƒçice (Little Peasant Girls), which was based on verses of Milorad Petroviƒá, attained a special place. The poems (most of which were transcribed into music) composed in the folk idiom were used by Milorad Petroviƒá in his dramatic play ƒåuƒçuk-Stana (1907). He is remembered for a book of verse entitled Vaskrsenje (Resurrection). Literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá praised Milorad Petroviƒá for writing Resurrection that excited and delighted the readers. Furthermore, the book proved that Skerliƒá's prophecy was not proclaimed in vain. Petroviƒá showed that even patriotism could serve as a poetic mode. == References == *Translated and adapted from Jovan Skerliƒá's Istorija nove srpske knji≈æevnosti (Belgrade, 1914, 1921) page 424 *Translated and adapted from Serbian Wikipedia: http://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milorad_Petrovi%C4%87_Seljan%C4%8Dica Category:1875 births Category:1921 deaths Category:People from Mladenovac Category:Serbian male poets ","title":"Milorad Petroviƒá Seljanƒçica"},{"id":"56093913","text":"ClueKeeper is a GPS location-aware software platform created by a group of puzzle lovers and initially released in 2013. It is an iOS and Android based app for building and playing puzzle hunts. It incorporates features of a puzzle hunt, an escape room, and augmented reality. Creators can develop self- enclosed story files (called \\"hunts\\") that are read by the ClueKeeper app, which is installed on a GPS-enabled smartphone. The player and story take advantage of the location information provided by the GPS to trigger in-game events, such as using a virtual object, unlocking a puzzle, or interacting with characters. Completing a hunt can require going to different locations and solving puzzles. A typical ClueKeeper adventure is the Sunset Bar Crawl, created by San Francisco-based puzzle hunt company Shinteki, in which players are guided to several local pubs where they find clues and answer trivia questions. Hunts can be either hosted or self-guided. The former are organized events in which teams compete at the same time. The latter are played individually or as a team, not at a set time but whenever they want to do the hunt. Some are designed by escape room companies to supplement their room- based games with outdoor, walking puzzle hunts in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Jersey City. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing rules and business lockdowns forced many escape rooms to close their doors temporarily. Some of them turned to ClueKeeper as a way to allow people to play puzzle-and-escape games without actually going inside an escape room. Some rooms held hosted games, where teams compete for prizes without coming into contact with each other. Others developed play-anytime games in which the players download a ClueKeeper app whose clues and puzzles lead the players to various locations. In some cases, puzzle developers were asked by city park and recreation departments or visitors bureaus to create ClueKeeper apps featuring local landmarks or facilities for the entertainment of locals and tourists. ClueKeeper is used to run the annual international puzzle hunt for D.A.S.H, as well as hunts by companies such as Ravenchase, Shinteki and many others. ==See also== * Augmented reality * Escape room * Location-based game * Munzee * Pok√©mon Go * Puzzlehunt ==References External links == * ClueKeeper.com - Official ClueKeeper site * ClueKeeper: AR-powered group gaming is awesome!

With the rise of ISIS in Libya, Misurata became home to many people fleeing the violence. In May 2016, Eshtewi appealed for international aid, as his city had run out of food and housing for the refugees. In spring 2017, Mayor Eshtewi and the Misurata Municipal Council were the subjects of opposition by the city's military council, who opposed Eshtewi's support for the Libyan Political Agreement and the Presidential Council. After a series of demonstrations, military council head Ibrahim Ben Rajeb, an ally of the nationwide anti-Presidential Council movement led by Khalifa Ghwell, attempted to stage a coup d'√©tat. On 21 March 2017, the military council announced that the municipal council had been dismissed and replaced by a steering committee. The attempted coup was unsuccessful, largely ignored by municipal staff and the general population. On 13 April 2017, demonstrators from the same group protested the city's municipal council by blocking up the main entrance to the council building, constructing a cement- brick wall and even plastering it. A court order to remove the wall was not immediately carried out, and council employees who arrived to take it down were prevented by the protestors. On 3 May 2017, Eshtewi was forced to resign by protesters who forced their way into a meeting he was holding with Sirte mayor Mukhtar al-Madani and Bunyan Marsous representatives. The protestors stormed the building around 8 pm, pushed and shouted at Eshtewi, and refused to let him exit. There were unconfirmed gunshots, but no weapon was pointed at him. Eshtewi was forced to sign a statement of resignation, but revoked it soon after, stating that he had signed it under duress. In a statement, he vowed to continue his mayoral duties as normal. == Assassination == In late afternoon, Sunday, 17 December 2017, Eshtewi arrived at the Misurata Airport from Istanbul, Turkey, where he and numerous other city councilmen and elders had been on an official business trip. Just before sunset, he left the airport and was being driven back home from the airport with his brother Ahmed. Their car was attacked as it stopped at traffic lights on the airport road. Eshtewi's brother was shot in the head, and Eshtewi was kidnapped. His body was found several hours later outside the private Safwa Hospital in Misrata. There were three bullet wounds to his back, and bullet wounds in his legs, but the cause of death was a sharp blow to the head, according to a Misrata Central Hospital spokesman.  Aftermath  After Eshtewi's death, the City of Misurata declared three days of mourning, including public funeral prayers held at a sports venue. Eshtewi was buried on Monday, 18 December 2017, around 2:00 pm. Eshtewi's brother, Ahmed, is in serious but stable condition, and is recovering in Misrata Central Hospital's intensive care unit. The motive behind the attack is unclear, as are the identities of the perpetrators. Suspicion has been raised by some that Islamists and militants were responsible, though none of the armed groups active in the region immediately claimed responsibility. One senior local official told the Libya Herald that he believed local groups were not the perpetrators, but that Gaddafi or Haftar sympathizers or ISIS could be responsible. The Misurata Security Directorate formed a task force team to investigate the murder. Police spokesman Mohamed Ben Al-Amin urged restraint and cautioned not to accuse certain groups without evidence.  Reactions  Following Eshtewi's assassination, many important Libyan political figures and institutions released statements. The High Council of State, Presidential Council, and House of Representatives expressed condolences and condemned the murder. Prime Minister and Presidential Council Vice Chairman Ahmed Maiteeq praised Eshtewi's courage and peacemaking efforts, and lamented that Libya was still \\"bleeding\\" after the revolution. The Misurata City Council expressed its \\"deep sorrow and grief\\" at the murder. Official condemnations of the attack followed from the municipal governments of Sabratha, Tripoli, and Zliten. Misurata's rival cities in the east, Zintan and Bani Walid, did not release statements. Peter Millett, the British Ambassador to Libya, tweeted that he was \\"deeply saddened\\" by the \\"senseless murder.\\" The Italian embassy in Tripoli released a statement echoing Millett's sentiments. The French Foreign Ministry called the murder a \\"cowardly act\\" that indicated an urgent need for a political solution to the current crisis. The Turkish foreign ministry described the \\"heinous assassination\\" as an attempt to destabilize Misurata and Libya. United Nations envoy to Libya Ghassan Salam√© condemned the killing, calling Eshtewi a contributor to peace in Misurata and Libya. In addition, Libyan state electricity company GECOL, the National Forces Alliance, and tribal leaders have expressed their regrets. == See also == * List of people assassinated in Africa == References == Category:2017 murders in Africa Category:Assassinated Libyan people Category:Assassinated mayors Category:Deaths by beating Category:Deaths in Libya Category:Libyan politicians Category:Libyan torture victims Category:People from Misrata Category:People murdered in Libya Category:Year of birth missing Category:2017 deaths Category:2017 crimes in Libya Category:2010s murders in Libya ","title":"Mohamed Eshtewi"},{"id":"56093941","text":"Meir Kalmanson, (); better known by his stage name Meir Kay, is an American Internet personality best known for his inspirational Vlogs and interviews on YouTube, which have amassed over 350 million views and his social media presence with upwards of one million followers.

The microbiological research of Saumitra Das covered the fields of molecular virology and molecular biology. During his post-doctoral days at UCLA, Das identified I-RNA, a small RNA molecule isolated from the yeast species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrated its antiviral activity against viruses that cause polio and hepatitis C. Later, at IISc, he focused on the translation of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and has done in vivo and in vitro experiments on the characterization of La, a cellular trans-acting factor. The team of scientists led by Das concentrates on the regulation of transcription and translation, especially hepatitis C virus and Coxsackievirus B3 RNA. The research conducted by Das, along with Anjali Anoop Karande (his colleague from the biochemistry department of IISc) and their teams were successful in the development of a vaccine for hepatitis C; the vaccine, a mixture of virus-like particles, worked by enveloping the HCV proteins. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 111 of them. He and his colleagues hold several patents for the processes they have developed.

He retired in 1986. ==Career in Hainan== In 1987, the national government, led by Zhao Ziyang, Hu Yaobang, and Deng Xiaoping, approved the proposal to establish Hainan Island as a separate province, and the entire province would be a special economic zone (SEZ). In September, Xu Shijie and Liang Xiang, two former Guangdong officials, were taken out of retirement to lead the preparatory committee for the new province. Xu was chosen likely because he had years of experience in Hainan, while Liang had been the successful leader of the Shenzhen SEZ and was a close ally of Zhao. When Hainan Province was officially established in April 1988, Xu was appointed its first party secretary, and Liang the first governor. Xu was mainly in charge of party affairs, and Liang took more important initiatives in the province's development. Although Xu had a reputation for being a conservative, in Hainan he was fully supportive of Liang's reforms. He made essential contributions in winning support from local cadres for the new policies, and became one of the few officials from the mainland officials to gain the support of the Hainanese. Despite his former reputation as a conservative official, in Hainan Xu became one of the most liberal provincial party chiefs in the country. He proclaimed that \\"The policies [of the central government] only prohibit us from doing a few things, whereas we can do everything else. We in Hainan have the power to do everything not proscribed.\\" He also wrote that state-owned enterprises could be leased out, turned into joint-stock companies, accept foreign investors, or even sold. However, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Liang Xiang was dismissed for being an ally of the fallen liberal leader Zhao Ziyang. He was disciplined in September 1989 and almost went to jail. Although Xu was not close to Zhao, he also had to leave his post in June 1990 because he had supported Liang's policies. He held on to the post of Chairman of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress, but died soon afterwards in July 1991. Liang and Xu were replaced by Liu Jianfeng and Deng Hongxun, respectively. The two new leaders of Hainan not only did not share the vision of their predecessors, they were so antagonistic to each other that they weakened the position of the fledgling province, and the national government's focus of reforms shifted to Shanghai after 1992. ==Personal life== Xu was also a writer and poet, and began publishing in 1945 under the pen names Yajie () and Huichui (). He became a member of the China Writers Association in 1988, and served as vice-president of the China Poetry Association. He published several collections of his poems and essays. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Political office-holders in Hainan Category:Political office-holders in Guangdong Category:People from Chenghai Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Guangdong Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Guangdong Category:Poets from Guangdong Category:Members of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:20th-century Chinese poets Category:20th-century Chinese politicians Category:Politicians from Shantou Category:Writers from Shantou ","title":"Xu Shijie"},{"id":"56094600","text":"Salwa al-Raf'i (born 1942) is an Egyptian novelist and screenwriter.

It is an adaptation of the short story Paus Ala Motha by the late author Gauri Deshpande. == Plot == Savitri (Priya Bapat) lives in Kolhapur with her father Jagdish Sardesai (Kiran Karmarkar), a well-known lawyer. Jagdish is an emotionally unavailable, distant and cold man, who believes in practical and rational behavior. He is also an authoritarian father. In the absence of a mother and a busy father, Savitri (Savi) is brought up largely by servants and staff of the large house in which they live. Despite refusing to remarry after the death of his wife (Savi's mother), Jagdish brings home a new bride Amla (Mukta Barve) from one of his work trips, when Savi is 15 years old, without consulting or informing her. Although she is upset about this, she eventually develops curiosity and also begins a genial friendship with Amla, who she calls 'Ammi'. While Savi and Ammi are very different (Ammi is illiterate whereas Saavi is a school-topper, Saavi is hot-headed and stubborn while Ammi is quiet and patient) they both bond and look forward to each other's company. Ammi also tries to bring emotional depth to the cold and distant relationship between father and daughter. However, things between the two come to a head and Savi leaves home to pursue higher studies in Mumbai. While in Mumbai, Savi completes her Masters, topping the university and gets a fellowship at a research institute of her choice. She also befriends Ram (Bhushan Pradhan) who is enamoured by her outspoken honesty, practicality and straightforwardness. Soon, Savi moves into a rented apartment and begins a relationship with Ram. Despite her father's calls, she does not go back to Kolhapur. One day, as she is leaving to attend an office party thrown for her by her boss, Ammi shows up at her door. She informs Savi that her father passed away 15 days ago, but did not want to inform her. She shows Savi his will, wherein he leaves his entire property to Saavi, on the condition that she allow Ammi to live with her as her mother. Savi is initially angry at her father's actions, but lets Ammi stay with her. Saavi and Ammi once again come close and bond with each other, with Savi even introducing Ammi as her 'mother' instead of 'step-mother', like she would earlier. In the meanwhile, Ram and Savi start having relationship trouble as Ram is pressured into marrying by his family. He wants to marry Savi, but Savi doesn't believe in the institution of marriage. After an argument, Ram leaves for Nagpur, his family home, for an office project. He tells Savi he doesn't know when he will return. A few weeks later, Savi finds out from mutual friends that Ram has married an old family friend. Savi is upset but doesn't show it, focusing instead on why Ram would choose to marry such an ordinary girl. At this time, Ammi consoles her, telling her she should be happy that Savi and Ram only knew love in their relationship, and not the 'practicalities' of marriage that Savi detested. As Savi gets back to normal, she comes home to find Ammi shivering in bed. Ammi faints and Savi takes her to the hospital, where she finds that Ammi is in the last stage of leukemia. She is further shocked when the doctor tells her Ammi has known about this all along. Ammi then tells her that their fathers were classmates. Savi's father knew of Ammi's sickness when they married. Ammi came from a very poor family and had nothing. Once when Savi's father came to visit them in Belgaum, Ammi had just lost her father, and had no one else, nor any money. Taking pity on her, and with the assumption that she would make a good companion to Savi, her father married Ammi, however they never had any sexual relations. She tells Savi her father cared for her very well, arranging for medicines, doctors and more whenever necessary. As she breathes her last, she tells Savi not to bottle up her feelings, to set them free, just as she believes in freedom in relationships. When Ammi dies, Savi finally cries for the first time in her life. Savi sells her childhood home in Kolhapur, choosing to only keep the things that remind her of Ammi and open herself up to others, just as she did with Ammi. ==Cast== *Mukta Barve as Amla *Priya Bapat as Savitri *Bhushan Pradhan as Ram * Aarti Wadagbalkar as Neha ==Production== Mukta Barve and Priya Bapat were signed for playing lead roles in November 2017.

Besides, the ancestral temple of the Cao family was still in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), the capital of the former vassal Kingdom of Wei during the Eastern Han dynasty. After assuming office as Minister of Ceremonies, Han Ji wrote a memorial urging the central government to construct a new ancestral temple in Luoyang and relocate the ancestral tablets from Ye to Luoyang, so that the emperor and his subjects could properly pay respects to their ancestors. Throughout his eight-year-long tenure as Minister of Ceremonies, Han Ji came up with a new set of ceremonies, customs, rituals and protocol for the Cao Wei state, and abolished old practices from the Han dynasty which were no longer relevant.

After her graduation, she went to Italy where she was a student of Cottone teacher. On her return to Mexico, in 1910, she debuted at the Arbeu Theater in the world premiere of the Mexican opera Nicol√°s Bravo, with libretto by Ignacio Mariscal, secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Porfirista cabinet, and music by Rafael J.

Later, she was hired by the San Carlo Opera Company and the Ravigna Park of Chicago, with which she toured the United States in places such as Texas and New York, performing alongside figures such as Titta Ruffo and Rosa Raisa. In the early years of the 1920s she created her own opera company, Compa√±√≠a Consuelo Escobar, with which she performed numerous times in the country. Her husband, tenor Carlos Castro, and her sister, soprano Mar√≠a Luisa Escobar de Rocabruna also participated. During this period they made recordings in the United States in the Edison company.

Her last recorded performance was in 1932 at the Teatro Esperanza Iris (currently called Teatro de la Ciudad) where she sang in Il barbiere di Siviglia. The last years of her life she dedicated them to teaching. She was teacher of bel canto at the CNM (Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica) and was part of the editorial staff of the Cultural Musical magazine at the same conservatory. Her academic articles deal with musical pedagogy, vocal technique, critiques of opera presentations, and other topics related to her musical work.

Mangatangi can be translated as manga tangi to stream of weeping, or as rippling stream, or babbling brook. == River or stream? == The dictionary defines a river as a large natural stream. The Mangatangi is called a stream by some sources and a river by others. The New Zealand Geographic Board hasn't given it an official name. The 1:50,000 map shows it as a Stream, but LAWA calls it a River, as does Regional Council in documents on swimming and flow, but a Stream in its catchment management plan. Other references to River are 1894 and 1895 requests for a bridge, a Ratification Information Booklet and on Te Awa, RNZ, District Council, National Library and local historical group websites. == Geology == The river starts as several small streams on the eastern slopes of the Hunua Ranges. Greywacke and argillite of the Waipapa Group form the High Hunua Horst and underlie the river in the Hunua Ranges. The south-eastern boundary of the horst is the Mangatangi Fault, which runs along the north-west side of the mid section of the river. The upper stream is typically shallow, fast flowing, with cobble and gravel substrate. == Human use == As well as being a water and recreation resource, the river was historically a transport link. It also provided shingle to metal local roads and that use continues. A flax industry also existed as late as 1930.  Mangatangi Dam  The earth- fill dam (, with stone facing, was built between 1972 and 1977, on a foundation drainage filled with greywacke, with a high bellmouth spillway. It is wide, high and can hold of water covering .  Bridges  In 1897 Whangamarino Road Board built a girder bridge across the river. By 1914 it was in disrepair. A flood swept a temporary bridge away, whilst a replacement was being built in 1922. Further upstream, Stubbs Bridge was also built in 1922, swept away in 1966 and replaced in 1967. In 1921 Franklin County Council rejected a tender for a bridge with concrete piers, a main span of and two side spans. Stubbs Bridge was opened on 22 December 1924 by Minister of Public Works, Gordon Coates. == Ecology ==  Species  Introduced species include rainbow and brown trout. Koi carp and mosquitofish, have become major pests. Trout were introduced in 1885. Water quality is high in the regional park, but degrades downstream with increasing agricultural land use, so that by the Watercare Services flow gauging weir, given consent in 2001, only eels and Crans bully (Gobiomorphus basalis) were recorded. Galaxiids are largely absent upstream of the weir. Longfinned and shortfinned eels, and Crans bully are common. Attempts were made in the past to trap eels, in the belief that they damaged fisheries. Grey teal, brown teal and grey duck have been seen on the reservoir.  Environmental issues  Pollution measurements near the mouth of the river show that it is among the worst 25% of waterways in the country for a majority of pollutants. The catchment is mostly fertile farmland, so intensive agriculture is present and significant agricultural pollution is leached into groundwater and contained in the runoff. The removal of the native vegetation throughout the catchment to accommodate the increasing demand for farmland has contributed to the silting of the river with loose soils from eroded farmland. That would have been exacerbated by floating the felled logs down the stream, which was licensed under the Timber Floating Act 1873 till at least 1911. == References  External links == * Photo of 2008 flood near SH2 bridge * Retrolens aerial photos from 1952 * Photos of 1928 inspection of gauging weir Category:Rivers of Waikato Category:Waikato District Category:Rivers of New Zealand ","title":"Mangatangi River"},{"id":"56095340","text":"David Irwin (Sarcoxie, 1910 - Scotrun, 18 June 1970) was an American explorer who made the news in 1934 following a dog sled trek to the magnetic North Pole, encompassing 2,000 miles.

She was the first person from Queensland to study speech therapy. == Early life == Elizabeth Catherine Molphy (later Usher) was born on 16 November 1911 in Lilydale, Victoria. Her father Thomas Molphy, his wife Ella and family moved to Queensland and their daughter, Usher attended Merrimac Primary School and Warwick State High School. Elizabeth won a scholarship to train as a teacher attending the Teacher‚Äôs Training College in Brisbane. After taking her license, Elizabeth taught at a number of schools, including Kaimkillenbun, Maclagan, Elbow Valley and Central School, Warwick from 1928 to 1945. She took her teaching licence in elocution. She also took flying lessons at Archerfield before gaining her pilot‚Äôs licence in 1936. == World War II == During World War II, Elizabeth Molphy trained as a signals and cipher officer with the WAAAF and later in rehabilitation services. She became engaged to Leon Lyons, a pilot, but he was killed during the War. At the conclusion of the war, she entered a training course offered by the Victorian Council of Speech Therapists. Within two years she had completed her Licentiate at the Australian College of Speech Therapists, becoming the first Queenslander to study to become a speech therapist. == Professional career == Elizabeth Molphy returned to Warwick, Queensland to live with her parents after completing her course and a position as a speech therapist became available with Dr Basil Stafford‚Äôs Psychiatric Clinic, a division of the Brisbane Mental Hospital, in George St, Brisbane. Usher travelled to Brisbane weekly to take on patients at the Psychiatric Clinic and the nearby Spastic Centre (now Cerebral Palsy Alliance). Elizabeth travelled to England in 1952 to undertake continuing education, working as a supply teacher to support this training. She took a Bobath therapy course for the treatment of the Cerebral Palsy. Following her studies, Elizabeth was appointed a speech therapist to the Royal Oxford Hospitals in 1953. While performing her duties, she worked as a therapist at Headington Hill Hall, a hostel for returned soldiers of World War II and the Korean War, who had serious injuries and rehabilitation issues. She met Ken Usher at Headington Hil Halll. He was a former soldier who had suffered significant injuries during World War II. After undertaking further training at Syracuse University in New York during 1953-1954, for patients with hearing impairment and other conditions of the larynx, she returned to Oxford, England and married Ken Usher on 31 July 1954. Now taking her married name, Elizabeth Usher worked as a speech therapist with the London Education Authority. Ken and Elizabeth Usher moved back to Australia in 1956 and she became the first speech therapist to work full-time at the Queensland Spastic Centre (Cerebral Palsy Alliance). She also resumed her work at the Psychiatric Centre. She saw patients at the Mater Hospital and Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. The workload was considerable and Usher and three other therapists continued to take on new patients including those at the Subnormal Children‚Äôs Centre (now Endeavour Foundation). Usher petitioned for the establishment of a speech therapy course at the University of Queensland, to help provide a facility to train future speech therapists. After a number of years of negotiation, and with the support of the Vice Chancellor, Sir Fred Schonell, a university course was established in 1962. Usher taught part-time as a lecturer in the course. By 1964, the first group of students had completed the diploma and she was promoted to a full-time lecturer. The course was upgraded to a degree program in 1967. Usher was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Speech Therapy from the University in 1969. She took her B.A. in 1969. She was made Head of the Department and Senior Lecturer from 1971 and Reader in 1973. Usher retired from the University in 1977 as an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Speech and Hearing.

The British equivalent, known as a Dickensian evening, is distinct from its American counterpart because it is organised by local businesses and the town council to raise money for charity. Events may be outdoor, indoor or a combination of the two. The great majority are Christmas-themed, a reflection of the enduring legacy of Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. The fairs generally include an abundance of costumed entertainers and fair-goers, musical and theatrical acts, and art, handicrafts, food and drink for sale. ==Characteristics== Dramatic and musical entertainment, artisan demonstrations, dancing, parades, and lectures or discussions on literary or historical topics may be part of the events. Costumed entertainers are likely to impersonate characters from Dickens' novels, as well as historical figures such as Queen Victoria. ==History of the fairs in the United States== Ron Patterson and his wife Phyllis, started the first \\"Renaissance Pleasure Faire\\" in southern California in 1963, making it an annual event beginning in spring 1966.. Five years later they initiated a fall renaissance fair event in the San Francisco Bay Area with a harvest theme. These traditions took root locally and spread across the country. They then launched the Great Dickens Christmas Fair in San Francisco, an indoor event, in 1970. This has also inspired similar events across the U.S. ==Dickens fairs in England== Beginning in the 1980s, the English town of Ware began hosting a Charles Dickens themed carnival during the first week of December to welcome the arrival of Santa Claus.Ware Tourism The 25th Dickensian Evening was held in 2019.25th Ware Dickensian Evening Townspeople wear Victorian costumes, local businesses and volunteer groups run food and gift stalls to raise money for charity, actors perform a short open-air play such as A Christmas Carol, a craft fair is held in the drill hall, a nativity scene is unveiled in St Mary's church, a choir sings Christmas carols in the churchyard, puppeteers and street musicians entertain the public, and fairground rides and games are hosted in the town centre.Herts MercuryChristmas markets in Herts The highlight of the evening involves the mayor turning on the Christmas lights, and leading a procession featuring costumed performers and dancers, horse drawn beer wagons from McMullen's Brewery, the town crier, carnival floats, and marching band(s).Memories of 2009 Dickensian EveningNew additions to Dickensian evening The commercialised American approach was later exported back to England; a warehouse-based theme park, Dickens World, opened in Kent, England, in May 2007..

Richard Herman, sensing an opportunity, constructed this hotel, which quickly supplanted the Lease House. By 1902, the Lease House had closed, but plans were being made to extend the railroad line to Port Hope, allowing easier access for travelers. In anticipation, Herman enlarged his hotel in 1902-03. The railroad line was finished, and Herman sold his hotel to J . H. De Lisle in 1906. De Lisle renamed the establishment the Lake View Hotel two years later. The Lake View Hotel continued to operate under a succession of owners. As of 2017, the building houses a restaurant, the Port Hope Hotel. ==Description== The Herman House is a two-story, four-square, red brick Italianate building. A modern cinder block addition, painted white, is located at the rear. The walls of the original 1900 section are divided by belt courses and brick pilasters. A plain classical cornice supported by brackets runs across the top. The window and doorway openings have segmental- arch heads and raised brick caps. A modern wood porch fronts the building. On the interior, the first floor houses a bar/restaurant, and the second floor contains four sleeping rooms on either side of a central hall. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Residential buildings completed in 1900 ","title":"Herman House"},{"id":"56095899","text":"FC Underdog Chist is a Belarusian football club based in Chist, Minsk Oblast.

He attended university at Cologne and Berlin, his field of work including Oriental studies, Jewish studies and Art history. He received his doctorate in 1991 from Berlin's (misleadingly named) Technical University. His doctoral dissertation, subsequently reworked for commercial publication, dealt with \\"violence in the Biedermeier period\\" in the context of an increase in antisemitic riots at that time. In 1991 he accepted a position as an academic research assistant with the Berlin Historical Commission, remaining there till 1993. Between 1994 and 1997 he worked with the Hamburg-based Institute for the History of German Jews (\\"Institut f√ºr die Geschichte der deutschen Juden\\" / IGdJ). He moved on again in 1997, becoming Professor for Jewish studies at Duisburg till 2002. He then took a professorial post at the Heinrich-Heine University in D√ºsseldorf. He is a former chairman of the Association of Judaists in Germany (\\"Verband der Judaisten in Deutschland\\") and a member of the board of the Academic Working Group with the Leo Baeck Institute. Rohrbacher's most important research themes included Jewish history in central Europe, focusing primarily on the early modern period. He has also worked in depth on the Jewish enlightenment and the evolution of antisemitism, again with a particular focus on central Europe. == The case of Annette Schavan == Annette Schavan was a government minister, responsible till 2013 for the Education and Research portfolio. She received a doctorate from D√ºsseldorf university in 1980. In May 2012 allegations surfaced that Schavan's doctoral dissertation had been excessively plagiaristic. Although the allegations were anonymous, the case captured a place in the news agenda and the responsible \\"doctoral committee\\" at the University of D√ºsseldorf undertook a five-month investigation of the matter. The committee was chaired by the vice-dean of the university's Philosophy Faculty, Stefan Rohrbacher. Rohrbacker took the lead in drafting the committee's report: its conclusions were widely reported, giving Rohrbacher a hitherto improbably high public profile. Schavan's doctoral dissertation was determined to reflect a \\"plagiarising approach\\" (eine \\"plagiierende Vorgehensweise\\") and \\"intent to deceive\\" (\\"leitende T√§uschungsabsicht\\"). The report's issuance was upstaged by its premature leaking, which unleashed a new wave of public discussion and criticism, some of it directed against Rohrbacher's committee. There were those who felt the extent of Schavan's plagiarism had been far less flagrant than that in the recent case of Karl- Theodor zu Guttenberg, and that she was being judged harshly more because of her own robust condemnation of zu Guttenberg than on the basis of analysis of her own work. Helmut Schwarz of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation was critical of the procedure followed by university committee, complaining that there had been no \\"outsider\\" member of it, pointing out that Schavan had not been given sufficient opportunity to state her own case, and implying that Stefan Rohrbacher faced a clear conflict of interest in the matter, since he himself had first scrutinised the dissertation under discussion and then chaired the committee that evaluated his findings, while simultaneously holding a top position within the faculty for which the committee had prepared its report. Rohrbacher did not involve himself in the media storm, but others were less reticent in expressing support for the university's position. Bernhard Kempen, long-standing president of the German Universities Association (\\"Deutscher Hochschulverband\\"), insisted that Schavan, like anyone else confronting serious plagiarism allegations, deserved a fair process, and warned against a premature media acquittal orchestrated by \\"politicians and fringe academics\\". The leaking of the committee's draft report resulted from the actions of one individual and certainly could not be blamed on Rohrbacher. Factually unsupported criticisms and procedural recommendations plastered across the media displayed an unjustified lack of respect for the University of D√ºsseldorf. Shrill media posturing directed against Rohrbacher and against the procedural practices of D√ºsseldorf University certainly did nothing to change the proper legal basis that underpinned the exercise, and if it was intended that the public criticisms should dissuade the university from revoking Schavan's doctorate, then the critics failed in their objective. Schavan's subsequent decision to appeal against the university's decision in the district administrative court also failed. The court ruled that she had failed to establish the procedural errors alleged. Without exception, the court backed the findings of plagiarism and Rohrbacher's assessment of them. The doctoral committee decision accordingly received judicial endorsement. == Output (selection) ==  as author  * Juden in Neuss.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. ==History== Isaac Leuty was born in 1812 in Whitley Bay, England, and emigrated to America in 1832. He settled in Lexington, Michigan in the 1840s. He became partners in a general store, and in 1845 joined with Darius Cole to establish a nearby sawmill. They sold the mill in 1852, and Leuty moved back to Lexington. At some time between the late 1850s and early 1870s he moved to Port Hope. His daughter married W.R. Stafford, an early pioneer and wealthy businessman in the area. Leuty served as a bookkeeper in Stafford's general store. In 1874, Stafford deeded the land that this house stands on to Leuty. It is likely that the house was built at about the same time. ==Description== The Leuty House is an L-shaped, frame, two-story, Gothic Revival structure. Gothic details include the continuous undulating bargeboard under the house's eaves and pointed-arch headed windows in the front gables. The remaining windows have square heads with heavy molded caps supported by pairs of brackets. Similar paired-bracket cornices are placed over the hooded front entrance, the small front porch, and the several slant-sided bay windows. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1874 ","title":"Isaac Leuty House"},{"id":"56096022","text":"Volcan de la Pena is a volcano in Chile.

Previously a Salafi Muslim, in 2015 she founded the association Lib√©ratrices, which helps defend women and prevent radicalisation. == Biography == Henda Ayari was born on 4 December 1976 in Rouen to a father of Algerian origins and a mother of Tunisian origin, both non-practicing Muslims. Her mother was violent towards her, and her father abandoned the family.¬´ Henda Ayari : ‚ÄúJ‚Äô√©tais salafiste, je suis une femme libre‚Äù ¬ª, Le Temps, 8 November 2016 After the divorce of her parents, at the age of 21 she decided to start wearing the veil, as is customary for many Muslim women, after marrying a Salafi man. One of the first things her husband, Bachir, did was to make her buy a jilbab, which covers from the head to toe, and a niqab, the face covering veil. The niqab was, in her words, maximum religiosity, the clothing that most pleases Allah.Carlotta Gall, ¬´ I Could not Forget What Happened to Me That Night With Him ¬ª, New York Times, 3 November 2017. She adapted to family life and brought up her three children according to the rigorous principles of Salafi Islam. Henda Ayari lived for 9 years veiled from head to toe, under the absolute authority of her husband who grew more and more violent. She eventually refused the Salafi lifestyle, obtained a divorce, and slowly regained her independence. For a while she worked at odd jobs before training to become a clerk at the Ministry of Justice and starting a confectionery business.¬´ Henda Ayari, lib√©r√©e du salafisme, tout voile dehors ¬ª, Ouest France, 3 November 2017. Inspired by the November 2015 Paris attacks, she created controversy on social media in December 2015 by posting on Facebook two photos, one of which was her dressed in the veil, the other without veil, in tailored clothing, which symbolised her emancipation.¬´ Une tunisienne se d√©barrasse de son Hijab apr√®s 18 ans et suscite la pol√©mique ¬ª, R√©alit√©s, 29 d√©cembre 2015.

In 2016 she published her autobiography (J'ai choisi d'√™tre libre).

The Gerrman Emperor Friedrich II enfeoffed Herman V, Margrave of Baden, with the city of Ettlingen which had been founded by the Staufers. Mid-13th-century, Hermann's son Margrave Rudolf I of Baden built a castle complex in Ettlingen, possibly on the ruins of a previous building of the Staufers. However, so far such a predecessor building could not be verified. The ground floors of the keep in the castle's inner courtyard were built in the 13th century and still exist today. In the 16th century, a grand renaissance palace succeeded the 13th century castle. Two turrets were added to the southern wing and the keep was given a timbered upper floor. The renaissance palace with its three wings around the old keep was finished in 1600. In 1689, French troops completely destroyed both the palace and the city during the Palatine war of succession. == Baroque palace ==  Building History  After her husband, Margrave Ludwig Wilhelm T√ºrkenlouis, died in 1707, Margravine Augusta Sibylla decided to take up widow's residence at Ettlingen. From 1727 to 1733, she had the remaining ruins rebuilt. Using sandstone from Lossburg, the master builder Johann Michael Ludwig Rohrer built a luxurious baroque palace with four wings. It was to serve as a residence for her later years. After Margravine Augusta Sibylla‚Äôs death in 1733, the palace was used for multiple purposes for almost two centuries, including as a guest house and as a military hospital. In 1871, the Prussians turned it into an NCO school before the palace became property of the city of Ettlingen in 1912.  Palace courtyard  The highlight of the clearly structured palace courtyard is a stunningly beautiful illusionistic baroque painting on the wall towards the south wing. Additionally, there is an impressively constructed doorway and a dolphin fountain from 1612. This magnificent location sets the scene for the Ettlinger Schlossfestspiele, an annual theatre festival in Ettlingen.  Asam hall  Augusta Sibylla paid particular attention to the construction of the palace chapel which was dedicated to St John Nepomuk. It is decorated with 30 frescos by German baroque painter and architect Cosmas Damian Asam (1686‚Äì1739) depicting the martyrdom of St John Nepomuk. They are the only remaining frescos by Cosmas Damian Asam in the Upper Rhine region. Nowadays, the chapel is used as main hall where concerts, such as Schubertiades take place. Great Hall Among the most prestigious rooms of the palace is also the Great Hall, which was used as ballroom by Augusta Sibylla. Its window recesses are decorated with mural paintings. Moreover, it features a gently curved gallery and a larger Bohemian chandelier. Museum Nowadays, the palace is museum and venue for different kinds of events. It contains a collection concerning local history and archeology, a collection of regional art works since 1900, particularly works by Karl Hofer as well as a paintings gallery. East Asian handicraft is displayed in the baroque state rooms. == References  Further reading == *Anstett, Peter (1975). \\"Asamsaal im Schlo√ü zu Ettlingen instandgesetzt\\" (PDF).

Batlle had been opposed to the presidential system, believing that a collegiate body would lower the risk of a dictatorship emerging. Although the proposal was unsuccessful in 1916, Batlle negotiated a compromise with the National Party to include the system in a new constitution approved in a 1917 referendum. The compromise provided for a President and a nine- member National Council of Administration, which consisted of six members of the winning party and also three from the second party. The President was responsible for foreign affairs, national security and agriculture, whilst the NCA oversaw the budget, education, healthcare, industry, industrial relations, labour, livestock and public works. The National Council of Administration had a Chairman distinct from the President, making Uruguay the second Latin american country, after Peru, to have a Prime Minister with the adoption of the 1917 constitution. Although the new system worked well in its early years, in the early 1930s a series of conflicts involving the Council and the President led to a presidential coup by Gabriel Terra in 1933.

Dartford Urban District was a local authority in Kent, England. It was appointed in 1894 to provide local government to Dartford town and its immediate environs including, from 1925, Dartford Heath. It replaced the Dartford Local Board, and had fifteen councillor seats. Local businessman Everard Hesketh, owner of J & E Hall, had been elected to the Local Board in 1884 and continued to serve on Dartford Urban District Council (DUDC) until 1913. He donated land to the district, which became Hesketh Park in 1904. Another prominent member was James Sharp, owner of James Sharp and Son, builders and timber merchants, in Hythe Street, Dartford, and the nearby Baltic Saw Mills DUDC were instrumental in the establishment of Dartford‚Äôs Central Park, Museum and Library.They built a power station in Priory Road for the town in 1901, and on 14 February 1906 opened the Dartford Council Light Railways tram system, which operated until November 1935 when trams were replaced by a fleet of trolleybuses. The council maintained the local sewage works and marketed dried sludge from it as agricultural fertiliser. The authority was perhaps the first United Kingdom council to lend its support to the establishment of specialist state-run clinics for the treatment of babies and children under five to combat the then high infant mortality rate in Britain. The council worked with the Dartford Traders' Association to have the town awarded a Charter of Incorporation; this was finally achieved in 1933, after which the Municipal Borough of Dartford came into being. The Urban District Council held its last meeting on 4 October 1933.

It was established by Corinne Noyes in 2007 after she found a market gap for high- quality loose leaf tea. Teas for the different blends are sourced from Sri Lanka, India and China, and combined with locallygrown native Australian herbs. The blends are inspired by Noyes' travels to Cuba, France, America, China, Sri Lanka and Norway. Noyes continues her role in the company as Head Tea Blender. == Packaging == The brand is female-focused, and boxes of tea bags also include letters or colouring-in sheets which have built rapport between Noyes and her customers. When the tea blends were first launched in supermarkets, Noyes hand-signed 1000 of the enclosed letters. The letters have garnered 20,000 letters replying to the company. The teas are available in loose leaf or contained within gauze pyramid-shaped teabags, or infuser pods. The teabags are made from a corn starch derivative, and are green plant certified and biodegradable. == Blends == In 2011, the teas included Signature Blend, Grey De Luxe, Sultry Chai, Green, Jasmine and Pear and White with Rose. That same year, Mint Lavender Tisane was added to the range. The caffeine-free blend combines peppermint, spearmint, lavender and peppermint gum leaves. It was inspired by Noyes' rainforest property in South Gippsland. In 2012, the brand changed to a smaller, cheaper 18 pack with new tea versions Special Blend 18 and Grey de Luxe 18. In 2015, the tea range was expanded with \\"Tea Treats\\", which was billed as the first dessert-inspired tea range in Australian supermarkets. The single-origin blends included Orange Choc Ceylon, Caramel Oolong and Mint Choc Rooibos. In Winter 2016, Madame Flavour launched new tea blends, Blood Orange Fruit Tea, Ginger Masala Chai and Green Jasmine Pear.  Ingredients  The Earl Grey Twist blend contains lemon myrtle from a farm in Lismore, the Sultry Chai blend is made with Australian mountain pepper leaf from South Gippsland, English Breakfast has organic Assam loose leaves from Sri Lanka, and Mint Lavender blend has lavender from France, and round leaf mint from Gippsland. == Distribution == In February 2008, Noyes presented to a major supermarket chain, and by July that year, the range was being sold in 700 supermarkets. In 2012, the tea blends were sold in over 1200 supermarkets, and in 2015, this increased to over 1800 supermarkets including major chains Coles, Woolworths and New Zealand's Countdown. Madame Flavour teas are served on Virgin Australia flights and in Crown and Metropole hotels. The company produces 15 million bags of tea in up to 60 different varieties each year. As of 2016, Madame Flavour was close to achieving sales of $5 million AUD. In 2017, the teas were available in supermarkets across New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.  Location  The business was originally founded from Noyes' home in Highett in 2007. In 2011, Noyes and husband Matt and daughter Sienna moved to Gippsland, with the business relocating to a commercial building elsewhere in Highett. The business now operates from Brighton. == Marketing, awards and campaigns == In 2011, Noyes was a Victorian finalist in the Telstra Business Women's awards. In 2012, the infuser pods were a finalist in the Beverages category of the Food Magazine Awards. A \\"Let beautiful happen\\" branding campaign by Nourish Brands was a finalist in the 2013 Melbourne Design Awards in the Advertising-Print category. In 2014, Madame Flavour supported the Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival. Noyes spoke on 'conscious marketing' and product values, at the ADMA (Association for Data-Driven Marketing & Advertising) Global Forum in August 2015. In 2016, the brand worked with Smiling Mind to create a three-minute tea-infusion meditation ritual. The app-based ritual is focused on fostering mindfulness. == References  External links == * Official website Category:Tea companies of Australia Category:Tea brands Category:Australian companies established in 2007 ","title":"Madame Flavour"},{"id":"56096708","text":"Vivaldo Borges dos Santos Neto (born 13 September 1996), commonly known as Neto Borges or simply Borges, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a left back for Vasco da Gama, on loan from Genk. == Career == Brazil Neto Borges emerged into playing regular first team football in 2017, spending part of the year at Boca J√∫nior and Itabaiana.

Now the Washington School Apartments, it was built in 1922, and is one of the city's most architecturally prominent schools of the period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==Description and history== The former Washington School is located north of downtown New Britain, near the city's geographic center between High Street and Washington Park in a densely built residential neighborhood. The school is a broad two-story brick structure with Gothic Revival styling. It is divided into three sections, with a central projection flanked by wings. The central portion has five bays articulated by buttresses, with the center three filled with two-story segmented-arch windows three double-sashes wide and two high. The outer two bays have rectangular window bays that are smaller, with keystones at the top. The sides of the projection are angled and without windows, and it is topped by a crenellated parapet. The main entrances are in the wings immediately adjacent, recessed under segmented arches. The wings each extend to pavilions with no windows on the front facade. The school was built in 1922, a time when the city was experiencing a significant population boom. The building was designed by Delbert K. Perry, a prominent local architect, its design following the then-current standards for schools, including generous natural light for classrooms, and it was laid out to take advantage of the \\"platoon system\\" of class organization, in which classrooms are dedicated to specific subjects, and students move around between them. The school's elaborate exterior was criticized, leading to local legislation limiting such ornamentation on future school buildings. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1922 Category:Buildings and structures in New Britain, Connecticut ","title":"Washington School (New Britain, Connecticut)"},{"id":"56096790","text":"K√º√ß√ºkyalƒ± is an underground station on the M4 line of the Istanbul Metro in Maltepe.

Built in 1783, it was home to generations of the locally prominent Welles family, whose most famous member was Gideon Welles, the United States Secretary of the Navy under Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. Now re-adapted to commercial uses, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. ==Description and history== The Gideon Welles House stands in an area of dense commercial construction in northern Glastonbury, at the northeast corner of Main Street and Hebron Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is five bays wide, with 12-over-12 sash windows placed symmetrically around and above the center entrance. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and is sheltered by a hip-roof porch with round columns. A single-story ell extends to the right side at a recess, with a porch across its front that is topped by low balustrade. The house stands on land that was purchased by Thomas Welles of Wethersfield in 1655. This house was built in 1783 by Captain Samuel Welles for his son, also named Samuel. At the time, it was considered the grandest house in Glastonbury. Gideon Welles was born in this house in 1802, and rose to prominence in state politics, continuing the family's role in civic affairs. He became Secretary of the Navy in 1861, overseeing its growth during the Civil War and its role in the largely successful blockade of Confederate ports. The house remained in the Welles family until 1932. Threatened with demolition in 1935, a committee was formed to preserve it, which later became the Glastonbury Historical Society. The house was moved a short distance from its original location to its present one in 1936. Now owned by the town, it has been adaptively repurposed to house commercial businesses. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:American colonial architecture Category:Houses completed in 1783 Category:Houses in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Glastonbury, Connecticut ","title":"Gideon Welles House"},{"id":"56097037","text":"David Ekholm (born 16 January 1979) is a Swedish biathlete.

Tumor detection is based on the performance of the method and should include morphometric information (three axes dimensions, volume) and topographic information (number, location specifying liver segment and lobe/lobes). The specification of these data is important for staging liver tumors and prognosis. Tumor characterization is a complex process based on a sum of criteria leading towards tumor nature definition. Often, other diagnostic procedures, especially interventional ones are no longer necessary. Tumor characterization using the ultrasound method will be based on the following elements: consistency (solid, liquid, mixed), echogenicity, structure appearance (homogeneous or heterogeneous), delineation from adjacent liver parenchyma (capsular, imprecise), elasticity, posterior acoustic enhancement effect, the relation with neighboring organs or structures (displacement, invasion), vasculature (presence and characteristics on Doppler ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The substrate on which the tumor condition develops (if the liver is normal or if there is evidence of diffuse liver disease) and the developing context (oncology, septic) are also added. Particular attention should be paid to the analysis of the circulatory bed. Microcirculation investigation allows for discrimination between benign and malignant tumors. Characteristic elements of malignant circulation are vascular density, presence of vessels with irregular paths and size, some of them intercommunicating, some others blocked in the end with \\"glove finger\\" appearance, the presence of arterio-arterial and arterio-venous shunts, lack or incompetence of arterial precapillary sphincter made up of smooth musculatures. Diagnosis and characterization of liver tumors require a distinct approach for each group of conditions, using the available procedures discussed above for each of them. The correlation with the medical history, the patient's clinical and functional (biochemical and hematological) status are important elements that should also be considered. ==Benign liver tumors== Benign liver tumors generally develop on normal or fatty liver, are single or multiple (generally paucilocular), have distinct delineation, with increased echogenity (hemangiomas, benign focal nodular hyperplasia) or absent, with posterior acoustic enhancement effect (cysts), have distinct delineation (hydatid cyst), lack of vascularization or show a characteristic circulatory pattern, displace normal liver structures and even neighboring organs (in case of large sizes), are quite elastic and do not invade liver vessels. The patient has a good general status, as tumors are often asymptomatic, being incidentally discovered. Liver cysts They can be single or multiple, with variable size, generally less than 20 mm (congenital). Rarely, sizes can reach several centimeters, leading up to the substitution of a whole liver lobe (acquired, parasitic). They may be associated with renal cysts; in this case the disease has a hereditary, autosomal dominant transmission (von Hippel Lindau disease). The ultrasound appearance is a well defined lesion, with very thin, almost unapparent walls, without circulatory signal at Doppler or CEUS investigation. The content is transonic suggesting fluid composition. The presence of membranes, abundant sediment or cysts inside is suggestive for parasitic, hydatid nature. Posterior from the lesion the acoustic enhancement phenomenon is seen, which strengthens the suspicion of fluid mass. They typically displace normal liver vessels but no vascular or biliary invasion occurs. File:Ultrasonography of a liver cyst.jpgLiver cyst File:Ultrasonography of a hydatid liver cyst.jpgHydatid liver cyst. Diagnostic criteria are the presence of membranes and sediment inside. Hemangioma Hepatic hemangioma (2D). The lesion is located in the left hepatic lobe. Note precise delineation, their increased echogenity and the heterogeneous internal structure. thumbHepatic hemangioma (CEUS). Progression of CA from the periphery toward the center of the lesion is evidenced by examination at various time intervals (a ‚Äì arterial phase; b ‚Äì late phase). It is the most common liver tumor with a prevalence of 0.4 ‚Äì 7.4%. It is generally asymptomatic but also can be associated with pain complaints or cytopenia and/or anemia when it is very bulky. It is unique or paucilocular. It can be associated with other types of benign liver tumors. Characteristic 2D ultrasound appearance is that of a very well defined lesion, with sizes of 2‚Äì3 cm or less, showing increased echogenity and, when located in contact with the diaphragm, a \\"mirror image\\" phenomenon can be seen. When palpating the liver with the transducer the hemangioma is compressible sending reverberations backwards. Doppler exploration reveals no circulatory signal due to very slow flow speed. CEUS investigation has real diagnosis value due to the typical behavior of progressive CA enhancement of the tumor from the periphery towards the center. The enhancement is slow, during several minutes, depending on the size of hemangioma and on the presence (or absence) of internal thrombosis. During late (sinusoidal) phase, if totally \\"filled\\" with CA, hemangioma appears isoechoic to the liver. Deviations from the above described behavior can occur in arterialized hemangiomas or those containing arterio-venous shunts. In these cases, differentiation from a malignant tumor is difficult and requires other imaging procedures, follow up and measurements of the tumor at short time intervals. Focal nodular hyperplasia Benign focal nodular hyperplasia (CEUS). Gray scale examination (left) detects the lesion. CEUS examination (right) allows characterization of tumor nature based on central contrast enhancement and centrifugal dispersion. It is a tumor developed secondary to a circulatory abnormality with abundant arterial vessels having a characteristic location in the center of the tumor, within a fibrotic scar. A radial vessels network develops from this level with peripheral orientation. The tumor's circulatory bed is rich in microcirculatory and portal venous elements. The incidence is higher in younger women and tumor development is accelerated by oral contraceptives intake. 2D ultrasound appearance is a fairly well-defined mass, with variable sizes, usually single, solid consistency with inhomogeneous structure. Rarely the central scar can be distinguished. Spectral Doppler examination detects central arterial vessels and CFM exploration reveals their radial position. CEUS examination shows central tumor filling of the circulatory bed during arterial phase and completely enhancement during portal venous phase. During this phase the center of the lesion becomes hypoechoic, enhancing the tumor scar. During the late phase the tumor remains isoechoic to the liver, which strengthens the diagnosis of benign lesion. Adenoma It is a benign tumor made up of normal or atypical hepatocytes. It has an incidence of 0.03%. Its development is induced by intake of anabolic hormones and oral contraceptives. The tumor is asymptomatic but may be associated with right upper quadrant pain in case of internal bleeding. 2D ultrasound shows a well-defined, un- encapsulated, solid mass. It may have a heterogeneous structure in case of intratumoral hemorrhage. Doppler examination shows no circulatory signal. CEUS exploration is quite ambiguous and cannot always establish a differential diagnosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, during the arterial phase there is a centripetal and inhomogeneous enhancement. During the portal venous phase there is a moderate wash out. During late phase the appearance is isoechoic or hypoechoic, due to lack of Kupffer cells. ==Malignant liver tumors== Malignant liver tumors develop on cirrhotic liver (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) or normal liver (metastases). They are single or multiple (especially metastases), have a variable, generally imprecise delineation, may have a very pronounced circulatory signal (hepatocellular carcinoma and some types of metastases), have a heterogeneous structure (the result of intratumoral circulatory disorders, consequence of hemorrhage or necrosis) and are firm to touch, even rigid. The patient's general status correlates with the underlying disease (vascular and parenchymal decompensation for liver cirrhosis, weight loss, lack of appetite and anemia with cancer). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) It is the most common liver malignancy. It develops secondary to cirrhosis therefore, ultrasound examination every 6 months combined with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) determination is an effective method for early detection and treatment monitoring for this type of tumor . Clinically, HCC overlaps with advanced liver cirrhosis (long evolution, repeated vascular and parenchymal decompensation, sometimes bleeding due to variceal leakage) in addition to accelerated weight loss in the recent past and lack of appetite. Encephaloid hepatocellular carcinoma (CEUS). Contrast tumor enhancement is observed on the left during arterial phase. The ‚Äúwash-out‚Äù phenomenon can be seen on the right, during portal venous phase. HCC appearance on 2D ultrasound is that of a solid tumor, with imprecise delineation, with heterogeneous structure, uni- or multilocular (encephaloid form). An \\"infiltrative\\" type is also described which is difficult to discriminate from liver nodular reconstruction in cirrhosis. Typically HCC invades liver vessels, primarily the portal veins but also the hepatic veins . Doppler examination detects a high speed arterial flow and low impedance index (correlated with described changes in tumor angiogenesis). The spatial distribution of the vessels is irregular, disordered. CEUS examination shows hyperenhancement of the lesion during the arterial phase. During the portal venous phase there is a specific \\"wash out\\" of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) and the tumor appears hypoechoic during the late phase. Poorly differentiated tumors may have a stronger wash out leading to an isoechoic appearance to the liver parenchyma during portal venous phase. This appearance was found in approx. 30% of cases. The described changes have diagnostic value in liver nodules larger than 2 cm. Ultrasound is useful in HCC detection, stadialization and assessing therapeutic efficacy. In terms of staging related to therapy effectiveness, the Barcelona classification is used which identifies five HCC stages. Curative therapy is indicated in early stages, which include very early stage (single nodule <2 cm), curable by surgical resection (survival 50-70% five years after surgical resection) and early stage (single nodule of 2‚Äì5 cm, or up to 3 nodules <3 cm) which can be treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and liver transplantation. Intermediate stage (polinodular, without portal invasion) and advanced stage (N1, M1, with portal invasion) undergo palliative therapies (TACE and sorafenib systemic therapy) and in the end stage only symptomatic therapy applies. Cholangiocarcinoma It develops on non cirrhotic liver. 2D ultrasound appearance is uncharacteristic ‚Äì solid mass with heterogeneous structure, poorly delineated, often with peripheral location and weak Doppler circulation signal. CEUS examination reveals a moderate enhancement of the tumor periphery during arterial phase followed by wash-out during portal venous phase and hypoechoic appearance during late phase. Liver metastases Peripheral vascular pattern of the lesion is observed in colon cancer metastasis (CEUS). Lesion hyperenhancement in ovarian cancer liver metastasis is seen during the arterial phase. US examination is required to detect liver metastases in patients with oncologic history. In addition, the method can incidentally detect metastases in asymptomatic patients. Early identification (small sizes, small number) is important to establish an optimal course of treatment which can be complex (chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, surgical resection) but welcomed. In addition, discrimination of synchronous lesions that have a different nature is also important knowing that up to 25‚Äì50% of liver lesions less than 2 cm detected in cancer patients may be benign . US sensitivity for metastases detection varies depending on the examiner's experience and the equipment used and ranges between 40‚Äì80% . Sensitivity is conditioned by the size and acoustic impedance of the nodules. For a lesion diameter below 10 mm US accuracy is greatly reduced, reaching approx. 20%. Other elements contributing to lower US performance are: excessive obesity, fatty liver disease, hypomobility of the diaphragm, and certain patterns of hyperechoic or isoechoic metastases that can be overlooked or can mimic benign conditions. Conventional US appearance of metastases is uncharacteristic, consisting of circumscribed lesions, with clear, imprecise or \\"halo\\" delineation, with homogeneous or heterogeneous echo pattern. They can be single (often liver metastases from colonic neoplasm) or multiple. Echogenity is variable. When increased, they can compress the bile ducts (which may be dilated) and the liver vessels. Liver involvement can be segmental, lobar or generalized. In this situation a pronounced hepatomegaly occurs. Generally, metastases have non-characteristic Doppler vascular pattern, with few exceptions (carcinoid metastases). Cyst-adenocarcinoma metastases due to semifluid content may have a transonic appearance. When increasing, they can result in central necrosis. CEUS examination is a real breakthrough for detection and characterization of liver metastases. Increased performance is based on identifying specific vascular patterns during the arterial phase and seeing metastases in contrast to normal liver parenchyma during the sinusoidal phase. CEUS increased accuracy is due to the different behavior of normal liver parenchyma (captures CA in Kuppfer cells) against tumor parenchyma (does not contain Kuppfer cells, therefore CEUS appearance is hypoechoic). To this adds the particularities of intratumoral circulation represented by a reduced arterial bed compared to that of the surrounding normal liver and the absence of the portal vessels . In terms of vascularity, metastases can be hypovascular (in gastric, colonic, pancreatic or ovarian adenocarcinomas) with hypoechoic pattern during arterial phase, and similar during portal venous and late phases, respectively hypervascular (neuroendocrine tumors, malignant melanoma, sarcomas, renal, breast or thyroid tumors) with hyperechoic appearance during arterial phase, with washout during the portal venous phase and hypoechoic pattern 30 seconds after injection. Using CEUS examination to detect metastases a sensitivity of 80‚Äì95% is obtained, similar to that of contrast CT and MRI . Intraoperative use of the procedure increases its performance even if it does not have a decisive contribution to change the therapeutic behavior . Limitations of the method are those related to US penetration (pronounced fatty liver disease, deep lesion, excessive obesity) and to the experience of the examiner. To this the risk of confusion between hypervascular metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma and hemangioma and the confusion between hypovascular metastases and small liver cysts is added. Routine use of CEUS examination to detect liver metastases is recommended when conventional US examination is not conclusive, when precise information on some injuries (number, location) is necessary in conjunction with contrast CT/MRI and to assess the effectiveness of treatment when using an antiangiogenic therapy for hypervascular metastases . The method cannot replace CT/MRI examinations which have well established indications in oncology. ==Pseudotumors and inflammatory masses of the liver== Besides the entities listed above inflammatory masses or even pseudo-masses can occur. Their diagnosis is quite difficult and the criteria used for differentiation are often insufficient, requiring morphologic diagnostic procedures, use of other diagnostic imaging methods or patient reevaluation from time to time. This includes lesions developed on liver parenchyma reconstruction, as occurs in cirrhosis, steatosis accumulation or in case of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases. Focal steatosis It consists of localized accumulation of fat-rich liver cells. In some cases this accumulation can mimic a liver tumor. Sometimes the opposite phenomenon can be seen, that is an \\"island\\" of normal parenchyma in a ‚Äúshining‚Äù liver. In both cases ultrasound examination identifies a well defined, un-encapsulated area, with echostructure and vasculature similar to those of normal liver parenchyma. The lesion can have different forms, most cases being oval and located in the IVth segment, anterior from the hepatic hilum. It occurs in dyslipidemic or alcohol intake patients with normal physical and biological status. Benign diagnosis confirmation is made using CEUS examination which proves a normal circulatory bed similar to adjacent liver parenchyma in all three phases of investigation. Liver abscess thumbLiver abscess (2D and CEUS). 2D Examination reveals the fluid nature of the mass and imprecise delineation. CEUS examination shows congestion in the surrounding liver parenchyma and excludes a vascular tumor. Liver abscess have heteromorphic ultrasound appearance, the most typical being that of a mass with irregular shapes, fringed, with fluid or semifluid content, with or without air inside. Doppler examination shows the lack of vessels within the lesion. CEUS exploration shows hyperenhancement during arterial phase close to the lesion, this being suggestive of a liver parenchymal hyperemia. During venous and sinusoidal phase the pattern is hypoechoic, and the central fluid is contrast enhanced. CEUS examination is useful because it confirms the clinical suspicion of abscess. In addition, it allows for an accurate measurement of the collection size and an indication regarding its topography inside the liver (lobe, segment). ==Preneoplastic status. Cirrhotic liver monitoring== Cirrhotic liver is characterized by the occurrence of nodules with different sizes and evolution degrees, so that regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and even early hepatocellular carcinoma can coexist at some moment during disease progression. There are studies showing that between 59‚Äì94% of newly diagnosed liver nodules in cirrhotic patients have malignant histology and up to 50% of hyperechoic lesions, with ultrasound appearance of hemangioma, ultimately prove to be hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, current practice in many centers considers that any new lesion revealed in a cirrhotic patient should be regarded as malignant until otherwise proven. There are three categories of cirrhotic liver nodules: regenerative, dysplastic (considered as premalignant conditions) and tumoral (HCC). Regenerative nodules (RN) thumbRegenerative nodule (CEUS). One can see the hypovascular pattern of the solid nodule, with a size <10 mm. These lesions are well defined, with isoechoic or hypoechoic appearance and sizes less than 1 cm. They are high in numbers and have a more or less uniform distribution, involving all liver segments. They can crowd resulting in large pseudo tumors. At Doppler examination, these nodules have no circulatory signal. CEUS exploration is indicated when a nodule is different against the general pattern of restructured liver either by different echogenity or by a different size than the majority of nodules. During the arterial phase, the signal is weak or absent. During the portal venous and late phase, the appearance is persistently isoechoic. Generally, RN is not distinct from the surrounding parenchyma. CEUS examination is useful to exclude an active lesion at the moment of exploration but does not have absolute prognostic value; therefore the patient should be periodically examined at short intervals. Correlation with clinical status and AFP measurements is required. Dysplastic nodules (DN) thumb300pxDysplastic nodule (2D, CFM, CEUS). The nodule is well- defined with a size between 10‚Äì 20 mm, lacks vessels in CFM and CEUS exploration. These lesions have various patterns (hypo or hyperechoic) with at least 1 cm diameter. They are hepatocytes with dysplastic changes, but without clear histological criteria for malignancy. They are divided into low-grade dysplastic nodules, where cellular atypia are mild and high-grade dysplastic nodules with moderate or severe cellular atypia, but without any established signs of malignancy. Occasionally, well-differentiated HCC foci can be identified in high-grade dysplastic nodules (appearance called \\"nodule in nodule\\") . Most authors accept the carcinogenesis process as a progressive transformation of DN from low-grade to high-grade and into HCC. The nodule's vasculature changes progressively, correlated with the degree of malignancy, and it is characterized by decrease until absence of portal venous input and by increase of arterial intratumoral input. Neoformation vessels occur with increasing degree of dysplasia. Arterial neovascularization is enhanced in a chaotic and explosive way, while normal, arterial and portal vasculature continues to decline. High-grade dysplastic nodules are hypovascularized both arterial and portal phases, while early HCC nodules may have similar arterial pattern with the surrounding parenchyma or exacerbated, and portal hypovascularization. In moderate or poorly differentiated HCC (classic HCC) tumor nutrition is performed only by neoformation vessels (abundant), the normal arterial and portal vasculature completely disappearing. This behavior of intratumoral vascularization is typical for HCC and is the key to imaging diagnosis. B-mode ultrasonography is unable to distinguish between regenerative nodules and borderline lesions such as dysplastic nodules and even early HCC. Doppler examination also has a low sensitivity in differentiating dysplastic nodules from early HCC. Doppler signal may be absent in both regenerative and dysplastic nodules. Some authors indicate the presence of venous type Doppler flow which reflects the portal venous nutrition of the nodule as a characteristic feature of dysplastic nodules and early HCC (Minami & Kudo, 2010). Other authors noticed the presence of an arterial flow with small frequency variations and a normal resistivity index. On CEUS examination both RN and DN may have quite a variable enhancement pattern. Generally, both nodules enhances identically with the surrounding liver parenchyma after UCAs injection. Dysplastic nodules are hypovascular in the arterial phase. In case of highgrade dysplastic nodule sometimes a hypervascularization can be detected, but without associating \\"wash out\\" during portal and late CEUS phases. In these cases, biopsy may clarify the diagnosis. Early hepatocellular carcinoma (Early HCC) The suggestive appearance of early HCC on 2D ultrasound examination is that of hypoechoic nodule, with distinct pattern, developed on cirrhotic liver. Hypoechoic appearance is characteristic of moderate/poorly differentiated HCC, with low or absent fatty changes. Rarely, HCC may appear isoechoic, consist of a tumor type with a higher degree of differentiation and therefore with slower development. Another common aspect is \\"bright loop\\" or \\"nodule-in-nodule\\" appearance, hypoechoic nodules in a hyperechoic tumor. Spectral Doppler characteristics of early HCC overlap those of the dysplastic nodule, as they are represented by the presence of portal venous signal type or arterial type with normal RI (well differentiated HCC) or increased RI (moderately or poorly differentiated HCC). The CFM exploration identifies a chaotic vessels pattern. On CEUS examination, early HCC has an iso- or hypervascular appearance during the arterial phase followed by wash out during portal venous and late phase. There are studies showing that the wash out process is directly correlated with the size and features of neoplastic circulatory bed. Thus, highly differentiated HCC illustrates the phenomenon of late or even very late \\"wash out\\" while poorly differentiated HCC has an accelerated wash out at the end of arterial phase. It is therefore mandatory to analyze all these three phases of CEUS examination for a proper characterization of liver nodules. Tumor wash out at the end of the arterial phase allows the HCC diagnosis with a predictability of 89.5%. Some authors consider that early pronounced contrast enhancement of a nodule within 1‚Äì2 cm developed on a cirrhotic liver is sufficient for HCC diagnosis. These results prove that for a correct characterization of the lesions it is necessary to extend the examination time to 5 minutes or even longer. Fig. 11. Early hepatocellular carcinoma (2D, CFM). The 2D examination reveals a solid, hypoechoic nodule in IVth liver segment, without encapsulation. CFM shows a central vessel with ramifications to the periphery. The underlying liver is cirrhotic. Fig. 12. Early hepatocellular carcinoma (2D, CFM). ‚ÄúNodule in nodule‚Äù image: small hypoechoic early HCC inside monitored dysplastic nodule. The ultrasound value in HCC \\"screening\\" Baseline 2D ultrasound has an important role in surveillance programs for patients at risk to develop HCC. The examination has an acceptable sensitivity which increases with the tumor size. Sensitivity varies between 42% for lesions <1 cm and 95% for tumors larger than 1 cm, and specificity can reach 90%. Optimal time interval for ultrasound screening of ‚Äúat risk‚Äù population is 6 months as it results from clinical trials that investigated the tumor size doubling time (Bruix, 2005; Maruyama et al., 2008). For a recently developed nodule the dimensional criteria will be taken into account. Thus, for a nodule with a size of less than 10 mm the patient will be reevaluated by ultrasound every 3 months, as the growth trend is an indication for completion of investigations with other diagnostic procedures; at a size between 10 ‚Äì 20 mm two concordant imaging procedures are necessary, supplemented if necessary by an ultrasound guided biopsy; at a size over 20 mm one single dynamic imaging technique with characteristic appearance is enough for positive diagnostic. In uncertain cases complementary dynamic imaging techniques or biopsy should be performed. When Doppler exploration is not enough, CEUS examination will be performed. One should always keep in mind the risk of false positive results for HCC in case of cholangiocarcinomas so complementary diagnostic procedures should be considered. The effectiveness of screening programs is proved by an increase in detection rate of HCC <2 cm (from <5% in the 90s in Europe to > 30% today in Japan) with curative therapy options. The main problem of ultrasound screening is that, in order to be cost-effective, it should be applied to the general population and not in tertiary hospitals. This raises the importance of the operator and equipment dependent part of the ultrasound examination. The efficiency of such a program is linked to the functional liver parenchyma of the cirrhotic patient. Therefore, some authors argue that screening should be excluded in patients with etiologies that prevent curative treatment or in patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh class C). After curative therapies (surgical resection, local ablative therapies) continuing ultrasound screening is recommended first at 1 month then at 3 months intervals after the therapy to assess the effectiveness of therapy and to detect other nodules. ==Antitumor therapies== Ultrasound exploration can be an effective procedure for the assessment of liver tumors response to treatment. Over the years, different criteria for assessing the effectiveness of curative or palliative therapies have been considered. Now it has been proved that the degree of tumor necrosis is not correlated with tumor diameter, therefore simple measurement of the tumor diameter (RECIST criteria) is not enough for therapy assessment. Currently, local response to treatment is focused on tumor necrosis diagnosed by contrast dynamic imaging techniques and recognized by the presence of intratumoral non-enhanced areas. Local response to treatment is defined as: a. complete response, defined as complete disappearance of all known lesions (absence of tumor enhanced areas, reflecting total tumor necrosis) and absence of other new lesions determined by two observations not less than 4 weeks apart; b. partial response, defined as more than 50% reduction in total tumor enhancement in all measurable lesions, determined by two observations not less than 4 weeks apart c. stable disease (is not described by a, b, or d) d. progressive disease, defined as 25% increase in size of one or more measurable lesions or the appearance of new lesions. Techniques for evaluating the efficiency of therapy The efficiency of 2D ultrasound is low in assessing the effects of HCC or metastasis therapy, as it is unable to differentiate viable tumor tissue from post-therapy tumor necrosis. However, it is able to detect the appearance of new lesions and to assess the occurrence of any complications of disease progression (ascites or portal vein thrombosis). Color Doppler ultrasound can be useful sometimes being able to show the presence of intratumoral vasculature as a sign of incomplete therapy or intratumoral recurrence. The absence of Doppler signal does not exclude the presence of viable tumor tissue. CEUS exploration, by its ability to enhance intra-lesion microcirculation, has proved its utility in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. Its indications are defined for HCC ablative treatments (pre, intra and post-therapy), while monitoring of systemic therapies of HCC and metastases are not validated indications at this time, but with proved efficacy in extensive clinical trials (Claudon et al., 2008). CEUS examination cannot completely replace the other imaging diagnostic methods currently in use because of the known limitations of the ultrasound method (operator/ equipment dependent, ultrasound examination limitations). In addition to bloating, in cancer patients post-therapy steatosis occurs, which prevent deep visibility. Spiral CT scan remains the method of choice in monitoring cancer therapies because it provides an overview of tumor extension and it is not limited by bloating or steatosis. Gadolinium MRI examination is a procedure used more and more often, and its advantages are the absence of irradiation and its high sensitivity in tumor vasculature detection, especially in smaller tumors. However it remains an expensive and not a very accessible procedure, although it has a high specificity. Currently, CEUS and MRI are considered complementary methods to CT scan. Ultrasound monitoring ablative therapies (alcoholization ‚Äì PEI, radiofrequency ablation ‚Äì RFA) Ablative therapies are considered curative treatments for HCC together with surgical resection and liver transplantation and they are indicated for early tumor stages in patients with good liver function. Also they are successfully applied in the treatment of liver metastases, where surgical resection is contraindicated. They are chemical (intratumoral ethanol injection) or thermal (radiofrequency, laser or microwave ablation). They are applied in order to obtain a full therapeutic response, without affecting liver function. Complete response is locally proved by complete tumor necrosis with a safety margin around the tumor. 2D ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound and especially CEUS can play an important role in pretherapeutic staging, particularly when sectional imaging investigations (CT, MRI) provide uncertain results or are contraindicated. During the interventional procedure, ultrasound allows guidance of the needle into the tumor. CEUS allows guidance in areas of viable tissue and avoids intratumoral necrotic areas. CEUS also allows assessment of therapeutic effect immediately post-procedure (with the possibility of reintervention in case of partial response) . To accurately assess the effectiveness of treatment it is mandatory to compare the tumor diameter before therapy with the ablation area. The volume of damaged tissue must be higher than the initial tumor volume. CEUS appearance is that of central nonenhanced area showing a peripheral homogeneous hyperenhanced rim due to post-procedure inflammation. 24 hours after the procedure the inflammatory peripheral rim is thinning and the necrotic area appears larger than at the previous examination. Thus, a possible residual tumor may appear more evident. Residual tumor has poorly defined edges, irregular shape, and the tumor diameter is unchanged. Residual tumor tissue is evidenced at the periphery of the tumor as an eccentric area behaving as the original tumor at CEUS examination, with arterial hyperenhancement and portal and late wash-out. Ultrasound examination 24 hours after the procedure, including CEUS, can show apart from the character of the lesion any potential post-intervention complications (e.g. active bleeding). In the first days after RFA both CEUS and spiral CT have low sensitivity in assessing therapeutic efficacy. CT sensitivity 24 hours post-therapy is reported to be even lower than CEUS. Difficulties in CEUS examination result from post-lesion hyperemia, presence of intratumoral air, ultrasound limitations (too deep lesion or the presence of fatty liver) or lack of patient's cooperation (immediately after therapy). For this reasons contrast imaging (CT or CEUS) control should be performed one month after ablation to confirm the result of the therapy. Local recurrence is defined as recurrence of a hyperenhanced area at tumor periphery in the arterial phase, with portal and late wash-out. Sometimes, especially for HCC treated by alcoholization (PEI) hyperenhanced septa or vessels can be shown inside the lesion. In case of successful treatment, US monitoring using CEUS is performed every three months. Although CE-CT and/or MRI are considered the method of choice in post- therapy monitoring, CEUS can be used in follow-up protocols, its diagnostic accuracy being equivalent to that of CE-CT or MRI. Fig. 13. Assessment of therapeutic efficacy on ultrasound (2D, CFM, CEUS). US exam shows vascular Doppler signal at CFM (left) and CEUS examination reveals incomplete therapy (right). Ultrasound monitoring of TACE therapy (transarterial chemoembolization) Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is part of palliative therapies for HCC used in intermediate stages of the disease. It consists of selective angiographic catheterization of the hepatic artery and injection of chemotherapeutic agents (usually adriamycin, but other molecules are currently the subject of clinical trials), followed by embolization of hepatic artery with gelfoam, alcohol or metal rings. A similar procedure is transarterial embolization but without chemotherapeutic agents injection, used in the treatment of hypervascular liver metastases. These therapies are based on the predominantly arterial vasculature of HCC and hypervascular metastases, while the remaining liver parenchyma has a dual vascular intake, predominantly portal. Their efficacy is high only for lesions who are hyperenhanced during arterial phase. The role of US is limited in the first few days after the procedure, and refers only to its complications, due to Lipiodol retention mainly intratumoral, but also diffusely intrahepatic. On ultrasound, Lipiodol appears intensely hyperechoic inside the tumor, with significant posterior attenuation which make US examination more difficult. On the other hand, CE-CT is also limited by the presence of Lipiodol (iodine oil), therefore the evaluation of therapeutic efficiency is currently made by indirect assessing Lipiodol binding to the tumor using nonenhanced CT. CE-MRI is not influenced by the presence of Lipiodol, but it is an expensive method and still difficult to reach. Several studies have proved similar efficacy, even superior, of CEUS compared to CE-CT and CE-MRI for the evaluation of postTACE treatment results, while other studies have shown the limitations of CEUS especially for deep or small lesions. Given the CEUS limitations, currently some authors consider CT as standard method for the evaluation of TACE and local ablative therapies and CEUS and CE-MRI as complementary methods. Monitoring TACE therapeutic results by contrast imaging techniques is performed as for ablative therapies initially after one month then after every 3 months post-TACE. Given that TACE is indicated only for hyperenhanced lesions during arterial phase, CEUS plays a very important role in monitoring the dysplastic nodules to identify the moment when changes occur in arterial vasculature, being able to have an early therapeutic intervention in order to limit tumor progression, to increase patient survival, and thus to create a bridge to liver transplantation. Fig. 14. Small HCC is seen at top (nodule in nodule). Efficient chemoembolization of the nodule (bottom). CEUS examination shows no circulatory signal within the nodule. Ultrasound monitoring of systemic therapies Systemic therapies are procedures based on the affinity of certain molecules to inhibit either tumor cell replication or multiplication of neoplastic vasculature (antiangiogenic therapies). They are intravenously administered and are indicated in advanced stages of liver tumor diseases, when there are no other effective therapeutic solutions. Among ultrasound techniques, CEUS is the one that brought a significant benefit not only by increasing the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in detecting liver metastases, but also by assessing the efficacy of systemic therapy for HCC and metastases. The method has been adopted by oncologists since 2003 because it involves no irradiation and has no hepatic or renal toxicity, and it is now currently used in tumor therapeutic evaluation. It is currently used in large clinical trials aimed at determining the efficacy of different types of anti-angiogenic molecules by quantifying intratumoral perfusion based on the statistical analysis performed using specific software during post-processing in order to assess therapeutic efficacy as early as possible. ==References== Category:Medical ultrasonography Category:Hepatology Category:Digestive system neoplasia ","title":"Ultrasonography of liver tumors"},{"id":"56097107","text":"The Pondo rock gecko or Pondo flat gecko (Afroedura pondolia) is a species of African gecko found in South Africa and Swaziland. ==References== pondolia Category:Reptiles described in 1925 Category:Reptiles of Eswatini Category:Reptiles of South Africa Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist) ","title":"Pondo rock gecko"},{"id":"56097143","text":"The following is a list of Axe products: ==Deodorants== Axe's list of yearly body-spray variants is as follows.

He adopted the name \\"Friedrich Maria\\" as a pen name and his published articles appear under the name \\"F. M. Urban\\". He was a Gymnasium graduate in Br√ºnn in 1897 and received his Promotion (Ph.D.) in philosophy from the University of Vienna in 1902. He did research and studied probability under Wilhelm Wirth in Leipzig. He taught psychological acoustics at Harvard University from February 1904 to November 1905. He was a Fellow for Research in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania from 1905 to 1908. In 1914 Urban returned to Br√ºnn and married Adele K√∂nigsgarten (born 1884), who was Jewish. At the outbreak of WW I, he and his wife moved to Sweden, where he did research from 1914 to 1917 at the Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1917 he returned to Br√ºnn and served in the Austrian army. Br√ºnn was transferred to the sovereignty of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1919. Because his fluency in the Czech language was inadequate for an academic post, from 1919 he worked as a statistician for an insurance company, but continued to publish papers on psychometry and psychophysics. Urban and his Jewish wife stayed in Br√ºnn throughout WW II, although they sent their two daughters abroad. At the end of WW II, he was put into a concentration camp by the Soviet Red Army and then by the Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakian regime. He was released owing to pleas from foreign colleagues, but he was forced in 1948 to leave Czechoslovakia. He and his wife joined their elder daughter in Norway and then lived in Brazil from 1949 to 1952 where he lectured at the University of S√£o Paulo on factor analysis. In 1952 Urban and his wife went to live with their younger daughter in France, living first in Toulon and then Maisons-Laffitte near Paris.

By marriage, the von Heygen family came into the possession of Bamenohl. On March 5, 1324 Bawenole inferiore was first mentioned in a document by Herbord von Heygen. The cellar vaults and the 2-meter thick walls suggest construction during the 14th or 15th century. At this time there was already a chapel, which is mentioned for the first time in 1362. Around 1433 the von Plettenberg family came into possession of Haus Bamenohl. In the 16th century the property was divided into a so-called \\"lower house\\" (Niederbamenohl and an \\"upper house\\" (Oberbamenohl) referring to the direction of the nearby Lenne river. The lower house was a part of the present castle core, the upper house was situated only a few meters southwest of it. In 1647, Adam Vogt von Elspe built a new house, today the east wing of the castle, IN GREAT WAR AND STRIFE AND REPULSIVENESS, as inscribed on a stone, referring to the Thirty Years' War that ravaged Westphalia at this time. The new building could only outlast the war because the family had several letters of protection, sparing the house from robbery and looting. 18th century Karl Wilhelm Georg von Plettenberg-Heeren In 1781 Moritz Georg Vogt von Elspe called Voss zu Rodenberg and the last Vogt von Elspe, owner of the lower house, purchased the upper house from abbess Caroline von Dalwigk zu Neuenheerse and thus united Oberbamenohl and Niederbamenohl. In 1784, the buildings of the upper house were demolished. When Moritz Georg died, his niece Christine Anna Luise Gisbertine von Bodelschwingh (* 1766 Haus Bodelschwingh, ‚Ä† 1833 ibid.), inherited the estates of Oevinghausen, Schwerte, Westhemmerde, Werl, Bamenohl and Borghausen. Through her marriage to Freiherr Karl Wilhelm Georg von Plettenberg (* 1765 Haus Heeren, ‚Ä† 1850 on Draiser Hof), Erbmarschall (hereditary marshal) of the County of Mark, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, in Utrecht and Grand Master of the Order of Freemasons, Haus Bamenohl returned to the Plettenberg family. He later added his wife's last name to his own. His son Freiherr Gisbert von Bodelschwingh-Plettenberg (* 1790 Haus Bodelschwingh, ‚Ä† 1866 ibid.) inherited Bamenohl, Borghausen, Bodelschwingh, Schwarzenberg, Rodenberg, Sch√∂rlingen, as well as Geretzhoven, Katz and Katzcherhof in the Duchy of J√ºlich, Teschendorf in Farther Pomerania, Drais in the Duchy of Nassau and Huis Loowaard in the province of Gelderland. He was elected in 1826 for life to the Upper House of the Westphalian provincial parliament (Provinziallandtag). 19th and 20th century Haus Bamenohl around 1900 The ruins of the upper house Oberbamenohl were removed in 1851 by the son of Gisbert, Graf Carl Gisbert Wilhelm von Bodelschwingh-Plettenberg (* 1821 Burg Geretzhoven, ‚Ä† 1907 Haus Bodelschwingh) who also filled the moat that surrounded the property from three sides. In addition, he upgraded from 1851 to 1853 the former lower house Niederbamenohl (today's castle) to its present appearance. In particular, he built the tower and set up the English landscape garden. After the death of his father, Carl moved to Haus Bodelschwingh in 1866 and handed over Haus Bamenohl to his brother Adolf Eugen Ludwig von Bodelschwingh-Plettenberg (* 1826 Burg Geretzhoven, ‚Ä† 1902 Haus Heeren). 1856 he married his cousin Bertha von Plettenberg-Heeren (* 1832, ‚Ä† 1900), owner of the etates Heeren, Hilbeck, Werve and Hahnen. The couple moved to Haus Heeren and Haus Bamenohl was used as summer residence. After World War II Haus Bamenohl served as accommodation for refugees from the former eastern territories of Germany, later it was converted into a nursing home, leaving a run-down building in 1967 when it closed. After a vacancy of about 20 years, a successive renovation of the castle and the three surrounding buildings (Forester's lodge, barn and carriage house) began. ==Today== The ensemble of castle, courtyard and garden with its ponds is a listed cultural heritage site. The buildings are inhabited, but visits to the castle and gardens are possible by prior arrangement. Rooms on the ground floor can be rented for events, especially civil marriages. The annual Open-air concerts in the courtyard have become a popular event on the third weekend of August. == References External links== * Haus Bamenohl website Category:Castles in North Rhine-Westphalia ","title":"Haus Bamenohl"},{"id":"56097314","text":"Pek Nga is one of the famous traditional food in Kedah.

By marriage, she became Countess of P√©rigord, her husband was Count Elias VII. According to several sources, Brunissende had influence in the politics of the newly formed Avignon Papacy due to her close relationship with Pope Clement V. This arrangement supposedly enabled Brunissende to ensure a clerical career for her son, H√©lie, who would go on to have an influential career as a cardinal. ==Biography== Background Brunissende's date of birth is unknown, the marriage contract of her parents is dated 14 October 1252 and she herself married in 1298.Cawley, TOULOUSE - COMMINGES, FOIX, Medieval Lands Her three sisters also married during the 1290s.Cawley, TOULOUSE - COMMINGES, FOIX, Medieval Lands Considering that both of her parents were children of around nine years old when the contract was signed, it is most likely that Brunissende was born over a decade later. Viscountess Margaret was a typical example of a medieval woman being betrothed at a young age and it is of little doubt that Brunissende and her sisters were the same. It was certainly a common trend in Toulouse and other parts of southern France for a bride to be between her late teens and early twenties.Ward, no pagination With this context in mind, it is likely that Brunissende was born no earlier than 1275. Brunissende came from a family of politically influential women, her mother and grandmother being two good examples. Viscountess Margaret was involved in succession disputes with her sisters over the County of Bigorre and the inheritance of B√©arn. The situation transpired in Philip IV of France summoning the women to his court in 1302 for a hearing over the matter.Merlet ‚ÄòProc√®s‚Äô, Pi√®ces Justificatives, XIV, p. 322 The situation had been inherited from their mother Martha, Viscountess of Marsan, whom had entered into the dispute with her own relatives, a complicated legacy of Petronilla, Countess of Bigorre. Marriage As previously mentioned, the marriage between Elias and Brunissende took place in 1298. For the groom, this was his second marriage due to the death of his first wife, Philippa, Viscountess of Lomagne, in 1286. Brunissende's family provided her with a dowry of 6,000 livres.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.6 Over the course of the marriage, Elias and Brunissende had several children, including the aforementioned H√©lie as well as Archambaud and Roger-Bernard, both of whom succeeded as Count of P√©rigord. Amongst her daughters were Rosemburge and Agnes.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), pp.6-7 When H√©lie was only six years old, at the request of his father, he received Pope Clement V's permission to receive the clerical tonsure from any bishop whatever, and thus enjoy the right to hold ecclesiastical benefices. A few months later, again at the bidding of his father, H√©lie received permission to receive the fruits of his prebend in the Church of St. Caprais in the diocese of Agen, where he had been made a canon, for three years, without taking up residence. In the next few years other grants quickly followed, some of considerable value.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.8 Whilst it may appear on paper that Count Elias was behind his son's good fortune with the Papacy, others have put this down to Brunissende. According to Eustance Kitts, she had become the Pope's lover and used this position to gain influence over him. To quote Kitts: \\"those who wanted rich benefices in the time of Clement the Fifth laid their petitions on the white bosom of the beautiful Brunissende of Foix\\".Kitts, In the days of the councils: a sketch of the life and times of Baldassare Cossa, 62 According to Thomas Campbell, it was the charms of Brunissende which kept the Pope detained in France following his election, a time when he should have moved to Rome.Campbell, Life and Times of Petrarch, p.144 However, it is more likely that the Avignon Papacy came about due to the political manipulations of King Philip IV, which resulted in Clement's election in the first place.\\"Clement V\\", Encyclopaedia Britannica Giovanni Villani even confessed that stories he had heard of the relationship between Brunissende and the Pope were only hearsay.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.8 With no concrete evidence, the accounts cannot be accepted. Zacour was certain that the two met as the Pope had visited P√©rigueux and the P√©rigords were close allies of the French king, to whom the Pope was in debt to.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.8 What is clear from the evidence is that H√©lie benefitted from the close political ties that both his parents and the Pope shared with the French king. Widowhood and death In 1311, Brunissende was widowed. Due to Archambaud being underage, she assumed the regency over the County of P√©rigord. During this period, her ties with the Avignon Papacy strengthened. The favours to H√©lie did not stop when her husband died. On January 23, 1314, he was made canon in the Church of Cahors, with reservation of a prebend. This certainly implies some form of communication between the Pope and Brunissende, Zacour claimed that the favour was a result of Brunissende's request; as she was regent at the time, it seems logical to have come from her.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.8 In addition, the marriages of her daughters proved advantageous for Brunissende's family. In 1319, her daughter, Rosemburge was married to Jacques de Lavie, a grandnephew of Clement's successor, Pope John XXII. This marital tie with the Papacy made the P√©rigord family of greater interest to the European powers. In 1321, King Robert of Naples desired to develop closer ties with Avignon due to his ambitions in Northern Italy. In order to ensure papal support, a marital alliance was necessary. As the Pope was now related to the P√©rigords through marriage, another one of Brunissende's daughters would be the ideal embodiment of an alliance between the Papacy and Naples.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.31 Therefore, Agnes was married to Robert's brother, John, Duke of Durazzo. Brunissende probably died at Montagnac d'Auberoche, where her last will and testament was drawn up on Sunday, September 30, 1324.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.9 Her funeral saw one of the many dramatic episodes in the long, futile struggle of the counts of Perigord with the independent townsmen of Perigueux. Her body was brought to Perigueux for burial in the convent of the Friars Minor, it was accompanied by her three sons, her daughters and a host of noble ladies, barons, and knights, all of whom lodged in the Franciscan convent. It was Archambaud's claim later that the consuls of the town of Puy St. Front, followed by a crowd of bourgeois, planned an attack on him and his company; they had the horn sounded which customarily summoned the towns folk to meeting, and moved on the Franciscan convent in dead of night with the intention of slaying the Count and all his people.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.9 In the engagement which followed, six of the Count's archers were killed. Archambaud brought suit in the Parlement of Paris against the consuls of the town, demanding that in recompense he be given that absolute authority over the city and the town which his predecessors had lost many years before. The consuls, however, in reply to his charge, said that the Count, on the pretext of the great number of persons who had come to Perigueux for the funeral, demanded that the municipality cause a patrol to be made around the town, which was granted. But when a patrol had gone out beyond the walls of the town, some of the men in the Count's party began to insult the bourgeois, \\"calling them hicks and mocking them in other ways\\"; and then, going into the convent a moment, where the Count was waiting for them, they emerged with their arms and fell on the patrol just as it was re-entering the town, seriously wounding two of the townsmen. The consuls declared unhesitatingly that the Count, \\"who hated the town and townsmen with a great hate,\\" was privy to the whole affair. The Parlement made no decision, but significantly ordered Archambaud to pay the costs of the action.Zacour, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.9 ==ReferencesBibliography== *\\"Clement V\\", Encyclopaedia Britannica *Campbell, Thomas, Life and Times of Petrarch: With Notices of Boccacio and His Illustrious Contemporaries, Volume 1 (H.

The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits, and Jazz and Piano, which involves songs from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened on December 28, 2018, and the Jazz and Piano show opened on January 20, 2019. It was praised by critics, and became the highest grossing Las Vegas concert residency of 2019. With Enigma's gross, Gaga also became the fifth woman to pass the half-billion career total as per Billboard Boxscore. ==Background and development== Park MGM in Las Vegas, location of the concert residency In December 2017, Lady Gaga announced her two-year Las Vegas residency at Park Theater at Park MGM, starting in December 2018. The deal is reportedly worth $100 million, includes 74 performances with a possible extension. In July 2018, Ticketmaster website had mistakenly uploaded details about a \\"2 Show Bundle\\" for the residency with tentative name as Enigma and ticket sales from the end of that month. The link was quickly removed and the residency was finally announced on August 7, 2018. It was named Lady Gaga Enigma with 27 dates, starting from December 28, 2018 to November 9, 2019. Two different shows were listed with the press release, with Enigma described as a \\"brand-new odyssey of [Gaga's] pop hits built as an experience unlike any other,\\" and Lady Gaga Jazz & Piano painted as featuring stripped down versions of her songs accompanied by tracks from the Great American Songbook. Gaga described the show as \\"unlike anything I've done before. It will be a celebration of all that is unique and different within us. The challenges of bravery can be overcome with creativity and courage that is grown out of adversity, love and music.\\" Five additional dates were added to the itinerary for the Jazz & Piano shows. The singer released a promotional poster accompanying the announcement, colored in day-glo paint. She wore a neon green tulle dress by designers Laurence & Chico, and latex gloves and swim cap from Vex Clothing. The image was photographed by Inez and Vinoodh and styled by Gaga's longtime collaborator Nicola Formichetti. Matt Moen from Paper felt that the poster hearkened back to Gaga's fashion choices during The Fame Monster (2009) era, suggesting the singer's return to avant-garde looks. He also found Las Vegas EDM and rave influences in the poster, likening it to an Electric Daisy Carnival. Formichetti also worked on creating the costumes for the concert series. On December 4, 2018, Gaga shared a video from the rehearsal on her Instagram account showing her in a bodysuit with dots on it, utilizing motion capture while the song \\"Aura\\" played in the background. She also assumed a titular new identity in one of the videos, referring herself as Enigma. In May 2019, a mini-museum, called Haus of Gaga: Las Vegas, also opened in Park MGM. It includes forty pieces of clothing and accessories from Gaga‚Äôs personal archive, including her bodysuit from the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, custom Alexander McQueen lace gown worn in the \\"Alejandro\\" music video, and her meat dress. == Concert synopsis ==  Enigma  Gaga performing her song \\"The Fame\\" The show starts with an introduction where Enigma, a motion captured character who is Gaga's alter ego, welcomes the crowd. Shortly after, the singer appears suspended to the roof of the theater and performs \\"Just Dance\\" as she plays the keytar. After joining the stage, Gaga and her dancers perform \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"LoveGame\\". Then, she meets Enigma, who explains her who she is and that she's going to show Gaga the future through a simulation. After an interlude, the singer returns on stage wearing a fluorescent suit and a manga inspired wig, and performs \\"Dance in the Dark\\" and \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\". Gaga takes her jacket off and plays an instrument which includes a keyboard and guitar strings, while singing \\"The Fame\\". After performing \\"Telephone\\" and \\"Applause\\", Gaga realizes that in the simulation, paparazzi are dangerous and want to capture her. She performs \\"Paparazzi\\" up in the air in an orb-like cage, but quickly after, the paparazzi catch her and she performs \\"Aura\\" while they torture her. Gaga performing \\"Bad Romance\\" in a latex suit The third act opens with Gaga riding a giant mechanical robot, wearing a light-up catsuit by futuristic designer Asher Levine, while singing \\"Schei√üe\\". Pyrotechnic effects accompany the performance. The song transitions to \\"Judas\\", in which Gaga performs a long electric guitar solo. Later she performs \\"Government Hooker\\" with changed lyrics to address the current US administration. After that, Gaga covers David Bowie's \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\" while standing in a circular keyboard console. Following an interlude in which Enigma explains to Gaga that she must heal, \\"The Edge of Glory\\" and \\"Alejandro\\" are performed. Gaga sits down at piano at the end of the catwalk to sing \\"Million Reasons\\" and \\"You and I\\", where she is joined by her guitarists. The last act opens with \\"Bad Romance\\", performed in a cream latex suit on the catwalk while Gaga's dancers execute the choreography on the main stage. Enigma tells Gaga it is now time for her to leave, but Gaga insists to perform for her one last time. \\"Born This Way\\" follows, and after Gaga and her crew leave the stage, she comes back to sing \\"Shallow\\" on her piano as the encore.  Jazz and Piano  The singer's Jazz and Piano engagement does not involve a comprehensive narrative as the Enigma show, but it is divided into four segments, each of them preceded by costume change and black-and-white interlude films. In the videos, Gaga talks about her love of Jazz and American classics, and gives shout outs to performers who inspired her, including Billie Holiday, Etta James and Dinah Washington. == Critical response ==  Enigma  Gaga performing \\"Schei√üe\\" during her Enigma show Chris Willman from Variety called the Enigma show a \\"back-to-roots move for the superstar\\", as it focused on her \\"art and artifice of being spectacular\\", and complimented Gaga for singing live for the entirety of the two hours. Mark Gray from People thought that the show was \\"highly energetic\\", which \\"lived up to the hype\\", and praised the theatricality of the show and the singer's connection with the audience. Andreas Hale from Billboard thought that the \\"set pieces were just as grandiose and over-the-top as the performances themselves\\" and the outfits were \\"outrageously unique\\". At the end of his review, he concluded that \\"it was obvious that Gaga was more than comfortable on the Vegas stage where many all-time greats cut their teeth. Simply put, she was born to do this.\\" John Katsilometes, from the Las Vegas Review-Journal praised the singer's vocal and piano skills, saying that \\"she is dazzling dancing around the stage, a slim figure in a mirrored one-piece to open the night, but her heartfelt playing on the keyboards shows she can move a crowd subtly, too.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos highlighted the variety of the setlist and the use of props, while saying that \\"the best moments are the ones that feel improvised\\". She concluded her review by saying that Enigma \\"ended up becoming a show that confirms and begins her legacy\\". Randy Lewis from the Los Angeles Times thought that Gaga was \\"in full pop star mode\\", and while he appreciated the \\"gigantic\\" set pieces and the inclusion of the singer's biggest hits, he found the show \\"disjointed\\", with \\"little sense of narrative flow\\". He also added that the choreography \\"offers little in the way of physical expression or amplification of her songs‚Äô lyrics or music\\", although he noted that it showcased \\"plenty of wild, kinetic energy\\". Entertainment Weekly journalist Marc Snetiker called the show \\"on the whole, rather nutty, (...) but Enigma the show is a damn good time, and it‚Äôs admirable in its attempts to elevate a greatest-hits gathering into something striving for more, something that perhaps even galvanized an artist in the peak of her career to take a Vegas residency in the first place.\\"  Jazz and Piano  Gaga performing during one of the Jazz & Piano shows Variety magazine journalist Chris Willman thought that the Jazz & Piano arrangement was even better than the singer's other show, calling it \\"the best shot we‚Äôre going to get at (...) time travel\\" as \\"this show recalls peak Vegas\\", and complimented the singer\\"s \\"real emotion\\" showcased throughout this performance. Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times also compared it to Enigma, saying that \\"for all their differences in style and repertoire, both shows feel indelibly Gaga, linked by the unifying force of her wacky personality and her raw vocal talent.\\" He further noticed, that \\"for her, the two Vegas performances aren‚Äôt opposed but complementary ‚Äî part of the same determination to use artifice to say something real.\\" == Commercial reception == Pre-sale for the show started from August 8, 2018, for Gaga's fan club members, followed by Citi bank credit card holders on the next day, getting an early chance at acquiring the tickets. There was also a pre-sale for MGM members as well as Live Nation and Ticketmaster customers which ran from August 11‚Äì12. The next day tickets for the show would be available to the general public, including the general bookings and VIP packages for meet-and- greet. IQ magazine reported that the tickets were outselling nearest competitors, those of residencies by artists like Celine Dion and Britney Spears. The sales are also affected by the higher price range of the tickets in the secondary markets. In February 2019, the first set of boxscores were reported by Billboard. Gaga earned $16 million from the 11 reported sold out dates, which when divided monthwise, resulted in grosses of $4.3 million in December 2018, $8.7 million in January 2019 and $2.9 million in February. Individual show grosses ranged from $1.41‚Äì$1.48 million, with the total audience rounding out at 59,162 tickets. According to the magazine's Eric Frankenberg, the total gross was \\"an electrifying opening pace for Gaga's Vegas residency\\", since the singer \\"outperformed\\" the opening grosses of all previous residencies by other artists‚Äîincluding Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, the Backstreet Boys, Shania Twain and Gwen Stefani. With the gross, Gaga also became the fifth woman to pass the half-billion career total as per Billboard Boxscore. In 2019, the residency grossed $53,868,719 million for an average of $1,584,374 per concert, and sold 185,019 tickets for an average of 5,442 per concert. The average ticket price was $291.15. ==Set lists== Enigma This set list is a representation of the December 28, 2018, concert.

Adela Ju≈°iƒá is one of the creators of the online archive of the antifascist struggle of women in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia. She lives and works in Sarajevo. == Education == Ju≈°iƒá attended the High School of Applied Arts from 1997 to 2001. She obtained an MA from the Academy of Fine Arts, the Department of Printmaking, Sarajevo University in 2007. She completed her second MA in Democracy and human rights in South East Europe from Sarajevo and Bologna universities in 2013. She completed her internship as part of ERMA program at the Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities, Skopje, Macedonia in 2013. == Career == Ju≈°iƒá grew up in Sarajevo during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina which strongly influenced her art works. The main aspects of her work are her personal experience of the war and the politics of war, her strong devotion to feminism, communality and solidarity. She uses different media: video, video performance, performance, collage and drawing.(The sniper, I will never talk about the war again, Silk lavander shirt, Ride the recoil). Second part of her works portray partisan women's role in the Second World War and the role of women in Socialism (Unknown Heroines, What has our struggle given us?, Unknown partisan woman). Until 2017, she has created more than 50 multimedia and visual art works. Her works have been reviewed by Marina Gr≈æiniƒá, David Elliot, Jelena Petroviƒá, Matthew Webber, Jonathan Blackwood, Alessandra Ferrini and Hodara Susan, among some. Her work is described as \\"disarmingly honest and candid, be it dealing with family stories or broader political narratives.\\" Auto-biographical works on war in Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Sniper (2007)  Original title Snajperist, this short video is an auto-biographical work. Adela Ju≈°iƒá's father had been a member of the Bosnian Army in Sarajevo from the start of the war. His task during Sarajevo siege was to hunt down the snipers who were shooting at civilians in breach of human rights and the Geneva Conventions. It was on December 3, 1992, when, as a sniper, he got killed by a sniper bullet which hit him in the eye. In The Sniper, the artist narrates the part of her father's notebook where he had listed how many soldiers he had killed during his combat assignments, while drawing a red circle behind which the photograph of her father appears. The Sniper was part of the MOMENTUM exhibition ‚ÄúHERO MOTHER / Contemporary Art by Post-Communist Women Rethinking Heroism‚Äù curated by Rachel Rits-Volloch and Bojana Pejic in Berlin. Bojana Pejic states that: \\"Memory is also re-enacted in the pieces that treat the trauma and loss caused by the war in Bosnia (Maja Bajeviƒá and Adela Ju≈°iƒá), and these works also specify that the memories of women, even when they are soldiers, differ from those of men.\\" Alessandra Ferini, visual artist, researcher and educator, states: The Sniper was used as part of MA Fine Art degree course at Chelsea College of Arts, University of the Arts London and Tate Research Centre and rose \\"the issue of how personal material occupies the field of catharsis in making, living and restoring memories.\\" Ju≈°iƒá presented her work The Sniper at London School of Economics panel \\"Art in Conflict\\" in 2013. The Sniper is part of imai ‚Äì inter media art institute foundation archive and Transitland: Video Art from Central and Eastern Europe. Transitland EUROPA is a collaborative archive of 100 videos that reflect on the transitions and transformations in the post-Socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The videos include works from the past twenty years, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the present. When I die, you can do what you want (2011)  Original title of the work is Kad ja umrem, radite ≈°ta hoƒáete, 2011. In this video, the artist tenderly applies dye to the hair of her grandmother, who has since died. On the soundtrack, Ju≈°iƒá whispers in Bosnian, retelling the stories her grandmother shared about her difficult life. ‚ÄúBack then it was hundred times worse,‚Äù the subtitles read, and, ‚ÄúDeath is a pretty relief.‚Äù. Ju≈°iƒá's grandmother had lived through both the Second World War and the previous war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hana Marku describes the work: When I die, you can do what you want is also part of imai ‚Äì inter media art institute foundation archive of 3,000 artistic and documentary works from the pioneering era of the 1960s until the present day.  I will never talk about the war again (2011)  Original title of the work is: Ja vi≈°e nikada neƒáu priƒçati o ratu. In this collaborative video performance I Will Never Talk About the War Again of Adela Ju≈°iƒá and Lana Cmajcanin, the two artists from Bosnia and Herzegovina promise each other not to talk about the war anymore, repeating the same sentence over and over, increasingly becoming more and more agitated that they cannot escape the subject even by not talking. Matthew Webber reviews the work: The work I will never talk about the war was included in the Perpetuum Mobile collection of Living Archive, during its first edition in Zagreb, Croatia in 2011, as \\"integral part, an attempt and challenge to politically (re)articulate these overlapping, conflicting and rebounding grounds\\". Jelena Petrovic, member of curatorial team, states that \\"the work itself becomes a trigger for the curators‚Äô positioning in relation to the work, as well as a signifier of the context in which it is presented to the audience, media and the politics of place.\\" This work, along with The Sniper and When I die, you can do what you want have been included in Film Mutations: Festival of Invisible Cinema 08 Parallel Film, Zagreb 2014. Selector of the Festival, theoretician and artist Marina Gr≈æiniƒá, describes the works showing the \\"intensified, militarized colonialism and the machine of war (which regulates gaze, affects and life)\\" and further that: = I will never talk about the war again exhibitions = I will never talk about the war again was used as a title for an exhibition in F√§rgfabriken's global project, Psychosis in Stockholm in 2011, curated by Vladan Jeremic, on post-war trauma and the social psychological consequences. It presents the works of artists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia and Russia such as Adela Ju≈°iƒá, Marina Abramoviƒá, Igor Grubiƒá, ≈Ωivko Grozdaniƒá Gera, Lana Cmajcanin and several others. I will never talk about the war again work and Bedtime stories, also a collaboration between Adela Ju≈°iƒá and Lana Cmajcanin are both included in the exhibition. The modified exhibition of the original one presented in Stockholm I will never talk about the war again was also presented in Maribor, Slovenia as a part of the programme created by KIBLA for the manifestation Maribor 2012: European Capital of Culture. It is focused on critical social analysis and testimonies of violence and trauma connected with recent wars in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Ride the recoil (2013)  Adela Ju≈°iƒá's mixed media work in collaboration with Ervin Pra≈°ljiviƒá Ride the Recoil was developed with technical support by Ervin Pra≈°ljiviƒá and Ognjen ≈†avija. Ride the Recoil is a critique of the video game Sniper : Ghost Warrior 2 (set in Sarajevo) as the commodification of the Bosnian war. The work consists of the video-game excerpts, audio narrative part of the artist on how to avoid snipers (based on her wartime experiences) overdubbing the instructions of the video game on how to kill and series of photographs of a little girl leaving the gate. Ride the recoil has won the Special award of 54th October salon. Ride the Recoil was first published as part of Triple Canopy‚Äôs Internet as Material project area, supported by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Brown Foundation, Inc., of Houston, the Lambent Foundation Fund of Tides Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Jonathan Blackwood, theoretician, writer and curator of contemporary art, describes the piece:  Silk lavander shirt (2016)  As a main element of the performance, the artist uses ICTY trial transcripts, the memoirs of Biljana Plav≈°iƒá, her statements to the media, and other relevant materials. Biljana Plav≈°iƒá, the former President of the Republic of Srpska, was indicted in 2001 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes during Bosnian war. After pleading guilty and statement of repentance, the prosecutors dropped genocide charges against her, and sentenced her to 11 years. She served two thirds of her sentence in prison in Sweden and was released earlier. During her stay in prison in 2005, she published a voluminous memoirs in which she denied her previous confession. The idea of the performance was to point out to the contrast present in representation of Biljana Plavsic, her false repentance and light sentence she had received, disproportionate to the crimes she had committed. The title of the work was inspired by the quote about Biljana Plav≈°iƒá of a prominent writer Slavenka Drakuliƒá: Pale green, lavender, fuchsia, and dark blue seem to be her favorite colors; a silk shirt under her jacket part of her uniform.  Works on partisan women and Second World War  Adela Ju≈°iƒá has dedicated years to the research of participation of women in National Peoples Struggle, Women's Antifascist Front and their position in the aftermath of the Second World War. First central segment of her work is related to the portrayals of women partisans, their representation in NOB, women's narratives and their oral history. Such works include What has our struggle given us? (2013), which is a mixed media work inspired by the book Women heroes on life stories of 10 Bosnian heroines from World War II. Another example of Ju≈°iƒá's work is Unknown Partisan woman (2016). After the World War II in Yugoslavia, Partisans whose names were not known were buried under the gravestone that instead of a name had words Unknown Partisan or Unknown Partisan woman engraved. Ju≈°iƒá created a replica of such gravestone with words: Unknown Partisan woman and put it in the park in the center of Sarajevo, near other historically important sites and across the building where notorious Beledija jail was, where many woman antifascists were held prisoners and tortured during the war. After almost a year, no city authorities or media gave attention to the gravestone. It is still on the same spot. The second central topic of her work is the relationship of the economy and the reproductive role of women during Socialism. Ju≈°iƒá compares the participation of women in Second World War through their mass mobilization and armed struggle, post-war participation of women in re-building of the state through their voluntary work and the big turnover of perception of women's work during 1950's when women are called into their natural roles as mother, housewives and nurturers. Some of the most notable works on this topic include: Labor of Love in collaboration with Andreja Dugandzic (2014), Here come the Women (2015), We long for work and toil in collaboration with Andreja Dugandzic (2014) and many more. As Jonathan Blackwood describes:  Archive of Anti-fascist Front of Women of BiH and Yugoslavia  Adela Ju≈°iƒá and Andeja Dugand≈æiƒá have started an online archive of Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia and Women's Antifascist Front of BiH in 2015. This online platform consists of thousands of documents, photographs, interviews, transcripts, periodicals and books Adela Ju≈°iƒá and Andreja Dugandzic have been collecting for years in public archives, libraries and private collections. The archive was launched on 8 March, the International Women's day in 2015. The archive was launched as to: As part of the archive a book as a collection of essays, works and illustrations called Izgubljena revolucija: AF≈Ω Izmeƒëu mita i zaborava was published and presented. The collection features a chapter on Ju≈°iƒá's illustrations. == Awards == * 54th October Salon Special Award, 2013 * Henkel Young Artists Prize CEE 2011 * Charlama gallery award for best work of young artist, 2011 * YVAA Zvono for the best Bosnian young artist, 2010 == Residencies, scholarships, funded research and other == * 2017 Artist in Residence Program, Kulturni Center Tobaƒçna 001, Ljubljana, Slovenia * 2017 November 11- January 11, 2018 ‚Äì transmaking, art based research at Izmir University of Economics, Fine Art Department, Izmir, Turkey * 2017 April 25 - June 25 ‚Äì transmaking, art based research at Izmir University of Economics, Fine Art Department, Izmir, Turkey * 2017 September 1‚Äì25 Artist in Residence, frei_raum Q21 exhibition space, Museums Quartier, Vienna, Austria * 2016 International artist-in-residency platform GuestRoom Maribor, Slovenia * 2014 TICA, Tirana, Albania * 2013 recipient of ERMA Scholarship, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina * 2013 i.a.a.b., Basel, Switzerland * 2012 Kulturkontakt, Vienna, Austria * 2011 ISCP, New York, USA * 2010 Temporary City, Kozelites Approach Art Association, Pecs, Hungary * 2010 Miskolc Institute for Contemporary Art, Miskolc, Hungary == References  External links == * * Archive of antifascist struggle of women of BiH and Yugoslavia Archive website * Complete list of exhibitions Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century women artists Category:21st-century Bosnia and Herzegovina artists Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina women artists Category:People from Sarajevo Category:University of Sarajevo alumni Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina video artists ","title":"Adela Ju≈°iƒá"},{"id":"56097530","text":"The 1880 Welsh Cup Final, was the 3rd in the competition.

The √âcole de haute montagne (High Mountain School)was created in Chamonix in 1932, becoming the world's first specialist training school for mountain troop leaders. The aims of the school were to teach mountain instructors, and to test and development of technical equipment and armaments. In August 1939 the majority of √âcole de haute montagne's cadres joined the 199th Battalion Chasseurs de haute montagne, whose role was to defend France's alpine borders. The school's mission changed in 1945 to train mountain and ski specialists for the entire Army. In 1947 the French Military Ski Team was formed, under the Commissariat for Military Sports, it was supported and managed by the EHM. In 1948 the Chamonix Mountain Relief Society, the doctors of the School participated with the rescue team to provide emergency relief and aid in the Mont Blanc area. The first section of volunteer NCOs were incorporated into the EHM in 1961. On the initiative of Colonel Gonnet, then commander of the EHM, an international military rally of mountain troops was created in 1963. In addition to France, the four other alpine nations (Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy) participated. In 1966 the EHM was redesignated as the √âcole militaire de haute montagne. In 1981 the High Mountain Military Group (Groupe militaire de haute montagne, GMHM) was relocated from Grenoble where it had been created 5 years prior, to settle at the EMHM. ==Brevets== All mountain brevets are all available in summer and winter. *The Brevet d'alpiniste et de skieur militaire(mountaineering and military skier's certificate, BASM) composed of: **Brevet de skieur militaire (Military skier's certificate or BSM) **Brevet d'alpiniste militaire (Military mountaineering certificate or BAM) Insignia of the Brevet CEHM. *Chef d'√©quipe haute montagne (High Mountain Team Leader, CEHM) **CEHM Summer **CEHM winter ***on a technical level, the CEHM is the equivalent of the BQTM but is only intended for corporals and master corporals. *Brevet de qualification des troupes de montagne (Mountain Qualification Qualification Certificate, BQTM) **summer qualification, four week course **winter qualification, which also lasts four weeks *Chef de d√©tachement haute montagne (detachment high mountain leader, CDHM, for non-commissioned officers) or Chef d'unit√© de haute montagne (unit of high mountain leader, CUHM, for officers), these patents correspond to the same formation **A summer course of 6 weeks **A winter course of 6 weeks *Brevet sup√©rieur de technicien de l'arm√©e de terre (Senior Army Technician Certificate, BSTAT) Mountain Option *Brevet de guide de haute montagne (mountain guide certificate) There are then other qualifications which, although not specific to mountain troops, were created and developed within the High Mountain Military School (EMHM), including the three paragliding pilot licenses (Brevet A, B, and C) each having a higher qualification level.

Born in Blackburn in Lancashire, Brothers was educated at Blackburn Technical College, where he obtained top marks in the City and Guilds of London Institute examination. He spent some time in Canada, working as a miner, and then building railways, but returned to Blackburn, where he worked as a weaver and a cardroom operative. He joined the Blackburn Cardroom Workers' Amalgamation, soon becoming its secretary, and in 1927 visited India to investigate the state of the cotton industry there. The Cardroom Amalgamation was the only major cotton trade union without a member of Parliament, and they sponsored Brothers as a Labour Party candidate in Birmingham Duddeston at the 1922 general election. He was unsuccessful, but pursued his political career with election to Blackburn Borough Council in 1928, and finally won the union a place in Parliament at the 1929 general election, when he was elected in Bolton. During Brothers' time in Parliament, Indian tariffs against British cotton were greatly increased, but Brothers believed that the Lancashire cotton industry would benefit, as tariffs against rival Japanese cotton were increased by even more. This hope proved incorrect, and the industry in Blackburn suffered most from the new barriers to export. He lost his seat in Parliament at the 1931 general election, and left the council in 1932, but remained involved with Labour as a member of its National Executive Committee, on which he represented the United Textile Factory Workers' Association from 1930 until 1939. From 1935, Brothers served as a magistrate in Blackburn. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Trade unionists from Lancashire Category:People from Blackburn Category:UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:United Textile Factory Workers' Association- sponsored MPs ","title":"Michael Brothers"},{"id":"56097832","text":"Turan's minnow (Pseudophoxinus turani) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae.

Athletes climb up, spin from, hang off, flip onto, jump off, and invert on poles. Poling requires agility, strength, balance, endurance, and flexibility. A 2017 study of 52 female pole dancers indicated that pole-dance fitness improves strength and posture. Pole-sports athletes include men and women of a variety of ages and physical abilities, including para-athletes, who perform alone or with others (for example, in doubles competitions). Poling developed into a fitness activity and sport during the 1990s and 2000s, with national and international pole competitions. Poling has become a dance, fitness activity and sport, and continues to evolve. The International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF), formed in 2009 by Tim Trautman and Katie Coates, is endeavoring to make poling an Olympic sport. The federation has held world championships since 2012, and poling was one of seven sports granted observer status by the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) in 2017. Professional pole-sports leagues have been formed, notably Oksana Grishina's O.G. Pole Fitness (which holds its annual championship at Mr. Olympia)https://polepress.org/articles/competition-news/olympia-hosts-first- pole-competition and the Pole Championship Series (which holds its annual championship at the Arnold Sports Festival).https://polepress.org/articles/competition-news/5-years-of-pole-at- the-arnold-anniversary-interview-with-pcs-president-lindsey-kimura/ Poling involves technique as well as artistry. In a pole competition, each athlete performs a routine to music. Athletes are judged on their ability to perform complex movements (e.g. spins and strength and flexibility poses), choreography, style, and expressiveness. Poles in IPSF pole-sports competitions are brass, 45mm (1.77 in) in diameter, with 4m (13.12 feet) of usable height. In competition, athletes use a static (non-spinning) pole and a spinning pole. Their skin helps performers grip the slippery poles, and athletes wear clothing which exposes the skin on their shoulders, waist, arms and legs. The IPSF requires competitors to cover their pelvis, gluteal muscles and (for women) breasts. When using Chinese poles (which differ from IPSF poles), thicker clothing protects the body. == Background == Poles have been used in mallakhamba and circuses. Mallakhamba traces its origins to the 12th- century malla-yuddha, a type of wrestling in India. It commonly uses a wooden pole and a cotton rope. The practice has a spiritual component, involves acrobatic and yogic movements, and was first developed as a tool for wrestlers. Mallakhamba has developed into a contemporary sport: Mallakhamba has been demonstrated to improve mood. According to Qifeng and Xining, acrobatic Chinese pole-climbing was first mentioned 2,000 years ago. Its techniques arose from tree-climbing in agriculture. Chinese poling is an acrobatic activity which has been part of Cirque du Soleil and is taught for recreational purposes in aerial gyms, such as Aerial Athletica in Las Vegas. Although online articles and websites draw historical connections between the ancient activities and contemporary pole dance and pole sports, how much and in what ways mallakhamba and Chinese poling may have affected their development is unclear. Pole use in mallakhamba and Chinese poling has been used to argue that pole dance and pole sports are not inherently erotic, and may be suitable for youth. Online conversations suggest contemporary connections, such as the adoption of moves from Chinese poling by pole athletes.). Researchers suggest other influences on contemporary pole sports, such as maypole dancing. Poling is commonly associated with striptease, and is perceived as evolving from exotic-dance clubs in North America during the 1980s. Not all exotic-dance clubs have poles, however, and not all exotic dancers make a pole central to their performance. Fitness model, performer and former exotic dancer Fawnia Mondey-Dietrich is often credited with developing the first instructional pole dance videos and classes during the 1990s. Classes in exotic pole, pole fitness and pole dance have been offered in exotic-dance clubs, bars, gyms and specialized pole studios. Mondey-Dietrich operates Pole Fitness Studio and hosts the annual Pole Expo in Las Vegas. Pole studios (studios focused on teaching pole) have also sprung up in Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. They offer classes with erotic components and classes focused on fitness and athletics; Power Pole Sports offers training in competitive pole sports and judging. Students in elementary pole classes learn how to perform spins, supporting their body weight with their hands. They then learn how to climb the pole, invert (flip upside down), and perform complicated maneuvers or tricks. Pole classes are physically challenging, and poling requires a high level of understanding how the body's points of contact work with the pole. As pole athletes develop skill, they can use fewer body points of contact with the pole and make more aerial moves without being on the ground (including deadlifting their bodies from a stationary aerial position parallel to the pole into an inverted ‚Äì upside-down ‚Äì position). In addition to strength and flexibility, pole sports can be painful. Poling has not developed into a fitness activity and sport without tension. Some feminists say that poling will always be symbolically linked to exotic dancing, is part of the larger sexualization of culture, and is objectifying. Pole classes have provided opportunities for students to bond with and support each other, however, and encourages athleticism. Poling has sex-positive aspects, may challenge gender and sexual stereotypes, and studies have indicated that polers can feel empowered. According to Silvia Grosso of Milan Pole Studio in Miami, poling is a challenging workout (especially for beginners). Grosso believes that poling is more enjoyable and creative than a traditional gym, however, and she wants her studio to be part of a community in which students have the freedom to express themselves. Disagreements have existed between exotic dancers and fitness-sport polers, who are trying to demonstrate that a pole can be more than erotic and belongs in other settings than strip clubs. Terminology can be controversial, and those trying to distance pole dancing from its erotic connotations refer to \\"pole fitness\\". Dancers have argued that distancing can be divisive and stigmatizing, ignoring contributions made by erotic dancers to poling. A Twitter debate occurred, with polers using the hashtag #notastripper to distance poling from exotic dance; erotic dancers and supporters used the hashtags #yesastripper and #eroticnotexotic. According to some polers, the pole community needs to come together and support all forms of poling. Poling is practiced in classes, in professional and international competitions, and onstage in non-strip clubs; Felix Cane and others have performed in Cirque du Soleil. The IPSF hosts world competitions in pole sports and ultra, artistic and para pole. == Sport == Scholars of sport and leisure note a process in which physical activities develop into sports. According to Allen Guttman, modern sports are characterized by secularism, equality of opportunity, specialization of roles, rationalization, bureaucratic organization, quantification and the quest for records. Pole dance has become pole sports; the International Pole Sports Federation was founded in 2008, with national federations, competitive teams, formalized rules and a code of points. \\"Pole sports: This flagship discipline includes artistic elements but is based more heavily on athleticism and technical merit, and judged by an original Code of Points in line with other Olympic standard sports such as diving, ice skating and gymnastics.\\"  Extreme sport  Poling tricks have multiplied as the pole community has developed and shared new techniques. Some athletes perform acrobatic tricks, jumps and other maneuvers, making poling an extreme sport. The IPSF supports ultra pole competitions: \\"The exhilarating Ultra Pole, was designed to encourage innovation, embolden creativity, elevate freedom of expression, and escalate ultimate athleticism to attract the most radical and innovative athletes yet. Judged by the Freestyle Rules, Ultra Pole is an ultimate trick battle enabling the athlete to trick out against other competitors in battle style rounds.\\"  Commercial aspects  Companies have formed to support pole sports, manufacturing competition poles and poles for home and practice. Performers use a variety of grip aids to minimize sweat or aid stickiness. Other companies provide clothing to polers. == References == Category:Dances Category:Sports by type Category:Acrobatic sports ","title":"Pole sports"},{"id":"56097980","text":"Emily Steel is a business journalist who has contributed to several news publications and has covered the media industry at the New York Times since 2014.

When talking about Mike, Kathie Baillie, of Baillie & the Boys, said \\"Some artists just have a knack for going to the right places, playing the melody in a way that sounds familiar, and yet at the same time fresh. Mike is that guy.\\" == Early life and education == Morgan was born in Jackson, Ohio on June 12, 1948 to Naomi Elizabeth (n√©e Long) and John Willard Morgan as the youngest of 3 boys. As a teenager, Morgan, along with high school friend Paul Hanks, formed a garage band called The Truants in 1964. The group began to perform with members Craig Loney, Larry Coburn, John Jones, and Joe Click coming alongside Morgan and Hanks. The Truants became one of the #1 touring bands in the Tri- State. They appeared in concert and on television with John Hamer‚Äôs Let‚Äôs Dance TV program generated from Huntington, West Virginia. This appearance generated tremendous response for the band. In 2006, The Truants came back together to produce a CD, which led to the band performing several benefits across the region. Morgan went on to study Education at Eastern Kentucky University, where he graduated in 1970. Afterwards, Morgan attended University of Dayton where he earned his master's degree in counseling, graduating in 1986. == Career == Morgan was surrounded by music his entire life. Growing up, he remembers his dad, uncle, and aunt coming together on Sunday evenings to sing hymns. His brothers were also influential along his musical path. Mike's oldest brother, Bob, was a drummer in a local group called The Four Jacks. Morgan grew up with all genres of music surrounding him. There was no type of music left out in their record collection. In the late 60s, David Howell approached Paul Hanks about recording two singles. Hanks remembered his time with The Truants and requested that Morgan come along as a producer for the singles. The two singles received a lot of regional airplay and sales. In 1968, Morgan met up with high school friend Jeff Elliott. The two began writing songs together and decided toward the end of 1968 to take the songs to Nashville, Tennessee. The duo was signed by Jack Key of Newkeys Music. With the help of Jack and Jimmy Key, Morgan and Elliott had their first songs recorded. During that time, Morgan met country artist Ed Bruce. Bruce had just formed a new publishing company and asked Morgan and Elliott to play some of their songs. Morgan and Elliott joined the company in 1971. In 1973, David Howell asked Morgan to record and release a single called Walker's Woods, which received a lot of regional airplay in the Southern United States. This was the first single that featured Morgan as a recording artist. It was produced by Ed Bruce. In the late 70s, Morgan moved on to Greene Pastures Music, which was owned by Nat Stuckey and his wife Ann. Conway Twitty recorded The Feel of Bein' Gone on his MCA Records album \\"Heart and Soul\\". Also, the song Washed in the Blood was recorded by former Governor of Louisiana and Country Music Hall of Fame member Jimmie Davis. Later in the 1980s, Morgan became discouraged and pushed music away. He spent an entire year not writing songs and avoiding music altogether. He wasn't sure how he was going to get back into the music game, if he even tried to get back in. While sitting in Dr. Greg Miller's office at University of Rio Grande, the path back to music came to Morgan. He was asked to present a program on Appalachian music to kindergarten and 1st grade students in Gallipolis City School District by the Ohio Arts Council. After talking with the teachers in the district, Morgan decided to teach the students some of the key components of music to help spread music education into young minds. It was at this time that Morgan, with help from his wife, realized that he may not be destined to win a Grammy Award or have a Number 1 Single, but just to enjoy making music and sharing it with others. While keeping his faith strong, opportunities began to open up for Morgan and he was back writing songs. In the late 90s, Morgan and Elliott teamed up again with Dr. Greg Miller to write the music for Miller's Off- Broadway play called Billy Bob Loves Charlene. Morgan and Elliott again teamed up with Ed Bruce, as well as Jack Jackson, to coproduce a new album for Bruce called \\"This Old Hat\\" in 2002. This was Bruce's first project in 10 years and features several traditional country songs. Morgan co-wrote several of the songs on the album as well. To this day, many people are still purchasing and downloading the last album Morgan and Bruce worked on together. When talking about the album, Country Weekly Magazine said \\"It's been way too long since we heard from Ed Bruce. His decade-long string of smashes like \\"You're The Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had\\" and \\"You Turn Me On (Like A Radio)\\" ended in the late 80's and he has been pretty much off the scene since then. So the big question has to be: Can he still cut it? This Old Hat answers that question in the warmest, most unassuming way you could imagine. Ed delivers these 13 songs - including some new versions of his old hits, such as a gorgeous take on \\"You're the Best Break\\" - in such a quietly confident way that you'd think he hasn't been away for a moment.\\" In 2015, Morgan was looking at some unfinished works and came across a song named Sweet Liberty. He thought it could make a great patriotic choral piece and got into contact with Tom Fettke, a music arranger in Nashville. Tom liked the idea and began working with Morgan and Elliott to finish the song. It was published by Praisegathering Music and released as a patriotic choral anthem. In that same year, Morgan teamed up with Austin, Texas Americana artist Slaid Cleaves. Cleaves, Morgan, and Elliott worked together to co-write two songs that appeared on Cleaves' \\"Ghost on the Car Radio\\" and \\"Still Fightin the War\\" albums. Following a similar theme to that of Ed Bruce, Morgan got in touch with Michael Bonagura of Baillie & the Boys to work on their first project in 6 years. Their work together began in 2015 on the CD \\"I Will Run\\" and was released in February 2018. The CD features various music styles and is considered one of their most interesting albums to date. Morgan continues to write new songs and perform at songwriter venues. == Family life == Mike married his wife, Melody, in 1971. They have two children, Michael C. Morgan (born 1973) and Amanda J.

He won several awards and honors as a sophomore in 2019, including being named a consensus All-American. ==Early years== Parsons was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. He grew up playing football at Sunshine Park. For his freshman and sophomore years, Parsons attended Central Dauphin High School. In his sophomore year, Parsons committed to Penn State, but later decommitted to look at other options. For his junior year, Parsons transferred to Harrisburg High School where he started at both defensive end and running back. In his senior year, Parsons rushed for 1,239 yards and 27 touchdowns. He racked up sacks and one interception. Parsons also played varsity basketball. He was a five-star recruit and was ranked #4 in his class by 247Sports.com and #7 by ESPN. Parsons was recruited by Nebraska, Georgia, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Alabama and Penn State. On December 19, The Lantern reported that Ohio State had committed NCAA violations because the university allowed him on the set of ESPN's College GameDay to take a picture with analyst Kirk Herbstreit. Due to the fact that Herbstreit was a former Ohio State University quarterback, a violation of some NCAA laws, as recruits are not allowed to have contact with members of the media associated with former student-athletes. As a result, Ohio State agreed to no longer recruit Parsons. Parsons formally committed to Penn State University on December 20, 2017, and graduated Harrisburg High School seven months early to enroll early there. ==College career== After committing to Penn State, Parsons was informed by head coach James Franklin that he would start his Penn State career at middle linebacker rather than defensive end, which he played in high school. Franklin also announced that Parsons would be in contention for the starting job even though he was a true freshman. In his freshman year, Parsons only started one game for the Nittany Lions, but managed to lead the team in tackles with 82. He became the first Nittany Lion to ever lead the team in tackles as a freshman. Prior to the start of the season, Parsons was named to the Butkus Award preseason watch list. In his sophomore year, Parsons recorded 109 tackles, 5 sacks, 3 deflected passes and 3 forced fumbles. Parsons went on to be named the Butkus‚ÄìFitzgerald Linebacker of the Year and a consensus All-American. Parsons had a dominating performance in the 2019 Cotton Bowl Classic and was named the Defensive MVP of the game. Parsons recorded 14 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Penn State bio Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:American football linebackers Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Sportspeople from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania ","title":"Micah Parsons"},{"id":"56098094","text":"Daniel Baur (born 6 May 1999) is a Scottish footballer, who plays for Lowland League team Spartans.

Early in his life, Ewing travelled to many locations, opening wainwright shops in Walpole, New Hampshire, Westminster, Vermont, and Littleton, New Hampshire. By the age of 30, he and his family had relocated to New York City where he became an associate of the Fairbanks Scale Company, serving as both a maker of scales and subsequently as a sales representative. ==Founding of the Hadley Falls Company== As a salesman for Fairbanks, Ewing travelled across the United States, Europe, and even Russia to expand the company's market. During his travels he had a chance to see the new dam and canals constructed at Lowell, and by 1846 had noticed that a 60-foot drop in the Connecticut River, at what would be Hadley Falls, would serve as an ideal location for a similar project.https://archive.org/stream/storyofholyoke00harp#page/32/mode/2up Having served many mills across the country as customers, Ewing was familiar not only with their operations but with their financiers as well. Although the company left the project soon after land was amassed, the Fairbanks Scale Company was largely responsible for the initial charter and water rights of the Hadley Falls Company. Ewing, having personally known Erastus Fairbanks, was able to convince him and a number of backers from Boston, Hartford, and New York to charter the company tasked with building a new planned industrial city. In March 1847 Ewing was appointed land agent and transferred 37 acres to the company, with very little resistance from the farmers whose land he had purchased. By the time Holyoke was chartered as a municipality this number had reached 1,300 acres. The one farmer who pushed back against the effort was one Sam Ely, who \\"declar[ed] that he would not sell to the 'cotton lords' of the Hadley [Falls] Company 'if they covered the entire field with gold dollars.' Finding no support from his contemporaries, Ely delayed sale of his land, but ultimately sold as well. Labor disagreements and resignation While Ewing, Fairbanks, and their associates were responsible for the conception of the Hadley Falls Company, their direct involvement in Holyoke's founding was cut short when Ewing severed ties as a company agent. Even during his time with the enterprise, Ewing had misgivings with his partners, the Boston Associates, including a decision to pay the dam's laborers 75 cents a day rather than the 85 cents they were initially promised; for the time he remained with the project Ewing paid the difference out of his own personal funds. A devout Christian, he fervently believed Sundays were a day of rest. When dam laborers were forced to work on Sundays, a strike broke out which was met with response from the state militia; it was not until a Catholic priest was brought from Springfield that the standoff was resolved. Finding fault with the actions of the company, Ewing and Fairbanks resigned from the enterprise thereafter. Their decision to leave the business proved sound when a series of poor design and construction decisions by the associates led to the very first dam washing down the Connecticut River within hours of its gates closing. ==Political career== Throughout his life Ewing had a varied political career of many positions both in Holyoke, and as a figure in Massachusetts politics. In his early political career he remained active in the Whig Party, serving as a delegate in at least one of the party's conventions in Boston. Having founded a Temperance Society in the city's earliest days, following the Whig Party's dissolution, Ewing became identified with the Prohibition Party. In Holyoke, Ewing remained an ardent advocate of not only the city's development but also for reform of its labor, seeking to \\"bridge the growing gulf between the established and working classes\\", through such proposals as shorter hours for workers. One of the reforms he proposed was a law that would use state funds to compensate families whose children were attending school for the wages they would have made from working during that time; the motion lacked any political support. However, as superintendent of Holyoke's public schools from 1867 to 1868, he was able to successfully start an evening school program which proved a marked success; in 1868 there were 20 pupils in this program, by 1879 the number had grown to 300. Among his many various positions in Holyoke civic life, Ewing served as an assessor in 1851, and a justice of the peace in 1855. In 1852 he served as a state representative to the Massachusetts General Court, the only official state office he held. Prior to its incorporation as a city, Ewing served as one of its selectmen from 1869 to 1870. When the Holyoke National Bank was founded in 1872, Ewing would serve as a member of its first board of directors. Believing in prohibition for much of his life, Ewing was initially selected to run on the gubernatorial ticket of the Prohibition Party in 1878, but objected \\"the party ought to head the ticket with a bigger man than [himself], unless they prefer some one who isn't very well known\\". Ultimately the party selected Alonzo Ames Miner, Tufts University's second president to head the ticket instead. Ewing would run unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the gubernatorial race of 1878, receiving only 2,117 votes or 0.83% of the final count. ==Later life and death== George Ewing was a Congregationalist, serving as a lay preacher even into his later years for the Second Congregational Church of Holyoke, which he had joined in 1864. In his final years he wrote a history of the city to be published by its YMCA, which he proclaimed to the secretary of that chapter as well as his son, George Ewing Jr., would be his \\"last work\\". George Ewing died between the hours of six and seven on the evening of July 16, 1888; he was 78 years old. ==Ewingville== A section of a map of Ireland Parish, Holyoke, showing Ewingville as well as those properties owned by George C. Ewing, abbreviated \\"G.C.E.\\" The George C. Ewing House; built before 1870, this Italianate structure was moved to its present site in 1925 during the construction of Our Lady of the Holy Cross Catholic Church. In addition to purchasing land for the company, Ewing purchased a section of land for himself in an area between the Highlands and downtown Holyoke. With a patchwork of parcels owned by others, Ewing's large tract of land extended from west of Linden Street to Northampton Street; as far south as the present location of Forestdale Cemetery, and as far north as Beacon Avenue. Among his developments to that area, Ewing built four Italianate tenements along Dwight Street, connecting it from the Hadley Falls Company's grid to Northampton Street, a major thoroughfare. Ewing constructed his own home there as well; the George C. Ewing House is a large brick Italianate structure with triangular windows and a brick cornice, built sometime before 1870. Following Ewing's death the building was sold to the Highland Parish in 1895 and used as a rectory until the house was moved to its present location in 1925 with the construction of the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church. ==See also== * Boston Associates * William Whiting II, another key figure in the founding of Holyoke, Massachusetts ==NotesReferences== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Wainwrights Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:American city founders Category:1810 births Category:1888 deaths Category:19th-century Congregationalists Category:Politicians from Holyoke, Massachusetts Category:History of Holyoke, Massachusetts Category:American school superintendents Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Massachusetts Whigs Category:Massachusetts Prohibitionists ","title":"George C.

Choe became the head of the Korea Film Studio in 1956 at age 22. By the time Kim Jong-il took over the country's film industry in 1968, Choe was the most experienced filmmaker of North Korea. Kim and Choe became close associates ‚Äì Kim producing and Choe directing ‚Äì a number of important North Korean films. Sea of Blood (1968) and The Flower Girl (1972) were \\"Immortal Classics\\" that, in addition to being popular successes, profoundly shaped the industry. By the end of the 1960s, Choe supervised film making in all of North Korea as the Propaganda and Agitation Department film section head. In 1972, his responsibilities covered other forms of North Korean propaganda as well after he was made the vice director of the Department. In 1978, Kim had South Korea's famous director-actress couple Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee abducted to North Korea. Choe was tasked with aiding them to make films for North Korea. After Shin and Choi escaped in 1986 on a business trip in Vienna under Choe's watch, he was demoted. Kim Jong-il's trust in Choe would survive despite numerous incidents leading to the latter's dismissal from his posts. All in all, Choe has been sacked five times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department: first in 1969, then in 1977 as part of purges, in 1986 after the Vienna affair, in 1993, and finally 2010. He served as the country's Minister of Culture between 2003 and 2006. He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009, but was replaced the following year. He remains a delegate to the Supreme People's Assembly. Choe remained part of Kim's inner circle until the latter's death in 2011. Choe supported Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong-un's, ascension to the leadership of the country at a time when he was still an uncertain heir. ==Early and personal life== Choe Ik- gyu was born on 26 February 1934 to a poor family in Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province, Korea. Choe graduated with a baccalaureate from the department of Russian literature of Kim Hyong-jik Teachers' College in 1954, and briefly became a lecturer of Russian at Kim Il-sung University's Pyongyang Labor Academy that same year. Choe also studied in the Soviet Union and graduated from the Red Flag Mangyongdae Revolutionary School in Pyongyang, at some point. Choe is married and has a son and three daughters. His eldest daughter Choe Il-sim is an aspiring scenario writer, having written scripts for the five-part movie series The Country I Saw (1988‚Äì). ==Career== Choe began working at the Korea Film Studio, first as a deputy film director in 1955 and then as an independent director. He became the head of the studio in 1956 at the age of just 22. As a filmmaker, he was largely self-taught but aspiring. In addition to his formal education in arts, he now had much experience with the Stalinist model of making films in particular. Choe's breakthrough was the 1963 film A Garden Zinnia. In 1968, Kim Jong-il, the country's future leader, took control of the country's film industry. Kim lacked experience in the field and so he teamed up with Choe, who was much experienced by this time and was \\"[a]rguably the single North Korean most knowledgeable about film, other than Kim\\". Choe became Kim's closest partner in his activities related to film; his \\"film tutor\\". Their collaborations became immensely popular, Choe directing and Kim producing films that would become known as \\"Immortal Classics\\" and People's Prize winners. The first film Choe and Kim made together was Sea of Blood (1968), followed by Five Guerilla Brothers the same year. By the end of the decade, Choe had been appointed as a supervisor of the film industry section of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. Mass games in Pyongyang, a recurring propaganda spectacle developed by Choe In 1972, Choe and Kim released The Flower Girl, The film augmented Choe's position as Kim's close confidant, making him responsible for propaganda spectacles beyond film. Choe was promoted as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department and elected a member of parliament in the fifth Supreme People's Assembly. Choe was now in charge of events like Day of the Sun celebrations and Liberation Day marches. He developed mass games that would evolve into the Arirang Festival, the organizing of which he is still overseeing. Choe would also give artistic guidance to Korean revolutionary operas and plays. For instance, he had directed an operatic adaption of Sea of Blood in 1971. Choe and Kim's relationship became a close and long one. Choe would be personally involved in the making of many more films and supervising the production of others, such as multi-part The Star of Korea (1980‚Äì1987). Abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee Choe Ik-gyu played a role in the abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee, a famous South Korean director-actress couple. In a secret tape recorded by Shin and Choi, Kim Jong-il is heard confiding to the couple that he decided to kidnap them on the advice of Choe who considered Shin the best director of South Korea. After years of separation, when Shin and Choi were re-united by their captor, Kim Jong-il, on 6 March 1983, Choe was present. He would work with Shin from that point on to direct movies for Kim Jong-il. He would pass on messages between Kim, Shin and Choi; the latter two rarely met Kim in person. First, Choe accompanied Shin and Choi on a trip from Pyongyang to Moscow, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The purpose of the trip was to scout for locations for the first film Shin had agreed to make for Kim Jong-il: An Emissary of No Return. Choe was discontent with the project. He had been an acclaimed film director in his own right, but now he had to mind his South Korean counterpart. Both Shin and Choi disliked Choe. Choe resorted to criticizing Shin's directing in front of the crew. Shin gained back control of the project by threatening to report to Kim Jong-il about Choe's behavior. The film was finished and would be played at the London Film Festival and Shin was to attend. Shin contemplated escaping there, but Choe and an entourage of bodyguards had traveled to London in advance. After Shin and Choi had managed to escape in Vienna, Choe was demoted from his position in the Propaganda and Agitation Department. He was sent into the countryside, his exact whereabouts unknown for years. Return to politics Korean revolutionary opera, an art Choe has been involved in as a director and cultural administrator Choe Ik-gyu was allowed to return as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 1988. He assumed full control of the theater and operatic fields. That year, he was involved in making The Life of Chunhyang, an acclaimed folk opera. Choe guided performers \\"as if he were a stage director\\". Beginning with the early 1990s, Choe ‚Äì credited under his pseudonym Choe Sang-geun ‚Äì produced The Nation and Destiny. Choe produced, directed and wrote scenarios throughout the production of the 50-part film series, which Kim Jong-il considered the last work made under his personal guidance. Choe briefly fell out of public life in 1993 when he was dismissed from his Propaganda and Agitation Department post again. Even during this period, Kim Jong-il allowed him to travel to Germany to treat his health problems, which reflects the amount of trust Kim had in Choe. All in all, Choe has been dismissed four times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department. Choe became the Minister of Culture in September 2003 but retired temporarily some two years later because of diabetes and other chronic health issues. He relinquished the position in 2006. Choe was elected to the 12th Supreme People's Assembly on 8 March 2009, representing Electoral District #73. He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009. As the director of the Department, Choe was one of North Korea's propaganda chiefs. He was replaced by Kang Nung-su in early February 2010 for unknown reasons. Choe was often seen accompanying Kim Jong-il on formal occasions until the latter's death in 2011. When traveling outside North Korea, Choe uses the name Choe Sang-geun. Such was the case for instance when he visited Seoul in South Korea in 2000 in the capacity of the counsel to the National Orchestra of North Korea. Succession of Kim Jong-un Choe was among those who vouched for the succession of Kim Jong-un at a time when his ascension to power remained uncertain. In addition to Kim Jong-il, Choe would aide Kim's third wife Ko Yong-hui, and Jang Song-thaek. Paul Fischer, the author of A Kim Jong-Il Production, assesses that \\"[t]he modern North Korean state, which is a production, a display performance of its own, owes as much to Choe Ik-Gyu's taste and talents as it does to Kim Jong-Il.\\" ==Filmography== *A Garden Zinnia (1963) *Sea of Blood (1968) *Five Guerilla Brothers (1968) *The Flower Girl (1972) ==Opera== *Sea of Blood (1971) *The Life of Chunhyang (1988) ==See also== *Cabinet of North Korea *Culture of North Korea *Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea *Politics of North Korea *Cinema of North Korea *Propaganda in North Korea *List of North Korean films ==References== Works cited * * * ==External links== *Profile at the Ministry of Unification * Category:Living people Category:1934 births Category:North Korean film directors Category:Workers' Party of Korea politicians Category:Propagandists Category:Government ministers of North Korea Category:20th-century North Korean artists ","title":"Choe Ik-gyu"},{"id":"56098201","text":"Sean Lewis is an American football coach.

He was the only member of the gens Mussidia to reach the consulate; this office he held as the colleague of Titus Axius in an as yet undetermined year during the earlier part of the reign of emperor Claudius.Giuseppe Camodeca, \\"Novit√† sui fasti consolari delle tavolette cerate della Campania\\", Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 143 (1991), p. 69; Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\\", Classical Quarterly, 28 (1978), pp. 416, 426 Pollianus is known from several inscriptions found in Rome. The portion of the cursus honorum up to his consulate can be reconstructed from a statue base found in Rome, although the offices are listed out of logical order. The earliest office Pollianus would have held was in the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next was as quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Pollianus would be enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune and praetor. The three offices Pollianus held after his praetorship are scattered through the inscription on the statue base. Another inscription, now lost, reportedly puts them in the following order: curator viarum (curator of a number of unspecified roads); praefectus frumenti dandi (the prefect responsible for the distribution of Rome‚Äôs free grain dole); and governor of the public province of Gallia Narbonensis. A.L.F. Rivet dates his governorship of Narbonensis to the years AD 34 to 37.Rivet, Gallia Narbonensis (London: Batsford, 1988), p. 87 Pollianus' consulate followed.

As in previous sessions, an important part of the work of the Committee will focus on the examination of human rights questions, including reports of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council which was established in 2006. == Mandate == The work of the Committee focuses on human rights, humanitarian affairs and social issues. In addition, it also considers issues relating to: * The advancement of women * The protection of children * the protection of indigenous populations, and related issues * The treatment of refugees, and related issues such as racism and discrimination * The promotion of fundamental freedoms * The right to self-determination * Youth, family and ageing * The rights of persons with disabilities * Crime prevention and criminal justice * The international drug trade, and related issues == Working methods== The work of the Third Committee begins in early October and usually ends by Thanksgiving. Unlike most other bodies of the General Assembly, the work of the Third Committee does not begin with a general debate between its members. Instead, its agenda items are debated individually from the beginning of the session. The Third Committee hosts interactive dialogues with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the High Commissioner for Refugees each year. == Current state == In its 75th Session, the Committee will focus on: * Promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ** Social development ** Advancement of women * Maintenance of international peace and security ** Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions * Promotion of human rights ** Report of the Human Rights Council ** Promotion and protection of the rights of children ** Rights of indigenous peoples ** Elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance ** Right of peoples to self-determination ** Promotion and protection of human rights * Drug control, crime prevention and combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ** Crime prevention and criminal justice ** Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes ** International drug control ==Bureau== The following make up the bureau of the Third Committee for the 75th Session of the General Assembly: {  !

First described independently by Gilles Klopman and Lionel Salem in 1968, this relationship provides a mathematical basis for the key assumptions of frontier molecular orbital theory (i.e., theory of HOMO-LUMO interactions) and hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory. Conceptually, it highlights the importance of considering both electrostatic interactions and orbital interactions (and weighing the relative significance of each) when rationalizing the selectivity or reactivity of a chemical process. == Formulation and interpretation == In modern form, the Klopman-Salem equation is commonly given as > \\\\Delta E = > \\\\Big(-\\\\sum_{a,b}(q_a+q_b)\\\\beta_{ab}S_{ab}\\\\Big)+\\\\Big(\\\\sum_{k<\\\\ell}\\\\frac{Q_kQ_{\\\\ell}}{\\\\varepsilon > R_{k\\\\ell}}\\\\Big)+\\\\Big(\\\\sum_{r}^{\\\\mathrm{occ.}}\\\\sum_{s}^{\\\\mathrm{unocc.}}-\\\\sum_{s}^{\\\\mathrm{occ.}}\\\\sum_{r}^{\\\\mathrm{unocc.}}\\\\frac{2(\\\\sum_{a,b}c_{ra}c_{sb}\\\\beta_{ab})^2}{E_r- > E_s}\\\\Big), where > q_a is the electron population in atomic orbital a, > \\\\beta_{ab}, S_{ab} are the resonance and overlap integrals for the > interaction of atomic orbitals a and b, > Q_k is the total charge on atom k, > \\\\varepsilon is the local dielectric constant, > R_{k\\\\ell} is the distance between the nuclei of atoms k and l, > c_{ra} is the coefficient of atomic orbital a in molecular orbital r, > and E_r is the energy of molecular orbital r. Broadly speaking, the first term describes the closed-shell repulsion of the occupied molecular orbitals of the reactants (four-electron filled-filled interactions, steric effectsThe term steric effects is broad and often includes the result of Coulombic repulsion as well, since, in practice, any method of dividing energetic contributions between repulsive electrostatic interactions and filled-orbital repulsion is artificial and arbitrary to varying degrees.). The second term describes the Coulombic attraction or repulsion between the atoms of the reactants (ionic contribution, electrostatic effects). Finally, the third term accounts for all possible interactions between the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals of the reactants (two-electron filled-unfilled interactions, stereoelectronic effectsThe term stereoelectronic effects usually refers to the consequence of energetically favorable, two-orbital, two-electron interactions; however, it can be used more broadly to refer to any effect originating from orbital interaction, including unfavorable two-orbital, four-electron interactions.). Although conceptually useful, the Klopman-Salem equation seldom serves as the basis for energetic analysis in modern quantum chemical calculations. Because of the difference in MO energies appearing in the denominator of the third term, energetically close orbitals make the biggest contribution. Hence, approximately speaking, analysis can often be simplified by considering only the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the reactants (the HOMO-LUMO interaction in frontier molecular orbital theory). The relative contributions of the second (ionic) and third (covalent) terms play an important role in justifying hard soft acid base theory (HSAB), with hard-hard interactions governed by the ionic term and soft-soft interactions governed by the covalent term. == References == Category:Quantum chemistry Category:Organic chemistry ","title":"Klopman-Salem equation"},{"id":"56098548","text":"thumb300x300px Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial The Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial (Niten Ichi Ry≈´ (‰∫åÂ§© ‰∏ÄÊµÅ)), in the commune of Gleiz√©, France, is a memorial to Japan. It is a set of stelae and flags erected in 2014 nearby the official school of Miyamoto Musashi, school passed on March 4, 1999 by tenth descendant of Musashi Sensei Tadashi Chihara, and of which Sensei Yannik Barrot is guarantor. It is recognized and sponsored by many nations throughout the world, and thirteen countries are represented in the eighteen flags that have flown continuously and officially since 8 December 2014, over this unique building. The memorial's sixteen flag-poles fly the flags of Mimasaka, of Ohara of the Mori Clan, of the Doat, of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes Region, of the Central Region, of the Burgundy Region, of Japan, of France, of the 150th Anniversary of Franco-Japanese Relations, of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur, of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Tricolore, of Saint Esprit, of Cambodia, of ASEAN, of Russia and of the Lyon-Japan club. == History ‚Äì the Foundation of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial == The Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial recalls a series of specific and decisive historical events that result from the little known factual milestones, below. Auguste Guinon and Lucien Picard  In 1817, Auguste Guinon was born in Liergues. In 1869, he transformed Jarnioux, a rural commune, by endowing the village with community buildings: a wash house, the town hall / school followed by the Church. He had made his fortune by developing a chemical plant at Saint-Fons near Lyon. Here he produced picric acid, which was very useful in the Silk industry, but was also a powerful explosive known as melinite. His products were sold in considerable quantities in Japan which used it particularly in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), while at the same time promoting the industry of the \\"City of Silk\\" which had been created through the constant efforts of the Canuts from the Croix-Rousse hill. This trade contributed to the expansion of Lyon region and formed the basis of the viticultural history of Beaujolais. This 150 years history of interchange between Lyon and Japan is presented in the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, Lyon-Japan-Japan-France, which opened in Gleiz√© the 8 December, 2014. Auguste-V√©ran Guinon would become closely linked to Lucien Picard, also an industrial chemist, and mayor of Cogny, as a commemorative plaque reminds us at the foot of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial's flag- poles. √âmile Guimet  A handful of French and Japanese people reached across the land and the sea in brotherhood and friendship, beginning in 1859. √âmile Guimet on an official mission to Japan in 1876, met Masanao Makimoura governor of Kyoto and L√©on Dury the former consul of France at Nagasaki and director of the French school in Kyoto, where seven Japanese students studied, having been chosen to go abroad on a mission during the Meiji era. √âmile Guimet invited them to continue their studies in Lyon. Two of these, including the future Yamada Consul, were selected for scientific and technological studies in the Martini√®re, the School of Sciences and Industrial Arts of Lyon. This important transfer of knowledge would enable Japan to make crucial technological advances, particularly in the Silk industry. In 1919, these former students who had been educated in Lyon met and welcomed their friends from the University of Lyon who had come on a mission to Japan. Finally, in 1924, their efforts were crowned with the founding of the Franco-Japanese House of Kyoto, set up thanks to the joint and active participation of Paul Claudel, Ambassador of France to Tokyo, and Edouard Herriot, then Minister of Public Education and Senator-Mayor of Lyon. These young men strongly contributed to Japan's present and future influence around the world, and greatly enhanced the industrial development of their country. √âmile Guimet and these young contributors, are notably remembered by a memorial plaque, which is one of the most profound touchstones in the grounds of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial.  Louis Michallet  In May 1998, the Lyon-Japan Club and the Organizing Committee for the Year of Japan in France 97‚Äì98 re-published Kikou Yamata's, autobiographical novel Le mois sans dieux. In June 1996, in Lyon, as part of the G7 summit which took place thanks to the crucial role played by the Consul General of Japan, Louis Michallet, Ryutaro Hashimoto and Jacques Chirac decided to organize \\"The Year of Japan in France\\", from April 1997 to March 1998 to correct the superficial and sometimes inaccurate understanding of Japanese culture. The start of that year coincided with the inauguration of the House of Culture of Japan in Paris. \\"The Year of France in Japan\\" followed \\"the Year of Japan\\", the combination of these two events inaugurating Franco- Japanese relations for the 21st century. In 1897 Kikou Yamata was born in Lyon and through her family ties, was deeply imbued with the two cultures, western and eastern. Her father, Tadazumi Yamada, Chancellor of the Consulate of Japan in 1885, would become Consul of Japan in Lyon where he would meet his future wife Marguerite Varot. Kikou Yamata received her letters of French literature at the Lyc√©e la√Øc Edgar-Quinet and completed her studies at the Coll√®ge du Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Tokyo. Returning to France, she pursued studies in art history at the Sorbonne and enjoyed a leading literary career. For example, her very first novel Masako was reprinted seventeen times. Le mois sans dieux has been reprinted and prefaced by the President and Founder of the Lyon-Japan Club, testifying to the permanent and delicate balance between western freedom and Japan's cultural wealth. Its history is the very symbol of the connection between the \\"City of Silk\\" and the \\"Silk Country\\". The book is the hyphen in the Lyon-Japan flag. This link between Lyon and Japan was renewed maintained and safeguarded by the President-Founder of the Lyon-Japan Club, Louis Michallet. In addition to hosting the G7 of 1996, Louis Michallet promoted Japanese economic and cultural structures within the Beaujolais and the Lyon region. Le Ch√¢teau de l‚ÄôEclair, in the municipality of Liergues, was as a consequence purchased by NHK from the Maison Bocuse to create a highly visible position for Japanese cuisine in the heart of Beaujolais, the Tsuji School. In addition, Honorary Consul General to Japan, Louis Michallet, prior his death, donated the entire file of the Lyon-Japan Club to be conserved at the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, in so doing providing the foundation stones essential to the development of the building.  Dojo Miyamoto Musashi  The stele of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial The Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, a French- Japanese link was created in the memory of Miyamoto Musashi the unconquered samurai of the 16th century who spent a lifetime fighting (he fought more than sixty battles, all victorious), master of arms and the spirit for many disciples. This heritage has since been passed down through the very heart of Japan, from generation to generation. The Miyamoto Musashi dojo of Gleiz√© represents the Miyamoto Musashi School in Japan, and in France and joins Japan and France in the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial. On 26 February 1999, the Miyamoto Musashi School, or Japan's School of the Two Swords (Niten Ichi Ryu) of Japan, responded to the invitation by the dojo in Gleiz√© and visited France for the first time. On 27 February, at an official reception and a presentation of Martial Arts in front of 800 people, the Miyamoto School Musashi of Japan repeated the remarks of 26 February, and recognizing the abundance and evidence of a project based on the spirit of \\"Bushido\\" or spirit of the warrior's way (The Five Wheel Treaty written by Miyamoto Musashi is both a synthesis and a milestone in the tradition of the Samurai, which is at once a quintessential part of the foundation of Japanese culture, and a part of the national treasure). It was therefore proposed to make the Gleiz√© dojo, the main school of \\"Miyamoto Musashi\\" in the West, recognizing it as koryu, a traditional school. On Thursday, 4 March 1999, the Japan School \\"Miyamoto Musashi\\", representing the most noble spirit of chivalry and which contributes largely to the philosophy of Martial Arts (budo, bushido, fencing, kendo, Aikido) is the patron of the Gleiz√© dojo, and the Budo school of Aikido (Poems of the Way by Morihei Ueshiba are the purest expression of this). In addition, it was given a new name, the \\"Dojo Miyamoto Musashi\\" and representing the Miyamoto Musashi School of Japan in France, becoming a main link to this school in the West. Consequently, it acquired the legitimacy of being one of the foundations of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Japan-France Memorial.  Budokan Miyamoto Musashi  thumb200x200px Budokan Miyamoto Musashi in May 2015 On 20 May 2000, the Dojo Miyamato Musashi in Gleiz√©, at the request and invitation of the Miyamoto Musashi School ‚Äì Niten Ichi Ryu of Japan went to the country of the rising sun for the inauguration of the new Budokan Miyamoto Musashi dojo located in Ohara-Cho in the Mimasaka Province. This budokan in its outer form represents a samurai helmet, specifically the symbol of the prefecture of Okayama and recalls the symbolic central figure of Japanese culture and native of the country, Musashi. It brings together the various schools in the handling of the way of the sword, and daily reminds us of his heritage, the cradle of the bushido spirit and the Japanese collective memory. Later, several official exchanges of flags were made between the Rhone region represented by the Miyamoto Musashi School in France and the Mimasaka Province represented by Japan's Miyamoto Musashi School. The raising of flags took place in front of the Budokan and has been repeated regularly from 18 May 2008 to this day. The flagpoles of the Japanese budokan successively flew the flags of Mimasaka, of the Mori Clan, of the Doat, of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes Region, of the Central Region, of the Burgundy Region, of Japan, of France, of the 150th Anniversary of Franco-Japanese Relations, of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur, of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Tricolore, of the Saint Esprit, of Cambodia, of ASEAN, of Russia and of Lyon-Japan. The traditional Budokan Miyamoto Musashi was revealed as mirror of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial in the West reflecting its proper origin as the light that comes from the Orient. This is a diplomatic, geopolitical, cultural, historical and spiritual achievement, as Japan, particularly deepest Japan is not traditionally inclined to tolerate outside contributions of this nature on its soil. This recurrent and highly symbolic gesture has made it possible to reinforce the deep and lasting ties that unite the Budokan Miyamoto Musashi and the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, so strengthening the links between the commune of Gleiz√© and Ohara-cho, since 1998. == The Institution ‚Äì The influence of the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial == Cambodia and ASEAN joined the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial at the ceremony on 15 July 2016 On 8 December, 2014, the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial, originally in the Ch√¢teau de Boisfranc estate, was granted legal, public and national recognition in the commune of Gleiz√©, notably during public ceremonies under the aegis and presence of the authorities of the Republic, both municipal, consular and senatorial. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, on 8 December, the Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial echoes the humble demands of her Immaculate Heart, expressed primarily through her servant Saint Marguerite‚ÄìMarie Alacoque in Paray-le-Monial, and of Claire Ferchaud in 1917. The latter, as a result of that which they had humbly received, summoned the recognition of the French State for the Sacr√©-C≈ìur. Holy Spirit In addition the Administration of Elysee formalized the memorial on French soil. A distinction that throws a spotlight on to the heart of Kingdom of Cambodia, which is a link is to the very centre of ASEAN which brings together eleven countries of South East Asia. The memorial is therefore a bridge between these nations and promotes trade, cultural and spiritual interchange. A collection of paintings by the Lyonnais artist Antoine Barbier was bequeathed to the Kingdom of Cambodia to build a museum in his name. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia jointly with the Russian Embassy in Paris has recognized this historic landmark, since June 2017, as a reminder of traditional culture and civilization, as well as of the powerful and profound link between France and Russia. By the same token, Russia authenticated the whole site and recognized it as a legitimate and indisputable cultural cornerstone. ==See also== * France-Japan relations == References Further reading== * == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20100523060528/http://www.city.mimasaka.lg.jp/www/index.jsp * https://www.memorial-heiho-niten-ichi-ryu.org/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20161226225252/http://www.geocities.jp/themusasi1/ * http://www.sitedemarie.com/SACRECOEUR.HTM *http://www.dojo-miyamoto- musashi.com/histoire_uk.html Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2014 Category:Buildings and structures in Rh√¥ne (department) Category:France‚ÄìJapan relations Category:Monuments and memorials in France ","title":"Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial"},{"id":"56098552","text":"Aleksey Petrukhanov (born 15 May 1972) is a Russian athlete.

It also is responsible for administrative matters, such as: management reform, governance, oversight and accountability issues. Finally, it is responsible for examining all draft resolutions with budget implications before they can head to the Plenary. == Working Methods == The work of the Fifth Committee is split into three sessions: * A main session lasting from September to December. * A resumed session in March in which any items not concluded in the main part of the session are considered. * A second resumed session in May in which the administrative and budgetary aspects of United Nations Peacekeeping are considered. The work of the Committee begins when reports are introduced in formal meetings, which are followed by discussion in informal meetings. Following these meetings, draft resolutions are created and discussed in informal consultations. There are two readings per draft resolution. If consensus cannot be reached, the resolution is not passed by the Committee. However, if there is consensus, the draft resolution is first adopted informally, then tabled by the Chair and, finally, formally adopted by the Committee.

He is currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. ==Early life and education== Radcliffe Bailey was born in Bridgeton, New Jersey in 1968. At age 4, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, which is where he currently resides. His interest in art was galvanised by childhood visits to the High Museum of Art and drawing classes he later took at the Atlanta College of Art. He cites Atlanta's history with civil rights and the Civil War as an artistic inspiration. Bailey received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1991 from the Atlanta College of Art. From 2001 to 2006, he taught in the Lamar Dodd School of Art at the University of Georgia. == Work == Bailey was trained as a sculptor but experiments with paint and mixed media. He works within the convergence of painting and sculpture, utilising items such as vintage photographs of his family, vinyl records, piano keys and bottle-caps. Thematically, his art explores the intersection of ancestry, race and cultural memory. In 2003, he adopted a style of art conceptually inspired by Kongo minkisi, which he described as being \\"medicine cabinet sculptures.\\" As a result, his work has been described as being three-dimensional and layered, incorporating elements of smell and sound. In a 2013 interview, Bailey described his creative process and fascination with the connection between past and present, stating: ‚ÄúThe day by day experience of art, even though my work may seem to have this layer of history, it is also a cover for what I‚Äôm dealing with on a day to day. It‚Äôs very much about today. We were talking about where I go next: I‚Äôm still thinking about today and yesterday and what‚Äôs coming in front of me tomorrow.\\" He is largely inspired by historic figures, citing individuals such as George Washington Carver and Charleston-based blacksmith Philip Simmons as sources of inspiration. His large-scale installation Windward Coast (2009-2011), was presented as part of the First International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. He has been awarded for his artistic contributions, receiving the Joan Foundation Grant in 2008 and Elizabeth and Mallory Factory Prize for Southern Art in 2010. ==Solo exhibitions== Bailey has had solo exhibitions at many galleries and institutions including: * The Mint Museum of Art, Charlotte, North Carolina, ARTCurrents II: Radcliffe Bailey (1992) *TULA Foundation Gallery, Atlanta, Georgia, Radcliffe Bailey: Places of Rebirth (1992) *Atlanta College of Art, Atlanta, Georgia, Spiritual Migration (2001) *Harvey B.

Comer's Avondale Mills, turned Alex City into one of the textile centers of the South. In 1913, the family built several houses on a hillside overlooking the mills. Benjamin's youngest son, Ben, built a Classical Revival house with a hip roof and fa√ßade dominated by four columns with Corinthian capitals. Benjamin's sister, Sally, built a brick, Classical Revival residence with doubled Ionic columns. Thomas Commander Russell, Benjamin's brother who served as Alex City's mayor from 1907 until 1947, built a tan brick Craftsman-style house. In 1937, the second generation of the family began to build on the family land. Elisabeth, Benjamin's daughter, built a Classical Revival house inspired by the \\"Tara House\\" from the film Gone with the Wind. The next year, Thomas Russell built a Colonial Revival near-replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon.

The inscription is notable for including symbol for Om in Gupta era. It marks the dedication of the cave to a statue of Bhutapati (Shiva) and Devi (Parvati). The statue was likely of Ardhanarishvara that was missing when the caves came to the attention of archaeologists in the 18th- century. ==History== The Vadathika Cave, also called Vadathi ka Kubha is one of three caves found in the Nagarjuni Hill cluster near the Barabar Caves in Bihar. The other two are Vapiyaka Cave and Gopika Cave, also called Vapiya ka Kubha and Gopi ka Kubha respectively. These are near the Lomas Rishi Cave, the earliest known cave excavated in 3rd century BCE and gifted by Ashoka to the Ajivikas monks. The Nagarjuni Caves were excavated in 214 BCE from a granite hill by the grandson of Ashoka. They are about north of Gaya. The Vadathika cave is the one on the left, with the entrance in the recess. Barabar Caves. According to Arthur Basham, the motifs carved in these groups of caves as well as inscriptions help establish that the Nagarjuni and Barabar Hill caves are from the 3rd century BCE. The original inhabitants of these were the Ajivikas, a non-Buddhist Indian religion that later became extinct. They abandoned the caves at some point. Then the Buddhists used these caves because there are the Bodhimula and Klesa-kantara inscriptions found here. Centuries later, a Hindu king named Anantavarman, of Maukhari dynasty, dedicated Hindu murti (images) of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism in three of these caves in the 5th or 6th century. To mark the consecration, he left inscriptions in Sanskrit. These inscriptions are in then prevalent Gupta script and these have survived.;For more on Maukhari dating, see: Maukhari dynasty, Encyclopaedia Britannica After the 14th-century, the area was occupied by Muslims, as a number of tombs are nearby. The Vadathika Cave inscription was first noticed in 1785 by J. H. Harrington, then reported to scholars in the 1790 issue of Asiatic Researches, Volume 2. It is found on the northern side of the hill, immediately next to the Vapiyaka Cave and its Vapi (water tank). The cave has several inscriptions, including one from the 3rd-century BCE. It starts by stating the name of the cave to be Vadathi, the source of this cave's historic name and the inscription. The inscription as copied by Harrington was first translated by Charles Wilkins. In 1847, Markham Kittoe made a new eye-copy and published it with Rajendralal Mitra's new translation.Markham Kittoe (1847), Notes on the Caves of Burabur, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 16, pages 401-406 John Fleet published another revised translation in 1888. ==Description== The inscription is carved in granite over about by surface. It has eight lines in Gupta script, with letters approximately tall. It is one of the earliest Indian inscriptions that uses full matras (horizontal bar above each letter).

It was first described by Henry Walter Bates in 1864. It is found in Mexico, Central America and parts of northern South America. ==Description== The wingspan of the ringless blue cracker is approximately . The upper surface of the wings is mottled grey, brown and white. There is no red bar on the forewing and the hindwing has submarginal black spots, surrounded by blue, brown and blue rings, and with a central white crescent or oval. The under surface of the wings is whitish, with black rings near the hind margin that resemble those of Hamadryas feronia. The larvae are black with fine longitudinal yellow lines, which may be indistinct, pale spines and two horns on the head. The pupae are bright green with some bands of white and a silvery rim to the yellowish-green wings. The heads of the pupae have a pair of elongated \\"rabbit ears\\", green with a white seam, forming a V-shape. ==Distribution and habitat== The range of the ringless blue cracker extends from Mexico, through Costa Rica and Panama, to Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and southern Brazil, with a single individual being reported as a vagrant in Texas. This butterfly occurs in glades and on the edges of tropical forests. The larvae feed on vines in the family Euphorbiaceae, Dalechampia triphylla, Dalechampia ficifolia and Dalechampia stipulacea being host plants in Brazil, and Dalechampia cissifolia in Panama. ==Ecology== The eggs are laid on the underside of leaves of the host plant and the larvae feed on the leaves and are not gregarious. They rest in an unusual position with only the prolegs touching the leaf blade, and the head with their horns projecting forward. The adults feed on rotting fruit and do not visit flowers. They have a habit of perching on the trunks of trees in a head-down position with their wings spread out in close contact with the bark. When another butterfly approaches, a male will dart away from the trunk, making a cracking sound. This appears to be a mechanism that helps males to distinguish the sex of the new arrival; males will click in response while females remain silent. At night the butterflies roost separately among foliage. In the tropics, the adults are on the wing most of the year. In Mexico, they are most frequently seen during July and August. ==Subspecies== *H. iphthime iphthime (Costa Rica to Colombia, Brazil [Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso], Bolivia) *H. iphthime joannae Jenkins, 1983 (Mexico) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Original description as Ageronia iphthime: Category:Hamadryas (butterfly) Category:Butterflies of North America Category:Butterflies of Central America Category:Butterflies of Mexico Category:Butterflies described in 1864 Category:Nymphalidae of South America Category:Taxa named by Henry Walter Bates Category:Lepidoptera of Peru Category:Lepidoptera of Colombia Category:Lepidoptera of Bolivia Category:Lepidoptera of Guyana ","title":"Hamadryas iphthime"},{"id":"56098859","text":"Remus Cozma (born 12 November 1952) is a Romanian Olympic boxer.

The eponymous castle, which had probably been built earlier than that was is mentioned for the first time in 1192, was the family seat of the lords of Westerburg, a branch of the lords of Runkel. == Predecessors: the lords of Runkel == The lords of Westerburg go back to the House of Runkel, which had its main seat at Runkel Castle on the River Lahn. After this older branch died out, the lords of Westerburg inherited most of the estate rights of their Runkel cousins. The House of Runkel is first mentioned in a deed dated 1 April 1159. At that time a Siegfried of Runkel was a witness, when the lords of Laurenburg, later the House of Nassau, were given Nassau Castle as a fief. It is possible that, even at that time, the main territorial estate of the House of Runkel was in the region of Westerburg. This is evinced by the fact that Runkel Castle had only a very small estate in its immediate vicinity. == Foundation and early history == Through his marriage to a countess from the House of Leiningen, Siegfried III of Runkel acquired both Westerburg as well as the Vogtei over Stift St. Severus in Gem√ºnden and called himself henceforth Siegfried of Runkel and of Westerburg. Two of his sons inherited: Siegfried IV of Runkel, who resided in Westerburg, and Dietrich I of Runkel, who lived in Runkel. By around 1250 family disputes arose that, under Siegfried' grandchildren, finally led to the separation of the baronies of Runkel and Westerburg, at the latest in 1288. Dietrich's son, Siegfried V of Runkel, threatened his cousin, Henry from Runkel, and the latter, a son of Siegfried IV, called himself henceforth, Henry II of Westerburg. He underlined the enmity by building the Schadeck Castle, first recorded in 1288, on the north bank of the Lahn opposite Runkel. Through his marriage to Agnes, daughter of Gerhard of Limburg, Henry also came into the possession of the Barony of Schaumburg and one sixth of the Barony of Cleeburg. After Henry of Westerburg, seven generations of direct descendants followed him as lords of Westerburg: * Siegfried of Westerburg (died 1315) * Reinhard I of Westerburg (died 1353) * John I of Westerburg (1332‚Äì1370) * Reinhard II of Westerburg (1354‚Äì1421) * Reinhard III of Westerburg (died 1449) * Cuno I of Westerburg (1425‚Äì1459) * Reinhard IV (1453‚Äì1522), from 1475 Reinhard I of Leiningen-Westerburg Like the other small principalities between the rivers Rhine, Main and Sieg, the Barony was constantly under pressure from the Prince-Archbishopric of Trier and the expansive counts of Nassau, and the House of Westerburg thus sought to protect itself by marrying into the other noble families of the area. For example, they married into the houses of Isenburg Limburg, Solms, Merenberg, Sayn, Virneburg, Leiningen, Wied, Cronberg, Diez, Weilnau, Runkel and even Nassau-Wiesbaden. == Fusion with Leiningen == On the death of Count Hesso of Leiningen-Dagsburg on 8 March 1467, the male line of this branch of the Leiningen counts died out. His sister, Margareta, who was married to Reinhard III of Westerburg, inherited the greater part of the estate of this older main line of the House of Leiningen, and the Westerburg family were then called Leiningen-Westerburg. When Countess Margareta died in 1470, her entire Westerburg and Leiningen estate fell to her grandson Reinhard IV who, with the imperial permission, named himself Count Reinhard I of Leiningen-Westerburg from 1475 onwards and moved his seat to the County of Leiningen. His son Cuno III. (died 1547) had three sons who founded the three lines of the family. == Seat of Leiningen branches == Schloss Westerburg above the town It was not until 1557 that Westerburg was once again the seat of secondary lines of the House of Leiningen, which was repeatedly divided. Under Reinhard's grandsons, the three branches of Leiningen-Leiningen, Leiningen-Westerburg and Leiningen-Schaumburg were established. Reinhard II of Leiningen-Westerburg (1530‚Äì1584) resided in Westerburg from 1557 onwards, but the Leiningen-Westerburg line ended in 1597 with the death of his sons Albert Philip (1567‚Äì1597) and John Louis (1572‚Äì1597). It was inherited by the Leiningen-Schaumburg line, which also continued to branch from 1695 and from which two secondary lines still exist today, Leiningen-Westerburg-Altleiningen and Leiningen-Westerburg- Neuleiningen. == End == In 1806, in the wake of the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine under Napoleon, Westerburg was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg, but by 1813/1815 it had passed to the Duchy of Nassau and in 1866, with annexation of Nassau, it went to Prussia. Since 1946, the area of the former Westerburg principality has belonged to the state of Rhineland- Palatinate. == Coat of arms== Family coat of arms of the lords of Westerburg The heraldic achievement of the Westerburgs comprises a gold cross on a red field, studded with 20 (4x 5 (2:1:2)) gold crosslets. On the helmet with its red and gold mantling a red or black vol, embellished with a red disc with a gold perimeter and a gold cross, studded with 5 (2:1:2) golden crosslets (one in each corner and one in the centre); the vol may also be decorated like the escutcheon.Bernhard Peter, Historische heraldische Exlibris (1) ; Die heraldischen B√ºcherzeichen der Grafen von Leiningen-Westerburg == Members of the house == *Siegfried of Westerburg, 1275‚Äì1297 Archbishop of Cologne == Literature == * Sante, Wilhelm: Geschichte der Deutschen L√§nder - Territorien- Ploetz.

In a track career interrupted by illness and injury he won eight of his nineteen starts over five seasons. He began in Ireland as a two- year-old in 1988 when he was unbeaten in three races including the National Stakes and the Beresford Stakes. After being well beaten in two starts as a three-year-old he developed Horse colic and missed the rest of the year before being transferred to the United States. Racing mainly in California he won the American Handicap in 1990 and then returned from injury to take the San Gabriel Handicap and San Marcos Handicap as a six-year-old in 1992. ==Background== Classic Fame was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Kinderhill-Aron Associates. As a yearling in July 1987 the colt was consigned to the Keeneland Sale and was bought for $750,000 by the trainer Vincent O'Brien. He was acting on behalf of Classic Thoroughbreds, a public company founded by O'Brien, Robert Sangster and John Magnier. The colt was sent to Europe and was taken into training by O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was sired by Nijinsky, the Canadian-bred winner of the English Triple Crown in 1970 who went on to become an important stallion, siring horses such as Ferdinand, Lammtarra, Caerleon, Sky Classic and Shahrastani. Classic Fame's dam Family Fame was an unraced, Illinois-bred daughter of the Washington DC International winner Droll Role. She was a third-generation descendant of Two Bob, who won the Kentucky Oaks in 1936 and was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Tim Tam, On-And-On, Chief's Crown, Excellent Art, Deep Sky, Special Duty and Winning Colors. ==Racing career== 1988: two-year-old season Classic Fame began his racing career in the Belleville Race over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 3 September in which he started the 9/10 favourite and won by three lengths from Just A Millionaire. Seven days after his debut, the colt was stepped up to the highest level for the Group 1 National Stakes at the Curragh and was made the 9/4 favourite. The more fancied of his eleven opponents included Always Valiant (winner of the July Stakes), Corwyn Bay (Anglesey Stakes), Stone Flake (third in the Vintage Stakes) and the highly regarded maiden race winner Guaranteed Bonus. Ridden by John Reid he came home two lengths clear of Always Valliant, with Stone Flake a length away in third. In October Classic Fame was moved up to one mile for the Group 2 Beresford Stakes at the same track and was clearly expected to win again despite a four-pound weight penalty, as he started at odds of 1/2 against five opponents. He maintained his unbeaten record but was not impressive as he was \\"all out\\" to prevail by a head from the British-trained Prince Ibrahim. 1989: three-year-old season Classic Fame began his second campaign in the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 20 May. Starting at odds of 8/1 he proved to be the best of the Irish contingent but came home fifth behind the British challengers Shaadi, Great Commotion, Distant Relative and Danehill. On 7 June he was sent to England and started a 33/1 outsider in the 210th running of the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse and finished seventh of the twelve runners, more than seventeen lengths behind the winner Nashwan. Classic Fame missed the rest of his three- year-old season after suffering a bout of colic. 1990: four-year-old season For the 1990 season, Classic Fame was transferred to the United States where he entered training with Gary F. Jones. He began his North American career by winning an allowance race at Santa Anita in April and was then stepped up in class for the Grade II John Henry Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack the following month in which he finished second to Golden Pheasant. After finishing third to Mohamed Abdu in the Inglewood Handicap at Hollywood Park in June he contested the Grade II American Handicap on 4 July at the same track. In the straight, he appeared to be boxed against the rail but was extricated by his jockey Eddie Delahoussaye to win by three quarters of a length from the 1989 Turf champion Steinlen. Jones, who was wearing a \\"lucky\\" green jacket in honour of his Irish import commented \\"There was not too much of a place to go, but he got through. For a while, there, I thought we had no shot and I was getting ready to cuss. But then he came through. That's the way it's supposed to go all the time\\". On his next appearance Classic Fame finished second to Fly Till Dawn in the Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack on 8 August. Three weeks later he was sent to Chicago to contest the Arlington Million and came home fourth behind Golden Pheasant, With Approval and Steinlen. He sustained a cannon bone fracture during the race and missed the rest of the season. 1991: five-year-old season After an absence of almost a year, Classic Fame returned at Del Mar in August and finished sixth in the ungraded Tsunami Slew Stakes, sustaining a hoof injury in the process. His other two races that season came in November: he won an allowance at Santa Anita and then finished third to Notorious Pleasure in the Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park. 1992: six-year-old season On 1 January 1992, Classic Fame began his fifth campaign at Santa Anita in the San Gabriel Handicap in which he was ridden by Delahoussaye and started second favourite behind Fly Till Dawn. He took the lead in the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and three quarter lengths from Super May. Later that month at the same track the horse started favourite for the one and quarter mile San Marcos Handicap in a six-runner field which also included Golden Pheasant, Fly Till Dawn and Super May. With Delahousaye again in the saddle he raced in fourth place before moving up to second on the home turn, overtaking Fly Till Dawn in the straight and winning by half a length. Delahoussaye commented \\"I loved the pace. I was just hoping he'd kick on. He dug in and caught that horse. I thought Fly Till Dawn would stop sooner... I don't know how far he'll go. They were concerned about a mile and a quarter, but he did it today\\". At Santa Anita in March, Classic Fame started second favourite for the Arcadia Handicap but ran poorly and finished unplaced behind his old rival Fly Till Dawn. Despite his defeat the horse was made favourite when he stepped up to Grade I class for the Hollywood Turf Handicap in May, but finished second, beaten a length by the 1990 Epsom Derby winner Quest For Fame. On his final racecourse appearance at Hollywood Park in June Classic Fame came home third behind Notorious Pleasure and Marquetry in the John Henry Handicap. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Classic Fame was retired to become a breeding stallion in California before moving to New Zealand. His best offspring included Armstrong (New Zealand Stakes), Beaujolais (Manawatu Cup) and Gentle Call (Lowlands Stakes). His last recorded foal was born in 2003. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1986 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 23-b ","title":"Classic Fame"},{"id":"56099346","text":"Rieffenach Family Equestrian Act Aug. 2, 1931 Chicago Sunday Tribune page of pictures including section on the \\"Circus is coming to town\\" with references to performers Rose Rieffenach, bareback equestrian, and Felix Adler, clown, performing with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Combined Circus in Chicago's Grant Park. The Rieffenach family were circus performers who specialized in a Bareback riding act that performed in Europe and the United States during the first half of the 20th century. Family members, daughters Maria (Mitzi) Rieffenach and Rose (Rosie) Rieffenach, were inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame in 1970. The Rieffenach Family Equestrian Act originated from the marriage of the mother Maria Enders of the Hungarian Circus Enders, and Simon Rieffenach Sr. The family performed their horseback riding act with the Sarrasani Circus in Europe from 1905 and were with the German Circus Carl Hagenbeck in 1921. The Rieffenach Family Riding Act came to the United States in 1922 after being booked to perform for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The Rieffenach Family Act was with Ringling Brothers for sixteen years through 1937. In her memoir, Tiny Kline, the famous circus acrobat, stated: \\"The Rieffenachs' riding act had been the feature in the center ring of the Big Show since their arrival from Austria\\". In 1939 the Rieffenachs went on the Cole Bros. Circus, performing through 1942 after which time the act was disbanded. One son, James Rieffenach, continued riding with the Poodles Hanneford Act, while the other members of the act retired. James died of a heart attack in 1945 while still performing with the Cole Bros. Circus. The members of the act included the matriarch, Maria Enders Rieffenach, and her daughters, Mitzi Rieffenach Jahn, Rose Rieffenach Bruce, Betty Rieffenach Olvera and Maria's son, James Rieffenach. In an interview for the magazine Circus Scrap Book published in 1932, the late famous circus aerialist, Lillian Leitzel, spoke of the Rieffenach family as an example of the wholesome conditions of circus life, demonstrated by the parents desire to see their children continue in the family circus performer tradition. In addition to the Rieffenach family members, the act included Clarence Bruce, husband of Rose. In an ironic twist of fate, after Lietzel‚Äôs death in a circus accident in 1931, her widowed husband, the trapeze artist Alfredo Codona would marry Vera Bruce, also a trapeze artist and the sister of Rose‚Äôs husband Clarence. In 1937, in an unwholesome act, Codona would commit suicide after murdering Vera Bruce. The Rieffenach Act was the continuation of a long established family affair with the circus beginning in Europe. An equestrian herself, the mother Maria had performed bareback riding in Europe with her sister, Paula Enders Balasic, with the Circus Enders owned by their father, Josef Enders. Maria joined the Rieffenach Act and after the Circus Enders closed in 1905 the act joined the Sarrasani Circus. Her sister Paula had left the Circus Enders earlier to form the Balasis family acrobatic act with her husband Victor Balasic Sr. Once in the United States, the mother Maria owned and managed the Rieffenach act but did not ride in the performances. The Rieffenach act consisted of athletic riding performances on the back of horses, with act members usually standing on the bare back of a horse or sometimes employing a small platform strapped to the horse's back. The performers would execute acrobatic feats in the center ring of the circus tent, riding in circles around the ring, in front of the audience in the stands. There were many elements to the act including one rider standing on the shoulders of another, riding on two horses with one foot on each horse, riding balanced on only one foot, jumping from one horse to another, and even somersaulting from one horse to another. At times the entire family performed at once with three riders standing astride four horses, supporting two more family members on their shoulders. The most famous part of the act was the performance of Maria (Mitzi) Rieffenach and Rose (Rosie) Rieffenach called \\"riding two-high\\". Mitzi and Rosie would stand on the horse and then, while the horse galloped around the ring, Mitzi would lift her sister Rosie with one arm up into the air. The scene is recreated on one of their more famous lithographic posters for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus including the title \\"The Rieffenach Sisters, Riding Beauties of International Fame\\". In addition to the many circus art posters created for The Rieffenach Sisters, they were the subjects for a painting by the famous artist John Steuart Curry and a print by the famous illustrator and lithographer, Robert Riggs. == Alternative names == * Geschwister Rieffenach Akrobatinnen zu Pferde * The Rieffenach Troupe * The Rieffenach Sisters Riding Beauties of International Fame * Miss Rose Rieffenach Hungarian Queen of Equestrianism * Rose Rieffenach Champion Equestrienne of Continental Europe * Miss Rose Rieffenach World's Greatest Equestrienne \\"BULLETS OF CODONA FATAL TO HIS EX- WIFE; Vera Bruce Dies in Morning After Aerialist's Suicide at Long Beach, Calif.\\", New York Times, August 1, 1937. ==See also== * Circus Hall of Fame == References External links== *Rieffenach Poster Collection held by the Ringling Museum of the Circus, Sarasota, Florida *Rieffenach Circus records - photographs, movies, poster art, held by the Robert L.

She is best known for appearances in images and videos in which she confronts Israeli soldiers. Tamimi's advocates consider her a freedom fighter for Palestine, comparing her to Malala Yousafzai; her detractors argue she is manipulated by political parents and has been taught to engage with violence. In December 2017, she was detained by Israeli authorities for slapping a soldier. The incident was filmed and went viral, attracting international interest and debate. Tamimi was sentenced to eight months in prison after agreeing to a plea bargain and released on 29 July 2018. ==Early life== Ahed Tamimi was born on 31 January 2001 in Nabi Salih, a small village located about northwest of Ramallah in the West Bank in the Palestinian territories. Her father, Bassem Tamimi, was born in 1967, the year the occupation began. In January 2018 Harriet Sherwood wrote that he and his children \\"have known only a life of checkpoints, identity papers, detentions, house demolitions, intimidation, humiliation and violence. This is their normality.\\" According to her father, Tamimi is subjected to threats from Israeli forces when she is recognised. To protect her from harassment, her parents relocated her to a relative's home in Ramallah so she did not have to pass through Israeli checkpoints to continue her secondary education. By Bassem's estimate, the family home, which had been slated for demolition in 2010 just prior to the village's adoption of its weekly protests, has been subjected to 150 military raids as of September 2017. ==Activism== Tamimi has been involved in protests and political agitation expressing her opposition to the expansion of Israeli settlements and detention of Palestinians. She has argued that documented, organized protests against the Israeli occupation will lead to wider recognition of the Palestinian struggle for autonomy; her viral images and videos have produced a wave of public reactions in Israel and Palestine, as well as internationally. At 11 years old, Tamimi was commended by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas for attempting to intervene during her mother's arrest in August 2012. When an Israeli soldier arrested her older brother in 2012, Tamini was mentioned in the international media. The image of Tamimi waving a fist while confronting him went viral on social media and she was invited to travel to Turkey by the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Three years later she gained attention after she was seen biting and hitting a masked Israeli soldier who was in the process of taking her younger brother away because he was throwing stones. In December 2016, the United States denied Tamimi a visa for a speaking tour titled \\"No Child Behind Bars/Living Resistance\\". Slapping incident Pro-Palestinian protest in Paris on 8 March 2018 wall, by Jorit Agoch and others On 15 December 2017, Tamimi took part in a demonstration in Nabi Salih opposing the expansion of Israeli settlements near her village. The protest turned violent when around 200 of the demonstrators threw stones at Israeli soldiers; the soldiers organized to quell the unrest and entered the Tamimi house to subdue protesters who, according to the army, continued to throw stones from inside the house. According to the Tamimi family, during the protest Ahed's 15-year- old cousin Mohammed Tamimi was shot in the head at close range with a rubber- coated steel bullet, severely wounding him. In response, Tamimi, along with her mother and cousin Nour, approached the two soldiers outside the Tamimi home, and were filmed slapping, kicking, and shoving them; the soldiers did not retaliate. Her cousin was put in a medically induced coma to treat his head injury and regained consciousness a few days later. Footage of the incident was uploaded to Nariman Tamimi's Facebook page and went viral. Days later, on 19 December Tamimi was arrested in a nighttime raid. Despite concerns about the use of military court for a minor who may have been singled out for \\"embarrassing the occupation\\", thirteen days later Tamimi was charged with assault, incitement, and throwing stones; her mother and Nour joined her, having been arrested in relation to the incident. Her mother was also charged with incitement and assault after posting a video in which the indictment claims Tamimi urged violent attacks against Israel. The case drew global attention and spurred debate over the soldiers' restraint in Palestinian and Israeli societies. Rallies in support of Tamimi took place in North America and Europe. On 24 March 2018, Tamimi agreed to a plea bargain with prosecutors whereby she would serve eight months in prison and pay a 5,000-shekel ($1,437) fine. As part of the agreement, she pleaded guilty to one count of assault, one count of incitement, and two counts‚Äî‚Äåunrelated to the December 2017 incident‚Äî‚Äåof obstructing soldiers. While in prison, Tamimi earned her high school degree; she was released on 29 July, resolving to study law and \\"hold the occupation accountable\\". A mural of Tamimi on the Separation Wall was completed by two Italian artists‚Äîincluding Jorit Agoch‚Äîas an act of homage to coincide with her release. Both artists were arrested and forced to leave Israel.'Mo:Torna in libert√† Tamimi: rilasciati anche lo street artist Jorit Agoch e l‚Äôaltro italiano,' ANSA 29 July 2018'Italian graffiti artist arrested for mural of Ahed Tamimi on security barrier,' Times of Israel, 28 July 2018.'Graffiti artists detained for giant mural of al-Tamimi,' Ma'an News Agency 29 July 2018. ==Analysis== Tamimi has been described as one of the new symbols of Palestinian resistance to Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. Many Palestinians have protested their living conditions, but Tamimi is one of the few internationally recognized figures of the cause. She is credited with energizing Palestinians demoralized by years of Israeli settlement building and bringing renewed attention to Israel's occupation of the West Bank; her case also highlighted Israel's detention and prosecution of Palestinian minors.:'Her case has highlighted the arrest and detention of what local human rights groups say are more than 300 Palestinian minors.'Alice Speri Homecoming:How Ahed Tamimi Became the Symbol of Palestinian Resistance to Israeli Oppression The Intercept 31 July 2018: 'Ahed‚Äôs story drew rare attention to the plight of Palestinian children held in Israeli military prisons ‚Äî an overwhelming majority of them over stone-throwing incidents or for participation in protests ‚Äî and the sham court proceedings, abuse and threat-filled interrogations, and extracted confessions to which they are subject.'Oren Liebermann and Ian Lee, 'Ahed Tamimi: Palestinian teen who slapped Israeli soldier freed from prison,' CNN 29 July 2018:'Tamimi's case has become a lightning rod for criticism of the Israeli military, the military court system, and its treatment of Palestinian youth. \\"Israel's jailing of a child for eight months -- for calling for protests, and slapping a soldier -- reflects the discrimination, complete absence of due process, and ill- treatment of children endemic in Israel's military justice system. Ahed Tamimi is now free, but hundreds of Palestinian children remain locked up with little attention on their cases,\\" said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.' Ben Ehrenreich, a journalist who documented the Tamimi family in 2012, saw her physical appearance as a factor in her celebrity; \\"A great deal of work goes into ‚Äòothering‚Äô Palestinians,\\" he wrote, \\"to casting them as some really recognizable other.\\" Ehrenreich continued: \\"when suddenly the kid [Tamimi] doesn‚Äôt fit into those stereotypes‚Äîwhen she actually looks like a European kid or an American kid‚Äîthen suddenly all that work of dehumanization can‚Äôt function.\\" Since 2010, the Israeli military detained and prosecuted 8,000 Palestinian children. Tamimi's detractors consider her actions staged performances aimed at discrediting Israel. She and her family have been denounced in Israel as \\"terrorist sympathizers\\". Others, including Israeli parliamentarian Michael Oren, accuse her of dressing up in \\"American clothes\\" to provoke responses from soldiers. Some Palestinians also suggest that the video may have hurt their cause by showing the soldiers behaving passively. == Documentary == Jesse Roberts of Rise Up International and Jesse Locke of AMZ Productions filmed a documentary, Radiance Of Resistance, that featured the then 14-year-old Tamimi and 9-year-old Janna Jihad.Nirmal Narayanan, 'Singapore bans film featuring Palestine-Israel conflict in fear of unrest,' International Business Times 4 January 4, 2018.'Screening: Radiance of Resistance,' Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center 26 March 2017 In 2017 it was screened worldwide at a number of festivals, including the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where it won Best Documentary. The Singapore Government's Media Development Authority (IMDA) banned public screenings of Radiance of Resistance for its \\"skewed narrative\\" which could cause \\"disharmony\\" in the country. The government's ban was described as censorship. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2001 births Category:Child activists Category:Living people Category:Palestinian activists Category:Palestinian human rights activists Category:Palestinian children Category:Palestinian people imprisoned by Israel Category:People convicted of assault Category:People from Nabi Salih ","title":"Ahed Tamimi"},{"id":"56099420","text":"Stanley Pierre Nsoki (born 9 April 1999) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for Ligue 1 side OGC Nice. ==Club career== Nsoki developed through the Paris Saint-Germain academy.

He was proficient in scoring goals from various angles and situations. Yousef studied at Tahra Primary School and has been practicing football from an early age. He was given the name Chico because of his size by a group of British soldiers during the start of his career during the late 1930s.

He was the star of the Iraqi Army team which participated in the Arab Army Games in 1954 and played in the Six Team Army Tournament the next year in Tehran. Yousef helped Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya become a successful team in Iraq since its 1931 founding, guiding them to a number of cups and championships during his long career with the club, which ended in 1959. Even though Chico was only seen by fans at stadiums in Iraq and heard on the radio during the 1950s, he had managed to develop a legendary status with Iraqi fans of today. The Iraqi football writer Shaker Ismail nicknamed him 'the Eternal Footballing Legend'. He retired from sports in 1963 and died on September 26, 1991 following an illness.

The company manufactures and sells non-dairy, plant-based milks made from nuts, grains, and seeds. The first four nutmilks ‚Äì almond, cashew, hazelnut, and walnut ‚Äì debuted at Natural Products Expo West in March 2017. A number of additional products have launched since, including their line of unsweetened plant milks] made with just 2 to 3 ingredients, award winning barista editions , dairy-free creamers, and single serve ready-to-drink options. ==History== Elmhurst was founded in Queens, New York in 1925. Current owner Henry Schwartz‚Äôs father and uncle started the company, which became Elmhurst Dairy, in their father‚Äôs milk house in the Elmhurst neighborhood. The Schwartz brothers moved to the Jamaica neighborhood in the 1930s. Here they linked with their brother-in-law, who had a farm of 200 cows in Middle Village, and set up a manufacturing plant. The Jamaica site housed Elmhurst Dairy until its closure in 2016. Schwartz cited ongoing losses, stating that the family had kept the plant open ‚Äúlong past the years that it was economically viable.‚Äù It was the last remaining fluid milk plant in New York City. Elmhurst Dairy rebranded itself as Elmhurst 1925, and switched its focus from dairy to plant-based milks. It moved its manufacturing operation to a new 30,000 square foot plant, adjacent to sister company Steuben Foods, in 2017. A line of nutmilks launched in March 2017. ==Products== Elmhurst 1925 currently offers a wide range of products and continues to add to this portfolio regularly. Milked Almonds, Cashews, Walnuts, and Hazelnuts were originally introduced at Natural Products Expo West in March 2017. A number of additional Elmhurst Milked products were shown at Natural Products Expo East in September 2017: Milked Oats, Brown Rice, Peanuts, and Peanuts with Chocolate; and unsweetened versions of Milked Almonds and Hazelnuts. These launched in January 2018. Elmhurst Milked Peanuts is the only packaged peanut-based milk on the market. All products are packaged in 32 fluid ounce (946 mL) multi-serve cartons, and sold in both retail stores nationally as well as being available directly through their e-commerce site in the contiguous US. Elmhurst's product line is vegan, lactose-free, kosher, and non-GMO certified. == Process - HydroRelease == Elmhurst uses a proprietary process, which it calls the HydroRelease method. Dr. Cheryl Mitchell developed the process over five years, at a California research facility purchased in 2001. Previously, she had developed Rice Dream for Imagine Foods. In 2015, Mitchell partnered with Elmhurst and Steuben Foods owner Henry Schwartz to bring the technology to market on a large scale. This led to the opening of Elmhurst's cold-milling plant in Elma, New York in 2017. According to Mitchell, \\"milking\\" begins with nuts, grains, and seeds, rather than a formulation to which these ingredients are added later. The process separates the source ingredient into its individual components, which include protein, fat, fiber, and micronutrients. These components are then put back together, forming a milk-like liquid which retains the nutritional profile of the original nut, grain, or seed. No gums, stabilizers, or emulsifiers are used. Because the ingredients are separated, fiber may be left-out when the ingredients are recombined and sold for other uses, such as making pasta. Schwartz claims that Elmhurst's milked nuts products contain up to four times the nuts of other nutmilk brands. == Certification and verification == * Elmhurst Milked Oats bears the 100% Whole Grain Stamp. Granted by the Oldways Whole Grains Council, the stamp verifies that 100% of the grain in the product is whole grain, and there are at least 16 grams whole grain per serving. Elmhurst Milked Oats is labeled as having 20 grams whole grain per serving. * All Elmhurst products are kosher-certified, with classification as pareve, by the Orthodox Union. * All Elmhurst products are certified Non-GMO by the Non- GMO Project * All Elmhurst cartons bear the Forest Stewardship Council trademark. * All Elmhurst cartons bear a recycle symbol linked to the Carton Council. The Carton Council was formed in 2009 by SIG Combibloc, which supplies Elmhurst Milked packaging, and three other leading paperboard carton manufacturers. ==Awards and recognition== * VegNews, in its 2017 Veggie Awards, recognized Elmhurst 1925 as Company of the Year. * VegWorld Magazine named Elmhurst 1925 Best in Show among vegan milks at Natural Products Expo East 2017. * Elmhurst 1925 won New Hope Network's Natural Products Expo East 2017 NEXTY Award for Best New Beverage. * Clean Eating Magazine awarded Elmhurst 1925 the 2019 Clean Choice Award * VegNews awarded Elmhurst 1925 Best New Vegan Product at New Hope Network's Natural Products Expo West 2019 * Clean Eating Magazine awarded Elmhurst 1925 the 2020 Clean Choice Award * The National Restaurant Show awarded Elmhurst 1925 the 2020 FABI Award for their Barista Editions * ==External links== *Company website ==References== Category:Plant milk Category:Milk substitutes ","title":"Elmhurst 1925"},{"id":"56099551","text":"The Ministry of the Electrical Industry () was a government ministry in the Soviet Union. ==History== The Ministry of Electrical Industry USSR originated from the Main Administration of Electric Power Industry (Glavenergoprom) of the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry. A law of 11 May 1937 authorized the subdivision of the Main Administration of Electric Power Industry into two main administrations. On 24 January 1939, when the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry USSR was divided into six people's commissariats, one of the six was the People's Commissariat of Electric Power Stations and Electrical Industry USSR. The Main Administration for the Sale of Electrical Engineering Output (glavelektrosbyt) was organized into the People's Commissariat of Electric Power Stations and Electrical Industry in September 1939. A ukase of 17 Aprile 1940 established the People's Commissariat of Electrical Industry USSR, giving it jurisdiction over the following enterprises: electrical machine building, electrical apparatus building, telephone and telegraph, storage battery, cable, lighting engineering, electrical insulation products, electrical measuring instruments, automatic instruments, telemechanical instruments, radio apparatus, and boiler and turbine building enterprises. By the law of 15 March 1946, which reorganized the Council of People's Commissars into the Council of Ministers USSR, the People's Commissariat of Electrical Industry became the Ministry of Electrical Industry. A ukase of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of 28 June 1946 divided the Ministry of Electrical Industry into two ministries: the Ministry of Communication Equipment Industry, with control over enterprises and organizations producing radar, radio engineering, and telephone and telegraph equipment, vacuum tubes, storage batteries, battery cells, and carbon electrical products, and the Ministry of Electrical Industry, with control over enterprises and organizations producing electrical machinery and apparatus, electrical hoist and transport equipment, electrical precision measuring instruments, cable, and electrical insulation products. ==List of ministers== Source: * Ivan Kabanov (19.3.1946 - 2.4.1951) * Dmitri Yefremov (16.5.1951 - 6.3.1953) ==References== Electrical Industry ","title":"Ministry of Electrical Industry"},{"id":"56099574","text":"The Torped 47 is a new lightweight torpedo intended for ASW and surface targets, providing multiple-target active/passive homing combined with wire guidance.

The area around the \\"Big Spring\\" remained sparsely populated from 1814, when the land was ceded to the United States by the Creek Nation, until after the Civil War. A post office was established in 1834, and a sawmill was founded in 1861, but development did not begin in earnest until the coming of the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad in 1870. Now connected to Atlanta and Columbus, Mississippi, business and industry began to center in Springville, and the town was a center for moving ore from the surrounding hills to industrial centers in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The town was incorporated in 1881, and it is from this period that the district's oldest buildings date. Several high-style Victorian houses, including some Queen Anne, are spread throughout the town, including the town's first school. Many commercial buildings from this time were destroyed in a fire in 1897. The commercial core was rebuilt and expanded over the next few decades, mostly in simple brick styles, but some (including the Presley Store built in 1902) with more elaborate details. Later houses were mostly bungalows and cottages with Victorian elements, although some Craftsman houses were built as well. In addition, several churches, a cotton mill, and a Masonic temple are still in existence.
