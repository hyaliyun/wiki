He was noted for being a painter even though he had no arms or hands.  Life  Schweicker was born in Schw√§bisch Hall, to Hans and Dorothea Schweicker. His father was a baker and a councilor, and later a judge. Schweicker was the 6th of 8 children, and had four brothers and three sisters. He was born without arms, presumably due to amniotic band syndrome. Nevertheless, he learned not only to master every day tasks like washing and dressing himself, but also to write, by using his feet. By age seven, he began his schooling, and by age twelve, he was enrolled in the Schw√§bisch Hall Latin school. Calligraphy and Celebrity Status Schweicker had a talent for calligraphy, and soon became adept at creating elaborate documents. This, combined with his ‚Äòunusual‚Äô technique soon made him a celebrity. Many visitors came to Schw√§bisch Hall to see him, watch him work, and buy a piece of his art. In 1570, he met both Kaiser Maximilian II and Prince-elector August of Saxony, and impressed them with his work. In 1584 he was invited to come to Heidelberg, to perform at court for audiences. Schweicker stayed there until 1598, working mainly as a painter.  Death  Schweicker died in the early morning hours of October 7, 1602 following a short illness.

He studied literature at the university and music at the conservatory in Rome. In 1924 he completed his composition studies under Ottorino Respighi and continued studying conducting with Bernardino Molinari. From 1938 to 1944 he was Molinari's assistant and co-director of Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He collaborated also with La Scala and l'Orchestra dell'Angelicum in Milan as well as with the Vienna State Opera and with soloists like Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli or David Oistrakh. According to the family tradition, he supported the musical life in his home town and became conductor of the philharmonic orchestra and director of the conservatory (\\"Liceo Musicale\\") in Trento. As a composer he collaborated also with the SAT man's chorus Trento. Since 1989, an international conducting competition takes place every year in that city in his honor (\\"Concorso internazionale per Direttori d'Orchestra Antonio Pedrotti\\"). Pedrotti had also a long association with orchestras in then Czechoslovakia. From 1950 to 1972 he was a frequent guest conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, Prague Symphony Orchestra, Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra (SOƒåR) and Slovak Philharmonic, with whom he made a large number of outstanding performances and recordings (over twenty first Czech recordings of compositions of Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Antonio Vivaldi, Modest Musorgsky, Ottorino Respighi, B√©la Bart√≥k, Igor Stravinsky etc.). With the Czech Philharmonic he collaborated more than forty times, including concerts in Switzerland and Great Britain (London). He was well respected particularly for his interpretations of impressionistic and classical music. His way of working with the orchestra as well as his intellect, imagination and sense of facture and colour continued V√°clav Talich's tradition and played an important role in the development of the Czech Philharmonic.

Twelfth Fleet was established from the U.S. naval forces under Commander Naval Forces Europe, Admiral Harold Stark when, on 9 September 1943 Admiral Ernest King ordered the consolidation of all U.S. naval forces in Europe under a new Twelfth Fleet. The fleet was actually organized earlier under Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk before all naval forces in Europe were combined. As a command under the United States Naval Forces Europe, the commanders were based from London, England. Kirk was replaced by Admiral H. Kent Hewitt in August 1945. The fleet had the following commands: * Task Force 122 under command of Rear Adm. Alan G. Kirk to control operations and training for the cross-Channel assault. Forces from TF 122 made up much of D-Day's Western Naval Task Force. * Eleventh Amphibious Force * Landing Craft and Bases, Europe, to receive and control the buildup of landing craft for the invasion. Task Force 129 was the bombarding force during the Bombardment of Cherbourg. On 15 April, United States Eighth Fleet was disestablished. All U.S. ships and shore bases in the Mediterranean became part of Task Force 125 of the Twelfth Fleet.

Judy and Lewis Moran had a son Jason Moran in 1967. The Morans separated in 1995. Mark Moran was murdered in 2000, Jason Moran was murdered in 2003, and Lewis Moran was murdered in 2004. Desmond Moran, Lewis's brother, was murdered in June 2009. Judy Moran was arrested, charged and subsequently convicted of his murder. In 2011 she was sentenced to 26 years' jail, with a non-parole period of 21 years. Autobiography Just under two weeks after the death of her de facto husband, Lewis Moran, Judy Moran signed with celebrity agent Harry M. Miller and announced that she was planning to write a book of her experiences, intending to \\"clear her estranged partner's name.\\" The announcement immediately brought criticism: both police and the leader of the Victorian Opposition, Robert Doyle, were reported to be \\"outraged\\" at the news, and a victims of crimes group called for new legislation to prevent the book from being published. However, while Victorian law prohibits people convicted of a crime from writing or selling stories about those actions, Judy Moran had never been convicted or charged in relation to her family's activities. Although the book was delayed in October 2004, it was released in February 2005 as My Story through Random House, and covered her upbringing in Carlton, the murders of her husbands and two sons, and her relationship with other underworld figures. Less than a week later, Random House recalled the book from sale and pulped 20,000 copies after it was revealed that the book contained false allegations in regard to a deceased Victorian detective, Fred Silvester. At the time Random House stated that the book would be reprinted without the false allegations, and the book was reprinted and returned to book stores in May of that year. As of August 2005 over 4,500 copies of the book had been sold. In 2007, Moran revealed that she was in the process of writing a second book. Murder of Desmond Moran On 15 June 2009 Moran's brother-in-law Des Moran (commonly known as \\"Tuppence\\") and brother of Lewis, was shot dead in Ascot Vale. On 16 June, Judy Moran and three others were arrested in connection with his murder. Those arrested include 45-year-old Suzanne Kane, sister-in-law of Moran's deceased son Jason Moran and daughter of Painter and Docker Les Kane, an associate of Lewis Moran who was murdered in his family home on 19 October 1978. Moran and Kane were subsequently charged with being an accessory after the fact and Kane's partner, 43-year-old Geoffrey Amour, was arrested in Portland and charged with murder.Four people arrested over killing of Des Moran , The Australian, 16 June, 2009.

Police had her under surveillance and she was arrested as she walked back to her home. Police discovered a rifle in the abandoned car and white gloves Moran was allegedly seen wearing while driving the car were found discarded in bushes nearby. On executing a warrant on Moran's home, police allegedly discovered a hidden safe containing three hand guns, two stolen Victorian licence plates, a wig and clothing which police claim matches witness descriptions of clothing worn by the gunmen.Anderson, Paul, Judy Moran and three others charged over Desmond Moran killing, Herald Sun, 16 June, 2009.

In the museum, finds from Amphipolis and its surroundings are exhibited. The excavations took place mainly in the period from 1956 to 1984, under the direction of the late archaeologist Dimitris Lazaridis. After his death (1985) his daughter, Calliope Lazaridis, continued the work until 1989. There are also finds from ancient Argilos and Eion, the port of ancient Amphipolis, together with wall panels relating the history of ancient Amphipolis and the surrounding area. Also, an 18th-century historians‚Äô correspondence about ancient Amphipolis, along with photographs of the unearthing and restoration of the Lion of Amphipolis, in 1913. Location The museum is located about 600 meters north of the acropolis, right at the entrance to the modern village of Amfipoli. The building The construction of the museum stretched between 1984 and 1995. It was built in two-storey construction and is divided into several areas. In addition to the exhibition rooms, there are offices, a conference room and a warehouse. On display are finds from the area of ancient Amphipolis and its surroundings; The artefacts were found in sanctuaries, settlements and tombs.

In the first half of the 5th century BC Alexander I introduced coinage in the Macedonian Kingdom. By extending his kingdom to the east, Alexander I brought more mines, located in the vicinity of Philippi, under his control. The yield from these mines alone was estimated at one TalentSilver (about 26 kg) per day. Depending on the sufficient availability of the raw material silver, the coins were either made of pure silver or of a silver alloy mixed with other metals. From the 5th century BC BC, two currencies existed in parallel. Heavier and more valuable coins for foreign trade and smaller, lower value, for payments within Macedonia. Towards the end of the 5th century, the smaller pieces of silver were gradually replaced by bronze coins. Phillip II continued to expand the Macedonian state, gaining control over more mines. In addition to the mint in Pella another was built in Amphipolis. From this time, gold coins were also made to the Attic standard (see Attic talent), which was introduced by Philip II.Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: Gods and Mortals at Olympus.

The museum is located within the archaeological site of Ancient Corinth, Greece, and lies under the jurisdiction of the 37th Ephoreia of the Greek Archaeological Service.The building was designed by architect Stuart Thompson, constructed by the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, with respect to a generous donation made by Ada Small Moore. Thompson‚Äôs design of the museum derived from the architectural model of the ‚ÄúChicago school‚Äù. In 1951, the west part of the building was extended, allowing space within the museum to be organised around two atriums. Between 2007-2008 renovations occurred as a result of the 3rd Community Support Framework (CSF). Improvements were made to two galleries consisting of the prehistoric collections and the findings from the Sanctuary of Asklepios. In 2015, the east and south areas of the museum now contained new large-scale works. The 2007-2013 National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) was able to assist in funding a new exhibition project in the refurbished east and south areas of the building, consisting of works from the Geometric Period until its demolition by the Romans in 146 B.C.  Ancient Corinth  Temple of Apollo, Archaeological Site of Ancient Corinth Early excavations of the archaeological site of Ancient Corinth began in 1896 and has since continued. The Temple of Apollo, one of the most significant monuments of Ancient Corinth was built approximately 540 B.C. Acting as an emblem for the Greek city of Corinth, this monument dominated Ancient Corinth, reflecting its growth and prosperity. Further investigations discovered the remains originated from the Early Neolithic period (6500-5750 B.C.) through to early modern age. Other key aspects of the Archaeological site of Ancient Corinth include: * Lechaion Road * Basilica * Fountain of Peirene * Stoa * Agora * Odien * Other temples * Theatre * Surrounding shops Findings of archaeological works at the site are enclosed in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth. This includes the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the slopes of Acrocorinth, in the Potters' Quarter, at the sites of the Sanctuary of Asklepios and Kenchreian Gate Basilica.

The lead worker (on the left) has returned to the nest and is leading the remaining workers back to the food source. Tandem running is a social learning phenomenon seen mostly in ants, by which one ant leads another native ant from the nest to the food source it has found. Tandem running is also used to find and choose better, new nest sites to which the colony can emigrate. The follower ant maintains contact with the lead ant by frequently touching the leader‚Äôs legs and abdomen with its antennae. As predators, scavengers, and herbivores, ants have a variety of food sources, for which they may journey as far as 200 meters from their nest, spraying a scent trail as they go. To lead their kin to new food sources, ants demonstrate one of the few examples of interactive teaching outside of the mammalian class. Social learning by teaching requires that the naive observer change its behavior and acquire some skills or knowledge faster than it would have independently and that the teacher incur some cost. In order for the follower ant to learn landmarks, the leader must travel much slower and make frequent stops to check for his follower. Ultimately, the knowledge of the route to the new food source can be passed throughout the colony as one follower becomes a leader, making tandem running an effective time-saving practice.Davies, N.B., Krebs, J.R., & West, S.A. (2012). An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. 4th ed, Wiley-Blackwell. The following ant frequently touches the legs of the lead ant with its antennae to maintain contact in the tandem run.  Species that use tandem running  = Ants (By genus) = * Temnothorax * Diacamma * Pachycondyla * Camponotus * Hypoponera * Paltothyreus * Ponera * Cardiocondyla * Chalepoxenus * Harpagoxenus * Leptothorax = Termites = * Reticulitermes speratus * Reticulitermes flaviceps * Reticulitermes chinensis  How ants perform tandem running  Individual ants utilize celestial and land cues as well as their own motion detection to navigate, but scout foraging is not their only strategy for finding food resources. Up to 35 percent of ants setting out from the nest forage as tandem pairs.Schultheiss, P., Raderschall, C. A., & Narendra, A. (2015). Follower ants in a tandem pair are not always na√Øve. Scientific Reports, 5. Studies have found that vision only plays a role in navigation during tandem runs, but plays no role for the followers in following the leader. The follower is only dependent on tactile and phenomenal information. Experiments in which researchers impair the vision of ants found that blind ants were more likely to follow than to lead, but could still occupy either the role of follower or leader, however, for pairs where the leader was fully sighted, their tandem run was usually smoother and faster. Thus, it can be concluded that sight is used for navigation along with other orientation systems, but is not the mechanism by which ants perform their tandem run. Research has shown that leaders rely on tactile feedback from followers during a tandem run. The follower will follow closely behind the leader, and the leader will run rapidly only after it is tapped by the antennae of the follower. During tandem runs, in addition to tactile signals, ants may also use chemical cues. Pheromone trails help maintain the bond between the ants, facilitate learning, and assist with navigation. The chemical trails may allow followers to stop and examine landmarks before rejoining the leader. Leaders, which are the teachers, are more likely to lay trails during forward tandem runs than during reverse tandem runs. Most leaders deploy their gaster down during forward tandem runs, while the followers do not. During reverse tandem runs, most leaders deploy their gaster in the up or middle position because by this time the ants have learned the route and trails have already been laid, so followers are less likely to get lost. Follower ants are not necessarily naive foragers. When lead ants were experimentally removed during tandem runs, 40 percent of follower ants successfully reached the foraging area after a brief search, providing evidence that the followers were already experienced foragers.  Costs and benefits  The time it takes for the leader to reach the food source during a tandem run is increased fourfold. However, the follower will be able to find the food source significantly faster during a tandem run compared to searching alone. Additionally, the leader will benefit by having another ant help carry food back to the nest. Experienced foraging ants will often participate in tandem runs as a follower to a familiar tree or foraging site. This may be because trees and other sites are often complex structures to navigate, and the leader may guide the experienced ant to a new food source within the same system. There is also a cost to following ants who get separated from the leader (or \\"lost\\") during a tandem run. When tandem running ants were experimentally separated in the lab, lost ants engaged in searching behavior, where they would often return to the point where they were separated from their leader, and their walking speed was slowed by almost 50%. There is a benefit to being separated from the leader in some cases however; independent exploration is critical to the practice of tandem running. Through independent exploration, ants can discover new and more direct routes and thus reduce the duration of their subsequent tandem runs that they will lead. Independent exploration is the basis of route improvement in tandem running. Teaching and social learning Tandem running is a form of recruitment and communication that involves teaching and social learning. Experience influences the tendency to engage in tandem running more than age. Temnothorax albipennis of all ages are able to participate in tandem running, but experienced individuals are more likely to do so. Older experienced ants are also more likely to lead slowly and be precise. Young inexperienced ants are capable of leading and following in tandem runs, but they lead faster and are less accurate. When an individual ant practices on its own it can learn even more. Ants are able to shorten the length of tandem runs and transfer information faster only if they independently explore the area in between being a follower and becoming a leader. Independent exploration is beneficial because it leads to an improved route and more accurate leadership of tandem runs. Only one bout of independent exploration is necessary for improvement, and extra independent explorations do not further improve tandem runs. If a leader happens to lose its follower during a run, it may continue to its destination rather than turning around to find another follower because this is a chance for independent exploration, which can improve future runs. Tandem running combines social learning with individual learning in order to maximize benefits of this practice. The exact information that is transferred between the follower and leader is not known, but the following ant acquires the same information that it would have gotten if it had found the nest on its own. If the new nest site is far from the old one, tandem running allows followers to find it faster than they would have if they used individual exploration. In termites Apart from ants, tandem running has been observed in the genus Reticulitermes, which includes termites. In Reticulitermes speratus, tandem running has been observed as homosexual behavior with males following males and females following females in order to reduce predation. By participating in tandem running, the termites increase their encounter risk of predators, but this risk is outweighed by the benefits of decreasing their post-encounter risk. The predator is able to capture only one animal at a time, so by utilizing tandem running, each termite's individual risk of predation is decreased by the dilution effect. Tandem running is also used for sexual selection in termites. There is often competition between tandem running males over which termite will be in the back position. The male in the back position is thus stronger and larger, and when the pair of tandem runners encounters a female, she will favor the back male.

The scheme provides tenants with office space, business support, fast telecom links and venture finance. The concept was originally developed by a partnership between Swansea University and the Welsh Development Agency (WDA), which built an Innovation Centre at the university in 1986. The project led to the construction of the first Technium building, a purpose-built ¬£2m facility to house general technology at Prince of Wales Dock, Swansea, opened in 2001. In October 2001, the WDA decided to build five more Technium centres across Wales in an effort to spur innovation in the Welsh economy. In 2003, a ¬£150m expansion of the Technium programme was a key part of the Welsh Assembly Government's three-year Innovation Action Plan. The Technium programme's attempt to develop indigenous businesses was described as radically different from the WDA's previous inward investment strategy, which sought to attract foreign employers to Wales. However, critics have argued that the scheme is over-ambitious, with too many incubator spaces than can be filled by local academic entrepreneurship, and focuses on property development and leasing space, rather than management assistance for new ventures. A 2009 report on the Technium initiative by DTZ showed that since the first Technium was opened, 151 tenant companies had been accommodated. Eighty-two were still in residence, 38 had moved to other locations and 22 had failed. The Western Mail argued that the scheme's performance had been \\"mixed at best... the tenants have created nearly 1,000 jobs, but surely they would have been created anyway and found suitable accommodation from private sector landlords.\\" In November 2010 following a substantial review process, it was announced by the Welsh Assembly Government that six Technium centres were to be removed from the network - Pembrokeshire, Aberystwyth, Bangor (CAST), Pencoed (Sony), Baglan and Llanelli.

Prominent among the third generation of the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography and cultural ecological research, he has been a leader in bridging this work with the Chicago School of natural hazards and risk research. In August 2008, he took a position as the first Gilbert F. White Chair in Environment and Society at Arizona State University, where he is affiliated with the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning and the School of Sustainability. In November 2015, he was named a Regent‚Äôs Professor, the highest faculty honor that can be bestowed by Arizona State University.ASU.edu, retrieved Nov 2015 Billie Lee Turner, II For most of his career (1980‚Äì2008) he taught at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. There, he served as Alice C. Higgins and Milton P. Professor of Environment and Society, and Director of the Graduate School of Geography. In 2019, he was appointed Adjunct Faculty of Graduate Studies at Dalhousie University. Personal Raised and educated in Texas, he is the first son of Billie Lee Turner, a noted taxonomist and desert botanist. He has a B.A. and M.A. in Geography from the University of Texas at Austin (1968, 1969) and received his PhD at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1974 for work on Mayan agriculture and landscape change,ASU.edu , retrieved Nov 2015 under the tutelage of William M. Denevan. He then taught at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for two years, and was based from 1975-1979 in the Department of Geography, University of Oklahoma before moving to Clark University in 1980 and Arizona State University in 2008. Scholarship Turner's contributions to knowledge have evolved from an interest in human impacts on the natural world. His early study was on the borders of archaeology, paleoecology and geography - the pre- Hispanic agricultural systems of the Maya in the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico (Turner, 1983; Harrison & Turner, 1978). This work fueled an interest in agricultural pathways and livelihoods more generally, particularly patterns of agricultural intensification. As an authority of agricultural systems, Turner produced several influential texts on the theory of agrarian change (Turner and Brush, 1989; Turner, 1974; Turner, Hyden & Kates, 1993) and advanced understanding of induced thesis of agricultural intensification. His position at Clark University assisted in the merger of his cultural ecological interests with the natural hazards-risk work in human ecology, launching him into various leadership roles for international science addressing land change and culminating in the fields of land system science. A major initiative at Clark University involving Robert Kates, who Turner notes as his ‚Äúsecond mentor,\\" generated the Earth Transformed by Human Action (1990), a major stocktaking of anthropogenic impacts on the planet and its ecosystems. Over the last 20 years Turner has led, or participated in, other research on the science and dynamics of global environmental change (e.g. Steffen et al., 2004). His interest in specific impacts of populations and societies on land use change and alterations in land cover led to a return to fieldwork in Central America in the 1990s, supported by several large research grants and supporting a large number of PhD students. The specific focus was to understand contemporary patterns of land use, informed by social investigations and GIS and remote sensing (Turner et al., 2004; Gutman et al., 2004). This research helped to reinterpret climate and landscape change involving the demise of Classic Maya civilization (Turner & Sabloff, 2012). He also promoted the emerging field of 'Sustainability Science', an emerging focus at Arizona State University (Rindfuss et al., 2004), lately applying it to the landscape in the Phoenix metropolitan area, including the design of urban land systems on microclimates. He has served as the Associate Editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences focused on sustainability and human-environmental science since 2009. He has a lifelong interest in the promotion of geographic and human-environmental science as an academic discipline. He lists, among his hobbies, \\"entertaining grad students,\\" and he has supervised more than 45 PhDs through to successful careers, and been their great supporters.

He died within four months of preparing his will at the age of forty. His wife Manekba Chimanlal established Kumar Chhatralaya (Boys Hostel) on 26 April 1912 in memory of his husband. This first institution was established at Maganbhai ni Wadi in Gheekanta. in 1921, the hostel was shifted to Sheth Ambalal Sarabhai‚Äôs bungalow, \\"Shantisadan\\" in Mirzapur. The trust established his own middle and high schools in 1926 for the hostel boys. The boys hostel again shifted from \\"Shantisadan\\" to Military bungalow in Khanpur in 1928. Chiman Chhatra Sangh, an association of hostel students, was also established in 1928. With growing needs, the Trust acquired land in Ambawadi to establish campus in 1929. The high school building was constructed and opened on 26 February 1933 and khadi was introduced as the uniform for students and staff. In 1937, the school started admitting students other than hostel boys and Sheth C.N. Technical Centre was established to provide vocational training courses. Indumati, a daughter of Chimanlal, was elected as a member of Ahmedabad Municipal School Board in 1937. Jhinabhai Desai aka Snehrashmi joined the institute and coined the word, \\"Vidyavihar\\" for the entire campus comprising boys hostel, schools, technical institute. In 1941, the primary school was established. Shishuvihar (pre-primary school) was established in 1945 along with Kanya Chhatralaya (Girls Hostel). In 1947, a Primary Teachers Training College was established. An art teachers‚Äô diploma was started in 1952 which later became Fine Arts College. In 1953, Manekba and the trustee Nirmalaben died. In 1959, Derasar was constructed. Manekba Vinayvihar was established at Adalaj in 1959. In 1961, Indumati established Vyayam Vidyabhavan for training physical instructors and the first fine arts college of newly founded Gujarat state. In 1964, the high school was given special recognition of a multipurpose school and the Government of India recognized it as the special science school. As part of this recognition, technical education classes were introduced in the school in 1965. The same year Vidyaviahr Geetmala written and compiled by Bhailalbhai Shah was published.

A separate building is constructed for the Angreji Kendra. The building was inaugurated by Professor Yashpal; an eminent educationist and Member of Rajya Sabha. In 2010, English Medium school was established which was moved to new campus two years later. Sheth C. N. Sports Academy was opened in 2011. It has two basketball courts, five cricket practice pitches and a ground, volleyball court, three table tennis tables, handball and hockey grounds. Campus The campus is spread over 72 acres. It contains kindergarten to 12th grade schools, a Fine Arts College, a teachers training college, a Jain temple as well as farms and hostels. About the school At the entrance of the two- storeys building of the High School, stand two sculptures of the Goddess Saraswati and Pragna Paramita. The school is a co-educational K through 12 institution. The campus has separate buildings for Kindergarten, Junior-High and High School. The school was selected as a multipurpose school for fine arts under the Government of India scheme. The school is based on Gandhian values and require students to wear Khadi (hand-spun cotton) clothes as their uniform. Children in all classes are encouraged to sweep and clean their own classrooms and mingle with fellow-students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Apart from academics, the school encourages an all-round development of a student through cultural and sports activities.

The museum was established in 1983 to display excavations unearthed in the area from a fortified city that once stood in its place from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD. The artifacts of the museum were also discovered in Olympus, the archaeological site of ancient Leivithra and the wider Pieria regional unit. The shown finds are witnesses of the history of Pieria. The rector of the University of Thessaloniki, Georgios Sotiriadis, began with the first excavations from 1928 to 1931. The work was resumed by Georgios Bakalakis 30 years later. From 1973, under the direction of Professor Dimitrios Pandermalis, larger areas of the city were excavated. The works are still continuing under the direction of the University of Thessaloniki. The museum contains many items from when the Romans lived in the area, including statues, architectural members, votive and grave monuments, coins, and many other objects found in the necropolis and the sanctuaries and baths of the ancient city on site. The water organ, the Statue of Dionysos, Isis and Aphrodite Hypolympia and the Asklepios Daughters are displays of particular note. Interior Statue of Isis‚ÄìTyche and marble votives offerings from the 2nd century CE. On the ground floor of the museum are a number of important statues, including the Statue of Dionysos, the Asklepios Daughters and many others found in the ancient baths. The votive statues of Isis and Aphrodite Hypolympia, were unearthed from the Sanctuary of Isis. The heads of Demeter were also found in the sanctuary. The museum also contains notable exhibits from the necropolis, including further votive offerings found in Macedonian tombs and a wide collection of wooden figurines. The ground floor also displays the remains and objects found on the sites of early Christian basilicas, and a notable collection of coins. Notable coins include a gold stater of Philip II, depicting the head of Apollo and a racing chariot with two horses, and a silver tetradrachm of Alexander the Great and a head of Heracles and the Zeus Olympios. A small cinema shows a multilingual video about the history of the excavations at Dion. Professor Pantermalis informs about the past, present and the future of the ancient site. The basement of the museum is devoted to objects excavated which relate a significant amount of information about the daily life of the people of ancient Dion, with objects used by them in daily life, and also includes more statues and items of worship from the surrounding regional unit. The museum has a wide selection of vases and jugs, ancient keys and locks and stone processing tools such as hammers and chisels. A number of notable mosaics were also discovered in a complex known as the Dionysos House. Of particular note is the item known as the Mosaic of Dionysus. However the special feature, given its own room on the upper floor, is the hydraulis or water organ, which is the first organ of its kind found in Greece and the oldest found to date anywhere in the world. The organ was described by Hero of Alexandria and Vitruvius. On a stone slab there are also the remains of an alliance agreement between the Macedonian king Philip V and the citizens of Lysimacheia in Thrace. Statues and other finds of the sanctuaries, churches and houses =Large thermal baths - Asklepios sanctuary= Among the remains of the great thermal baths were several statues representing Asklepios, the healer and protector of the body, and parts of his family. Next to his wife Epione were statues of his sons Podaleirios and Machaon. From his daughters, statues of Hygieia, Panakeia, Akeso and Iaso were found. =The Isis sanctuary= From the second century BC, The Isis cult began to replace the Artemis cult. There were statues of Isis Tyche, Isis Lochia, the goddess of birth, and Aphrodite Hypolympiada. A statue of Julia Phrougiane Alexandra stood upright on the base of the excavations. Furthermore, statuettes of Harpokrates, the companion of the Isis, and stone tables showing footprints of different sizes (possibly of men and women) are exhibited. In addition to the representations of persons, one found the upper part of a well frame as well as cult objects such as a millstone, a fruit press and a small altar. =The Demeter sanctuary= It is the oldest sanctuary in Dion to date, and dates back to the 6th century BC. On the site, cult objects, clay figures, lamps, vases and coins were found. Exhibited in the museum are parts of statues from different eras. Thus a head of the Demeter from the 4th century BC, And a head of Aphrodite from the 1st century. AD. The Roman copy of a statue of Artemis (original from the 4th century BC) was found in the spring of the river Baphyras and is exhibited under the designation \\"Artemis Baphyria\\". =Sanctuary of Zeus Olympios= A statue of Perseus, the last king of Macedonia (reign from 179 to 168 BC), and stone writing plaques are exhibited in the museum. * A letter of King Antigonus Gonatas to Agasikles. The 16 lines of the letter from the 3rd century BC, the treatment of a dispute between Noumenios and his children. It was about the use and possession of a large plot. * A letter King Philips V to the magistrate of Dion from the year 180 BC, Eurylochos, was urged to recognize the religious status of the city of Cyzicus in Asia Minor as a religious place. At that time a religious place was not subject to any secular rule. * Fragments of a writing tablet (around 200 BC) confirming an alliance between King Philip V and the citizens of Lysimacheia. On the fragments is written the oath which was given by the ambassadors of the citizenship of Lysimacheia. Another fragment refers to a condition of the alliance, namely, the prohibition of alliances with one of the two pacting parties hostile camps. * A letter of king Philip V (206-205 BC) to the citizens of the Thessalian cities Pherrai and Demetrias. It defines the border between the two cities on the basis of specific local conditions. * Confirmation of an alliance between King Perseus and the Boetians (172 BC). From this connection Perseus promised support against the Romans. The Roman historian Livy noted that there are three stone steles on which this pact was written down. One of them stood in Theben, the center of Boeotia. a second stele stood in Delphi and a third in a famous place whose name was not handed down. The discovery of the missing, third stele in Dion testifies to the importance of the city at that time. =The sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistus= Exhibited objects of this sanctuary are cultic statues of Zeus and Hera as well as two stone statuettes of sitting eagles. =Other exhibits= From early Christian times, stone reliefs, crucifixes and objects of the liturgy can be seen. From the Leda House, a fully preserved marble table, supported by a lion statue, is exhibited. In addition to numerous other statues and statuettes, a mosaic from the Villa of Dionysus is depicted, which represents a Medusa head in a circular frame. Coins The hydraulis The most varied coins found in Dion during the excavation are displayed. Among them was the gold stater, which was the most important currency of the Balkans and of Europe and had a value of two gold drachms. The silver four drachma coin (œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ¨Œ¥œÅŒ±œáŒºŒøŒΩ), which Alexander the Great minted, was common throughout the East of his empire. A chart on the lower floor of the museum shows on a time axis the respectively marked coins in connection with the ruling kings of Macedonia. The predominant material for coin production was silver. It was mainly heavy, precious, silver coins, of which pieces were found in Mesopotamia, Egypt or the Levant, and also smaller coins, thought to for the payments of daily life, were minted. In addition to the usual means of payment, coins showing gods such as Zeus, Athene or Artemis were found. =Macedonian Coinage= In northern Greece, coins were introduced as an exchange medium quite early. Due to precious metal mines on the Chalkidiki peninsula and the Pangaion Mountains, enough raw materials were available for the coinage. In the first half of the 5th century BC, Alexander I established the coinage in the Macedonian kingdom. The main reason for this step was to pay taxes to the Persians. By expanding his kingdom to the east, Alexander I brought more mines, in the vicinity of Philippi, under his control. The yield from these mines alone was estimated as a talent silver (about 26 kg) per day. Depending on the availability of the raw material silver, the coins were produced either from pure silver, or from a silver alloy with admixture of other metals. From the 5th century BC onwards, Two currencies existed in parallel. Heavy and valuable coins for foreign trade and smaller, lesser value, for payments within Macedonia. By the end of the fifth century, the smaller silver coins were gradually replaced by bronze coins. Phillip II continued to expand the Macedonian state, gaining control over other mines. Next to the minting-house in Pella, another, probably in Amphipolis, was built. From this time gold coins were also manufactured according to the Attic standard (see Attic talent) introduced by Philip II. A special coin category is the so-called ghost coins (Greek Œ¥Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œ≠, danake). They consist of gold leaf and were put into the mouths of the dead to pay the ferryman Charon. This, according to Greek mythology, brought the dead across a river into the realm of Hades.Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: Gods and Mortals at Olympus. Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, page 46, The pieces found in Dion and its surroundings date back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, Chr. =The Roman Coinage= After the emergence of the Roman Empire (31 BC) Rome secured the sole right to the coinage of gold coins. The Aureus was the only gold coin in circulation. It was used for payments in foreign trade and for the payment of high officials of the Roman state. As an internal currency, the denarius was in circulation. The production of silver coins in Macedonia was discontinued, possibly bronze coins for local trade were still produced. Also in Dion was a local minting area; during the excavations many of these coins were found. A further innovation of the Roman coin was that for the first time all coins had a uniform appearance. The Hydraulis In the summer of 1992, the hydraulic organ (·ΩìŒ¥œÅŒ±œÖŒªŒπœÇ, hydraulis) was found in excavations within the remains of a building, which is situated opposite the villa of Dionysos. It is one of the most important exhibits of the museum and dates from the 2nd century AD. It corresponds to the instruments mentioned by Heron of Alexandria and Vitruvius. The organ pipes are arranged in two rows and consist of 24 additional and 16 narrower pipes. They were decorated with silver rings. The body of the organ was decorated with silver stripes and multi-colored, rectangular glass ornaments. The instrument found in Dion is the only find of its kind in Greece; It is the oldest, so far discovered specimen of the world. Tools and items of daily use Construction materials such as floor tiles, roof tiles, bricks, clay and lead pipes are exhibited. Pottery household vessels, containing oil or wine, were produced with the help of pottery wheels and burnt in kilns. The processing traces of various tools are illustrated on marble pieces. A variety of different chisels are displayed, in addition to which one can directly see the effects of processing the material on the marble. A small loom illustrates how fabrics were made. Mortars and pestles are exposed on stone tools. A plow from the third century AD, which was found south of the Hellenistic theater, should be mentioned separately. From the 1st century BC, A hand scale was found which was very finely adjustable. Also from the 1st century BC, is a speculum, an instrument used for gynecological examinations. A model of the hypocaust shows how the thermal baths of the city were heated. Exhibits from the surrounding area =Excavation Pigi Athinas= This excavation lies at the eastern foot of the lower Olympus. The presence of people was proofed from the first half of the 7th millennium BC. First settlements date from the time of the Middle and Late Neolithic Period (5600 - 4500 BC). Some thousand years later (2100 - 1050 BC) hill graves (tumuli) were excavated. The central tomb was considerably larger and deeper than the surrounding tombs, indicating a special status of the deceased. A Roman cemetery from the 4th century AD consists of 16 graves for 12 adults and 4 children. The numerous grave attachments (Kterismata) were completely preserved. =Excavations of Tribina= Named after the river Tribina (or Derbina), the remains of a settlement dating from the time around 2500 BC. were unearthed. From the Mycenaean era there are 24 tombs, in which either individual persons or up to three persons were buried. The tombs do not have a uniform shape, but they have grave attachments such as vessels, weapons and jewelry. =Excavation Pigi Artemidos= The sleeping girl Located at the foot of Mount Olympus; The first traces of the presence of people dating around the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. A tumuli from the late Bronze Age was surrounded by a stone ring (10 m diameter). Within the hill grave nine separate graves were found. The tumuli was marked by the collection and arrangement of stones in a certain form (Sema). =The tombs of Katerini= Two graves (named grave \\"A\\" and grave \\"B\\") were discovered two kilometers north of Katerini. Grave \\"A\\" consists of two rectangular chambers with a marble door between the burial chamber and the antechamber. This type of Macedonian grave is the forerunner of the great Macedonian tombs because it lacks the artistic fa√ßade which is usually found in Macedonian tombs. It was covered by a flat roof. Grave \\"B\\" is smaller and has only one burial chamber. Though the graves were stripped long ago, impressive grave remains, exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. =The excavations of Pydna= Near Makrygialos a skull of a girl was found during excavation from 1994 to 1996, in tomb 108. It had died quite young, because it had not yet a fully developed dentition. For her funeral, she was decorated with a bronze diadem. Next she wore a bronze bracelet, three finger rings, a necklace, and metal fittings on her belt. Archaeologists gave her the name \\"sleeping girl\\". There were three Mycenaean clay vessels among the burial objects. Diadems of the kind the girl wore them were very rare as burial gifts for girls or young women. They underline the high social rank of the deceased. Outbuildings =The Archaiothiki= The Dionysus mosaic is exhibited in this building, which is located west of the museum and was completed in 2007. From a gallery the mosaic can be viewed from all sides. In showcases the visitor is presented the latest finds from excavations from Dion and surrounding ancient sites. A video informs about the dismantling of the mosaic at its site, the transport to the Archaiothiki and the subsequent restoration. The building was built especially for the exhibition of the Dionysus mosaic. =The laboratory= South of Archaeothiki is the scientific laboratory. It is operated by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. =Storage building= Southeast of the museum, archaeological finds from Dion, Leivithra and the surrounding area are stored in a long-stretched building. In a workshop, professional staff deal with the cataloging and cleaning of the finds. Repairs of broken pottery are performed on an all-round table. Literature Dimitrios Pandermalis: \\"Dion.

First held in 1969, it gathers nowadays 3,200 participants coming from 23 countries and from more than 165 universities. In 2017, the association received the award of best student organization of France by the ANEO challenge. Today the ESC is composed of three different trophies that include diverse sports: The Sea Trophy (a regatta), the Land Trophy (a multi- sport raid) and the Sand Trophy (a beach soccer, beach rugby and beach volley competition).http://www.federvela.it/files/EDHEC%20Sailing%20Cup%20presentation.pdf  History  Three French students from the prestigious EDHEC Business School willing to broaden the sport of sailing, Jean-Luc Picot, Francis Prat and Pierre Jouannet, decided in 1968 to organize a student regatta. It took place from May 1 to May 4, 1969 in Dunkirk. For its first edition, the thencalled EDHEC Business School Cup, gathered 18 crews and was won by a Dutch team. Older than the Vend√©e Globe, the Volvo Ocean Race and other sailing event, the EDHEC Sailing Cup constitutes a precursor in the high-level competitions. Seven years after its creation the regatta reached 100 crews from 10 nationalities and took its actual name, the \\"EDHEC Sailing Cup\\". 329 boats attended the 18th edition, a record. For the 19th edition the Organizing Team decided to build a Village to welcome participants, partners and activities in one place. The same year the \\"Cha√Æne Avitaillement\\", an open-air free supermarket, was also created. For its 23rd edition, 20 international boats participated in the regatta including the first African boat, from Tunisia, and boats from the United States and from Brazil. In 1994 was created the Land Trophy. It was first created as a replacement of the Sea Trophy. Since it was a great success, it became a full trophy. In 1998 an Israeli-Palestinian team participated in the regatta ‚Äì it was the ancestor of the \\"Peace Boat.\\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001129/112944e.pdf 6,000 participants attend to the EDHEC Sailing Cup in Brest. In 1999, the EDHEC Sailing Cup became the leading student sporting event in Europe. To give a more sporting dimension to the event, the Sand Trophy was created in 2007. For the first time in 2010 was organized the Orange Port of Call, a coastal race that gathers the participants, at night, in an area away from the Village under a marquee build up for the occasion. In 2013, the EDHEC Sailing Cup and the Intercollegiate Offshore Regatta, organized by Storm Trysail Foundation and Larchmont Yacht Club, created a partnership. It enables the winners of each regatta to have their costs of participation for the other one covered. Among the renowned sailors who have participated at least once in the event sre Eric Tabarly, Alain Colas, Franck Cammas, Olivier de Kersauson, Vincent Riou, Jean Le Cam, Marc Thiercelin, Yves Parlier, Marc Pajot, Yann Eli√®s, Yvan Bourgnon, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede and Jimmy Pahun.http://www.sailingworld.com/racing/exchange-program  The Sea Trophy  Grand Surprise boats at race during the 37th Edition in Les Sables d'Olonne. The Sea Trophy, created in 1969, is the historic heart of the EDHEC Sailing Cup and remains the biggest trophy of the EDHEC Sailing Cup. Each year, the competition gathers more than 230 boats. The French Federation of Sailing (FFVoile) and its National Race Committee supervise the race.http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2014/04/29/first-starting- signals- edhec-sailing-cup-rough-conditions/ It is open to all monohull boats with a length overall between 8 and 16 meters (approximately 25 to 50 feet) with a rating of 14 to 33.5 net handicap as well as Longtze boats. The three common boats used are Grand Surprise (around 40 boats), J/80 (around 40 boats) and Longtze (around 10 boats). The competition is divided in several rankings: An Overall Ranking, a 100% Student and the 100% International, and each competition is rewarded by different prizes. The results of the EDHEC Sailing Cup are used in order to choose which French team will be selected for the Student Yachting World Cup.  The other trophies  = The Land Trophy = The Land Trophy was created in 1994. More than 150 teams of four or five are competing in several sports such as mountain bike, running, orienteering, canoeing, zip-line or abseiling. In 2017, an obstacle course was organized between participants of the Land Trophy and of The Sand Trophy: The Mud Contest. = The Sand Trophy = Created in 2007, this trophy is divided in more than 80 teams of 5 to 9 individuals. There are competitions of beach soccer, beach rugby and beach volleyball during the day and concerts in the evening. The competitors spend all of their time on the Village with their teammates and other teams. They can rent a stand of 16m2 to represent their school and their sponsors and organize activities in it such as fast-food contest or a petanque tournament. In 2017, the Sand Trophy evolved for its 10th edition. The day is divided into two parts. One part is for classical sporting challenges and the other for more various challenges with, for example, an escape game, an archer arena and a nautic trophy. = The Air Trophy = The latest Trophy, which last took place in 2016, was a competition of kitesurfing and windsurfing. Initiated in Lorient in 2011 and officially launched in 2012 during the 44th edition, the trophy was the first kitesurfing competition in teams ever organized in France. The windsurfing competition was divided into two different elements: A race and a freestyle contest. The kitesurfing was divided into a race, a freestyle and a boarder cross contest.  The Organizing Team  The EDHEC Sailing Cup is an event organized by students for students. Indeed, the entire event is organized by students, from the logistic to the communication of the event and its 3 trophies. Divided into four divisions - Logistic, Sports, External Relations and Communication - with a head office, the association works likes a real SME, with presidents that devote their whole gap year to this mission.

The museum, noted for its pottery collection, was established in 1994 and is supervised by the Tenth Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. History The idea of a museum began in 1987 when the local council donated an old stone primary school erected in 1903 to the Greek Ministry of Culture, which began renovating and restoring the building. The Archaeological Collection of Distomo then opened formally in 1994 by Evangellos Pentazos to showcase finds from the ancient Phocean city of Ambrossos, which was located on the site of modern Distomo. Collection The artifacts, which date from the Mycenaean to the Early Christian period, derive primarily from excavations of the Tenth Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. The permanent collection of the museum occupies two rooms and the entrance hall on the ground floor and one of the basement rooms is used as a conservation laboratory for mosaics, while another houses an exhibition of World War II photographs related to the Distomo massacre in 1944 by Nazi troops. The museums contain a notable pottery collection from Medeon and Antikyra. It has a number of vases unearthed in the cemetery of ancient Medeon, spanning over 1600 years from the Mycenaean to the Roman era (14th century BC - 2nd century AD). The vases from Antikyra date between the 8th and 2nd centuries BC. One of the notable artifacts is a clay sima, which preserves the outlet for the rain water in the form of a lion's head.

It was the first Neolithic settlement by the side of a lake excavated in the country. Many important artifacts were found, the most notable being the Dispilio Tablet. The village is 8 km from Kastoria. In 1932, Professor Keramopoullos of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki located traces of a prehistoric lake settlement there. Thirty years later Professor Moutsopoulos conducted surface investigations and confirmed the existence of the settlement. In 1992 Professor Nikos Hourmouziadis of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki began systematic excavations, which are still going on. A settlement has been uncovered which dates to the mid-Neolithic period, i.e. the middle of the 6th millennium BCE. The strategic aim of the excavations is to study the settlement as a specific cultural system. The finds include tools (stone, bone, and flint) and quantities of animal bones, a discovery which shows that the inhabitants engaged in agriculture, hunting, and fishing; materials with which the huts were built (wooden piles and floors, post-holes); large clay storage jars; baskets woven in the manner of that period; cooking utensils (many of them boat-shaped); and bone and stone jewellery. The most important find is a bone flute, one of the oldest musical instruments ever found in Europe. There is also a model in the exhibition area illustrating the form of the huts and how they were constructed. A short distance from the exhibition area, lake, lakeside and land dwellings have been built by the lake, all exact reconstructions of the huts of the prehistoric settlement. Inside the huts are all the utensils which the people used for their everyday needs. An earthen cover in the middle of the settlement served to protect the fire, and there is a kind of pirogue moored at the lakeside, which the inhabitants would have used for fishing.

The museum, noted for its reconstructions of temples and its columns and inscriptions, was established in 1902 and opened in 1909 to display artifacts unearthed in the ancient site of Epidaurus in the surrounding area. Background and history The ancient site of Epidaurus was dedicated to healing and the gods Apollo and Asklepios. The oldest area of the site is a Mycenaean sanctuary dedicated to a healing goddess, which stands on the Kynortion hill; it was founded in the sixteenth century BC on a ruined settlement of the Early and Middle Bronze Age (2800-1800 BC). It lasted until the eleventh century BC, and then in about 800 BC it was rededicated to Apollo and the area is now known as the Apollo sanctuary. Epidaurus sites The other main sanctuary, the Asclepeion sanctuary of Epidaurus, was first studied by the French Scientific Expedition of the Peloponnese in 1829. In 1870, Panagiotis Kavadias of the Greek Archaeological Society began excavating the site, and over the decades that followed discovered an extensive array of artifacts. The bulk of the collection was unearthed mostly by Karvadias in two main sanctuaries of Asklepios and Apollo in Epidaurus, the older sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas on Mt. Kynortion and the later Asclepeion in the plain. The Asclepeion, the larger of the sanctuaries was known for its healing rituals and for hosting sports.The size of the partial reconstructions of the most important monuments of the Asklepeion and growing collection meant that between 1902 and 1909, Kavadias built the Museum of Epidaurus to store the finds. The sculptures which had been transferred directly to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens were replaced by plaster casts to display in the museum. Statue of Asklepios After Kavadias's death in 1926, only limited excavations of Epidaurus took place, such as by G. Roux of the French School at Athens in the area of the Abaton in 1942-43, and by I. Papadimitriou of the Greek Archaeological Service in 1948-51. A. Orlandos undertook the restoration of the theatre between 1954 and 1963 and unearthed new objects, which led to the expansion of the museum in 1958, with a storeroom built in the northwest end of the archaeological site, and storerooms to house sculpture and pottery added to the northeast of the museum. In 1971, the museum underwent expansion again when a new hall was built to the northwest of the main building to accommodate a collection of inscriptions. The large columns on display in the museum Since 1974 excavations by the Archaeological Society at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas have been conducted under Professor V. Lambrinoudakis. A special committee of the Ministry of Culture was founded in 1984 under the name of Work Group for the Restoration of the Monuments of Epidaurus known as the Committee for the Restoration of the Monuments of Epidaurus which is responsible for the conservation of the site and presentation of the monuments in both sanctuaries. In 1992, when the partial reconstruction of the Tholos temple of Asklepios was dismantled to undergo examination, a temporary exhibition was placed in the second gallery of the museum, which provides photographs and explanations of its architectural parts. Collection right The museum contains a number of large reconstructions of temples and architectural components, particularly those found at the Asklepieion. Of major note is the reconstruction of part of the entablature and Doric columns of the Temple of Asklepios dated to 380‚Äì375 B.C. and reconstruction of part of the entablature of the Temple of Artemis, dated to 370‚Äì310 B.C. There is also an extensive reconstruction of the entablature and part of the inner Corinthian colonnade of the Propylaia dated to 300 B.C. The museum also has a Corinthian capital which was unearthed below the foundations of the Tholos temple; that temple is believed to be designed by Polykleitos the Younger. The temporary exhibition of architectural parts and sculptures from the Tholos, added in 1992, is located in a room which is known as the \\"B gallery\\". Corinthian capital The museum has a substantial collection of inscriptions and Greek and Roman sculptures. The main collection of inscriptions has been housed in the special hall to the northeast of the main building since 1958 as has a storeroom for the sculptures, a pottery room, and a restoration workshop. A collection of inscriptions is also displayed under the portico to the south of the main building of the Epidauras Archaeological Museum. The museum has a plaster cast statue of Asklepios, with a sacred snake curling up on his stick. It is a copy of the original statue unearthed in Epidaurus and which is exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Also of note is a marble headless statue, believed to be of the health goddess Hygeia, dated to the Hellenistic period and a statuette of a child. thumb The museum has a collection of votive inscriptions and perirrhanteria, displayed at the facade of the inscriptions hall. There is a fragment of a votive relief and Doric metopes, which are decorated with relief scenes, one of which depicts Asklepios and Athena, and are dated to the end of the 4th or the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. A lily from the ceiling of the Tholos decorates one of the coffers of the ceiling of the external Doric colonnade of the Tholos which is dated to 360‚Äì330 B.C. The museum also displays bronze medical instruments providing an informative insight into medical practice at the sanctuary of Asklepios. Another notable display are the fossils unearthed at Epidaurus and other places in Greece, an array of minerals found in the area of Lavrio, and a collection of ancient ammonites which are believed to be over 240 million years old.

Early life and education Latham was born on 11 March 1912 in Audley, Staffordshire. He was educated at Wolstanton Grammar School, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire (now The Orme Academy) and Queens' College, Cambridge where he received a double First Class Honours Degree in history. Academic career In 1935 he was appointed an Assistant Lecturer at King's College London, and in 1939 a Lecturer. He was Reader in History (1947‚Äì1972) and Dean of Men (1965-1968) at Royal Holloway College, University of London, during the introduction of male undergraduates. In the academic year 1968‚Äì69 he was Professor of History at the University of Toronto. From 1970 to 1972 he was Research Fellow, from 1972 to 1984 Fellow, and from 1984 to 1994 Hon. Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where, as Pepys Librarian from 1972 to 1982, he had charge of the remarkable collection of books, prints and manuscripts which Samuel Pepys had left to his old college. Beginning in 1950, he devoted the greater part of his life to the study and editing of Pepys' diary.

Latham's second wife, Linnet, assisted him with the compilation of the Index and Companion volumes: the Index volume alone ran to some 900 pages. Latham described the edition as \\"the first [...] in which the entire text was printed and a comprehensive commentary published\\". It included the erotic passages omitted in the edition of 1893‚Äì99 by H. B. Wheatley which \\"could hardly have been published in Victorian England without causing offence\\". The Diary was described in a Times review by Bernard Levin as \\"the absolutely complete and unimprovably definitive edition [...] so exceptional that it can be said to have set new standards of scholarship\\". In 1985 Latham also published a single-volume edition of selections from the diaries, under the title The Shorter Pepys.

The local Church of England Church is St Philip's on Church Road which was established by Harriett, 13th Baroness Windsor, although it was not consecrated until after her death, The church was established to serve estate workers from Hewell Grange, and as such is a comparatively modest affair (nave capacity 100) that has only recently listed as a grade II heritage building. The nave has been recently modernised and is warm and comfortable. Building work commenced in 2016 to create space for meetings and storage, and also to provide the much needed toilets. The annual church fete at the beginning of July is a major community event, and Christmas services fill the church to capacity. There is no church history of Webheath; for most of its life it has been dealt with as a daughter church of the much grander St Bartholomew's Tardebigge, although it is now part of the Redditch Holy Trinity team.

Until 1998, the museum ran an educational programme for ten- to seventeen-year-olds titled \\"¬ëIn the World of Byzantine Icons\\"¬í, and one of its aims for 2000 is to resume the programme. It involved a guided tour of the museum and a detailed account of the stages of the making of an icon, accompanied by related activities and games.

Hungarian language title: Ap√°k k√∂nyve.  The Book Of Fathers  This is a monumental family saga, the adventures of twelve generations. Over three hundred years of Hungarian history, and the story of all fathers. The story begins in 1706, when the Czuczor printer family, having recently returned to Hungary from Germany, is forced to flee again by the violence which ensues after the Habsburg army suppresses the war of Hungarian independence led by Prince Ferenc R√°k√≥czi. They hide out in a cave but are found and all killed, except the youngest boy, Korn√©l Csillag. After this miraculous survival (he is fed by a dog while living in the woods), Korn√©l grows up to become a talented and wealthy man, changing his name to Sternovszky. His son remembers the grandfather's buried treasure and builds a tower on top of the blown up cave, whilst the next son, Istv√°n, now called Stern, in order to marry his lover converts to Judaism and becomes a wine merchant. And so the lineage carries on, through the Hungary's Holocaust, its Stalinist terror of the 1950s, and eventually passing to America, where Henryk Csillag is born. He moves to Budapest, and it is his son who picks up the tale of the book of fathers in 1999, the year of the solar eclipse. Thus the lineage of sons is brought into conjunction with the heavenly ordained cycle of the son. In chronicling this remarkable dynasty. The book thrillers and tragicomedies which is shot through with strands of Hungary's history and rich culture, deploying an astonishing battery of literary styles appropriate to the period of each episode.

The museum also has exhibits of folklore art, agriculture operations and basket making. Features The museum structure is prominent in Komotini for its architectural elegance. The exhibits cover the Neolithic and Iron Age sites of colonies of Greece in the remote northern Aegean, Greek art, holy sites, Roman hamlets and artifacts of funeraries.

A detailed map showing the location of the archaeological sites in Thrace and Macedonia are also provided to the visitors. There is also a clay figurine from Abdera dated to early 200 BC, although the gilded bust of Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211 AD) is cited to be the most impressive exhibit in the museum. Another interesting exhibit in the museum is a grave stele with images marked on both its faces, made from Thacian marble. It was found at ancient Dikaia in 1927, and is an example of late Ionian art of the Late Archaic period dated to 300 BC.

While his pioneering was relatively late in the settlement of the Ohio River Valley area, his life exploits have made him a particularly memorable character in the history of the region. Youth and early life Aside from his birthdate of March 22, 1780, little else is known about his birth and early life. It is postulated that grew up somewhere in the central Pennsylvania farm lands. Known to have been a lifelong illiterate, Moore claimed to have heard \\"wild tales\\" about the lands to the west. He bought a Kentucky Long Rifle and left for what he called his \\"adventures\\" sometime in the late 1790s.The Annals of Northern Kentucky 1800‚Äì1850: A Concise Yet Incomplete History 105 Founding of Russell After fighting for over a decade in the still ongoing Indian Wars, he claimed to have killed \\"at least Three Hundred Red-Skins.\\" He later retorted that he \\"counted women as a half, kids only a third and hell-babies was just sport.\\"The Annals of Northern Kentucky 1800‚Äì1850: A Concise Yet Incomplete History 106 Finding the Northern Kentucky area to his liking, he wandered through various towns and over a period of five years was run out of nearly fifteen communities over incidents attributed to his hard drinking and extreme, even for the time, racism.Welcome to the Kentucky Historical Society Web Site In early 1823, while traveling through the area that is now Russell, Moore decided, upon seeing the area's unique hilly features, that a town built here could be easily fortified and defended against what was his near constant and lifelong fear: \\"Injun Attack.\\"Fast Cars Over the next few months, Moore built a large cabin on the highest hill in the area and declared this to be the center of his new town which he subsequently christened Russell. This name was to honor a man he once mistakenly killed in a dispute over \\"Shine\\". After these preparations, Moore returned East and gathered what family he could find to return with him and convinced all others possible to join through what was referred to later as a series of \\"lies, subterfuge and just plain untruths\\"The Annals of Northern Kentucky 1800‚Äì1850: A Concise Yet Incomplete History 107 about his new community. Moore eventually returned to his new community in late Spring of 1824 with a group of nearly seventy settlers who, with their hard work, built Russell into the thriving community it is today. Moore remained in Russell for the rest of his life where he became a valued member and leader of the town he founded.Welcome to the Kentucky Historical Society Web Site Death Moore died September 22, 1835 after spending five days drifting between a delirious and near comatose state resulting from a severe head injury he received September 17. The most widely accepted explanation of his receiving this injury comes from The Annals of Northern Kentucky 1800‚Äì1850: A Concise Yet Incomplete History: > Concerning the events that lead to the death of Russell town founder Jeff > Moore, local resident Biddy Harper reported the following that on or around > the midnight hour of September 17th she was awakened by what she described > as \\"a ruckus a-coming from around the back of the house.\\" Upon going to > investigate, she reported seeing the following scene: \\"I first saw two men I > didn't recognize yelling and carrying on with each other who I surmised from > the slur of their speech and seeming little control of their movement were > heavily intoxicated. I tried to yell some sense into the two but they were > too heavily into the drink to notice me. I gathered from what little speech > I could make out the two were fighting over a woman they both wanted to > marry. Eventually one man knocked the other to the ground, then he pulled a > knife and slashed the man rather deep on the arm yelling 'She's mine and > don't you forget' then turned to leave seeming satisfied with himself. The > other man with his still good arm grabbed a loose fence post and ran up on > the other beating him rather severely about the head and then running off > into the night.\\" The Annals go on to report that Ms. Harper immediately summoned the town doctor who discovering the victim's identity did all he could to \\"remedy\\" the town founder. Eventually, the other man was found and identified from his injured arm. He was revealed to be one Thomas Lorry, a cousin of Moore, and the identity of the woman in dispute was reported to be fourteen-year-old Virginia Godfrey, a cousin to both.

It is used in explaining the difference between two views of the law (usually as expressed by two different rabbis). The implication is that they agree on the practical result but differ on the source text or legal principle forming the rationale for that result. It is contrasted with the question Mai nafka minnah, \\"What goes out from it?\\", which indicates that in a distinction between two or more legal opinions or conceptual categories, there must be some practical effect that emerges from the distinct categories as conceived. In other words, nafka minnah concerns the tachlis or \\"bottom line\\". An example of be-mai peligei occurs at Temurah 6a, where Rava and Abaye are discussing whether a transaction which breaches a religious law can have any legal validity, Rava holding that in general it does not and Abaye holding that it does. However, in a series of examples drawn from different fields of law it is found that they agree on the practical result in every case. \\"So on what do they disagree?\\" Rava holds that, while the general principle is that such transactions are invalid, exceptionally they are valid where there is an indication to this effect in the Biblical text. Abaye holds that, while the general principle is that such transactions are valid, exceptionally they are invalid where there is an indication to this effect in the Biblical text. In other words, they agree on the lists of examples but differ on which is the general rule and which is the exception.

Particularly important are the finds from the city and the cemetery of Olynthos, of the Archaic and Classical period, because they give a full picture of the everyday activities and the public life of that time. The museum has hosted an exhibition entitled 'Three Colonies of Andros in Chalcidice: Sane, Akanthos, Stageira since 1998. Among many other things, it includes three standing or kneeling statues of Nike from the roof of a temple of the 6th century BC, which was originally at Sane and was later incorporated into the urban complex of Ouranoupolis.

The museum was established in 1965 in a building constructed especially for the purpose in Elia, one of the loveliest parts of the town. Finds from the Palaeolithic to the Ottoman period are displayed in its three halls. The Neolithic finds come from the settlement at Nea Nikomideia, which is believed to be the oldest known permanent settlement in Europe. The Iron Age finds come from the cemetery of Vergina. In the first hall are special showcases displaying a bronze kalpis or cinerary urn of the fourth century BC, a red-figure bell crater of the Kertsch type of the fourth century BC, and a bronze hydria kalpis used as a cinerary urn of the fourth century BC from the north-east cemetery of Veroia, and a reconstruction of a single-chambered rock-cut family tomb of the Hellenistic period, which was excavated in Veroia. Various other showcases display groups of finds from pit graves, cist graves, and rock-cut graves excavated in Veroia‚Äôs north-east, south-east, and south-west cemeteries. These groups illustrate the development of pottery and koroplastics from the end of the fifth to the end of the second century BC. The second hall contains mainly grave stelai and Hellenistic and Roman reliefs of the first century BC from the Veroia area. Of particular note are the stela bearing the Gymnasiarch‚Äôs Law, which describes how middle and senior education was conducted in the Veroia Gymnasium, and the hunter-and-boar group, which is part of the sculptural decoration of a third-century BC grave monument from Vergina. The most notable of the stelai are those of Paterinos Antigonou and Adea Kassandrou. The third hall contains exhibits of the Roman period, most notably an inscribed bust of the river god Olganos of the second century AD, which was found at Kopanos and is in excellent condition. There are also a grave relief of a husband and wife (second century AD), which was found in Veroia, burial offerings from a cist grave of the Roman period (third century AD), and terracotta figurines from an early Roman tomb.

The Avakians feel convinced that the rising tide of Turkish hostility on the horizon means little to them and will scarcely affect their day-to-day lives. The Avakians do not pay attention to the warning signs, and set about preparing for a family reunion with the impending visit of two well-to-do sons - landowner Aram, who resides in Turkey, and Assadour, a physician living in Venice. These illusions come crashing down when a Turkish military regiment crops up at the house, annihilates every male member of the family and forces the ladies to trek off into the Syrian desert, where they will be left to rot. With them goes one of the little boys of the family, who was dressed as a girl in order not to be killed. Along the journey, the Turks continue to commit horrible atrocities, including forcing an Armenian mother to crush her newborn baby son to death. Meanwhile, a handsome Turkish officer (Moritz Bleibtreu) falls in love with Aram's daughter and makes an aggressive attempt to deliver her from certain death, even as the circumstances surrounding him attest to the astounding difficulty of doing so.

Its members were Jeffrey Steele (lead vocals, bass guitar), Hugh Wright (drums), and brothers Cary Park (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Larry Park (guitar, fiddle, vocals). Between 1992 and 1995, the band recorded two albums (1992's Welcome to Howdywood and 1995's Born That Way) and an extended play (1994's She'd Give Anything), all on the Curb Records label. In that same time span, Boy Howdy charted seven singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, including the Top Ten hits \\"She'd Give Anything\\" and \\"They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore.\\" After Boy Howdy disbanded in 1996, Steele worked as both a solo artist and songwriter.  History  Boy Howdy was founded in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1990. Before the band's formation, lead singer Jeffrey Steele worked as a songwriter and solo artist in California. Brothers Larry and Cary Park, sons of bluegrass music artist Ray Park, met Steele at a gig at a club; drummer Hugh Wright, also present at the gig, soon joined. Boy Howdy initially recorded several demos through the assistance of producer James Stroud. A year after their formation, the band independently released a rendition of the Civil War standard, \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home,\\" at the height of the Gulf War. This single was so well-received that it caught the attention of Curb Records, a Nashville, Tennessee record label, which signed the band in 1992. That same year, Boy Howdy released its debut album titled Welcome to Howdywood, from which two singles were issued: \\"Our Love Was Meant to Be\\" and \\"A Cowboy's Born with a Broken Heart\\". These peaked at No. 43 and No. 12, respectively, on the Billboard country charts. The album also included a cover of The Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\". On May 30, 1992, Wright was involved in a motorcycle accident in Dallas, Texas, while trying to assist a driver who had crashed his pickup truck on the median of the LBJ Freeway. The accident placed Wright in a coma for five months. After coming out of the coma, Wright had to re-learn how to walk and play drums. In addition, his speech was impaired and, as a result, was no longer able to sing. Notwithstanding, however, he officially rejoined Boy Howdy on July 1, 1993. Shortly after Wright's reunion with Boy Howdy, the band released the single \\"She'd Give Anything\\", which became its first Top 5 hit on the Billboard country music charts, peaking at No. 4. The music video for \\"She'd Give Anything\\" was also a No. 1 video on both Country Music Television and The Nashville Network. \\"She'd Give Anything\\" was included on an extended play of the same name, which containing four previously unreleased songs as well as a re-issue of \\"A Cowboy's Born with a Broken Heart.\\" One of the four new songs, \\"They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore\\" was the EP's other single; it was also the band's highest-charting single, reaching No. 2. Following this was a largely unsuccessful third release, Born That Way, which produced a No. 23 single in \\"True to His Word\\" and three other singles, none of which entered the Top 40. Disbanding In February 1996, a year after the release of Born That Way, the four members announced that the band was \\"on hold\\" with no immediate plans to resume performing together, and by August of that same year, they had disbanded. Steele then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he began a solo career. He recorded an unreleased album for Curb, but later switched his focus to songwriting, including singles for Kevin Sharp, Diamond Rio and LeAnn Rimes. Steele charted the No. 33 single \\"Something in the Water\\" in 2001 on Monument Records, and has since become primarily known as a songwriter, although he has self-released several albums as well.

Art, music, theatre, film, design and cultural/educational events take place in its exhibition and performance spaces. The centre includes cafes, commercial art galleries, bookshops, craft shops, and an art library. It is intended as a venue for cultural exchange, giving Bangkok an operational base on the international art scene. The number of visitors has risen from 300,000 in BACC's first year in 2007 to 1.7 million visitors in 2017. History Inside BACC In 1995, Bangkok Governor Dr. Bhichit Rattakul began a project called \\"the art centre\\". After agreement that The Bangkok Contemporary Art Centre should be near Pathumwan junction, the project was stopped in 2001 when Samak Sundaravej became the new governor. He wanted a commercial retail space and private investors. Cultural organizations, artists, students, and media joined together to oppose the suspension. In 2004, Apirak Kosayodhin became Bangkok Governor. The project was presented again and the governor agreed to the original project that the art centre should be designed following the original plan. On 19 August 2005 a \\"Declaration of Cooperation in the Fields of Art and Culture by Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and Allied Organizations in the Fields of Art and Culture\\" was signed at Benjasiri Park. On 29 July 2008 the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre opened after many delays. Aims BACC walkway The BACC aims to create a meeting place for artists and the public, to provide cultural programmes for the community giving importance to cultural continuity from past to present. It aims to blaze new paths for cultural dialogue, networking, and to create new cultural resources from both the public and the private sectors. The main aim of BAAC is to become a place for cultural exchange. Finances The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) under Governor Apirak Kosayodhin started the BACC project with a 509 million baht construction budget in 2005. The goal was to make Bangkok a city of culture. The BMA continues to support the BACC with a 40 million baht allocation yearly (except for the years 2009, 2010, and 2017 when the BMA failed to assign funds to the BACC). Forty million baht falls far short of BACC's operating budget, which ranges from 75 million baht to 90 million a year. The shortfall is raised from donors and corporate sponsors. In 2018, the ongoing 40 million baht expenditure displeases Bangkok Governor Police General Aswin Kwanmuang, who says, \\"Each year the city supports the BACC with 40 million baht. If we could manage this money ourselves, we could develop the center in appropriate ways.\\" He want on to say, \\"As the BMA annually provides Bt40 million in funding to the foundation, it is better that BMA officials operate the city centre,...We will lease the ground floor area in order to earn more money so as to cut the losses.

Training and home matches are held at Stadio Steno Borghese. The club currently holds the Italian baseball record for most wins (17). 10,000 capacity Stadio Steno Borghese is their home stadium. History The spread of baseball and the craze for it in Nettuno is attributable to the number of U.S. military bases present in the area after the end of World War II. U.S. soldiers stationed at the bases often played baseball and softball and involved many local Italians in their games. One of the Italian baseball pioneers, Alberto Fasano, was a Nettunese. Fasano and his friend Julius Zerella eventually founded Nettuno's first softball team ‚Äì called Neptune PS. The team's first players were: John Petrelli, Luciano Serpe, Luciano Verlezza, Manrico David, Fulvio Verlezza, Tonino Marcucci and Sergio Serpe. Their official debut was in 1946 in the First Division Male Softball championship against Milan. The nettunesi won by a score of 32‚Äì7. Neptune PS won its first title in 1949. In 1950, Neptune PS became Neptune USMC. In its first championship, the club finished second, with 12 wins out of 14. Over the next four years (1951, 1952, 1953, 1954), Neptune USMC won 4 consecutive championships, making the Lazio region most titled of the Italian championship, with 17 league titles. The team won its first European Cup in 1965, and has since won the Cup five more times. The team won the CEBCup 3 times (1993, 1995 and 2000) and the Italian Cup in 1970, 1995 and 1998. In the 2007 and 2008 seasons, they advanced to the finals seven of the Italian Baseball League Series, but lost the title to the Grosseto BBC in 2007 and the San Marino BBC in 2008. This club has most of the times made the playoffs, and very often the IBL. The club did not make it to the Playoffs only in 2003. During the 2009 season, the club was defeated on 11 April in a home match against Baseball Godo. The club bought Manuel Gasparri from Bologna, Manny Alexander from Rimini, and other important players from Central America, including Abraham N√∫√±ez. Within Europe, Nettuno won the Final Four Barcelona, first defeating Kinheim and then triumphing in an all-Italian final against the Fortitudo Bologna with a result of 1‚Äì0, winning the European Champions Cup for the second time in a row.

It stars Abhishek Bachchan, Asin, Rishi Kapoor, and Supriya Pathak in lead roles. The film tackles a thorny issue with a social message similar to Shukla's previous venture OMG ‚Äì Oh My God!. The official trailer of the film was released on 1 July 2015 on YouTube. The film released on 21 August 2015. This marks the last film appearance of Asin before her marriage with Delhi based businessman Rahul Sharma on 23 January 2016. The movie title is based on a song from the movie 3 Idiots. Plot The film starts off with Inder Bhalla (Abhishek Bachchan), an aspiring song composer getting kicked out of his house by his father, Bhajanglal (Rishi Kapoor). Bhajanglal runs a bakery that doesn't really \\"run\\". He wants Inder to work at the bakery, but due to Inder's ambitions on becoming a successful song composer, he clearly refuses. Bhajanglal finds this an insult and sends Inder out of his house thinking that he is arrogant and selfish. This makes Inder hate his father forever but somewhere inside his soul, Bhajanglal still has love for his son. Inder travels to Thailand with his friend Ronny (Sumeet Vyas) who is also an ambitious song composer. Inder misses his mother, Pammi Bhalla (Supriya Pathak) but hasn't talked to her in many years. Suddenly, Inder gets a phone call from Cheema (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub). Cheema lies to Inder that his father has sold his bakery and wants him to get his share. Unknown to this lie, Inder leaves everything and flies back to India. At the airport he hugs his girlfriend Nimmi (Asin) goodbye, little knowing that she is also travelling to India on the same flight. When Inder and Nimmi reach India they catch the same taxi as Nimmi wants to visit Inder's place. Inder drops Nimmi at his place and then goes to visit Cheema. There he sees his father has been abducted by Cheema and his goons. Inder learns that over the years his father borrowed much money from Cheema due to house needs but couldn't repay it. Cheema warns that if he wants himself and his father to stay alive then he'd better arrange money. Inder and Bhajanglal go home to think of something. There, Inder finds out that his mother is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and Bhajanglal sent her to an ashram. Inder thinks that his father was very selfish but he hasn't learnt the truth yet. Inder, Bhajanglal, Pammi and Nimmi take a road trip to try to run away from Cheema. They go to a bank on their way and want to take Pammi's brother's money, that Pammi has the actual right to. Bhajanglal is made to sign the form due to Pammi's memory loss. There, Inder learns that his father has divorced his mother. This makes his hatred towards his dad increase. Bhalanglal tells Inder that it wasn't his fault and a dark truth was behind his and Pammi's divorce. After restituting what he has learnt, Inder realises that his father was always innocent and starts loving him again. Inder sell all his songs that he had composed to pay back Cheema, gets his parents married again, marries Nimmi, and renovates his father's bakery. The film ends with Inder, Nimmy, Bhajanglal and Cheema (now their friend) working at the now-profitable bakery.

The club entered the 2019 season ranked 6th in Europe and 2nd in Italy after reaching the 2018 IBL Finals which saw Bologna crowned as Italian Champions. Parma Baseball is sponsored by Parmaclima, Macron and Errea. The club, managed by Guido Poma, finished the 2020 season with a 15-11 record, good for 3rd place in Italy, behind Bologna and San Marino. One of the most successful clubs in the Italian League, Parma has won 10 IBL championships, as well as 13 European Cup titles, the most in European baseball. The club finished 4th in the 2019 Champions Cup won by rival Bologna, and will represent Italy alongside Bologna in the 2021 European Champions Cup which will be held in Ostrava, Czech Republic in June 2021. After a lengthy delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, Parma opened the 2020 season on July 8 with a 11-4 win over Collecchio in Parma. The team plays its home games at 5,000 seat Nino Cavalli Stadium located in Parma. It is currently the second-largest stadium in Italy after Nettuno's Steno Borghese, and along with Bologna's home park, often hosts Italian national team home games. Parma and Bologna served as co-hosts of the 2021 Olympic Qualifiers in September 2019 where Israel earned the Europe/Africa bid to next summers games.  2019  Italian national team players Sebastiano Poma (.380, 4 HR, 26 RBI), Aldo Koutsoyanopulos (.317, 1 HR, 11 RBI), Ricardo Paolini (.308, 1 HR, 17 RBI) led the offense. Veterans Charlie Mirabal (.297, 1 HR, 10 RBI) and Luca Scalera (.364, 1 HR, 8 RBI) also made their impact in the lineup. Erly Casanova led the pitching staff with 50.2 IP to go with a 3.02 ERA and 52 K. Marc-Andre Habeck (2.48 ERA, 38 K in 29.0 IP), Owen Ozanich (3.86 ERA, 18 K in 18.2 IP) and Yomel Rivera (4.50 ERA, 24 K in 18.0 IP) were also very steady. Veteran hurler Mauro Schiavoni proved to be an important addition, the right hander from Argentina posted a 0.00 ERA in the regular season, not allowing a single run in 11.1 IP. He also had an impressive 1.93 ERA in the Champions Cup. Parma finished 4th in the week long tournament where the top 8 club teams face off to crown the new European champion.

After jumping out to a 2-0 series lead, Parma lost three straight as Bologna came from behind, not only in the best of five series, but in game five as well. Erly Casanova was Parma's top playoff performer, logging 14.2 innings, allowing just two earned runs (1.23 ERA), walking one batter while striking out 15. Yomel Rivera (5.2 scoreless with 3 K), Junior Oberto (1 ER in 5 IP) and Marc-Andre Habeck (2 ER in 7.1 IP) also pitched well in the series. At the plate, in the playoffs, Ricky Paolini (.381), Rafael Vinales (.375), Stefano Desimoni (.333), and Mattia Mercuri (.300) were the club's .300 hitters. Longtime shortstop Charlie Mirabal injured his shoulder diving for a ball in the hole in Bologna, an injury that sidelined him for the first month of 2020 as well.  2020  The 2020 offseason saw many changes to the Parmaclima roster. Gone were pitchers Erly Casanova, Mauro Schiavoni, Marc-Andre Habeck and Junior Oberto. Infielder Mattia Mercuri and catcher Rafael Vinales also moved on from Parma. Alessandro Deotto returned to the club he called home in 2017 and 2018, Deotto started off hot, batting .344 with 3 home runs in 12 games before missing the second half of the 2020 season. Longtime infielder Luca Scalera opted to change clubs in 2020, moving to cross town Collecchio. Left-handed national team pitcher and current Cubs minor leaguer Luis Lugo along with righty Michele Pomponi were the club's two main starters. The 26-year-old Lugo posted a 6-0 record, 3.47 ERA in 59.2 innings for double-A Tennessee in 2019 and appeared in a 2020 MLB spring training game where he recorded a scoreless inning for Chicago. Lugo had previously pitched for Parma in 2018 before being signed as an international free agent, and returned following the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season. The big lefty posted a 3-3 record in 40.0 IP, striking out 69 while issuing only 10 walks to go with an impressive 1.40 ERA. Pomponi came back with Parma after having missed the entire 2019 season due to injury. The young righty logged 39.2 IP, striking out 48 to go with a 2.47 ERA. Italian national team hurlers Mattia Aldegheri (31.1 IP, 33 K, 4.02 ERA) and Yomel Rivera (18.0 IP, 30 K, 3.11 ERA) solidified the Parma bullpen. Philadelphia Phillies pitching prospect Samuel Aldegheri pitched well for Parma, posting a 2‚Äì0 record in 9.1 innings while striking out 13 to go with a 3.75 ERA. Veteran lefty Francesco Nardi (4-0 in 18.1 IP), two way player Francesco Pomponi (0 R in 3.2 IP, 3 K) Venezuelan righty Anthony Gonzalez (5.12 ERA in 13.2 IP) and French righty Owen Ozanich (2.0 IP, 0 R, 3 K) rounded out the bullpen. The club's everyday lineup featured utility man Aldo Koutsoyanopulos (.230, 17 R, 12 SB), infielder Ricardo Paolini (.325, 1 HR, 5 SB), and centerfielder Sebastiano Poma (.380, 4 HR, 19 RBI) at the top of the order.

Smooth fielding shortstop Charlie Mirabal (.286, 8 RBI, 4 SB) returned mid-way thru the season and added depth to Poma's lineup. The 2020 season featured six teams, a 26 game regular season between July 8 and September 12. The top two regular season clubs, San Marino and Bologna advanced to the Italian Finals featured a best-of-seven series to be played between September 17‚Äì26.

The company was formed in 2004 by Seb Clarke, who was shortly after joined by: Neil Graham, Al Padmore, James Wakefield and Tangwyn Davies. The label consists solely of bands native to the North Staffordshire area and has become a noted figure both locally and nationally, having recently received attention from Chris Hawkins, Steve Lamacq, and Huw Stephens (6music, BBC Radio 1) as well as Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie (BBC Radio 2) SONS has earned comparisons to Factory Records for its DIY ethic and its unique 'SONS sound'. In May of 2020 following a decade long hiatus, SONS announced the launch of their streaming service Sonstream alongside a string of new releases by This Is Seb Clarke, The Novellos, as well a series of tracks from their new roster of artists (some of which have yet to be released). The first of these tracks to receive national airplay while remaining entirely exclusive to Sonstream, was 'College Days Over' by Jayne Taylor. Chris Hawkins commented on his show that \\"this sounds like a great old tune, but it's brand new... Muscle-Shoals-on-Trent, great song and arrangement. Classic Americana with a twist of English melancholia.\\" Associated bands *This Is Seb Clarke *The Novellos *The Title *Tommy Turbo & The Turbervilles *La Dies *The Rough Charm *The Fortunas *Friends of Ken *Jane Taylor *Marty Vaughn *Neil Isaacs All of the bands use the labels in-house basement studio situated in Hanley, Staffordshire. Consequently The label has been noted for coining their own 'SONS Sound' due to their production practice. SONS exclusively record using analogue equipment, deliberately hearkening back to the production ethos of the 1960s; using tape machines, vintage valve amplifiers, and tube microphones for the distinctive warm, saturated character. The 'SONS Sound' has been likened to that of the Motown and Soul records of the 1960s and 1970s. SONS Showcase The label regularly hosts large showcase events in the centre of Stoke-on- Trent. These events feature all of the bands on the SONS roster as well as DJs such as Steve Lamacq, Chris Hawkins, and Jon Kennedy. These showcase nights have become a regular marker in the Stoke Music calendar and a centrepiece for the burgeoning scene. The showcases have earned an infamous insignia both in the local and national radar thanks to the late night antics of the audience, band members, special guests and the NME coverage of the events. The first SONS Showcase took place at the King's Hall and featured DJ slots from Andy Rourke of The Smiths, Huw Stephens, Russ Winstanley the Northern Soul Legend. Since then there have been a further three showcase nights which have taken place at the Victoria Hall in Hanley. These have been hosted by, amongst others: Carl Bar√¢t, Alexa Chung, Colin Murray and Phill Jupitus. The showcase was the label's most successful to date. Chart success SONS' first chart success came with the simultaneous release of three singles in January of 2007 by This Is Seb Clarke, Friends of Ken and The Title. These singles charted respectively at 7, 9 and 15 in the UK Independent Chart and received national airplay across 6Music and BBC Radio 1. In March 2008, the label once again released four singles simultaneously, all of which entered into the top 5 of the UK Independent Chart in their first week of release: This Is Seb Clarke, the label's longest serving signees marked the label's highest chart position to date, knocking The Futureheads off the number 1 spot. However, due to the label's financial constraints, only 1000 copies of each single were pressed, leading to all singles dropping out of the top 40 a week later due to lack of physical stock.

The platform released with a grassroots marketing campaign aimed at reinvigorating the conversation as to how music can be effectively monetised in a streaming based economy. The founder Seb Clarke stated \\"We stuck to making Sonstream happen because, finally it's a way in on a digital playform that Musicians / Artists and labels can finally earn a decent crust; without fleecing the music loving public too. Now there's an idea!\\" Sonstream promotional material has touted the service as paying artists as much as 21x that of Spotify. The platform operating on a pay per play model costs 1.4p on average per stream. Instead of advertising and subscriptions the ‚Ä≥pay per play‚Ä≥ model allows artists to see a proportionally greater, and accurate financial return for their work, as the service does not use any payout algorithms based on popularity. One of Sonstream's principal features ‚Ä≥You Release‚Ä≥ provides non VAT registered artists and labels the ability to upload individual tracks directly to the site, bypassing intermediary distributors for a greater return on their work.

The Holy See's policy in this area had always two objectives, the pastoral care of approximately ten million Christians united with Rome and the creation of positive ecumenical signals to the two-hundred and fifty million Orthodox Christians outside the Church of Rome.  Reforms of canon law  With his concern for the Eastern Catholic Churches with their combined ten million members, Pope Pius continued the initiatives of his predecessors, especially Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius XI. These Churches, not unlike the Latin Church before the Code of 1917, had their own ancient laws, which were not codified. The reform of Oriental Church laws, the CIC Orientalis for the Oriental Churches, was completed during the pontificate of Pius XII. The new, very comprehensive Church laws governed matrimonial law,AAS 1949, 89-119. Church trials,AAS1950 5-120.. administration of Church properties and religious ordersAAS 1952 65-120.. and individual rights.AAS 1957, 433-603.. New Oriental eparchies in the West  After World War II, a new situation developed as millions of united Christians from Eastern Europe emigrated to the Western hemisphere: United States, Western Europe, Canada, South America, the Middle East and Australia. The new Church law was welcomed, yet in some points, it was critiqued, for not fully adopting to these new Western circumstances. Traditional Orientals insisted on legal exemptions, allowing them to keep most of the ancient customs and laws.Herder Korrespondenz Orbis Catholicus, (HK) 13, 84. Pastorally, the Pope tried to meet this challenge, by creating independent new oriental eparchies (equivalent to dioceses) in Canada, Brazil, Iraq, France and the USA. They were legally independent from the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic bishops in these regions. Decentralization from Rome  Decentralized authority and increased the independence of the united Churches were aimed at in the Corpus Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) These reforms and writings of Pope Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as pronounced in the encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi.Encyclical Mystici corporis Christi on the Vatican website . Encyclicals Several encyclicals addressed non-legal issues of the Oriental Churches. Orientalis Ecclesiae was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of Cyril of Alexandria, a saint common to Orthodox and Latin Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. Orientales omnes Ecclesias, issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. The persecutions of the Church and a foreseeable schism are specifically mentioned and deplored. Sempiternus Rex was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to monophysitism to return to the Catholic Church. Orientales Ecclesias was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Oriental Churches, protesting the continued Stalinist persecution of the Church in all Eastern Nations and the Balkans, asking for prayers. Several Apostolic Letters were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pius XII addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in Fulgens corona and a papal letter to the people of Russia.Orientalis Ecclesiae.

The Association of Geographic Information Laboratories for Europe (AGILE) was established to promote academic teaching and research on geographic information science and systems (GIS) at the European level. History and organization AGILE was established in early 1998 to ensure the continuation of the networking activities that have emerged as a result of the EGIS Conferences and the European Science Foundation GISDATA Scientific Programmes. AGILE seeks to ensure that the views of the geographic information teaching and research community are fully represented in the discussions that take place on future European research agendas. AGILE also provides a permanent scientific forum where geographic information researchers can meet and exchange ideas and experiences at the European level. Activities of AGILE are managed by an eight-person council elected by its members. Its main tasks are to develop an organisational structure to realize the goals of AGILE, to further develop with the help of the members a European research agenda, to instigate and stimulate initiatives, and to organize a yearly GI-conference. Mission The title of the organisation conveys the following: *it is an Association *consisting of geographic information laboratories *in Europe. The idea of an Association presents few problems nor does the term \\"Europe\\". However, the use of the term \\"geographic information laboratories\\" needs some clarification. The term \\"laboratories\\" emphasises that this is an association of groups rather than individuals. It also reflects the fact that geographic information teaching and/or research tends to be a group activity in most institutions. The mission of AGILE is: \\"to promote academic teaching and research on GIS at the European level and to ensure the continuation of the networking activities that have emerged as a result of the EGIS Conferences and the European Science Foundation GISDATA Scientific Programme. Although rather wordy, the mission statement highlights the two main objectives of AGILE: *to promote academic teaching and research at the European level. This will be reflected by the organisation of initiatives on specific topics intended to influence the future European geographic information research agenda. *to facilitate networking activities between geographic information laboratories at the European level. This will be reflected in several different kinds of activity including focused meetings based on state-or-the- art presentations on key research issues and European geographic information research conferences.

He is the author of many books within many genres, including novels, short-stories and children's books, as well as writing for film and stage. His work has been translated into many languages. He has two children named Petra and Allan. Early years Tore Renberg was born in 1972 at Madla, a suburb to Stavanger, the oil capital of Norway. His mother, Mirjam Elisabeth Renberg, worked for the state roads of Norway, his father, Jan Renberg, was both a teacher and an accountant. Tore Renberg attended Madlavoll elementary school and Gosen high school, From an early age, Tore Renberg developed a profound enthusiasm for literature. Amongst his first infatuations were the Norwegian fairy tales, Roald Dahl¬¥s epics, the fantasy work of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Renberg's obsession with music was clear from the beginning. As a child his grandmother, Esther Elisabeth Ludvigsen, taught him the piano, he took violin lessons, and picked up the guitar at the age of 13. Renberg has often mentioned Duran Duran as a great favourite during his teenage years. He was also at one point a member of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood fanclub. Renberg devoted a lot of time to playing football with local club Vidar (position: striker). Formative years When an adolescent, Renberg left the world of fantasy and fairy-tales. At the age of 14 he was obsessed with Sue Townsend¬¥s The Diary of Adrian Mole, and soon after he encountered the works of writers such as Charles Dickens, Alexander Kielland and Tarjei Vesaas, all of whom would inspire the young writer. At the same time his interest in music shifted towards the growing indie-scene of the eighties, with artists such as The Smiths, Imperiet (later Th√•str√∂m), The Cure, deLillos, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, R.E.M., Japan, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. Renberg wrote his first poem on 26 December 1986. The poem dealt with his father's drinking habit, and Renberg has said that he considers that day the beginning of his writing career. In the following months he developed a habit of writing poems, and it is also in this crucial period of his life that Renberg reads the one novel that he has repeated over and over againg to be life-changing and a turning point: Dostoevsky¬¥s Crime and Punishment. After reading the Russian classic, fourteen-year-old Tore Renberg wrote in his diary: \\"I am going to be a writer,\\" and in the years to come he sat down every day after school to write song lyrics, poems and short stories. In these formative years Renberg also spent a lot of time at his home town theatre, Rogaland Theatre, a stage where he got to play in Torbj√∏rn Egners Hakkebakkeskogen, Bugsy Malone and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (where he played Willy Wonka). After Gosen high school Renberg attended the gymnasium Stavanger Cathedral School (Kongsg√•rd) in the town centre of Stavanger. Here he engaged both in the school theatre, Idun's Christmas Comedy (both as theatre director and actor in Shakespeare¬¥s A Midsummer Nights Dream), and the school paper, Lille Marius, where he worked as a critic of literature, film and music, and also submitted poems. At Kongsg√•rd Renberg met several radical and free-thinking characters who had a great impact on him, amongst them the (in)famous Norwegian Communist Aslak Sira Myhre. Whilst attending gymnasium, Renberg continued writing. In 1989 he submitted his first collection of poems to several Norwegian publishing houses, only to receive letters of refusal. This happened four times a year in the following years. After the gymnasium Renberg left to study in Bergen. As a young student of literature in the coastal town, he was deep into Marcel Proust. He wrote a term paper on the use of names in In Search of Lost Time. He also studied philosophy and was heavily into the works of Jacques Derrida and Hegel. In Bergen Renberg met his now long term friend and colleague, Karl Ove Knausg√•rd, as reported in Knausg√•rd's My Struggle. Together they would write, discuss, drink, go to gigs and work for the student radio and the student paper. They both shared the dreams and aspirations of becoming a writer, and developed a habit of reading each other's literature. Tore Renberg went on to become a literary critic, and he continued submitting manuscripts to several Norwegian publishing houses with no luck. Until 1995, when he was discovered by the influential editor Geir Gulliksen at Tiden Norsk Forlag. Literary career Renberg's first book Sleeping Tangle received critical acclaim by critic and author Linn Ullmann, and the book was awarded the Tarjei Vesaas First Book Award. In the years to come, Renberg struggled to find his own voice, and published experimental works, such as the grotesque novel Purification (1998) about a religious mass-murderer and the wildly speculative science fiction A Fine Time (2000); a novel about the future, supposedly written by one Tore Renberg in 1926. The literary breakthrough came when Renberg started relying on more familiar and for him, dangerous ‚Äì material. In 2003 he published the novel The Man Who Loved Yngve. It is a realistic novel set in Renbergs own hometown and has a main character attending Stavanger Cathedral School. The novel captures a specific time and sensibility, and the protagonist Jarl Klepp is now a household name in Norway. The book has sold 150 000 copies, it is translated into 7 languages and made into an award-winning film (The Man Who Loved Yngve, director: Stian Kritiansen). Since then Renberg went on to write four more books about Jarle Klepp, the most acclaimed of these being the highly autobiographical The Orheim Company, now a modern Norwegian classic, where the writer tackles the topic of his first poem from 1986 over the course of nearly 500 pages; his father's alcohol abuse. In 2011 came the book At Party With Literature, a collection of essays and lectures where Renberg explores the joys of being a reader, introducing some of his finest reading experiences: Honor√© de Balzac, Selma Lagerl√∂f and Halld√≥r Laxness. Autumn 2013 saw a significant turn in Renberg's career as a writer: the epic neo-noir See You Tomorrow, applauded by critics calling it \\"a masterpiece\\", \\"a tour de force\\", \\"a thriller with empathy\\". Tore Renberg has written several award-winning books for children.

Tonnage is also the basis for calculating registration fees and port dues. One of the Convention's goals was to ensure that the new units \\"did not differ too greatly\\" from the traditional GRT and NRT units. Both NT and GT are obtained by measuring ship's volume and then applying a mathematical formula. Net tonnage is based on \\"the moulded volume of all cargo spaces of the ship\\" while gross tonnage is based on \\"the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship\\". In addition, a ship's net tonnage is constrained to be no less than 30% of her gross tonnage. Calculation =Choice of draft value= The net tonnage calculation is based on a number of factors, one of which is the moulded draft d. The choice of the value to use for d can be complicated. For ships subject to the International Convention on Load Lines, the Summer Load Line draft is used, with the exception of cases where that is a timber load line. For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision load line assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a load line by its national government, the draft for that summer load line is used. If the ship has no load line, instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the moulded depth amidships. =12 or fewer passengers= The Net tonnage calculation is defined in Regulation 4 of Annex 1 of The International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969. It is based on three main variables: * Vc, the total volume of the ship's cargo spaces in cubic meters (m¬≥), * d, the ship's moulded draft amidships in meters, and * D, the ship's moulded depth amidships in metres The first step in calculating NT is to find the value known as K2, a multiplier based on Vc. It is obtained by using the following formula: K_2 = 0.2 + 0.02 \\\\times \\\\log_{10}(V_c) And then these three values are used to calculate NT using this formula: NT = K_2 \\\\times V_c \\\\times (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 Where the factor (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 will not exceed 1, the term K_2 \\\\times V_c \\\\times (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 will not be less than 0.25 GT, and the final value of NT shall not be taken as less than 0.30 GT. =13 or more passengers= When calculating NT for ships certified to carry 13 or more passengers, an additional term is used in the NT formula. It is based on three additional variables: * GT, the ship's gross tonnage, * N1, number of passengers in cabins with not more than 8 berths, and * N2, number of other passengers, First, a multiplier K3, based on the ship's gross tonnage is found, K_3 = \\\\frac{1.25 \\\\times ( GT + 10000 )}{10000} Then the net tonnage is calculated: NT = K_2 \\\\times V_c \\\\times (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 + K_3 \\\\times ( N_1 + \\\\frac {N_2}{10} ) Where the factor (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 shall not be taken as greater than unity, the term K_2 \\\\times V_c \\\\times (\\\\tfrac {4d}{3D})^2 will not be less than 0.25 GT, and the final value of NT shall not be taken as less than 0.30 GT. The difference between the cases of 12 of fewer passengers and 13 or more passengers is due to a restriction given in the net tonnage definition that states \\"...when N1 \\\\+ N2 is less than 13, N1 and N2 shall be taken as zero.\\" Usage In the United States, net tonnage is used to determine eligibility for registering boats with the federal government. Vessels with net tonnage of five or more are eligible for federal registration and not required to display state registration numbers. Most vessels longer than have net tonnage of five or more.

December 1928 Adolph Saurer AG was a Swiss manufacturer of embroidery and textile machines, trucks and buses under the Saurer and Berna (beginning in 1929) brand names. Based in Arbon, Switzerland, the firm was active between 1903 and 1982. Their vehicles were widely used across mainland Europe, particularly in the interwar period. History Car-Alpin in 1930 In 1853 Franz Saurer (1806‚Äì1882) from Veringenstadt, Germany established an iron foundry for household goods near the Swiss town of Sankt Gallen. Eastern Switzerland was a center for both embroidery and embroidery machine development. About 1850 Franz Rittmeyer built the first practical, satin stitch embroidery machine. It was known as the handstickmaschine, or hand machine. Several Swiss companies began building and improving hand machines. The machine's heyday lasted from roughly 1865 until the end of the century. Two of Franz Saurer's sons ‚Äì Anton and Adolf were aware of this invention, saw an opportunity, and began building hand machine's in their father's foundry about 1869. By 1873 F. Saurer & S√∂hne was the leader among the Swiss competitors in terms of sales and total machines built. By 1883 Saurer's production peaked at 796 machines per year. They had produced a total of 5,530 machines to date. Saxony Germany was also a center for embroidery and machine development. By the 1890s, German companies were Saurer's strongest competition. By the late 1870s a new, faster type of machine was invented. The (bobbin) shuttle, or schiffli machine adapted the lock stitch from the sewing machine. A German company added a Jacquard punch card reader, and thus fully automated the process. Competition motivated engineers at Saurer to develop their own Jacquard card reader, improve the stitch rate, and increase the machine's width, i.e. total number of needles and throughput. In 1905 Saurer matched the competing machine's width at ten meters. In 1913 they increased the width to 15 meters. The embroidery industry experienced many ups and downs due to fashion, trade policies and world wars. Saurer diversified into petrol and diesel engines, and then trucks to reduce its exposure to this volatility. However, Saurer continued to innovate and is still a leader in schiffli embroidery machines. In 1896 the eldest surviving son Adolph Saurer (1841‚Äì1920) took over the company. He and his son Hippolyt (1878‚Äì1936) developed the enterprise as a joint-stock company. Hippolyt Saurer initiated the production of a phaeton body automobile run by a one-cylinder opposed-piston engine. In 1902 a first four-cylinder T-head engine model with touring car and sedan chassis was built. From 1903 onwards Saurer concentrated on the production of commercial vehicles which soon gained a good reputation. The company ran subsidiary companies in Austria (1906‚Äì1959, in the end taken over by Steyr-Daimler-Puch), France (1910‚Äì1956, taken over by Unic), the United Kingdom (1927‚Äì1931, taken over by Armstrong Whitworth as Armstrong- Saurer), and in Germany (1915‚Äì1918, taken over by MAN). In Italy, the Officine Meccaniche (OM) manufacturer was for many years licensee of Saurer engines and other mechanical units, which they used in their own ranges of trucks and buses. In Poland the state-owned Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady In≈ºynieryjne produced license-built Saurer engines (powering, among others, the 7TP and 9TP tanks) and coach chassis used in the Zawrat bus. In the United States, the Saurer Motor Truck Company, headed by C.P. Coleman, had the rights to manufacture and sell heavy trucks under the Saurer brand name at its plant in Plainfield, New Jersey (which commenced operations in November 1911). On September 23, 1911 the Saurer Motor Truck Company merged with the Mack Brothers Motor Car Company of Allentown, Pennsylvania, headed by J. M. Mack, to form the International Motor Truck Company (IMTC).\\"Motor Truck Merger\\". The New York Times 23 September 1911. p.15. Retrieved 2008-06-16. IMTC would continue to make and sell trucks using the Saurer name until 1918. In 1922 IMTC would become Mack Trucks, Inc. Saurer trucks were developed along the years into four basic ranges: *A-type (1918) *B-type (1926) *C-type (1934) *D-type (1959) It was the B-type that established Saurer's international reputation as a builder of long-lasting trucks. In 1929 Saurer acquired its Swiss rival, Motorwagenfabrik Berna AG of Olten, but the Berna name was allowed to continue, badging the very same Saurer models. From 1932 on, trolleybuses were a very significant segment of Saurer production. Typically Saurer, or Berna, trolleybuses featured Brown, Boveri & Cie or Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Ateliers de S√©cheron (SAAS) electric equipment and Carrosserie Hess bodies. Saurer trolleybuses operated in most of Central Europe countries, and still do in several of them. In World War 2 a restructured type BT 4500 and 5 BHw of Saurer trucks were used to gas people in the Nazi Che≈Çmno extermination camp. Extermination vans were adapted, when they went in for repair, to carry the optimum number of people who could be gassed in the time it took to drive them from Chelmno to the woods where they were disposed of in ovens. There was concern about the strain on the front axle if too many people were loaded to be gassed, but as piles of bodies were always closest to the doors there was no strain on the front axle.Nazi Gas VansHidden camera interview: \\"Gustav Laabs and Letter Becker\\" (outtakes from Shoah, 1978‚Äì1981). Claude Lanzmann Shoah Collection, Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive, United States Holocaust Mmemorial Museum, Washington, D.C. Retrieved 2014-12-05. In 1951 Saurer and its Italian licensee, OM, reached an agreement by which Saurer would market in Switzerland OM's light and medium-weight trucks and buses, using Saurer-OM and Berna-OM badges. This was successful and lasted until Saurer closure. NAW Declining sales in the early 1980s saw the two leading Swiss truck makers, Saurer and FBW (Franz Brozincevic & Cie of Wetzikon, Switzerland), forming a joint organization called Nutzfahrzeuggesellschaft Arbon & Wetzikon, proceeding with motorbus and trolleybus production under the NAW brand, while the last Saurer- badged truck sold in the open market was delivered in 1983. Four years later, in 1987, a model 10DM supplied to the Swiss Army meant the very last Saurer truck produced in history. In 1982 Daimler-Benz had acquired a major shareholding in NAW and soon took full control; and in a short time dropped Saurer, Berna and FBW brands, while using NAW premises to assemble heavy haulage versions of Mercedes-Benz trucks. Eventually NAW went into liquidation in early 2003. Last remain of the Saurer automotive activity in Arbon is the present FPT Industrial S.p.A engine research center, that up to 1990 had been the Saurer Motorenforschung Research & Development Centre. The textile and automotive spin-offs In 1995, Ernst Thomke, reputed Swiss Manager, took over the leadership of Saurer AG in Arbon as Chairman of the Board. To restructure this conglomerate, he had previously abandoned his position with its then major shareholder: BB Industrie Holding AG (22%). The previous major shareholder, Tito Tettamanti, of the conglomerate, founded in 1853, specialized in textile machinery and \\"propulsion technology\\", had acquired the main competitor in each field, Schlafhorst, with a large manufacturing capacity excess, and Ghidela. Thomke led actively Saurer AG until 1996, when he retired to the direction of the Board until 1999. In his years he promulgated transparency at all levels, flexible working hours, optimized the production and refined accounting systems. In 1996, the group Saurer AG went back into financial results showing profits. More than half of the revenues originating from Schlafhorst, upon its positive restructuring.

In the late 1970s the F006 design from Saurer in Arbon, Switzerland was intended as a successor to the Jeep for the Swiss Army. In addition, it was hoped that the vehicle would also be purchased by fire departments as well as become work vehicles for community structures, such as road maintenance operations, forest rangers, electric and water utilities, etc. Selling to private users (like the Mercedes G) was not addressed, but it would have been likely. The reason was that Monteverdi, the luxury car manufacturer, had put on display at the Geneva Motor Show 1979 the civilian version of the Saurer F006 Military vehicle which they called the 260Z. This was the 230th based on the Military design. The 260Z was not produced, however they created three prototypes, which are listed in the Monteverdi Museum in Binningen. While Monteverdi did not use the Saurer chassis they did produce two versions of a luxury SUV vehicle called the Safari/Sahara based on the International Harvester Scout vehicle lending credence to the idea that had the F006 been in production, a civilian version would have emerged. Technology: It is the Saurer F006 turned into an off-road passenger vehicle with four-wheel drive. The concept was adopted by the automaker Monteverdi, improved by Berna engineering company of Olten, Switzerland. Saurer took over the production. The axles are from IHC Scout (Jeep I scout from International Harvester). The vehicle had a plastic body made of polyester. For power the drive-train was a 6-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo with an automatic transmission. Maximum speed was 100 km/h. Overall styling contrasted to the Mercedes G and Puch 230GE joint venture vehicle with the front turn signals mounted conventionally on the front of the vehicle (and not on the hood). The equipment installed in the front bumper parking lights can be turned by flicking the \\"Tarnlicht\\" switch (a multipurpose military switch for light dimming). The basic vehicle has a fixed open back cab. The loading / passenger seats are closed with a fast mountable / demountable plastic sheet at the rear including a military holder for a gas canister; a fixed structure is provided for use in case of fire. Saurer in 1980 introduced the F006 and in 1982 it was tested by the War Technical Department of the Swiss Army which appreciated the off-road capability. However, the Puch 230GE was procured instead. Failure to secure the army production order meant that production of the vehicle for other potential users was not economically viable. In the end only the 24 prototypes were built, one of which remained in service until 1988, and was subsequently donated to the Saurer oldtimer club; the other remaining vehicles are privately owned. Saurer F007: Simultaneously with the Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was introduced in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006, however, unlike the F006 it does not have the cab behind the engine, but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three windshield wiper blades instead of two, four headlights instead of two, and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same headlamp shell. The gasoline tank filler neck is on the left side immediately behind the driver's door, and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area, passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet, including two plastic windows on each side. Again, this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement, starting from 1982, SUV's in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here, too, the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007, but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007's are now privately owned.

The algorithm  The algorithm assumes that each process has a Unique Identification (UID) and that the processes can arrange themselves in a unidirectional ring with a communication channel going from each process to the clockwise neighbour. The two part algorithm can be described as follows: # Initially each process in the ring is marked as non-participant. # A process that notices a lack of leader starts an election. It creates an election message containing its UID. It then sends this message clockwise to its neighbour. # Every time a process sends or forwards an election message, the process also marks itself as a participant. # When a process receives an election message it compares the UID in the message with its own UID. ## If the UID in the election message is larger, the process unconditionally forwards the election message in a clockwise direction. ## If the UID in the election message is smaller, and the process is not yet a participant, the process replaces the UID in the message with its own UID, sends the updated election message in a clockwise direction. ## If the UID in the election message is smaller, and the process is already a participant (i.e., the process has already sent out an election message with a UID at least as large as its own UID), the process discards the election message. ## If the UID in the incoming election message is the same as the UID of the process, that process starts acting as the leader. When a process starts acting as the leader, it begins the second stage of the algorithm. # The leader process marks itself as non-participant and sends an elected message to its neighbour announcing its election and UID. # When a process receives an elected message, it marks itself as non-participant, records the elected UID, and forwards the elected message unchanged. # When the elected message reaches the newly elected leader, the leader discards that message, and the election is over. Assuming there are no failures this algorithm will finish. The algorithm works for any number of processes N, and does not require any process to know how many processes are in the ring.  Properties  The algorithm respects safety: a process will receive an elected message with its own UID only if his UID is greater than others', and only when all processes agree on the same UID. The algorithm also respects liveness. \\"Participant\\" and \\"not participant\\" states are used so that when multiple processes start an election at roughly the same time, only a single winner will be announced. When there's a single process starting the election, the algorithm requires 3N-1 sequential messages, in the worst case. Worst case is when the process starting the election is the immediate following to the one with greatest UID: it takes N-1 messages for the election message to reach it, then N messages for it to get back its own UID, then other N messages to send everyone in the ring the elected message. This algorithm is not very fault tolerant. Fault tolerance can be increased If every process knows the whole topology, by introducing ACK messages and skipping faulty nodes on sending messages.

Originally the area was known as Stoke and by 1086 was owned by William de Falaise following the Norman Conquest. He had recently married Geva, daughter of Serlo de Burci, and widow of Martin \\"de Wallis\\". Early in the 12th century, William and Geva's daughter, Emma, was betrothed to William de Courcy, and the couple received the manor of Stoke upon their wedding. The manor was renamed Stoke Courcy, and is now known as Stogursey. To preserve the Falaise family's association with Normandy the priory was donated as a cell to the Benedictine Abbey of St Mary at Lonlay. Within a few years, a group of monks were living in Stogursey and had built their own Priory around 1100‚Äì1107, which was known as \\"The Priory of St. Andrews in Stogursey\\". The descendants of Emma and William took their name from the village, and became known as de Gursey, de Curci, or de Courcy. The most well-known member of the family was John de Courcy, who made himself virtual Prince of Ulster after conquering it in 1177. He captured the Counties of Antrim and Down. Around 1183‚Äì84, he granted to the Priory of St. Andrews in Stogursey \\"Ten Caracutes of land and all its appurtances in the Country of Lart or The Ardes\\". In 1204 the Benedictine Priory was built and was called \\"The Priory of St. Andrews of the Ards\\". Over the years this Priory became better known as Blackabbey on account of the colour of the clothes worn by the monks. The abbey dwindled over the years and was repeatedly taken into the king's hands, at one time let to one of the burgesses, Johannes Bakeler (the town's MP). It was appropriated by the crown around 1440 and Henry VI presented the endowments of Stogursey to \\"the College of the Blessed Mary of Eton beside Windsor\\" (Eton College) which he had founded a few years earlier. Church of St. Andrew Today virtually nothing remains of the abbey, apart from the Church of St Andrew, which also served the village, and the dovecote. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The site may overlie an earlier Saxon establishment, and is one of the largest in West Somerset. The church retains elements of the Norman architecture (notably the tower and transepts), and the original apsidal ends to the transepts and chancels. The thatched, circular medieval dovecote was rebuilt in 1925 apart from the steps.

The southern entrance to Raphael Park is on Main Road, formerly called Hare Street, and the northern entrance is just south of the A12 Eastern Avenue. The western boundary of the park follows the line of Black's Brook, a small stream that is dammed where the park meets Main Road to form a lake 12‚Äì20 ft deep. The park itself is part of the parkland that once surrounded Gidea Hall. Raphael Park contains two ancient Pedunculate Oaks recorded by the Woodland Trust.The Woodland Trust  Recording  Tree details The park is named after Sir Herbert Raphael MP, who gave it to Romford Urban District in 1904.Mills, A., Dictionary of London Place Names, (2001), Oxford In addition to the lake, which is used for fishing, there are several amenities provided within the park. In the southern part of the park is a bandstand, and then near the end of the lake is a rockery which is used by the Romford Summer Theatre. Beyond this point the park widens to the east, and there are sports pitches (football in winter and cricket in summer) and sunken tennis courts. To the north of the tennis courts is a children's play area. This was remodelled in 2009. Apart from these the park consists of parkland, mature woodland and grassland.

The command copies computer files from one directory to another. Overview Generally, the command copies files from one location to another. It is used to make copies of existing files, but can also be used to combine (concatenate) multiple files into target files. The destination defaults to the current working directory. If multiple source files are indicated, the destination must be a directory, or an error will result. The command can copy in text mode or binary mode; in text mode, \`copy\` will stop when it reaches the EOF character; in binary mode, the files will be concatenated in their entirety, ignoring EOF characters. Files may be copied to devices. For example, \`copy file con\` outputs file to the screen console. Devices themselves may be copied to a destination file, for example, \`copy con file\` takes the text typed into the console and puts it into FILE, stopping when EOF (Ctrl+Z) is typed. Implementations The command is available in DEC RT-11, OS/8,\\"Concise Command Language\\" (CCL). RSX-11, Intel ISIS-II,ISIS II Users Guide iRMX 86, DEC TOPS-10, TOPS-20, OpenVMS, MetaComCo TRIPOS, Heath Company HDOS, Zilog Z80-RIO,Z80-RIO OPERATING SYSTEM USER'S MANUAL Microware OS-9, DOS, DR FlexOS, IBM/Toshiba 4690 OS, TSL PC-MOS, HP MPE/iX,MPE/iX Command Reference Manual IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows, Datalight ROM-DOS, ReactOS, SymbOS and DexOS. The \`copy\` command is supported by Tim Paterson's SCP 86-DOS. (59 pages) Under IBM PC DOS/MS-DOS it is available since version 1. A more advanced copy command is called \`xcopy\`. The equivalent Unix command is \`cp\`, the CP/M command is \`PIP\`. The command is analogous to the Stratus OpenVOS \`copy_file\` command. Example for DOS copy letter.txt [destination] Files may be copied to device files (e.g. \`copy letter.txt lpt1\` sends the file to the printer on lpt1. \`copy letter.txt con\` would output to stdout, like the \`type\` command. Note that \`copy page1.txt+page2.txt book.txt\` will concatenate the files and output them as \`book.txt\`. Which is just like the \`cat\` command). It can also copy files between different disk drives. There are two command-line switches to modify the behaviour when concatenating files: * Text mode - This copies the text content of the file, stopping when it reaches the EOF character. copy /a doc1.txt + doc2.txt doc3.txt copy /a *.txt doc3.txt * Binary mode - This concatenates files in their entirety, ignoring EOF characters. copy /b image1.jpg + image2.jpg image3.jpg See also * XCOPY in DOS, OS/2, Windows etc. * cp (Unix) * Peripheral Interchange Program References Further reading * * * External links * copy  Microsoft Docs * Open source COPY implementation that comes with MS-DOS v2.0 Category:Internal DOS commands Category:OS/2 commands Category:Windows commands Category:Microcomputer software Category:Microsoft free software Category:Windows administration Category:File copy utilities ","title":"Copy (command)"},{"id":"17306633","text":"Elizabeth Millicent Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland (n√©e Sutherland- Leveson-Gower; 30 March 1921 ‚Äì 9 December 2019https://www.northern- times.co.uk/news/countess-of-sutherland-dies-187901/) was a Scottish noblewoman.

It is native to southern Greece, southern Turkey and neighboring islands and is prized for its variable leaf forms, which include some of the most striking of any cyclamen. Distribution Cyclamen graecum is native to a wide variety of areas up to elevation in southern mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Aegean Islands, Crete, the southern coast of Turkey, and northern Cyprus. Description At Osaka Prefectural Flower Garden, Osaka, Japan The tuber is corky, with thick, strong, fleshy anchor roots sprouting from the center of the bottom. Leaves are heart-shaped and toothed. Flowers bloom in autumn and have 5 petals, white or pink with a darker blotch at the nose. They are often fragrant. The bases of the petals are curled outwards into auricles, like Cyclamen hederifolium. After pollination, the flower stem coils both directions, starting from the center, not from the top as in Cyclamen hederifolium.

On 30 May 2008, the Tampere District Court sentenced Lehto to two years and five months imprisonment. Lehto was charged with nine counts of gross defamation, inciting ethnic hatred and religious blasphemy against Islam. The defamations included sexual slander towards the victims, claiming the victims to be guilty of fabricated crimes and writing disturbing material as if they were written by the victims (Identity theft). Some blog entries were also inciting violence against the victims. Over 40 blog sites were closed by the court's decision.

The squadron, also known as the ‚ÄúBombing Banshees‚Äù, fought in World War II in the Pacific Theater as part of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. They were deactivated shortly after the end of the war. History Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 244 was organized and commissioned as VMSB-242 at Midway Atoll on March 1, 1942. While at Midway they were responsible for defensive patrolling, escort missions, and tactical flight training. They remained on Midway until 11 April 1942 when they sailed aboard the USS William Ward Burrows (AP-6) headed for Hawaii. They remained at Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Oahu until 20 April when the entire squadron again set sail this time for the west coast of the United States. The squadron arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara, California on June 14, 1942 and became part of Marine Aircraft Group 24. On 14 September 1942 the squadron was redesignated as VMSB-244. In October of that year they changed out their Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers for the new Curtiss SB2C-4 Helldiver. During the early part of January 1943, the squadron was assigned to overseas duty and left San Diego on 7 January 1943 for Midway Atoll. After staging through Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii for a little more than a month VMSB-244 disembarked at Midway on 20 March 1943 where they maintained the same duties as a year earlier. On 18 August 1943 the squadron departed Midway for the Hawaiian Islands where it was then split; both echelons arrived in Espiritu Santo in October where a brief training program and simulated attacks against shipping and airfields soon make them ready for combat. During this training period the squadron insignia and appropriate nickname, the \\"Bombing Banshees\\" was originated. Banshee was the USAAF's name for the SBD Dauntless and the title of an ancient Scottish and Irish spirit whose wailing foretold the coming of terror, death and destruction. In May 1945, as the campaign on Mindanao wound down, the squadron replaced its Douglas SBD Dauntless aircraft with the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and shortly thereafter VMSB-244 became the only squadron of MAG-24 to remain active.

Rakkojae Seoul was the first hanok hotel to be listed in the first edition of the Michelin Seoul guide in 2017.

Construction of the school began in the early 1960s, the predecessing Pool Hayes Farm was levelled and a nearby pool plus Pool Hayes Colliery were filled in to make way for progress. Patricks Lane was renamed 'Pool Hayes Lane' and was redeveloped in 1965. The school itself was opened in 1964 around the same time as construction of the surrounding areas (including housing), was still in progress. The first head teacher was Harold Chamings (who died in December 2005), the second was Mr Ian Lancaster, third was Peter Mitchell. Fourth was Jim Clarke who retired in December 2013. Matthew Allman replaced Jim Clarke and served until July 2016. Luke Baker who left in 2018. The headteacher now is Miss Harris. During 2006 the school came under partial redevelopment. The original 40-years old wooden windows were removed and replaced by new PVC framed windows. The I.T block was also redeveloped along with the tennis court, plus automatic doors replaced the original 60's wooden ones in the reception area. The maths section was altered as part of the redevelopment, with the two original doors either side being bricked over and replaced with a main door, which faces the grassy area. New signposts and other changes were also added. In September 2006, Pool Hayes was designated a Specialist Status as an Arts College which brought a big increase in resources to support exciting developments in Drama, Music Technology and Creative Technology in school. This Specialist Status also carries with it the challenge of raising standards in those subjects throughout the school. Previously administered by Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, in February 2016 Pool Hayes Arts and Community School was converted to academy status, and was renamed Pool Hayes Academy. The school is now part of the Academy Transformation Trust, but continues to coordinate with Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council for admissions.

According to the medieval Life of St ModwennaBritish Library Cotton Cleopatra A.ii she was an Irish noblewoman by birth and founded the abbey on an island in the River Trent. Modwenna spent seven years at the abbey with two other Irish nuns called Lazar and Althea, before the three embarked on a pilgrimage to Rome. Upon their return to England they built a church at Stapenhill in honour of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Modwenna is reported to have performed many holy miracles at Burton Abbey, and to this day the well on the site is said to have healing properties. After a time Modwenna left Burton-upon-Trent and travelled to Scotland where she died in Langfortin, near Dundee, reportedly at the age of 130. Her body was returned to Burton-upon- Trent for burial. Another abbess and saint, Osyth (died 700), was raised under Modwenna's direction. Others, however, say that she has been confused with St Monenna (Moninne) of Ireland and with a Scottish saint also called Modwenna, and that the Anglo-Norman text of her life has little historical value. This may be how she comes to be associated with Alfred the Great, whom she is said to have known, even though he lived in the 9th century, some two hundred years later. St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent is dedicated to her as is the chapel at Pillaton Hall.

This sermon, An Oration, Upon the Beauties of Liberty, Or the Essential Rights of the Americans, was reprinted seven times in four different cities, making it the sixth most-popular pre-independence pamphlet in British America.Unfortunately, this does not tell us anything about the size or volume of a particular printing. See Thomas R. Adams, American Independence: The Growth of an Idea (Providence, RI: Brown University Press, 1965), 69-70. This table was taken from G. Jack Gravlee and James R. Irvine, eds. Pamphlets and the American Revolution: Rhetoric, Politics, Literature, and the Popular Press (Delmar, NY: Scholars‚Äô Facsimiles & Reprints, 1976), viii. Old World Troubles In 1764, at age 23, John Allen was ordained and installed as the pastor of the Particular Baptist Church in Petticoat Lane, near Spitalfields, London.Prior to this he had served as a preacher and writer. He may have preached in Salisbury and wrote The Spiritual Magazine: or the Christian‚Äôs Grand Treasure. See Edward C. Starr, ed., A Baptist Bibliography: Being a register of printed material by and about Baptists; including works written against the Baptists Section A (Philadelphia, PA: The Judson Press, 1947), 63. Like most Baptist ministers, Allen had to earn his livelihood through secular work. He opened a linen-drapers shop in Shoreditch. When his business failed, Allen's debt grew, and he spent some time incarcerated at the King's Bench Prison. When the Petticoat Lane congregation dismissed him he briefly found a new pastorate at Broadstairs, near Newcastle. But in 1767 he was dismissed by the Broadstairs congregation, and in 1768 he returned to London as a schoolteacher.The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography dated his death between 1783-88. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) electronic source citation . The exact nature of the behavior that accounted for his dismissal by the Broadstairs congregation remains unknown. By January 1769 he was again in financial trouble, and he was tried at the Old Bailey for forging a ¬£50 note.Allen found the note in the street. A simple handwriting sample cleared him of the charge of forgery. But the fact that he tried to cash it in did not reflect well on his character. Although he was acquitted, this trial destroyed his reputation, and its stigma followed him to Boston.Kneeland and Davis, the publishers of Oration in Boston, tried to help salvage the reputation of their very successful pamphleteer by publishing the entire 20 page transcript of his trial in 1773. See Early American Imprints. First Series; no 13047. New World Success In 1770, Allen published The Spirit of Liberty.Allen was a high Calvinist with supralapsarian leanings. He was considered to be slightly unorthodox in some of his views; the Canons of Dordt (1618-19) adopted the infralapsarian order. While praising John Wesley as a gentleman, scholar, and historian, Allen questioned his Christian faith in The Spirit of Liberty. Allen showed little regard for the rising Arminianism of his day. Already showing his radical political views and his sympathies for the developing American cause, this pamphlet argued for the return of John Wilkes to Parliament and defended the rights of the individual.\\"John Wilkes‚Äôs career was crucial to the colonists‚Äô understanding of what was happening to them; his fate, the colonists came to believe, was intimately involved with their own.\\" Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1967), 110-112. Bailyn cited Pauline Maier, \\"John Wilkes and American Disillusionment with Britain,\\" William and Mary Quarterly 3rd Series 20 (1963): 373-395 for a detailed discussion. Footnote 16.

Norton & Company, 1993), 216. Most chroniclers believe that he left London for New York in 1771 though Allen did not re- appear in the historical record until 1772. At that time John Davis, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Boston had left his post due to failing health, so the congregation was searching for a new teaching elder.Church historian Albert Henry Newman stated that Davis was driven out of Boston by harsh treatment in the press for his active role in the Baptist Association‚Äôs resistance to ecclesiastical taxes and certificates. Albert Henry Newman, A History of the Baptist Churches in the United States (New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1915), 352. He left for Philadelphia in August 1772 in failing health and died the following February at age 36. It appears that Allen was preaching at Second Baptist before Davis died in Philadelphia. Reta A. Gilbert cited Bumsted and Clark as her only source for the fact that Davis died at his post in Boston. Bumsted and Clark, \\"New England‚Äôs Tom Paine,\\" p. 564. Davis was among a group of Baptist leaders who were planning to appeal to the British Crown for relief from unjust taxation, not from Parliament, but from the Massachusetts authorities. Isaac Backus, A History of New England with Particular Reference to the Baptists (New York: Arno Press & The New York Times, 1969), 176. Boston‚Äôs patriots did not want Baptists bringing their grievances about Massachusetts‚Äôs ecclesiastical taxation before the Crown in 1773. The intervention of George III on behalf of Ashfield, Massachusetts‚Äôs Baptists is in Frederick G. Howes, History of the Town of Ashfield (Ashfield, MA: 191-?), 63-86. They could not be taxed \\"for the maintenance of another society which they do not belong unto.\\" P. 86. Davis knew of Allen and made it clear before he died that he wanted Allen to preach at Second Baptist.Allen praised Davis‚Äôs work on behalf of imprisoned Baptists in New England in The American Alarm The church committee knew something of Allen's reputation in England and so was reluctant to invite him to speak.The Sons of Liberty were more interested in Allen than the Baptists. Some suspected Allen had sympathy for the much-despised Sandemanian sect because of comments he made in The Spirit of Liberty. For more on the Sandemanians see Williston Walker, \\"The Sandemanians of New England,\\" Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the year 1901 Vol. I (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1902), 133-162.

Early Death As stated above, Allen was not well-connected with other colonial patriots and we do not hear from him again. Some argue that he continued to publish pamphlets into the 1780s; most sources placed his death at age 33 in 1774.

The battle, with the concomitant battle for the adjoining peak of Tololing, culminated in Indian forces capturing Tiger Hill. Battle Tiger Hill was held by elements of the Pakistan Army's Northern Light Infantry. In late May 1999, the 8th Battalion, Sikh Regiment (8 Sikh) had attempted an assault on Tiger Hill, but were repulsed by heavy small arms fire. Poorly coordinated further assaults initiated without adequate artillery support failed under fire from an entrenched enemy. Unable to press the attack, the soldiers dug in and surrounded the hill. 192 Mountain Brigade assumed command of the operations on Tiger Hill in late June. The 18th Battalion, The Grenadiers (18 Grenadiers), fresh from participating in the victory at Tololing, were then assigned to 192 Mountain Brigade. The final assault on Tiger Hill began on 3 July at 17:15. 22 batteries from the Regiment of Artillery, including multi-barrelled rocket launchers, pounded enemy positions on the peak for 13 continuous hours, providing covering fire for the infantry advancing up the mountain. The 2nd Battalion, Naga Regiment (2 Naga) advanced on the right flank and 8 Sikh advanced on the left. They used unexpected, and therefore difficult, avenues of approach, maintaining the element of surprise. 200 men from Alpha and Charlie Companies of 18 Grenadiers, along with the battalion's Ghatak platoon, advanced up the rear side of the mountain, a 1,000-foot vertical cliff which the grenadiers climbed up in 12 hours using fixed ropes, in the freezing rain. They almost made it to the top before the Pakistanis atop the peak spotted them and opened heavy fire, stalling their attack. Sensing the loss of initiative, Maj. Ravinder Singh of 8 Sikh launched a daring attack. He and a detachment of 200 soldiers climbed up the side of the adjoining Western Ridge, splitting the Pakistani defense on the night of 5 July. The group held off several counterattacks. Most of the Sikh soldiers attacked without cold weather gear, and many of the wounded died from exposure.

Sydney Burleigh sits at right. Sydney Richmond Burleigh (July 7, 1853 ‚Äì February 25, 1931) was an American artist, known primarily for his watercolors but also for his oil paintings, drawings, illustrations, and building and furniture designs. Biography He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island, a descendant of the Pilgrim William Bradford. In 1875, he married Sarah Drew Wilkinson (1851‚Äì1952) and, with her encouragement and wealth, became a full-time artist. He studied in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens from 1876 to 1880 and then returned to Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Burleigh rose to national prominence after receiving a bronze medal at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 and an open prize from the Buffalo Society of Artists in 1913. He exhibited regularly at the Boston Art Club as well as the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Newport Art Museum. He also worked as an illustrator and collaborated with writer William Henry Frost on several children‚Äôs books. He was a painter in the realist style, consistent with the academic style of his teacher, Laurens. Mabel Ducasse, an art critic for the Providence Journal, wrote of Burleigh‚Äôs art that \\"there is a quality in his work which suggests that of the masters of the Renaissance when they chose to employ line and wash. It is character ‚Äî born of perfect certainty of touch and flowing freedom of line. It is seldom achieved by modern watercolorists, who most often mistake the function of their medium, which is that of drawing rather than painting.\\" Burleigh designed the Fleur-de-lys Studios. A man of versatile creativity, Burleigh designed the Fleur-de-lys Studios in Providence in collaboration with the architect Edmund Russell Willson of Stone, Carpenter, and Willson. Built in 1885 in conjunction with the Art Workers Guild, the building was to be used for art studios, including Burleigh‚Äôs own. It is an important monument to the American Arts and Crafts Movement and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. It is now owned by the Providence Art Club. Another of his studios was a unique and eccentric little building known as the \\"Peggotty.\\" Burleigh built it over the hull of a small sailboat that had been used as a ferry between Little Compton and Middletown, Rhode Island. It featured a thatched roof, and today it is on display at the Little Compton Historical Society. Burleigh was a leading member of the art community in Rhode Island. He was a founder of the Providence Art Club in 1880 and was the first president of the Providence Watercolor Club. He had a long association with the Rhode Island School of Design, serving on the board of directors (1887‚Äì1893), as a teacher (1897‚Äì1906), and as a trustee (1919‚Äì1931). He received an honorary degree from Brown University in 1912. His works are held in several private and public collections, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the museums at Brown University, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Rhode Island Historical Society, and the Little Compton Historical Society.

It is the only secondary school on the island, and is located beside Lamlash Primary School. The school has a roll of around 250 pupils, about 50 teachers, 16 prefects, 2 School Captains and 2 vice captains. At the beginning of 2008, a new school building was opened, replacing an older building which dated from the late 1930s. The current head teacher is Barry Smith. Depute Head Teachers are: Mrs Suzie Dick and Mrs Susan Foster. Principal Teacher of Guidance is Jane Macbeth. History Before the school, pupils from the island would need to travel to and board at a school on the Isle of Bute. The original Arran High School building was completed in 1939 but the building was taken over for use as a hospital in World War II . It only became a school in 1946 and was used as both a primary and secondary school. At this time the school was known as Lamlash Junior Secondary. In 2019 many members of the staff team (e.g teachers of geography, maths, english, computing science, religious and moral education, graphical design, design and manufacture, physics, etc) left which likely lead to many of the recent criticisms about pupils' timetables being supposedly rushed and/or incorrect which, according to some students, led to several students being removed from certain subjects which many had chosen based on their preliminary results. Many parents and pupils are rather unhappy with this and have pointed out that, despite the school supportive and inclusive nature, they are \\"kicking out the idiots\\".https://ibb.co/87J6Q0Q In addition to this, many pupils were offered business studies but were later told that it would not be available at the school despite previous promises. A promise which was also made and failed on in 2018.

An 1855 motion by Hanscom to designate Omaha City as the place for holding the first statehood convention in 1859 was lost by a vote of 15 to 19. A following motion by Milton W.

Convening in private, political leaders in the city could not decide which method to use to stop the vote. Hanscom proposed violence, and was taken seriously. The scheme led to a large-scale breakdown on the House floor, including a fight between almost all the members of the body. Hanscom led the events, with his ally Poppleton and others throwing fists and chairs and virtually demolishing the chambers. These events led to the illegal convening of several anti-Omaha legislators in the notorious Florence session, in which they called for a new government to rule on the proceedings.

Life  Houbraken portrayal of the Commemoration of King Mausolus by Queen Artemisia. Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus (1703) Houbraken was sent first to learn threadtwisting (Twyndraat) from Johannes de Haan, who introduced him to engraving. After two years he then studied art with Willem van Drielenburch, who he was with during the rampjaar, the year 1672. He then studied 9 months with Jacobus Leveck and finally, four years with Samuel van Hoogstraten. In 1685 he married Sara Sasbout, and around 1709 he moved from Dordrecht to Amsterdam. Arnold Houbraken painted mythological and religious paintings, portraits and landscapes. He is best known for the art historical work The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters (1718‚Äì1721). When he died his son Jacob assisted his mother with the last proofs of the manuscript before publishing. His first attempt at an instructive manual for artists was his Emblem book, Inhoud van 't Sieraad der Afbeelding, which was meant as a guide of possible painting themes. His registered pupils were Matthijs Balen, Johan Graham, and his son Jacob.Arnold Houbraken in the RKD  Family  Houbraken had ten children. His son Jacobus Houbraken (1698‚Äì1780) was an engraver of portraits and book illustrations, including books by his father. His daughter Antonina Houbraken also became an engraver for an Amsterdam publisher, and is known today for her embellishment of cityscapes and buildings with animals and people. His daughter Christina Houbraken was also an artist. Legacy Arnold Houbraken's books sold quite well during the entire 18th century. Jacob Campo Weyerman published his updated version (1729‚Äì47) in serial form that was published as a complete set in 1769. Houbraken's engravings of the artists are in some cases the only surviving portraits of these people. The first to make a published sequel to Houbraken's work was Johan van Gool in 1750‚Äì51. Though these books published well, with changing fashions, during the course of the 19th century Houbraken fell out of favor with art historians, especially when his sketches were found wanting, incorrect, or even slanderous. Houbraken was very careful to check and double check his sources, and today many of his personal judgements still stand up to our modern scrutiny. Attacks of his judgement due to the spelling of artist's names or accusations that he was nationalistic and deemed all of these artists as \\"Netherlandish\\" must be dismissed on the grounds that the various borders between the Netherlands, Germany, and Flanders were far from decided in the period during which he was writing, and spelling conventions in the Netherlands regarding names were only introduced by Napoleonic decree in the 1790s. Excepting those cases where the artist died quite young, or whose oeuvre was lost during various wars, very few artists were included in the Schouburg who do not hang in international museums today. The first modern art historian to publish an update of his work was Adriaan van der Willigen, in 1866. Since then he has remained a valuable resource for art historians.

He was an officer commanding a company under BGEN George Rogers Clark (1777‚Äì1782). He was the founder of Ruddell's Station, or fort, on the Licking River in present-day Harrison County, Kentucky. In 1780, during the Revolutionary War, the settlement was destroyed by joint British Canadian and Eastern Woodlands Indian forces under British officer Captain Henry Bird. He and his family were held prisoner in Detroit for over two years before their release. He was also a brother-in-law to Kentucky pioneers Isaac, Joseph and John Jacob Bowman. His grandson, John M. Ruddell, was a prominent Kentucky statesman and landowner. Biography Born in Nottingham, Pennsylvania his family moved to Virginia in the early 1740s. Ruddell became a captain in the Washington County militia; 6 March 1797 in Shenandoah Co, VA he married Elizabeth Bowman. In 1774 or 1775, he accompanied the Bowmans to Kentucky and while living in Boonesborough, Ruddell joined his brother-in-law John Bowman who was en route to Harrodsburg with two Virginia militia companies. Ruddell would later replace John Dunkin as one of Bowman's officers.Hammon, Neal O. and Richard Taylor. Virginia's Western War. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, 2002. (pg. 62) He also served under General George Rogers Clark during the Illinois campaign, in charge of the Corn Island party and of the military stores left there. For his service, he was awarded of Clark's Grant in the Indiana Territory.Hayden, William. Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778‚Äì1783. Indianapolis: Bowen-Merrill Company, 1896. (pg. 142-143) In the Spring of 1779, he established a fortified settlement on the South fork of the Licking River known as Ruddell's Station (or Fort Liberty) in Harrison County one mile (1.6 km) from present-day Lair Station. The fort was built on the site of Hinkson's Station which was previously abandoned several years before.Kleber, John E. The Kentucky Encyclopedia. Louisville: University Press of Kentucky, 1992. (pg. 107-108) Along with Martin's Station, located on Stoner Creek near present-day Paris, the settlement became home to a large number of Pennsylvania German families over the next year. During the American Revolutionary War however, an Indian (including Shawnee) raiding party of 600 - 900 led by British officer Captain Henry Bird and 150 British soldiers left twenty+ settlers dead. Isaac Ruddell was captain of the fort, and was in command of the militiamen present. When the British brought out artillery to knock down the walls to enable the Indians to massacre the defending families, he decided it was better to surrender.Mahan, Russell, \\"The Kentucky Kidnappings and Death March: The Revolutionary War at Ruddell's Fort and Martin's Station,\\" West Haven Utah: Historical Enterprises, 2020, pp. 49-68. The approx. 470 survivors, along with he and his wife (and captives from Martin's Station), were force marched to Detroit where they remained prisoners until the end of the war.Randall, Emilius O. and Daniel J. Ryan. History of Ohio: The Rise and Progress of an American State. Vol. II. New York: Century History Company, 1912. (pg. 280) During the march to Detroit, Ruddell was separated from his wife and children. Shortly after arriving in Detroit, Ruddell protested to the commandant of Bird disregarding his agreement of safe passage in exchange for their surrender. He was reunited with his wife and two daughters, however his two sons were turned over to the Shawnee who were eventually adopted by the tribe. Stephen Ruddell, 12 years old at the time of the attack, was accepted into the family of Chief Blackfish and eventually became the adopted brother of Tecumseh. The younger son, Abraham Ruddell, when repatriated from the Indians, by the War Department in 1794 could barely speak English and later settled in Arkansas.Tucker, Glenn. Tecumseh: A Vision of Glory. New York: Cosimo, Inc., 2005. (pg. 39-40) Film: (1967)\\"The Last Frontiersman\\" Shortly after their arrival in Detroit, Ruddell and his family were allowed to live on a nearby island where they grew corn and supplied food for their fellow prisoners. He also reportedly helped several men to escape from the camp. He and several other prisoners were allowed to return to Virginia in 1782. Soon after arriving, however, Ruddell was accused by several of his fellow prisoners of collaborating with the British and was charged with treason in Frederick County but was acquitted.Dicken-Garcia, Hazel. To Western Woods: The Breckinridge Family Moves to Kentucky in 1793. Rutherford, New Jersey: Fairleigh Dickinson Press, 1991. (pg. 84-85) His friendship with the commandant is thought to have been based on Byrd's poor treatment of Ruddle's party as well as both men belonging to the Masonic fraternity. Ruddell gave a written account of the attack which began appearing in newspapers in late 1783. Returning to Bourbon County in 1784, they built a home at the head of the Licking River four years later. He also built a grist mill on the northside of Hinkston Bridge and, in 1795, a sawmill which was operated by his son Abram. The town is still in existence, known today as Ruddell's Mills. He also donated land to the Stoner Mouth Church and cemetery.Wells, Dianne; Melba Porter Hay and Thomas H. Appleton, ed. Roadside History: A Guide to Kentucky Highway Markers. Frankfort: Kentucky Historical Society, 2002. (pg. 162) He died in January 1812. In 2008, the Ruddle's and Martin's Stations Historic Association dedicated a new monument for Captain Ruddell.

It opened in 1909 as the \\"Benjamin Church Home for Aged Men\\" as stipulated by Benjamin Church's will. Beginning in 1934, during the Great Depression, it admitted women. The house was closed in 1968 and became a National Register of Historic Places listing in 1971. The non-profit Benjamin Church Senior Center was incorporated in June 1972 and opened on September 1, 1972. It continues to operate as a senior center.  Benjamin Church  Benjamin Church was born on February 20, 1842, to Elizabeth Luther and Samuel Church, a wealthy grain and flour merchant. Benjamin was raised with his 12 siblings on Mount Hope Farm and the old family farm on Poppasquash. His two brothers built houses in the Poppasquash Farms Historic District. In 1900, Benjamin Church drafted a will to provide for the construction of a home for elderly men. It opened in 1909 as the \\"Benjamin Church Home for Aged Men\\".  Design  The Benjamin Church House is a two-story clapboarded Colonial Revival topped with a hipped roof that has four pedimented dormers. Constructed between 1908 and 1909 from designs by Clarke, Howe & Homer, architects, the building cost $21,000. The front of the house faces west towards Hope Street and is and has an ell on the rear side that measures . The front facade has a symmetrical five bay facade with the main entrance in the center, the door has sidelights and a semi- elliptical fanlight. The front windows are typical 20th-century windows with six-over-one sash and have splayed wooden lintels and those on the first floor have raised center keystones. Projecting out from the hipped roof are two dormers with shingled sides. The front facade has a one-story porch that runs the length of the face with a half-hipped roof. The porch is supported by six Doric columns that frame the bays and has a wooden frieze with a triglyph above each column. The porch has a simple wooden rail that runs the length of the porch and down the front and side steps, the newel posts are capped by small wooden urns. The corners of the main part of the house have wooden quoins. In the southeast corner of the building is an internal porch covered by a quarter-hipped roof. The rear roof is are two pedimented dormers, one on each side of the ell's roof and the third chimney which rises through the roof of the main building. The house has a stone foundation, which extends to a full story due to the sloping land and has a doorway in the rear. The porch is supported by brick piers. The interior of the house is designed around a central hall with a narrow stairway with turned balusters and newel that goes to the third floor. On both sides of the hall are two large front reception rooms, each and having tall ceilings. The rear of the south front room is the former dining room that is connected by a pantry to the kitchen in the ell. Two small rooms are located beyond the northern reception room. The second floor maintains the central hall and extends into the ell, but is bisected by a lateral hallway. Each \\"quadrant\\" housed two rooms for the residents with additional rooms in the ell and the third floor has four additional bedrooms with the dormer windows. The third floor of the ell was used as attic storage space. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the alterations that had been made to the house were described as \\"minor and inconspicuous, consisting mainly of alterations to windows and dormers to provide egress to necessary fire-escapes.\\" The porch is believed to be a part of the original design, but it was noted that if it was a later addition it would likely have been done before 1920. In 1969, the clapboarded outbuilding to the southeast was torn down to construct newer housing for the elderly.  Service  The Benjamin Church House was ready to open on March 15, 1909 and served as elderly housing for only aged men. In 1934, during the Great Depression, the board of trustees decided to admit women to the house. Samuel P. Colt would bequeath $25,000 to the home upon his death in 1921. The house was closed from 1968 until 1973 and vandalized during the period, but was also submitted and approved to the National Register of Historic Places. Sometime in 1972, the National Park Service approved a grant of $5,000 to refurbish the house. In June 1972, \\"[t]he Benjamin Church Senior Center was incorporated as a non-profit organization that was housed in [t]he Benjamin Church Home\\" and opened for occupancy on September 1, 1972. According to the Benjamin Church Senior Center, the house is used as a senior center and is run by volunteers and board members.  Importance  The Benjamin Church House is historically significant as a \\"very pure example\\" of the Colonial Revival style by noted local architects Clarke, Howe & Homer. The house also serves as an important asset to the Bristol environment as an elderly home, noted during its vacancy at the time of its nomination. The nomination states \\"[i]t is because of the environmental and architectural importance of this house and its significance in the greater context of the Bristol-Warren historic districts that it is thought to be worthy of National Register status and protection.\\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 22, 1971.

Its first inhabitants settled in the region during an obscure period of the Neolithic, coming from continental Europe. These were likely Celts, owing to the many prehistoric dolmens and shelters that were used as shelter. The tributaries of the Paiva and Varosa Rivers wind through the plateaus, providing irrigated fertile lands that could be used to support the early clans. While the Romans came to occupy the valleys and floodplains, the Lusitanians continued to occupy the high-grounds and defended their territory. Alman√ßor's Moorish forces eventually crossed the same territory after destroying the castle of Moimenta da Beira, around the 9th century. The Goths from Asturias eventually retook and repopulated the region, which was vaguely populated, reorganizing and forming an administrative territory (municipality) that included the villages of Peva, Ariz and Soutosa.

It was operated from 1932 until 1956. It was initially a civil airfield, and became a Royal Air Force station known as RAF Gravesend during the Second World War, when it was under the control of RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain. It was the first RAF station to operate the North American Mustang III. The airport returned to civilian use at the conclusion of the Second World War, although it remained under the ownership of the Air Ministry until its closure in 1956. It is notable that a decision had to be made in 1954, by the Air Ministry, as to whether this civil airport should be retained and substantially enlarged, or the extensions east of Thong Lane be released for residential development. Kent County Council had made it clear that the land west of Thong Lane, was identified as a Civil Airport. Additionally, Kent County Council also informed the Air Ministry, that it would neither support nor oppose enlargement, acknowledging, however, that it would as a result of any such enlargement, the site becoming designated as a fully operational international airport. Civil operation The airport was operated by Gravesend Aviation Ltd served Gravesend and has a significant place in the history of British aviation. From 1933 to 1936 it was home to Percival Aircraft, building the famous Mew Gull racing aircraft among others, before the company moved to Luton. After 1936 Essex Aero was based on the site, and maintained the airfield's link with racing aeroplanes by preparing the de Havilland DH.88 Comets and Alex Henshaw's Percival Mew Gull that set the record for a flight from England to South Africa. The airfield received Customs facilities in December 1933 and many European airlines made use of Gravesend as a diversionary airport when Croydon was fogged-in. These airlines included Imperial Airways, KLM, Sabena and Deutsche Luft Hansa. Royal Air Force The Royal Air Force moved into Gravesend in 1937 when a Flying Training School began operating de Havilland Tiger Moths and Hawker Harts at the airfield. In 1942, the RAF greatly enlarged the airfield, which included major extensions to both runways - albeit still formed of grass. Throughout the Second World War, Essex Aero continued to manufacture aircraft parts at the site. Accommodation for personnel was provided nearby at Ashenbank Wood. The company also drew up major plans for the airfield, including concreting the runways (the longest one being just over 5600 ft after the RAF extensions), a new terminal and cargo centre west of the Thong Lane side and their aircraft parts main plant to the east of Thong Lane. When the RAF requisitioned the entire aerodrome in 1939 at the beginning of the war they made it a sector airfield for Biggin Hill, as one of the airfields of 11 Group. The first squadron to occupy Gravesend was 32 Squadron, arriving on 3 January 1940 with its Hawker Hurricane fighters, being replaced by 610 Squadron on 27 May. These were followed by another Auxiliary Squadron, 604, which operated Bristol Blenheims as night fighters from 3 July. 501 and 66 Squadrons also flew from here during the 1940 Battle of Britain, arriving on 25 July and 10 September respectively. Many other units also occupied the station during the war years, such as 71 Squadron, which arrived 14 August 1942 for the Dieppe Raid, 92 Squadron (24 September 1941). No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron, arriving 11 August 1943 and 65 Squadron, which arrived 29 July 1943, and was the first Squadron to be issued with the North American Mustang III in December - making Gravesend the first RAF base to operate it. Accommodation was split between Cobham Hall (officers mess), the control tower (some pilots), and the 'Laughing Waters' restaurant (groundcrews), while aircraft were dispersed around the perimeter. Air defence was supplied by the army, and the airfield was attacked only a few times - on 2 September 1940 two soldiers were killed when a pair of bombs were dropped, and on the 4th an attack was mounted by a force of Heinkel He 111s, but was aborted. Two more attacks came, but neither managed to hit the airfield itself. The airfield was extended later in the war to accommodate three squadrons of American fighters, and it was also used as an emergency runway for bomber aircraft returning from sorties over the continent. After the war, Gravesend Aerodrome largely returned to civilian use, with the RAF finally leaving in 1956, whereupon Gravesend airfield became a housing estate. All that there is to see now is a plaque in a local sports centre listing the names of fifteen pilots killed in action whilst flying from this small field. =Squadrons= The first squadron to occupy Gravesend was 32 Squadron, arriving on 3 January 1940 with its Hawker Hurricane fighters, being replaced by 610 Squadron on 27 May.

All that there is to see now is a plaque in a local sports centre listing the names of fifteen pilots killed in action whilst flying from this small field. Approval for civilian use After the war, the then Gravesend Municipal Council gave planning permission to Essex Aero to take over the airport, but with severe (and unworkable) conditions. The main conditions were that the RAF extensions must be ripped up, thereby reducing the airport size by 40%; that the two runway lengths cut back to just 3000 ft; and finally, provisions that a school and associated housing should be built on parts of the airfield. Under those circumstances, Essex Aero did not continue with its scheme. Site today The airfield site today has become a housing estate called Riverview Park; little can be identified of the original use. Leander Drive & Vigilant Way were built quite a distance in-field from the former perimeter track, which ran east‚Äìwest, almost where Astra Drive now runs to the southern edge of Riverview Park. To the west and north, it followed a line almost where the existing boundary of Riverview Park Estate now stands and to the east, it ran almost adjacent to Thong Lane. The main entrance to the airport, leading to the control tower & hangars was roughly where the existing mini-roundabout in Thong Lane now is. On the eastern side of Thong Lane, where the leisure centre & golf club now occupy the site was the eastern wartime extension to the airfield. The peri track ran east from Thong Lane from a point roughly opposite Vigilant Way to the south, extended towards Shorne for about half a mile, before looping northwards and then north-east towards what is now the Leisure Centre, before finally crossing Thong Lane to link up with the peri track on the west of Thong Lane roughly where Leander Drive now is situated. The current approach road to the leisure centre does follow the line of the peri track. \\"Cascades\\" Leisure Centre in Thong Lane has a plaque dedicated to the airmen of World War II who served at Gravesend Airport. The Control Tower from the Airport was located across the road from the grounds. The Stand By Set House (Emergency Generator Building) stands in the field immediately to the north of Cascades surrounded by two modern-day barns whilst there is a small piece of the tarmac outer perimeter-track left in the fields behind Astra Drive. But this has fallen into disrepair. These are all that remain of the entire airfield. In addition, two buildings in Stacey Close off Valley Drive (The Stork at Rest Pub and the building opposite) housed the airfield's sick quarters.

This resembles the similar pattern of the Tingidae of the infraorder Cimicomorpha, and was initially taken to signify a close relationship. It is due to convergent evolution however. They feed on plant sap, mostly of Chenopodiaceae and Caryophyllaceae. Piesma linnavouri have been found on Acacia (Fabaceae). Mcateella have been found on many host plants but mostly Acacia and Proteaceae. The host plants of Miespa remain unknown. Taxonomy Three subfamilies and eleven genera belong to the family Piesmatidae: =Piesmatinae= * Afropiesma * ‚Ä† Eopiesma * ‚Ä† Heissiana * Mcateella * Miespa * Parapiesma * Piesma =Psamminae= * Psammium * Saxicoris * Sympeplus ;Thaicorniae *Thaicoris Many species were formerly in the type genus Piesma, from which the subgenera Afropiesma and Parapiesma were split off into separate genera. The genus Thaicoris was for some time placed in this family, but it has more recently been suggested that it is a member of the Thaumastocoridae. There are two fossil genera. Eopiesma from the earliest Eocene (about 55 mya) is still a very basal member of the family. Heissiana, found in Baltic amber from the Eocene might be a northern relative of Mcateella and Miespa but given its distribution it might more comfortably be considered closely related to the ancestor of Eopiesma. From 2007-2009 Cretopiesma was placed within the family. Cretopiesma was found in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar and lived about 100 mya (million years ago) and was initially considered to be a promitive piesmatid but this has since been rejected. The closest relatives of the Piesmatidae remain rather insufficiently determined. After the ash-grey leaf bugs were recognized as Pentatomomorpha, they were most often placed in the Lygaeoidea based on cladistic analysis, with their relatives variously presumed to be the Berytidae, Colobathristidae and Malcidae, or the peculiar, beetle-like Psamminae, a subfamily of the Lygaeidae. For some time, the Psamminae were even included in the Piesmatidae. Alternatively, the ash-grey leaf bugs were considered Pentatomomorpha incertae sedis or placed in a monotypic superfamily Piesmatoidea with the discovery of Cretopiesma. However a cladistic analysis rejected Cretopiesma from Piesmatidae and placed the genus in the family Aradidae.

He built the base of the economy cars in Japan through the development of the Corolla and the Toyota Publica. Early years Tatsuo Hasegawa was born in Tottori, Tottori Prefecture on February 8, 1916. After majoring in aerodynamics as a self-supporting student, he graduated from the Section of Aeronautics of the Faculty of Engineering at the Tokyo Imperial University in 1939. Tachikawa Ki-94 After graduating, Hasegawa joined Tachikawa Aircraft Corporation and was involved in the development of the Tachikawa Ki-94 in 1943 as the chief designer. This high-altitude interceptor aircraft was designed to intercept American B-29 bombers, and proposed to the Imperial Japanese Army. Although one aircraft was completed in August 1945, World War II ended before the aircraft ever conducted its first flight. Before the start of development of the Ki-94, Hasegawa had designed an airfoil based on his theory, and published a paper in the scholarly journal of the Japan Society for Aeronautical Sciences (now The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences) in March, 1942. He named it \\"TH airfoil theory\\" after his name (Tatsuo Hasegawa). Hasegawa used the \\"TH airfoil\\" on the Ki-94. Hasegawa's theoretical airfoil was very similar to the Supercritical airfoil theory that NASA would later develop in the 1960s. For this reason, when NASA lodged the patent application for their airfoil in Japan in 1979, their patent was not admitted to the agency. Toyota Hasegawa lost his job after the end of World War II because Japan was prohibited to manufacture aircraft under orders of the General Headquarters (GHQ) of General Douglas MacArthur. However, in 1946, Hasegawa was employed by Toyota which was recruiting engineers at that time. After he joined Toyota, Hasegawa was involved in the development of the Toyopet Crown as the sub-chief (fuku-Shusa) of development under his chief (Shusa), Kenya Nakamura. During the development for the Crown, the Shusa (product manager) style of organization was introduced for the first time. It is believed that this system was developed from the Chief designer system of fighter development used during World War II. The first generation of the Toyota Corolla. Hasegawa later led the development of the first generation models of the Toyota Publica, Sports 800, Corolla, Celica and Carina, as the chief (Shusa). He also was involved in the Toyopet SKB truck, the precursor of the Toyota Dyna He was promoted to the general manager of the product planning office and senior director, and retired from the automobile industry in 1982. After Toyota Hasegawa was a senior consultant to DuPont, Delaware, between 1982 and 1988, where he advised them on their marketing strategy aimed at the automobile industry. The \\"Detroit Development Center\\" may be one of his contributions. After his work for DuPont, Hasegawa returned to Japan and concentrated on gardening with roses and cattleyas. On November 15, 2004, he was elected as one of 2004 inductees in the Japan Automotive Hall of Fame for the application of aerodynamic theory to automobile design, and for mainstream product planning and management in corporate environment. On April 29, 2008, Tatsuo Hasegawa died at the age of 92 in Yokohama, Kanagawa.

It is bordered by 16th Street on the north, Pennsylvania Street on the west, Interstate I-65 on the south, and Bellefontaine Street on the east. The Monon Trail runs along the eastern edge of The Frank and Judy O'Bannon Old Northside Soccer Park. Old Northside was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is home to many residences from the Victorian era. History Old Northside was a prominent residential neighborhood in the late 19th century, when many of Indianapolis' wealthier residents built mansions in the area. Old Northside was home to Benjamin Harrison (23rd President of the United States), Ovid Butler (founder of Butler University) and other notable figures, including magnates of the L.S. Ayres department store. Indiana author Meredith Nicholson was also a resident for many years and wrote his most noted work House of a Thousand Candles while in residence. Old Northside was also the original location of Indianapolis' Butler University, then named North Western Christian University, which was later relocated to the town of Irvington. The neighborhood began a slow decline in the early 1910s as architectural tastes changed and families built homes further north in Indianapolis. Over several decades, homes were demolished and others fell into disrepair. In the late 1960s, residents began restoring remaining buildings of architectural significance, and petitioned the city for historic recognition. Old Northside received historic designation in late 1978 after adopting a historic plan for preserving the architecture and history of the neighborhood. Preservation of the neighborhood's history is overseen by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission. As part of the Indianapolis Bicentennial in 2020, Indiana Landmarks funded a self-guided, on-line walking tour of the neighborhood. Residences and museums The President Benjamin Harrison Home and the Morris-Butler House, both on the National Register of Historic Places, are located in Old Northside and are open to the public for tours and special events. In 2010-2011, the former Central Avenue Methodist Church, later known as the Old Centrum, underwent a multimillion-dollar major restoration as a performance venue and statewide headquarters of Indiana Landmarks and is now known as the Indiana Landmarks Center. The former home of Thomas Taggart is now the national headquarters of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Parks There are three parks related to Old Northside, all created with funding from the Old Northside Foundation. Great Oak Commons is a park created by the neighborhood from several empty lots and is landscaped as a Victorian walking park with a central fountain, gas lighting, a gazebo and a sensory garden filled with fragrant perennial flowers. Shawn Grove Park is a children's park with play equipment. The Frank and Judy O'Bannon Soccer Park was created by the city of Indianapolis on the east edge of the neighborhood, with the help of Old Northside Foundation. It is now maintained by Indy Parks. It was reclaimed from abandoned space near the former Monon train tracks and is used by several children's summer soccer leagues. Neighborhood organizations The Old Northside Neighborhood Association was created in 1979, and has been active in preserving the historic architecture of the neighborhood and providing cultural and social activities for the neighborhood. The Old Northside Neighborhood Foundation was created in 1990 to raise funds for neighborhood projects, including funding for the neighborhood parks and conversion of street lights to historically appropriate designs.

Early life and education Willcocks was born in Baraut, Meerut District, United Provinces, India, the son of an officer in the East India Company's army. He was educated in England and passed out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in January 1878 (having only got in on the third attempt), being commissioned into the 100th Foot in the Punjab. Military career as a company and field officer In late 1879, shortly after being promoted lieutenant, Willcocks persuaded his superiors to send him to the Second Afghan War (although his regiment was not engaged there), where he served as a transport officer. In 1881 he again served as a transport officer in the Mahsud Waziri expedition, rejoining his regiment the following year. In 1884 he was seconded to the newly formed Army Transport Department and posted to Assam. He was promoted captain in what was by now the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment in August 1884. He served in the Sudan in 1885‚Äì1886 and then returned to Assam before serving in Burma in 1886, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In December 1887 he was offered a permanent transfer to the Commissariat and Transport Department, but declined in favour of the adjutantcy of the 1st Battalion of his regiment. In 1889 Willcocks served as an intelligence officer in the Chin- Lushai expedition and in 1891 in the Manipur expedition. In June 1897 he was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the Baluchistan field force, and in November 1897 second-in-command of the new West African Frontier Force as a temporary lieutenant-colonel, under the command of Frederick Lugard. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1899 New Year Honours. In November 1899 he was promoted substantive lieutenant- colonel (having received his brevet in May 1898). Colonel Lugard became High Commissioner following the proclamation of the new Protectorate of Northern Nigeria on 1 January 1900, and Willcocks succeeded him as colonel-commandant of the Frontier Force, being granted the local rank of colonel on the same day. For his relief of Kumasi during the Ashanti War of 1900, Willcocks was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) and promoted to brevet colonel. Military career as a general officer General Sir James Willcocks and his personal staff in July 1915 2/4 Bn East Yorkshire Regiment and General Sir James Willcocks in Hamilton, Bermuda in 1917 In early January 1902, Willcocks received orders to go to South Africa, and issued a statement to say how welcome he found this order, as he had never before been unemployed. He was graded as a colonel on the staff while employed on special service in South Africa. After serving only a couple of weeks in the late stages of the Second Boer War, Willcocks was transferred to India in late February, to assume command of the Belgaum district. He was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel on 29 March 1902, on the day he took up command with the temporary rank of brigadier-general while so employed. He was promoted major-general and given a brigade in 1906, commanded the Bazar Valley Field Force against the Zakka Khel clan of the Afridi in February and March 1908, was given command a division in March 1908 and promoted lieutenant- general for distinguished service in the field following his command of the Mohmand Field Force in July 1908. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1907 Birthday Honours. In October 1910 he was appointed to the command of the Northern Army. In the 1913 New Year Honours he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI). He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1914. In 1914 Willcocks was given command of the Indian Corps in France. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1915 Birthday Honours, and was promoted general in May 1915, but resigned in September 1915 after friction with Sir Douglas Haig, who commanded the First Army. Willcocks was given the colonelcy of The Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) from 1916 until his death. Governor of Bermuda, retirement and death In May 1917 Willcocks was appointed Governor and military Commander in Chief of Bermuda (where a large Bermuda Garrison protected the Royal Naval Dockyard and other strategic assets), a post in which he served until 1922. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1921 Birthday Honours. He later returned to India and died at Bharatpur in 1926.

The Spacecraft were provided by NASA and the European Space Agency, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center oversaw the manufacture, integration and test of the NASA-provided TIROS satellites. The first polar-orbiting weather satellite launched as part of the POES constellation was the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS), which was launched on April 1, 1960. The final spacecraft, NOAA-19, was launched in February 2009. The ESA-provided MetOp satellite operated by EUMETSAT utilize POES-heritage instruments for the purpose of data continuity. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), which was launched on November 18, 2017, is the successor to the POES Program. On-orbit satellite operations of POES is performed by NOAA's Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO).  Daily global coverage  Notational local equatorial crossing times, showing POES (and other) satellites. Each POES satellite completes roughly 14.1 orbits per day. Since the number of orbits per day is not an integer, the ground tracks do not repeat on a daily basis. The systems includes both morning and afternoon satellites which provide global coverage four times daily.  Applications  Data from the POES support a broad range of environmental monitoring applications including weather analysis and forecasting, climate research and prediction, global sea surface temperature measurements, atmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics research, volcanic eruption monitoring, forest fire detection, global vegetation analysis, search and rescue, and many other applications. One of the key instruments of the current POES MetOp-B system is the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/4). HIRS/4 senses within 20 channels ranging from visible bands to long wave infrared (0.69-14.96 micron wavelengths), to sense variation of temperature, humidity, and pressures within the atmosphere. The data collected from HIRS/4 is collaboratively used with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Instrument (AMSU) to advance research in sea surface temperatures, cloud coverage analysis, ozone concentrations throughout the atmosphere and earth's radiance.  SARSAT  POES has been used by the Search and Rescue community since 1982. COSPAS- SARSAT is the international humanitarian Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System that is responsible for alerting and locating information to search and rescue authorities. COSPAS-SARSAT satellites detect 406 MHz distress signals at all times from nearly any place on the globe. Each 406 MHz beacon has a unique fifteen digit identification (ID) code embedded within its signal which allows rescuers to have an identification of the party in distress before they head out on the rescue. There is no charge for this service provided in conjunction with NOAA and SARSAT.

It has offices in China, India, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United States, and it publishes between 35 and 50 major studies each year. History The IBM Institute for Business Value grew out of earlier research programs at IBM that were part of the firm‚Äôs management consulting organization. These predecessors included the IBM Institute for Knowledge Management (IKM) and the IBM e-business Innovation Institute (ebII). The IKM, founded in 1999, was a membership consortium of private and public organizations that conducted research on the managerial and organizational aspects of knowledge management. The ebII was formed in 2000 with a small group of IBM consultants doing research into the impact of current and future technologies on business issues across a wide range of industries. In August 2001, IBM acquired Mainspring, a small strategy consulting firm headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in October combined its research capabilities with the IKM and ebII to create the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV). From its early years the IBV focused on topics relevant to senior executives. It began publishing studies on business trends and management issues in such core industries as banking, automotive, and telecommunications. Most of the studies were global in scope, although a few focused on issues specific to a region, such as Western Europe or North America. Additionally, the IBV began to conduct research concerning cross- industry issues, such as customer relationship management (CRM). In 2002, IBM acquired PriceWaterhouseCoopers Consulting (PwCC), the consulting arm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, thereby increasing IBM‚Äôs consulting population by some 30,000 employees and augmenting its expertise in the business issues of over a dozen industries and key functions, such as financial management, and supply chain management. The IBV became part of the merged consulting organization, now known as IBM Global Business Services (GBS). The inclusion of PwCC into IBM led to important changes in the IBV. First, the number of full-time consultants working at the IBV grew from about 35 in 2002 to about 55 by 2008 and with the addition of specialized groups in Japan, India and China to about 80 in 2011. Second, many came in with a combination of advanced academic research degrees and consulting experience. Third, the staff became more international, although two main offices were established: one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the other in Amsterdam. Studies were now organized more expansively by industry and management function (e.g., finance, HR). One type of study brought over from PwCC was the ‚Äúfuture agenda‚Äù that explored the economic and business trends affecting an industry over a 5 to 10-year period. Within several years, the IBV had published nearly a dozen of such studies. The staff also published books dealing with such issues as knowledge management, the electronics industry, and the role of IT in myriad American industries. Key Activities The IBV continues to conduct primary research, publish white papers, present research findings at industry conferences, and write bylined articles for trade and business publications. Global activities continue to expand through IBV satellite programs in China, Japan, India and South Africa. A high-profile collaboration, begun in 2001, with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) produces a ranking of scores of nations in their use of IT, called the E-Readiness Ranking. Published annually in the spring, by 2008 it was the longest-running review of economic, political, social and technological issues affecting countries around the world The IBV also has continued and broadened a series of CxO studies originated by PwCC. The CxO studies conduct extensive (often involving over 1,000 participants from across the world and from a wide range of sectors) in-office surveys and interviews with senior executives around the globe ‚Äì CEOs, Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) and Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs), ‚Äì publishing the results every two years for CEOs and CIOs in May and every four years for CFOs, CHROs, CSCOs and CMOs in October.

From Winter Haven, Dantzler served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1982 to 1990, and in the Florida Senate from 1990 to 1998. He was Buddy MacKay's running mate in the 1998 Florida gubernatorial election; they lost to Jeb Bush and Frank Brogan. From 2014‚Äì2017, Dantzler was President Obama's appointed Florida State Executive Director of the Farm Service Agency. Born into a family of politicians, Dantzler is a lawyer and writer. With his wife Julie (), Dantzler has two adult daughters. A member of the Florida Bar since 1983, Dantzler was specializing in agricultural law at the Victor Smith Law Group law firm . In July 2018, Dantzler was hired as chief operating officer of the Lake Alfred, Florida-based Citrus Research and Development Foundation. Personal life Born on Fort Leonard Wood on January 2 or 6, 1956, Dantzler was raised in Winter Haven, Florida as a third-generation Floridian. His father was mayor of Winter Haven while Dantzler was a child, an office to which his younger brother Brad was appointed in January 2016. Another brother‚ÄîTodd Dantzler‚Äîhas served as a Polk County, Florida commissioner. Dantzler met Julie Pope in 1982 during his first run for the Florida House of Representatives. The daughter of water skier and Florida business leader Dick Pope Jr., Pope was described by the Sun-Sentinel as \\"a hometown girl, [and] the well-to-do granddaughter of the founder of Winter Haven's Cypress Gardens tourist attraction.\\" Dantzler and Pope wed in 1984. They had two children: older daughter Elizabeth (born ) and younger Margaret (born ). According to his Florida House of Representatives biography, Dantzler is a Presbyterian. Dantzler enjoys writing, having written articles for newspapers and magazines, as well as three historical fiction books. One of these, 2002's Under the Panther Moon, is a collection of short stories about Florida environmental issues. He joined the board of the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, and was the body's president . Dantzler stood at in 1998, and in a June 1998 public disclosure of his health records, he revealed his diagnoses of Gilbert's syndrome and post- nasal drip, and that he was otherwise in good health. Education At Winter Haven High School, Dantzler played quarterback on the school's American football team, and was the baseball team's \\"star shortstop\\". Dantzler attended both the University of Puget Sound and the University of Florida. He received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the latter in 1978, as well as his Juris Doctor in 1981. At the University of Florida, Dantzler was a member of Florida Blue Key and Alpha Tau Omega. Political career =Florida Legislature= House of Representatives When Dantzler returned to Winter Haven in 1981, rumour was that the local state representative, Democrat Bob Crawford, was considering a run for the Florida Senate, but because he would not publicly commit, it was stopping other Democrats from running for his House seat. Dantzler instead approached Crawford in the representative's office, and plainly asked the man about his intentions. When Crawford admitted his senatorial plans, Dantzler ran for the 43rd District seat and beat Republican Bill Siegel in the 1982 election with 11364 votes (60.1% thereof). For his 1984 run to retain his seat from the 43rd District, Dantzler ran unopposed in both the Democratic primary and the general election. Dantzler was elected to the same seat four times, serving from 1982‚Äì1990. Senate Dantzler in 1990 In 1990, Dantzler was elected to the Florida Senate seat from District 13, defeating Republican Ernie Caldwell with 51.1% of the vote. This vacancy was also Bob Crawford's doing, as the Democratic senator left his seat to run for Florida Commissioner of Agriculture. While in the Senate, Dantzler forged \\"landmark laws\\", and his proudest achievement was negotiating the Everglades Forever Act as chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. Fellow Senate Democrat Howard Forman told the Sun- Sentinel in 1998 that Dantzler was known for his success at bringing together senatorial combatants. Eighty-nine percent of Dantzler's senate votes were found to have aligned with the interests of the conservative Christian Coalition of America. Dantzler served in the Senate until resigning from representing District 17 on January 6, 1998. =Run for governor= In 1998, Dantzler began his campaign for the Florida governorship. Dick Pope Jr., his father-in-law, held Dantzler's official campaign announcement at Cypress Gardens, the botanical garden and amusement park founded by Dick Pope Sr. in 1936. Dantzler was a gubernatorial candidate in the Democratic Party's 1998 primary. When Dantzler resigned from the senate, he said it was to preempt campaign finance improprieties that could arise due to his influence in the March 3, 1998 legislative session. Fellow Democrat contender, Representative J. Keith Arnold, called this a smokescreen gesture that would allow Dantzler more time than his opponents to fundraise; while political historian Edmund Kallina said the move was probably equally calculated to grab headlines, it actually indicated Dantzler's fundraising weakness in the face of Florida Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay's superior capabilities. By May 30, 1998, Dantzler's polling numbers for the September primary were trailing behind those of Lieutenant Governor MacKay, the latter of whom had raised approximately (equivalent to about $M in ). Dantzler joined the campaign of Buddy MacKay (pictured) as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in June 1998. According to Florida Democratic Party insiders, it was late June when Dantzler‚Äîbehind in polls and suffering fundraising difficulties‚Äîapproached Lieutenant Governor MacKay about joining forces for the Democratic primary. Governor Lawton Chiles brokered the deal, and on June 30 in a downtown Tallahassee park, the two men announced a new joint ticket. Supporters of the new joint venture expected Dantzler would provide the aggressiveness, youth, and vitality that MacKay's campaign lacked in facing Jeb Bush. Meanwhile, Arnold said he would stay in the primary race, calling the MacKay‚ÄìDantzler ticket a political marriage that would not help either man's chances in the election. Despite the political endorsement of the Sun- Sentinel, MacKay and Dantzler ultimately lost the November 3, 1998 election to Jeb Bush and Frank Brogan. =Farm Service Agency= In 2013, then-president of the United States Barack Obama asked Dantzler to serve as the Florida State Executive Director of the Farm Service Agency (FSA). When initially approached, Dantzler later admitted ignorance of the position, but became more interested the more he learned. The agency's responsibilities included the United States Department of Agriculture's programs concerned with Florida's environment, minority farmer outreach, and agriculture emergency response; these issues' importance to Florida are what Dantzler said compelled him to accept the appointment and take over the office from the outgoing Debby Folsom. The 57-year-old lawyer accepted the president's appointment in 2013, and served from January 13, 2014 through President Obama's last three years in office. As the executive director's office was located in Gainesville, Florida, Dantzler's family stayed in Polk County, Florida while the new appointee moved to McIntosh, Florida: a town approximately from Gainesville. In his new position, Dantzler looked forward to working with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to combat citrus greening disease and to resolve labor issues. Soon after his appointment, Dantzler worked with US Congressional Representative Ted Yoho to soften or delay the effects the Agricultural Act of 2014 would have on Floridian peanut farmers who could not secure crop insurance due to the federal Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. =Further political activity= After his run for the lieutenant-governorship, Dantzler made an aborted run for Florida Commissioner of Agriculture. The Ledger said in 2013 that he dropped from the race partly because of the pay-to-play requirements of urban county political parties. In 2013, Dantzler spoke with The Ledger saying of politics, \\"I think about it every day. I miss it a lot.\\" Dissatisfied with the products of Tallahassee, Florida and Washington, D.C. politics, the former state senator had crafted an agenda in case he returned to politics. Dantzler invoked Lawton Chiles' 1990 gubernatorial campaign, where the former US senator won the election having fund-raised with \\"$10 and $100 donations. If I ever thought I could do that, man I'd be off and running.\\" Apolitical work Dantzler was admitted to The Florida Bar in 1983. Prior to accepting appointment to the FSA position, Dantzler led the Tampa/Winter Haven, Florida branch of Morgan & Morgan's Business Trial Group. As of May 2018, he worked for the Winter Haven law firm Victor Smith Law Group, specializing in agricultural law, representing property owners, mediation, environmental law, and general civil litigation. On July 24, 2018, Dantzler was hired by the Citrus Research and Development Foundation (CRDF)--an agency overseeing scientific research against citrus greening--as their new chief operating officer, a position carrying a annual salary. In this role, Dantzler was to administer the CRDF's July 2018June 2019 budget (equivalent to about $M in ), as well as educate Florida citrus growers about the CRDF. Dantzler was the CRDF board's second choice for the position after Elizabeth Stobierski withdrew from consideration. By February 2020, Dantzler was the CRDF's executive director.

History Glenvar High School was opened in 1966 by Roanoke County public schools. Most, if not all, of the student body would previously have attended Andrew Lewis High School in Salem. However, the student bodies of Glenvar and Andrew Lewis were consolidated into the new Salem High School for the 1977‚Äì1978 school year. The former high schools became junior high schools. Beginning with the 1982‚Äì1983 school year, the city of Salem established an independent school district and enrollment in Salem High School was limited to students from the city. Glenvar High School was reopened to serve western Roanoke County. The school housed grades 7 through 12 until a new building was constructed for Glenvar Middle School in 1996. Academics Glenvar High School is a comprehensive high school which includes grades 9‚Äì12 with a student enrollment of 650. The school offers courses in multiple academic disciplines including Advanced Placement and Dual Enrollment courses. Specialized vocational education is available at the Arnold R. Burton Technology Center in Salem. Pass rates for Virginia's Standards of Learning tests average over 90%, which makes the school fully accredited.

Built in 1909 for Matson Navigation Company as SS Wilhelmina, she sailed from the West Coast of the United States to Hawaii until 1917. After her war service, she was returned to Matson and resumed Pacific Ocean service. In the late 1930s she was laid up in San Francisco, California, until sold to a British shipping company in 1940. While a part of a convoy sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Liverpool, she was sunk by on 2 December 1940.  Early history  Dinner menu, 6 July 1911 Wilhelmina‚Äîa steel-hulled, single-screw, passenger and cargo steamer built at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. for the Matson Navigation Company‚Äîwas launched on 18 September 1909 and departed her builders' yard on 7 December of that year. Under the Matson flag, Wilhelmina conducted regular runs between San Francisco, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii, carrying passengers and cargo between 1910 and 1917. SS Wilhelmina is referenced in a book called From Job to Job Around the World, written by Alfred C.B. Fletcher. Gutenburg EBook #55336.  World War I  Inspected by the Navy at the 12th Naval District, San Francisco, on 18 June 1917‚Äîtwo months after the United States entered World War I‚Äîthe steamship was later taken over by the United States Shipping Board on 1 December. Soon afterwards she sailed for Chile where she obtained a cargo of nitrates. Delivering that cargo at Norfolk, Virginia., Wilhelmina shifted to New York on 23 January 1918. Given Identification Number 2168, the ship was then taken over by the Navy and apparently commissioned on 26 January. Lieutenant Commander Joe W. Jory, USNRF, is listed as being in command in February. Wilhelmina was diverted to \\"special duty\\" and made her first voyage to France soon afterwards, departing New York with a general cargo on 1 February and returning on 26 March. Upon her return, she shifted to the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, where she was taken in hand and converted to a troopship for service with the Cruiser and Transport Force. When her extant deck logs begin, her commanding officer is listed as Commander William T. Tarrant. On 10 May 1918, Wilhelmina sailed out of New York on the first of six wartime voyages to France and back prior to the 11 November 1918 armistice. During these passages, Wilhelmina carried 11,053 troops to France to strengthen the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). The transport's half-dozen trips were all made safely as far as she was concerned, although not totally without incident. While in convoy with six other troopships and four destroyers, Wilhelmina was present when the transport was torpedoed on 1 July 1918. Nearly a month later, on 30 July 1918, one of Wilhelmina‚Ä≤s lookouts spotted what he thought to be a submarine periscope at 07:30. Going to general quarters, the transport surged ahead and opened fire to drive the submarine away. A short while later, when the periscope reappeared, Wilhelmina again fired at it, with the shell falling 50 yards (46 meters) short. Two weeks later, while Wilhelmina and were steaming under the protection of the destroyer , the erstwhile Matson steamship again went to general quarters to drive away what looked like a submarine. Shortly after 20:00 on 14 August, while Wilhelmina‚Ä≤s crew and passengers were holding an abandon-ship drill, a lookout spotted what looked like a submarine periscope 200 yards (183 meters) from the ship and just forward of the port beam. The captain of the transport ordered her helm put over to starboard soon after the sighting, as the submarine moved away on an opposite course. The one-pounder on the port wing of the signal bridge barked out two shots, both missing. Three shots from the after port 6-inch (152-mm) gun followed, until their angle was masked by the ship's superstructure. The submarine, however, apparently frustrated, submerged. It may have remained in the area to try again, as on the following day, 15 August, a submarine periscope appeared some 200 yards (183 meters) away from the troopship, prompting three salvoes which drove the would-be attacker off. In company with seven other transports‚Äîincluding Wilhelmina‚Äîon 23 August, in a convoy escorted by the armored cruiser and the destroyers and Hull, Pastores spotted what she took to be a submarine periscope at about 09:50. Hull rang up full speed and reversed course; Huntington and Fairfax soon did likewise but found nothing. Later that day, however, the enemy apparently reappeared. Pastores‚Ä≤s commander sighted a periscope at 19:04; Hull sighted the same object five minutes later. The periscope appeared to be about 500 yards (457 meters) distant, three points (34 degrees) off Wilhelminas starboard bow, and running on a course to starboard of and nearly opposite to that of the convoy. Pastores went to battle stations and headed for the periscope. Wilhelmina, too, turned toward the enemy. With the 'scope in sight for about 10 seconds, the time allotted the gun crews of the American ships that spotted the enemy was short. Pastores got off one round of 4-inch (102-mm) at the swirling water where the object had disappeared. Frustrated by the submarine's going deep, Wilhelmina, unable to ram, turned aside to port. Hull, rushing to the scene, soon dropped three depth charges. USS Wilhelmina (ID-2168) in the Boston Navy Yard on 13 May 1919. Note the two cage masts of a battleship behind her. Three days later, on 26 August, Wilhelmina noticed a suspicious wake five degrees off her port bow, 2,500 yards (2,286 meters) away and passing from port to starboard. Going to general quarters, Wilhelmina fired a shot from one of her forward guns shortly before she loosed three shots in succession from the forward starboard 6-inch (152-mm) battery. Nine rounds came from the after battery on that side; and, as the ship swung, the superstructure masked the forward guns. The wake soon disappeared; both Pastores and the Italian transport also fired several rounds at what was possibly a submersible with no apparent success. Wilhelmina emerged from World War I unscathed, although near-missed by a torpedo on 1 September 1918. After the armistice, she continued her troop-carrying activities, bringing back part of the AEF from France. She conducted seven postwar, round-trip voyages, returning 11,577 men home to the United States including 2,610 sick and wounded. These postwar voyages were not made entirely without incident either. A fire broke out in a storeroom where blankets and pillows were kept, a little over six hours after the ship departed Bassens, France, standing down the Gironde River on 25 March 1919. The fire, reported at 21:52, was put out by 22:10 with only slight damage to the ship. Wilhelmina subsequently entered the Ambrose Channel on 4 April 1919 and docked at Pier 1, Hoboken, New Jersey, the following day. There, she disembarked the troops and patients carried back from France. She began her last voyage shortly afterwards, returning to New York on 6 August 1919. There, she was decommissioned, struck from the Navy list, and returned to her owners on 16 August 1919.  Later career  Wilhelmina remained under the Matson house flag through the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, Wilhelmina was one of two ships that steered to aid the Travel Air 5000 City of Oakland in its successful transpacific flight attempt. Sold to British interests in 1940, Wilhelmina was in Convoy HX 90, steaming ing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to Liverpool, England, in the North Atlantic, on 2 December 1940 when the German submarine U-94, part of a wolfpack that included of Scapa Flow fame, drew a bead on a tanker and the steamer W. Hendrik, and fired two torpedoes. Both missed but continued on to strike and sink Wilhelmina.

The enthusiastic patrons merrily dispense into the store as the doors open at sunset. Before the unsuspecting shoppers have time to question the fact that the store is stocked with coffins, terror erupts and the store explodes into a bloodbath. A few weeks later, three unmindful, egocentric twenty somethings, Carrie (Robin Gierhart), Sam (Nate Rubin), and Bone (Deva George), embark on a road trip to Mr. Fire, a festival which shares eerie similarities to Burning Man, and accidentally wander into Fate, unaware of its population's ill-fated transformation... into vampires.

Social teachings =Medical theology= Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers. Pio XII, Discorsi Ai Medici compiles 700 pages of specific addresses. Pope Pius XII addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca, but also issues of uses of medicine in terminally ill persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII went often new ways, thus he was the first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.Pope Pius XII, The Moral Limits of Medical Research and Treatment . Other topics were the behaviour of medical doctors, facing pain and death, sterilisation, genetics, artificial insemination, painless child birth, the multiple moral aspects of developing medical technologies, morality in applied psychology, moral limits to medical research and treatment, and cancer treatment of children, and more. =Sexuality and conscience= Pope Pius XII fully accepted the rhythm method as a moral form of family planning, although only in limited circumstances, within the context of family.Addresses to the Italian Catholic Union of Midwives (29 October 1951) and to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families (27 November 1951).

Some historians consider these two speeches by Pius XII to be the first explicit Church acceptance of the method. In his speech to mid-wives, Pope Pius XII offered this understanding of sexual pleasures: \\"The Creator himself... established that in the [generative] function, spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the limits of just moderation.\\"Address to the Italian Catholic Union of Midwives (29 October 1951); text available at EWTN or CatholicCulture.org To Pius XII, \\"The conscience is the innermost and most secret nucleus of man. There he withdraws with his intellectual capacities into complete separation, alone with himself or better, alone with God, whose voice echoes in his conscience. There he decides over good or bad. There chooses between victory or defeat. The conscience is therefore, to use an old, venerable picture, a sanctuary, on whose entrance all must stop.\\"Radiomessaggio, La Coscienza Cristiana come oggetto della educazione, in Pio XII, Discorsi, Vol XIV, p. 20. This respect applies to children and even more to adults: \\"It is correctly argued, that the true meaning of adult independence is not to be led like a little Child.\\" Vatican II picked up this quote on conscience from Pius XII verbatim in Gaudium et Spes, and concluded: \\"By conscience, in a wonderful way, that law is recognized, which is fulfilled in the love of God and neighbour.\\"Vatican II, Gaudium et Spes, 16. Since 1993, the Magisterium of the Church explicitly highlights this particular view of Pope Pius XII, quoting it as an element of the official Catholic Catechism.

Pullman goes on to cite a speech, dated 21 February 1943, as evidence that Pius was even aware of the emerging possibility of nuclear weapons.Pullman (1998), p. 321. It is especially notable that Georges Lema√Ætre, who was at once a Roman Catholic priest, a cosmologist, and a student of Eddington, and the first to propose the now canonical Big Bang scenario for the origin of the universe, was also a member of the Pontifical Academy during Pius's day. Thanks to Lemaitre, Pius XII was well-informed about the rise of modern physical cosmology. Commenting on \\"the state and nature of original matter,\\" Pius acknowledged that science declares this to be an \\"insoluble enigma\\" but continues, that ‚Äúit seems that science of today, by going back in one leap millions of centuries, has succeeded in being witness to that primordial Fiat Lux when, out of nothing, there burst forth with matter a sea of light and radiation, while the particles of chemical elements split and reunited in million of galaxies\\"Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences 1939-1986, Vatican City, p. 82. Pius went on to say that these facts need further investigation, and theories founded upon them need ‚Äúnew developments and proofs in order to offer a secure basis for reasoning.‚Äù ibid., p. 82 =Evolution= In 1950, Pius XII promulgated Humani generis which acknowledged that evolution might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who use it as a religion, who \\"imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution... explains the origin of all things\\". While Humani generis was significant as the first occasion on which a pope explicitly addressed the topic of evolution at length, it did not represent a change in doctrine for the Roman Catholic Church. As early as 1868, Cardinal John Henry Newman wrote, \\"the theory of Darwin, true or not, is not necessarily atheistic; on the contrary, it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of divine providence and skill.\\" The encyclical issues a clear no to another scientific opinion popular at the time, polygenism, \\"the scientific hypothesis that mankind descended from a group of original humans.\\"Pius XII, Enc.

Built in 1735 by the co-founder of Brunswick Town, the Orton Plantation house is one of the oldest structures in Brunswick County. During its history Orton Plantation has been attacked by Native Americans, used as a military hospital, and been home to lawyers, physicians, military leaders, and a Colonial governor. Although the home is privately owned and closed to the public, the Orton Plantation Gardens and family-owned chapel have become a tourist destination in Southeastern North Carolina, attracting thousands of visitors each year. On April 11, 1973, the Orton Plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1725, Roger Moore, son of Governor James Moore and grandson of Irish nobleman Sir Rory Moore, and his family moved from the Province of South Carolina to an area of land known as Orton in southeastern North Carolina. Orton was owned by Roger's brother, Colonel Maurice Moore, father of General James Moore and Maurice Moore, Jr., author of a famous essay denouncing the Stamp Act of 1765. The elder Maurice was also the grandfather of Supreme Court Associate Justice Alfred Moore. Maurice sold the land to his brother when Roger moved to the area and together they founded Brunswick Town one mile (1.6 km) south of Orton. The first home Roger built in 1725 was destroyed by local Native Americans. Roger constructed the current Orton Plantation home in 1735 and developed his land into a leading rice plantation with the unpaid labor of hundreds of slaves. Orton remained in the Moore family until it was purchased by Benjamin Smith, who eventually lost ownership and was forced to auction off the home and surrounding . The property was purchased by a physician, Frederick Jones Hill, in 1826. The Orton Plantation remained in Hill's possession until the fall of Fort Anderson and Fort Fisher during the Civil War. Following the Confederate defeat at Fort Fisher, Union soldiers confiscated Orton Plantation and used the home as a military hospital, thus sparing it from destruction. Orton Plantation was abandoned after the War and the house sat empty for 19 years. Luola's Chapel Orton Plantation Gardens In 1884, Orton Plantation was purchased by a former Confederate military officer, Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison. Murchison restored the plantation to its original appearance and made it his winter home. When Murchison died in 1904, Orton Plantation was purchased by his son-in-law and daughter, James and Luola Sprunt. James, a lawyer, encouraged his wife to remodel the home and in 1910 he and Luola began the development of a flower garden and expansion of the house. The Sprunts constructed a family chapel in 1915, and when his wife died the following year from scarlet fever, James renamed the building to Luola's Chapel in her honor. At approximately the same time their son, James Laurence Sprunt tragically lost his first wife, Amoret Cameron Price giving birth to their first son, James Laurence Sprunt Jr. In the 1930s, James Laurence Sprunt and his second wife Annie enlarged the garden to its current size of , with some of the landscape design done by Robert Sturtevant.\\"Orton Plantation Boundary Increase and Additional Documentation\\" . North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office, January 2013. Accessed Dec. 31, 2015. After a relative was involved in an automobile accident, the Sprunts opened their garden to the public in hopes of raising money for medical expenses. Charging 25 cents for an entrance fee, the family raised $1,000 in a week. From that point on, the Sprunts decided to keep the garden open to the public. In 1954, the Sprunt family donated of the Orton Plantation to establish the Brunswick Town State Historic Site. Four years later, James Laurence Sprunt wrote a book about the history of Orton Plantation entitled The Story of Orton Plantation. After the death of Laurence Sprunt in 1973 and Annie Gray Sprunt in 1978, the ownership was shared by their four sons: James Laurence Sprunt Jr., Kenneth Murchison, Samuel Nash, and Laurence Gray Sprunt. Kenneth succeeded Bragaw as manager of the gardens after World War II until 2006 when Laurence bought the gardens from his brothers and continued the management. Ownership of the Orton Plantation was passed down to each generation of the Sprunt family for 126 years. The Laurence Sprunt family sold Orton Plantation for $45 million in May 2010 to Louis Moore Bacon, a hedge fund manager and direct descendant of Roger Moore, builder of the original Orton home in 1725. Bacon plans to restore the house and renovate the grounds. The Orton Plantation used to be a tourist attraction with the gardens and chapel open to the public. The old rice fields are now a wildlife sanctuary and the plantation was a haven for birdwatchers. Weddings, family reunions, corporate events, and school fieldtrips took place at the property and the gift shop and ticket office were located in Sunnyside, a playhouse built in the 1890s for James and Luola's daughter, Marion. Sunnyside was moved to the Orton Plantation in 1939. Bacon closed the plantation in 2010 and is spending a \\"significant amount\\" on restoration and research. 4000 acres of forest were burned in 2012 as part of the project. Bacon wants to grow rice on the land by 2014 for the first time since 1931. Because the fields are wetlands this requires a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Bacon also wants the National Registry designation to include the rice fields, and for the plantation to become a National Historic Landmark. Architecture Orton Plantation Gardens overlooking the Cape Fear River The Orton Plantation house is an example of Classical Revival and Greek Revival architecture. Originally a -story white brick building, a second floor was added to the house in 1840 along with four fluted Doric columns. Two wings were added to the house in 1904. A corbelled brick chimney is located on each side of the original section of the home. Similar to the house, Luola's Chapel is a white brick structure with four Doric columns. The chapel is surrounded by gardens and features a small steeple. A pavilion is located near the chapel. Orton Plantation Gardens contains of lawns and formal gardens, as well as of fountains, statues, forests, lagoons, old rice fields, and a family cemetery. The garden features tree-lined brick paths and rows of camellias, dogwoods, magnolias, crape-myrtles, annuals, and perennials. The front gates of the property are topped with cement eagles which lead to a dirt path driveway lined with large oak trees draped in Spanish moss that were planted in the 18th century. Popular culture Orton Plantation driveway In 1983, American movie producer Frank Capra, Jr. searched for a location to film a scene for his movie Firestarter and chose Orton Plantation. Afterwards, Capra Jr. convinced movie producer Dino De Laurentiis to open a studio in nearby Wilmington. Laurentiis founded the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group which brought additional opportunities for movie and television filming at the Orton Plantation. Since 1983, Orton Plantation has been featured in 23 films and 34 television movies and series. Some of the movies that feature scenes from Orton Plantation include Lolita, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Hounddog, and A Walk to Remember. Television series that have filmed scenes at Orton Plantation include One Tree Hill, Dawson's Creek, Hart of Dixie and Matlock.

Signs and symptoms The main symptom of gastroenteritis is diarrhea. Other symptoms may include: * Abdominal pain or cramping * Nausea * Vomiting * Low grade fever Because of the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, people who have gastroenteritis can become dehydrated quickly. It is very important to watch for signs of dehydration. Causes Gastroenteritis can be caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Common routes of infection include: * Food * Contaminated water * Contact with an infected person * Unwashed hands Fifty to seventy percent of cases of gastroenteritis in adults are caused by noroviruses (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae). This virus is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. Norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Diagnosis The doctor will take a medical history to make sure that nothing else is causing the symptoms. Also, the doctor might perform a rectal or abdominal examination to exclude the possibilities of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn‚Äôs disease) and pelvic abscesses (pockets of pus). A stool culture (a laboratory test to identify bacteria and other organisms from a sample of feces) can be used to determine the specific virus or germ that is causing gastroenteritis. Prevention With most infections, the key is to block the spread of the organism. * Wash hands frequently * Eat properly prepared and stored food. * Bleach soiled laundry * Vaccinations for Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus have been developed. Rotavirus vaccination is recommended for infants in the U.S. Vaccines for V. cholerae may be administered to individuals traveling to at-risk areas Treatment The body can usually fight off the disease on its own. The most important factor when treating gastroenteritis is the replacement of fluids and electrolytes that are lost because of the diarrhea and vomiting. Antibiotics will not be effective if the cause of gastroenteritis is a viral infection. Doctors usually do not recommend antidiarrheal medications (e.g., Loperamide) for gastroenteritis because they tend to prolong infection, especially in children. Parasitic infections are difficult to treat. A number of drugs are available once the condition has been identified. Removing part of the colon or needle aspiration of abscesses in liver may be required. Outcomes/prognosis Depending on the cause of the inflammation, symptoms may last from one day to more than a week. Gastroenteritis caused by viruses may last one to two days. Most people recover easily from a short episode of vomiting and diarrhea by drinking clear fluids to replace the fluid that was lost and then gradually progressing to a normal diet. But for others, especially infants and the elderly, the loss of bodily fluid with gastroenteritis can cause dehydration, which can be a life-threatening illness unless it is treated and fluids in the body are replaced.

In a similar manner to American Graffiti and Scorsese's earlier Mean Streets, the songs served roughly the same purpose as a composed musical score. While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used. Scorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters \\"in an oblique way\\". The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music which could have been heard at that time. Scorsese decided that if a scene took place in the 1970s, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non- dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \\"Layla\\" playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action. Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase. There is no music once Henry is arrested in his driveway by the DEA, until the end credits.

The chemical formula is Hg2I2. It is photosensitive and decomposes easily to mercury and HgI2. Synthesis Mercury(I) iodide can be prepared by directly reacting mercury and iodine. Structure In common with other Hg(I) (mercurous) compounds which contain linear X-Hg-Hg-X units, Hg2I2 contains linear IHg2I units with an Hg-Hg bond length of 272 pm (Hg-Hg in the metal is 300 pm) and an Hg-I bond length of 268 pm. Wells A.F.

The compound is often formulated as Hg22+ 2I‚àí. Historical Uses Mercury(I) iodide was a commonly used as a drug in the 19th century, sometimes under the contemporary name of 'protiodide of mercury'. It was used to treat a wide range of conditions; everything from acne to kidney disease and in particular was the treatment of choice for syphilis. It was available over the counter at any drugstore in the world, the most common form being a concoction of protiodide, licorice, glycerin and marshmallow. Taken orally, and in low doses, protiodide causes excessive salivation, fetid breath, spongy and bleeding gums and sore teeth. Excessive use or an overdose causes physical weakness, loss of teeth, hemolysing (destruction of the red blood cells) of the blood and necrosis of the bones and tissues of the body. Early signs of an overdose or excessive use are muscular tremors, chorea, and locomotor ataxia. Violent bloody vomiting and voiding also occur. Protiodide is banned as a medication, even though it persisted in use as a quack remedy until the early 20th century.

Chromium forms a second interstitial nitride, dichromium nitride, Cr2N. Synthesis Chromium(III) nitride can be prepared by direct combination of chromium and nitrogen at 800 ¬∞C: :2 Cr + ‚Üí 2 CrN It can also synthesize by Physical Vapour Deposition technique such as Cathodic arc deposition. Applications CrN is used as a coating material for corrosion resistance and in metal forming and plastic moulding applications. CrN is often used on medical implants and tools. CrN is also a valuable component in advanced multicomponent coating systems, such as CrAlN, for hard, wear-resistant applications on cutting tools. Magnetism The fundamental materials physics of CrN, giving rise to its favorable properties, has been debated recently in high-profile scientific journals such as Nature Materials. In particular, the importance of magnetism in both the low temperature and the high temperature phases has been demonstrated by means of quantum mechanical calculations of the electronic structure of the compound.

After studying philosophy and theology at Caen, he studied music and established himself in Paris in 1678 and remained there until 1687. He briefly was the private tutor of the young son of Nicolas-Joseph Foucault, a collector and bibliophile. He became a very close friend to √âtienne Louli√©, one of the musicians who performed the Italianate works that Marc-Antoine Charpentier was composing for Marie de Lorraine, Duchess of Guise, better known as \\"Mademoiselle de Guise.\\" While in Paris, he also became close to Samuel Morland, an English inventor and polymath who was working with Joseph Sauveur, a mathematician, on the Machine de Marly. It was during talks about music with Morland that Brossard deduced the role that a major third versus a minor third play in differentiating a major scale from a minor scale. These contacts shaped Brossard's future preoccupations. He enthusiastically embraced Italian music; he became a collector of musical manuscripts and music treatises; he perfected his knowledge of musical theory; and autodidact though he was, he honed his compositional skills. In 1687, Brossard was named a vicar at the Strasbourg Cathedral. He remained there until 1698. He founded an Acad√©mie de Musique at Strasbourg in 1687 and arranged Lully's Alceste for performance there. It was during the decade he spent in Strasbourg that he acquired the bulk of his music library, which has since become legendary. A collection of 157 sonatas acquired by Brossard bears the name Codex Rost, after the Cantor at Baden-Baden, Franz Rost (1640-1688). It is sometimes the only source of works by certain German and Italian composers of the 17th century. In 1698, Brossard was appointed chapel master at the Cathedral of Meaux and remained in that post until 1715. After his retirement, he worked on liturgical publications for the diocese. He died at Meaux in 1730, at age 75. Writings Brossard wrote a book on Greek, Latin, and Italian musical terms, the first music dictionary in French, in 1703. In 1724, he offered his very rich library, together with its annotated catalogue, to Louis XV, in exchange for a pension. Among the items in the collection were the unpublished manuscripts of his late friend √âtienne Louli√©, and his own set of four motets Le√ßons des mortes, written in 1696-7. A manuscript work of 393 pages accompanied by an alphabetical index of 253 pages, this catalogue today constitutes an incomparable source of information on music bibliography, the quality of printings, aesthetics, and the musical theory of the era. The manuscript (now available in published form) is kept at the Music Department of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Compositions Brossard wrote six books of serious airs and drinking songs (1691-1698), several motets, some trio sonatas, and the Lamentations du proph√®te J√©r√©mie (1721).

He played in the Premier League for Leicester City and in the Football League for Halifax Town, Stockport County, Darlington and Bradford City. During his career he scored goals in all of the top five divisions of the English football league system. This was a record that Willis held until it was equalled in 2004, by then Liverpool defender Steve Finnan. From 2001 to 2002 he was manager of Bamber Bridge. Playing career Born in Liverpool, Willis served his apprenticeship at Blackburn Rovers, before he signed for Halifax Town in 1986. His impact at both Halifax and subsequent club Stockport County was limited, although he came into his own at Darlington where he won medals for both the Conference and Football League Fourth Division titles despite suffering from a broken leg in 1991. Willis' form at Feethams netted him a ¬£250,000 move to Leicester City in late 1991, although he initially struggled at the higher level and was even loaned out to Bradford City. Eventually, however, Willis adapted to the higher standard of football and was the man of the match in the play-off final of 1994 when Leicester secured promotion. In 1996, Willis was set to join Burnley but the deal collapsed at the last minute because of contractual problems. However, a year later, Willis was forced to retire from the game because of injury. Willis briefly came into the media spotlight again in 2007 when it was reported on Sky Sports that Steve Finnan was the only player to score in the top five divisions of English football. However, as reported in the Liverpool Echo, Willis had scored for Darlington in both the Conference and the Fourth Division, for Bradford in the Third Division and for Leicester in the First Division (second tier of football) and the Premier League. Managerial career Willis dreams of breaking into football management, and briefly had a spell in charge of Bamber Bridge of the Northern Premier League. He was appointed manager in November 2001, taking over from Tony Greenwood, but only lasted two months until he left because of the financial problems at the club. Personal life Willis's younger brother Paul also became a footballer. Willis went on to work as a taxi driver in his native Liverpool.

The game was developed by Idea Factory with characters from games by Capcom, Nippon Ichi Software, Bandai Namco, and Gust Corporation. Released on September 25, 2008 in Japan, the game features turn-based battles, a plot that involves rescuing souls, and the ability to dress the female characters of the player's party in a wide variety of outfits. Cross Edge features characters from Darkstalkers, Disgaea, Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia, Spectral Souls: Resurrection of the Ethereal Empires, Blazing Souls, Atelier Marie and Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy. NIS America published the game in North America, and it was released for that region on May 26, 2009. The Korean version of the PlayStation 3 release lacked Playstation trophies support. Plot Gameplay Cross Edge is a traditional Japanese role-playing game complete with world map, random battles, level grinding, item combining/creation using alchemy, etc. It also features heroes and villains from game franchises published by Gust, Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai and Idea Factory. As players set about freeing the trapped souls supporting the nightmare world that they are stuck in, they engage in turn-based team battles. This is where the characters from previous games come in. Players must enlist them to join in party-based battles. Success in these battles is based on the ability to string together specific moves into chain attack sequences, which in turn unlock even stronger combinations when successful. Players can also increase their characters' stats and abilities by acquiring additional costumes called \\"forms\\" and redressing their characters in them. Female characters physical appearances can also be changed based on the form they're wearing. The goal of the game is to release souls. You can find and collect souls by searching around area maps. Exposure to souls can grant players items or unlock events. Along with soul related events, maps will also point players to other helpful locations such as event points, points at which other events may occur, and save points, where you can save your game as well as buy, sell and trade items.

The chemical formula is SnS. Its natural occurrence concerns herzenbergite (Œ±-SnS), a rare mineral. At elevated temperatures above 905 K, SnS undergoes a second order phase transition to Œ≤-SnS (space group: Cmcm, No. 63). in recent years, it has become evident that a new polymorph of SnS exists based upon the cubic crystal system, known as œÄ-SnS (space group: P213, No. 198). Synthesis Tin(II) sulfide can be prepared by reacting tin with sulfur, or tin(II) chloride with hydrogen sulfide. :Sn + S -> SnS :SnCl2 \\\\+ H2S -> SnS + 2 HCl Properties Tin(II) sulfide is a dark brown or black solid, insoluble in water, but soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Tin (II) sulfide is insoluble in (NH4)2S. It has a layer structure similar to that of black phosphorus. As per black phosphorus, tin(II) sulfide can be ultrasonically exfoliated in liquids to produce atomically thin semiconducting SnS sheets that have a wider optical band gap (>1.5 eV) compared to the bulk crystal. Photovoltaic applications Tin(II) sulfide is an interesting potential candidate for next generation thin-film solar cells. Currently, both cadmium telluride and CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) are used as p-type absorber layers, but they are formulated from toxic, scarce constituents. Tin(II) sulfide, by contrast, is formed from cheap, earth abundant elements, and is nontoxic. This material also has a high optical absorption coefficient, p-type conductivity, and a mid range direct band gap of 1.3-1.4 eV, required electronic properties for this type of absorber layer. Based on the a detailed balance calculation using the material bandgap, the power conversion efficiency of a solar cell utilizing a tin(II) sulfide absorber layer could be as high as 32%, which is comparable to crystalline silicon. Finally, Tin(II) sulfide is stable in both alkaline and acidic conditions. All aforementioned characteristics suggest tin(II) sulfide as an interesting material to be used as a solar cell absorber layer. At present, tin(II) sulfide thin films for use in photovoltaic cells are still in the research phase of development with power conversion efficiencies currently less than 5%. Barriers for use include a low open circuit voltage and an inability to realize many of the above properties due to challenges in fabrication, but tin(II) sulfide still remains a promising material if these technical challenges are overcome.

The village's name (also spelled La Balise) meant \\"seamark.\\" La Balize was historically and economically important for overseeing the river. It was rebuilt several times because of hurricane damage. The active delta lobe of the river's mouth is called the Balize Delta, after the settlement, or the Birdfoot Delta, because of its shape. La Balize was inhabited chiefly by fishermen, river pilots, and their families. The pilots were critical to helping ships navigate to and from the port of New Orleans through the shifting passages, currents, and sandbars of the river's delta front. The village was vulnerable to seasonal hurricanes. Washed away in a hurricane of 1740, the village was rebuilt on the newly emerged island of San Carlos. That village in turn was damaged severely several times and finally destroyed. By 1853 also called Pilotsville, the village of La Balize was rebuilt about five miles (8 km) to the northwest in the Southwest Pass, on the west bank of the Mississippi.Elis√©e Reclus, Fragment of a Voyage to Louisiana, 1855; translated and reprinted, 1993-1994 , accessed 7 May 2008 That village was taken down by wind and a storm surge of the September 14‚Äì15 hurricane of 1860. La Balize was abandoned, and a new pilots' settlement was constructed about five miles (8 km) upriver on the east bank of the Mississippi, just above the Head of the Passes. The new village was named Pilottown. History When the explorer Robert de La Salle claimed the land in 1682 for the French crown, he identified this site near the mouth of the Mississippi as important. It was at a point just above two major forks in the river, so passage could be controlled. A map drawn about 1720 showed the mouth of the Mississippi with the different forks of the river, and the isle and fort of La Balize.\\"Carte du Fleuve Saint Louis ou Mississippy dix lieues au dessous de la Novelle Orleans Jusqu'a son Embouchoure\\" (c.1720), Louisiana State Museum Map Database , accessed 6 May 2008 By 1721 the French had constructed a -high wooden pyramid as la balize at the settlement. It sat relatively high above the mud and marshes of the delta wetlands. By 1722 the center of the French colony was in New Orleans. In the early 18th century, the Roman Catholic Church quickly established seven pioneer parishes in the Louisiana colony, among them the parish at La Balize, founded in 1722. The French also founded four pioneer parishes in early villages of what are now Mississippi and Alabama.\\"A History of the Archdiocese of New Orleans - French Beginnings\\", Archdiocese of New Orleans , accessed 6 May 2008 After the establishment of La Balize, the King commissioned Nicolas Godefroy Barbin to serve as the \\"Garde Magazin\\" (chief administrator) there. That commission, signed in 1703 by the King and his minister J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux comte de Pontchartrain, was significant in that it recognized the strategic importance of La Balize.Maner L. Thorpe, \\"The Barbin and Goudeau Families of Louisiana,\\" Santa Barbara, CA: M. L. Thorpe, 2006, p. 6 Despite the vulnerability of the low-lying site to hurricanes, the French and later the Spanish needed to control the mouth of the Mississippi and have a place where pilots could meet the ships. They always rebuilt. The complicated conditions on the Mississippi River required ships to have river pilots to help them navigate the bar, with its changing currents, mud and sandbars, and avoid going aground. After the Americans took control of the territory by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, they sometimes called the village Pilotsville. With the advent of steam tugboats in the 19th century, the pilots had more power to maneuver oceangoing ships in the river. Not only did hurricanes destroy the settlements, but engineers started working early to try to improve entry at the river mouth. In 1726 French engineers dragged an iron harrow through sandbanks to make it easier for ships to pass the bar.Jiyu Chen, Engineered Coasts, New York: Springer, 2002, p.66 Other elements which pilots and captains had to deal with at the mouth of the Mississippi were changing passages. The main ship passage changed four times before 1888. In 1750 the main passage was at the Northeast Pass (part of Pass √° Loutre), then in succession it was at Southeast Pass (also in Pass √° Loutre), Southwest Pass, and South Pass.Jiyu Chen, Engineered Coasts, New York: Springer, 2002, p.67 The main ship passage is again in the Southwest Pass. Historical records for La Balize documented the long struggle of the French, Spanish and Americans to maintain this critical site at the delta front: *1740 - La Balize was destroyed in a hurricane. A new island arose which was called San Carlos. The village was built again on San Carlos. *October 7‚Äì10, 1778 - La Balize was destroyed, but was rebuilt at this location. *July 25‚Äì28, 1819 - Ships anchored near La Balize suffered through a 24-hour gale, but only three were grounded. *1831 - La Balize suffered major damage. *April 3‚Äì4, 1846 - This was the most damaging storm since that of 1831.

Tides were six feet above the high-water mark. The village was abandoned and rebuilt upriver at what became Pilottown. *October 2‚Äì3, 1860 - In the third hurricane of the season, there was widespread damage as far inland as Baton Rouge. *September 13, 1865 - Although La Balize had been abandoned since 1860, this hurricane destroyed the last traces of the village. The hurricanes of 1860 persuaded the pilots and their families to rebuild further upriver, which they did about five miles (8 km) away, on the east bank of the Mississippi. The new settlement was named Pilottown. At its peak of population in the 19th century, it had about 800 residents. A school for children operated into the 20th century. Today the pilots usually stay there only temporarily for work shifts.  Remains  Little of La Balize remains today. In the early 20th century, only a rusted iron tomb marking the site remained.[History and description of the now lost city of Balize, Louisiana, 1921] http://louisianadigitallibrary.org/islandora/object/state- lwp%3A6527 Literature Travelers found the Mississippi delta an astonishing area. In her Domestic Manners of the Americans (1833), Fanny Trollope captured her first perceptions as her ship entered the area of the river: > Large flights of pelicans were seen standing upon the long masses of mud > which rose above the surface of the waters, and a pilot came to guide us > over the bar, long before any other indication of land was visible.

He is venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Church and his feast day is 23 December. Biography Gabriel was born in the village of Beth Qustan in 573/574, and became a monk at the Monastery of Qartmin in 588/589. In 593/594, he was ordained a deacon, and, in 612/613, Gabriel was elected head of the brothers at the monastery. He was ordained a priest in 618/619, and became Abbot of the Monastery of Qartmin and Archbishop of Dara on 1 May 634.Palmer (1990), pp. 157-158 Gabriel succeeded Daniel Uzoyo as abbot and bishop.Palmer (1990), p. 154 Following the Muslim Conquest of Mesopotamia in 639, Gabriel likely negotiated the rights and obligations of the Syriac Orthodox Church in Tur Abdin with the Muslim conquerors. He may also have met with the Caliph Umar. Several miracles are attributed to Gabriel during his time as bishop, including the resurrection of the son of a widow in the village of Sighun, a boy from the village of Olin, and his friend the abbot of the Monastery of the Cross near Hah.Johnson (2008), p. 61 According to his hagiography, at the age of 70, Gabriel sent men to transport a large stone at Beth Debe to the Monastery of Qartmin, however, they were forced to abandon the stone due to its size. Gabriel ordered the people in the monastery to help transport the stone, at which the dead rose to help.

The squadron, known as the Hellions, is one of three Advanced Helicopter Training squadrons that produces aviators for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. They fall under the command of Training Air Wing Five and fly both the TH-57B Sea Ranger basic helicopter trainer and the TH-57C Sea Ranger advanced helicopter trainer. The squadron's tactical call sign is \\"Lucky.\\" Mission HT-28's primary mission is to transition student aviators through basic and advanced rotary wing pilot training. Along with its sister squadrons, HT-8 and HT-18, HT-28 provides advanced helicopter flight instruction to all Navy, US Marine Corps, and US Coast Guard helicopter flight students as well as international students from several allied nations. Additionally, HT-28 conducts a shortened helicopter syllabus for prospective MV-22 Osprey pilots.http://www.cnatra.navy.mil/tw5/ht28/index.asp Basic training introduces and develops student skills in helicopter flight maneuvers as well as training in visual navigation and tactics. Advanced training completes an intensive curriculum of basic and radio instruments, advanced tactics, and shipboard landings. The completion of this exacting training syllabus culminates in a highly trained and proficient all-weather aviator. Students who successfully complete the program earn the right to wear the coveted Wings of Gold. Insignia The squadron insignia for HT-28 is a tri-colored circular field featuring a dragon and torch. The tri-color field is a reference to HT-8 and HT-18 patches; an acknowledgment that HT-28 was initially established by officers from those squadrons. The deep blue section represents the US Navy and its operations over the world‚Äôs oceans. The olive green section represents the US Marine Corps and its projection of power ashore. The red section symbolizes these services‚Äô heritage of valor and sacrifice in peace and war. The black Chinese Loong dragon symbolizes both wisdom and ferocity in battle. It is coiled around a lighted torch, which signifies knowledge passed from one generation of aviators to the next. The dragon‚Äôs helical coils, which echo da Vinci‚Äôs famous design, are another nod to the legacy of rotary wing flight. The name ‚ÄúHellions‚Äù is an allusion to the word ‚Äúhelicopter.‚Äù Its connotation (an unruly child) is meant as an amusing reference to the pilots-in-training as they are refined into military aviators. Historically, only one other squadron has held the name ‚ÄúHellions‚Äù: VMF-218, a long-disestablished Marine Fighter squadron. The Chinese dragon motif from VMF-218‚Äôs original squadron patch is carried over in the HT-28 patch partly as a nod to the legacy of the name. History HT-28 was established by the Chief of Naval Operations with an OPNAV Note 5450 dated November 1, 2006. The order reads, in part: > \\"Currently there are two advanced helicopter training squadrons located at > Naval Air Station, Whiting Field, Milton, Florida. In order to meet > projected increase in the advanced rotary Integrated Production Plan, expand > oversight and ensure quality of training and safety of flight are not > compromised, a third advanced rotary squadron is required.\\" The Establishment Ceremony was held aboard NAS Whiting Field on May 25, 2007. The squadron was initially staffed by transferring one third of the instructors from HT-8 and one third of the instructors from HT-18 to the newly established HT-28 creating three equally sized squadrons. Squadron command  HT-28 squadron commanding officers alternate between Navy Commanders and Marine Lieutenant Colonels. When a Navy Commander is in command, a Marine Lieutenant Colonel is the squadron's Executive Officer, and vice versa. When the squadron changes command, the executive officers assume command from his predecessor.

Although, in Roman Catholic ecclesiastical terms, it is not classified as a minor basilica. See: List of minor basilicas in the world.) is located in the city centre of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch and seat of the Bishop of Christchurch, currently Bishop Paul Martin SM. Designed by architect Francis Petre, it is generally held to be the finest renaissance-style building in New Zealand.archINFORM website (retrieved 20 July 2012) On 7 April 1983, the building was registered as a Category I heritage item by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with the registration number 47. It is regarded as an outstanding example of church architecture in Australasia, and is regarded as Petre's best design. The cathedral was closed after the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake collapsed the two bell towers at the front of the building and destabilised the dome. The dome was removed and the rear of the cathedral was demolished. The decision to demolish the church was made public on 4 August 2019. On 7 December 2019, Bishop Martin announced that a new $85 million Catholic cathedral was to be completed by 2025 and would accommodate up to 1,000 people. It would be built adjacent to Victoria Square.\\"New $85m Catholic cathedral planned for centre of post-quake Christchurch\\", NZ Herald, 7 December 2019 (Retrieved 7 December 2019) History Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in the early 20th century A by wooden chapel was built on Barbadoes Street, south east of the city centre, in October 1860 for newly arrived Marist missionary priests. This chapel was replaced by a larger wooden church designed by Benjamin Mountfort in 1864, which was expanded over the years. This building was designated the Pro Cathedral of the newly established Diocese of Christchurch in 1887 by Bishop John Grimes S.M., the first Catholic bishop of Christchurch. This designation indicated that the bishop was planning a new Cathedral from the beginning of his tenure. The old building was considered inadequate for the growing population still confined to one city church. In May 1897 Grimes went to Rome for his ad limina visit. He had several audiences with Pope Leo XIII who gave two gifts for the project. One was a valuable cameo and the other a richly enamelled portrait of the Pope both of which were later sold in a fund- raising bazaar. During his 18 months overseas Grimes travelled in England, Ireland, France, Belgium, and on the return journey, via the Canadian Pacific Railway, in the United States and Canada. Wherever he could command an invitation he preached and begged for his Cathedral, nine times on one Sunday in New York. He arrived back in Christchurch on 10 January 1899 with more than ¬£3,000 for his Cathedral fund (including ¬£800 collected in Ireland). At that time Wellington's Sacred Heart Basilica was under construction with Petre as architect in a branch office there. It is likely that it was in Wellington that Grimes invited Petre to submit a plan for the Christchurch Cathedral. Petre proposed the form of the cathedral. He wrote later that the Roman basilica style was chosen because \\" ... the proportion of height to length and breadth in the Gothic building is nearly three times that of the Basilica. In fact if a Gothic church were drawn with the width of nave shown in my drawings it would be higher than any Gothic church in the world.\\" Gothic was also considered the greater earthquake risk and overall the more expensive. Grimes had the old church removed to Ferry Road and construction of a new cathedral began in 1901. Massive efforts began to raise money for the building. Grimes engaged in constant tours of his diocese to raise the cash. Problems with finding suitable stone for the construction of such a large structure caused financial difficulties during the construction, and a special Act was pushed through Parliament by then Premier Richard Seddon in order to aid with the financing of the building. The constant need to find money and to build cheaply led to strained relations between the Bishop and the architect. The Catholic community with under 5,000 wage and salary earners in a total Catholic community of 20,570, was fewer in number and overall less advantaged than the Anglican community (whose cathedral took 50 years to build and opened in 1904 at a probable cost of more than ¬£60,000 with a residual debt of ¬£4,000). It \\"speaks volumes for the value average Catholic placed on their faith\\" that such small numbers enabled the completion of their Cathedral at a total cost of ¬£52,000 with a final debt (10 years after it opened) of less than ¬£5,000. Grimes said at the opening on 12 February 1905, a mere four years after construction began: \\"No one can claim that our stately Cathedral is the work of the wealthy. It is the fruit of the hard earnings of the poor and the lowly, generous to a sacrifice of their well-won pounds, their shillings and their pence.\\" Cathedral under construction. The nave is lined with Ionic columns Construction The cathedral was built by Jamieson and Sons who built many other major ecclesiastical and municipal buildings in New Zealand. Petre had previous experience in using concrete, designing dock walls and sewers as a draughtsman. This knowledge allowed Petre to require innovative methods during construction such as pouring heart walls with concrete and then facing with stone. Mass-produced components were widely used, including curved arches made in a purpose built moulding machine. Fifty men were employed on the site, and in excess of 120,000 cubic ft (3400 m¬≥) of stone, 4,000 cubic ft (110 m¬≥) of concrete, and 90 tons of steel were used in the construction. After its completion the cathedral, constructed of concrete sheathed in Oamaru limestone, was widely acclaimed, later causing George Bernard Shaw to describe Petre as a \\"New Zealand Brunelleschi\\". Architecture Forsaking 19th-century Gothic, Petre designed the new church in a Renaissance, Italian basilica style, with one major exception. Ignoring Renaissance convention, Petre obtained a greater visual impact by siting the Italianate green copper-roofed dome not above the cross section of the church (as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), but directly above the sanctuary. In Petre's opinion, this design element, coupled with the Byzantine apse, added extra grandeur and theatre to the high altar set in the tribune. The nave and chancel roofs were supported by colonnades of Ionic columns and the entrance fa√ßade of the cathedral was flanked by twin towers in the manner of many of Europe's great renaissance churches.P R Hamilton, Francis Petre: 1847‚Äì1918. An Investigation into New Zealand Architectural Biography, MA Thesis, University of Auckland, 1986; D B Wynn-Williams, The Basilicas of F. W. Petre, MA thesis, University of Canterbury 1982. Interior view of the nave and sanctuary of the cathedral in 2009 While often likened, at least in its outward form, to St Paul's Cathedral in London, it is conceivable that the greatest influence behind this structure was Benoit Haffreingue. During Petre's formative years, Haffreingue had been the driving force of the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Boulogne-sur-Mer, a French church that has a very similar plan to that of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, including the controversial siting of the dome over the altar rather than the centre of the cathedral. Haffreingue was also the principal of a private Jesuit boarding school for boys (now known as \\"Le coll√®ge Haffreingue-Chanclaire\\") in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Petre was a student at this school in 1860‚Äì186, during Heffreingue's tenure. The building was also said by some to be based on the 19th-century Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris to which it bore some striking similarities. The similarities to another great French church, Saint-Sulpice, Paris (17th century) have also been remarked upon.John Simpson, \\"Difficulties after building begins\\", The Press, 9 February 1980, p. 12. Cathedra in the chancel (2007) One commentatorE J McCoy, \\"The Blessed Sacrament Cathedral, Christchurch\\" in the chapter, \\"Petre Churches\\", Historic Buildings of New Zealand: South Island, Metheun for the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, 1983, pp. 155 and 157. said that the exterior of the cathedral was probably the most complete and consistent of all Petre's churches. \\"The majesty of the dome was best seen from the rear, and from most parts of the city it registered powerfully above the Christchurch flatness in a manner reminiscent of Brunelleschi's dome in Florence\\". George Bernard Shaw during his 1934 visit was unimpressed with Gilbert Scott's Anglican cathedral but generous in his praise of Petre's Catholic one. \\"In fact it was Shaw who was one of the first to open local eyes to the quality of this building.\\" In 1970 under Bishop Ashby, \\"years of grime deposited from the [then] nearby railway station and gasworks were cleaned off and restoration work was carried out.\\" \\"The great joy of the cathedral, however, is the interior. Petre's handling of natural light is as sure as ever, the nave and sanctuary are suffused with daylight. The fine Corinthian and Ionic columns down each side of the nave are a development of the design of St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru, here doubled in height, for obviously single columns in this great nave would have required enormous girth. The sanctuary dome is undoubtedly the climax of the interior; it is here that the full power of the design is unleashed. This was Petre's finest achievement in forty years of practice. Fascinating vistas are gained through the arches which transmit the enormous weight of the dome to the four massive piers. These are decorated with subtle flutings, a fresh variation on an ancient theme. In this sanctuary the liturgy can be seen as drama and it receives a fitting setting for its movement and colour\\". Earthquake The 2010 Canterbury earthquake, a Richter magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, resulted in the closure of the cathedral to the public indefinitely, to allow for seismic strengthening and restoration. Masses were not celebrated at the cathedral from the September earthquake, but took place at other nearby locations such as the chapel of the adjacent Music Centre. However, although his Requiem Mass was celebrated at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Bishop Cunneen was buried in the cathedral.\\"Former Bishops\\", Catholic Diocese of Christchurch website (retrieved 23 February 2011) Damage from the February 2011 earthquake A Richter magnitude 6.3 earthquake on 22 February 2011 caused considerable damage to the cathedral. The Cathedral administrator, Monsignor Charles Drennan, said that engineers had indicated that it was unlikely the building could be saved. The two bell towers at the front of the building collapsed, bringing much of the front fa√ßade down with them, with large blocks of masonry destroying vehicles in front of the building. There was also major cracking evident around the cathedral's main dome. Stained glass windows, which had survived the 4 September earthquake and some 4,000 aftershocks, were also \\"in ruins\\". Monsignor Drennan said that workers repairing damage to the building caused by the earlier earthquake, escaped, as did a custodian who was in the Cathedral at the time.Michael Otto, \\"Christchurch Catholic Cathedral partially destroyed in earthquake\\", NZ Catholic, Wednesday 23 February 2011 (retrieved 23 February 2011) Drennan told Kim Hill in a National Radio interview on 5 March that the screams of the children at the nearby school when the earthquake struck at nine minutes to one \\"will stay with him for a long time\\".

Adjoining parts of Catholic Cathedral College were threatened by the severely damaged Cathedral and the college had to shift to St Thomas of Canterbury College under a \\"site-sharing\\" arrangement.Catholic Cathedral College homepage (retrieved 2 March 2011) =Reaction= Removal of the dome, 27 July 2011 On 2 March, Bishop Jones decided that the dome of the Cathedral would be removed after an inspection revealed another large earthquake could topple it completely. An engineer's report showed that the cathedral's dome was forcing weight-bearing structures outwards and that another earthquake like the magnitude 6.3 on 22 February would topple the dome. The Bishop said that the removal of the dome would begin as soon as possible, but other work had to be completed and equipment assembled before work could begin. The removal of the dome would be done by cranes at a distance from the site because of the risk of collapse. The Bishop also said that no decisions would be made about the future of the building until a detailed engineering report was generated after the dome has been removed. Until the February earthquake, Masses were being held at the Catholic Cathedral College assembly hall near the cathedral, but the Bishop said he did not know where future services would be held. He said: \\"We don't know anything, all we're concerned about now is protecting human life.\\" On 5 March, the Minister of Earthquake Recovery, Gerry Brownlee, told a media briefing that if he had his way, most of Christchurch's heritage buildings would be demolished but that he would like to see resources go into rebuilding the ChristChurch Cathedral, the Catholic Basilica, the Canterbury Provincial Chambers and the Christchurch Arts Centre ‚Äì \\"but that's it ‚Äì There will be a few others perhaps, but those would be the most iconic buildings that Christchurch residents would want to see rebuilt. They won't be put back the way they were. They will need to have a great deal of strengthening put into them and it will be quite a long consideration as to how those things might be done.\\" After the June 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the dome of the cathedral was removed. The outer copper dome was cut into segments and was finally removed on 26 July and the internal decorative dome was removed intact in August. The damaged rear of the cathedral was demolished to a low level in October.\\"Cathedral's Dome rises through the roof\\", The Press, 26 August 2011.

It became a quake survival symbol after the about face as it looked out of a tower window over the battered city. On 29 May 2011 the statue was carried around the damaged Cathedral, once again the centrepiece for a religious ceremony. After circumnavigating the Cathedral grounds, the 200-strong congregation witnessed the Bishop of Christchurch consecrating the city of Christchurch to Mary. The statue had been damaged while being removed from the tower, but was repaired by Carmelite nuns in time for the procession,Michael Wright, \\"Procession gives Mary to which was tour of damaged site'\\", The Press, 30 May 2011 (retrieved 17 May 2012) which was organised by the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer.Rowena Orejana, \\"Men‚Äôs order moves from outside to inside\\", NZ Catholic, 14 August 2014 (Retrieved 6 April 2019)See the description of a similar event 112 years before in Wellington: Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington =Options= Aerial view of the Cathedral in July 2012, with the dome now removed Full restoration of the cathedral was expected to cost more than $100 million and construction of a new Cathedral $40 million.Charlie Gates, \\"Cardboard cathedral will go ahead\\", The Press, 10 December 2010.(retrieved 26 January 2012)\\"Church takes Time on Cathedral fate\\", Sunday Star Times, 26 February 2012.

One commentator asked why there is \\"relative silence over the future of the Basilica for the Catholics who are allowed to get on with their decision-making processes in relative peace, while the Anglicans have to fight it out in the streets and letters to the editor pages of The Press? I suspect there remains in Christchurch the notion of old that the Catholics are still regarded as peripheral, parked over on the edge of town in an area back in the day that was next to the gas works that turned the cathedral a nicotine yellow. Now the distance from the heart of the city seems to have at last paid off as the Basilica's counterpart in the Square can't get out of the ring\\". By 7 May 2012, the Catholic Diocese had spent about $3 million deconstructing the damaged parts of the cathedral, on cleaning and saving and numbering stones, windows and unique elements, and on transporting material, at night, to a storage facility in west Christchurch. The facility and shrink-wrapping allowed the individually numbered objects to be kept in the \\"best condition possible\\" with a view to their use in any rebuild or as a guide for the design of new elements. The cathedral's fate was considered in the context of a total of 20 damaged churches in the Christchurch Catholic Diocese. The diocese also had to deal with insurance issues and decisions on other assets, which included schools, retirement villages, church halls and presbyteries, as well as churches.Paul Gorman, \\"Catholics bide time on cathedral: decision on Catholic cathedral months away\\", The Press, 7 May 2012.

This redevelopment, if it proceeded, would cost about $45 million and take four years to complete. In October 2016, the result of this investigation was announced. The Cathedral could be saved and gradually rebuilt, but at a cost $100 million. The final decision on the future of the building was to be made by the new Bishop of Christchurch, Paul Martin, appointed in 2018.Charlie Gates, \\"New catholic bishop reconsiders Christchurch cathedral restoration\\", Stuff News, 11 May 2018.

The option of just saving the nave and rebuilding on a modest scale was estimated to cost in excess of $91 million.Eleisha Foon, \\"Disappointment as Bishop decides to demolish Chch cathedral\\", Radio New Zealand Checkpoint] (Retrieved 5 August 2019) The bishop said that these costs were not bearable by the diocese. He said that the diocese had spent millions of dollars investigating the site and the building and had examined more than 20 different possibilities, but ultimately \\"a functional and financial solution\\" could not be found and the 113-year-old earthquake-damaged basilica would therefore be demolished. On Saturday 7 December 2019, Bishop Martin announced that a new $85 million Catholic cathedral to be completed by 2025 and accommodating up to 1,000 people would be built adjacent to Victoria Square. The project would also include a hotel precinct of up to four hotels, a relocated St Mary's Primary School, multi- storey car park building, hub for community activities, church offices and residential accommodation for clergy. Payment for the development would include $45m from the church's quake insurance claim for a cathedral. The bishop said that the \\"sizeable\\" funding shortfall would be met through fundraising and the sale of excess property and assets, including potentially selling the old Barbadoes St site. The search for potential architects and designs would begin in 2020. Demolition of the cathedral began on 1 September 2020 and is expected to take a year to complete.Charlie Gates,\\"Demolition work starts on quake-damaged Christchurch Catholic cathedral\\", Stuff news, 1 September 2020. Choir and Orchestra The Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament Choir and Orchestra (CBS) are the primary music providers for Masses at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral. Before the earthquake, they were based at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. The CBS is an affiliate of the RSCM New Zealand Canterbury Branch. The first formation of a choir, under the leadership of Don Whelan, was at Christ The King, Burnside. Whelan started working with Dutch immigrants, who come from a choral culture, understood the art of singing in parts well. Whelan soon became a well-trained organist, organising cantors and the choir. Before Easter 1969, an organist was needed for the services at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Whelan took this opportunity and the CBS Choir was formed. During their first international tour to Europe in 1990‚Äì1991, the CBS was given status as cultural ambassadors by the New Zealand Government. During their third European tour, the choir were invited to lead the singing during the Papal Midnight Mass in celebration of the inauguration the Holy Year of Jubilee Due to the 2010 Canterbury Earthquake, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament was badly damaged, leading it to be closed for the foreseeable future. Masses moved next door to the chapel. During the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake, the cathedral partially collapsed, as well as the chapel and music center being badly damaged and demolished afterwards. The CBS built a new state of the art facility at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in which to house their music library, offices and a practice hall. Despite the Canterbury Earthquakes, the choir and orchestra were still able to go ahead with their annual New Zealand tours, as well as going on their first Asian tour in 2012 and their fifth Australian and European tours in 2013 and 2015, respectively. In October 2019, members and associates of the CBS celebrated 50 years under the leadership of Don Whelan, with a luncheon at the Rydges Hotel in Central Christchurch. In March 2020, the Catholic bishops of New Zealand ordered the temporary suspension of Masses and churches to be temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in NZ. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the CBS program was halted due to the national lockdown. The Wednesdays at One music programme, concerts, annual music events, and the appearances at Masses were suspended for the first time in its history. On 14 June, the CBS was able to begin their program, celebrating the Cathedral's feast of Corpus Christi. The Wednesdays at One music programme resumed in July 2020. =Concert program and personnel= Wednesdays at One is a weekly concert series hosted by the CBS. This entails local and national musicians of all ages to perform the works of many composers on many different instruments. Annual concerts of Bach's St John Passion and Handel's Messiah are performed on Good Friday and in mid- December, respectively. In June, during the Diocese's Feast Day (Cathedral Feast of Corpus Christi) celebrations, a concert is given, where usually a Mass is performed. In 2019, John Ritchie's Missa Corpus Christi was performed, as well as MacMillan's Hymn to the Blessed Sacrament and Mendelssohn's Verleih uns Frieden. On the first Sunday of each month (excluding January), orchestral Masses are performed with the choir. Every other Sunday, the choir sings contemporary, polyphonic, and Gregorian chant compositions. Orchestral Masses with the choir are also performed at the Christmas Vigil and Midnight Mass. Don Whelan has been the musical director since 1969, with Simon Mace serving as assistant musical director in 2018 and Nicholas Sutcliffe becoming assistant musical director in 2019. , Wally Enright is cantor.

Plot summary The story takes place in G√∂ttingen in 1952. The young mathematician Daniel Mond (of Jewish-German descent but born in England) arrives to study \\"The Dortmund papers\\", a collection of notes left by the German mathematician Dortmund (died 1938). Mond is a student of Lancaster College which appeared in Fielding Gray. Early during his stay he gets to know the American historian Earle Restarick who is friendly for a while and then withdraws. Mond meets a large number of soldiers from The (10th)Sabre Squadron in the Earl of Hamilton's 49th Light Dragoons Regiment, among them his comrade from Lancaster, Julian James. Fielding Gray is also in this group and the two men have many discussions. Mond follows the soldiers during a \\"night on the town\\" (the first of many) but goes on picnic with Gray and his driver Michael Lamb the next day. Gray tells Mond about the reason for the army's presence in the area: to handle a nuclear war. A big exercise called ‚ÄúApocalypse‚Äù will be held in September in which the soldiers will practice what to do after a nuclear war. Mond is present at several dinners with the squadron and meets a former German officer, Pappenheim, who is very curious about Mond's research. His German colleague, Dr von Bremke, is also rather curious. Mond is trying to reveal the story about Fielding Gray and his failure to attend Lancaster, but the rumours are too vague after seven years. During a meeting with the officers Leonard Percival and Pappenheim, Mond is told that his friend Restarick (and the US) are supporting former Nazis to save West Germany from influence from the Soviet Union. They offer Mond protection if he reveals what he has found in the Dortmund papers. During an evening on the town Mond is humiliated by the antisemite von Augsburg, who is challenged to a duel by Major Giles Glastonbury. This results in von Augsburg ending up in hospital and Glastonbury in jail. As a key witness, Mond is now prohibited from leaving Germany. This news is delivered by Tuck (from Fielding Gray) who is now a member of the Allied Control Commission. As Mond will later discover, the whole affair was arranged to keep him in Germany. Glastonbury is, however, freed when his friend Captain Detterling (from Fielding Gray) arrives on his way to Baden-Baden. Detterling can't prevent Glastonbury from being sent to Hong Kong and Fielding Gray is suddenly head of the Squadron. During a visit to Dortmund's grave, Mond is harassed by Restarick and a number of soldiers. Shaken, he tells the truth to Fielding Gray. In the papers, Mond has found a way to create atomic chain reactions much more powerful than those of an atomic bomb. Mond is really scared about what this knowledge could lead to and will not tell a single person something of substance about how to achieve this. Gray and his squadron show a touching loyalty to Mond and promise they will help him escape. Mond gets a guard consisting of soldiers Lamb, Bunce, Chead and Mugger and he is dressed up as \\"Trooper Lewis.‚Äù In this guise he will escape during Operation Apocalypse, earlier mentioned by Gray. All goes well except for the fact that Mugger is severely beaten up in a fight with fusiliers. During the trip Mond also meets the genial journalist Alfie Schroeder, who recognises him but is persuaded to keep quiet. Mond is handed over to Captain Detterling who, after some hesitation, smuggles him out in an ambulance. Mond is put in an anti-radiation costume, but the zipper jams and he is, for a while, afraid that he will not get out of the suit before the oxygen expires. When, after a long trip, he steps out of the ambulance he finds himself face to face with Restarick and Percival. He faints but wakes up without the suit and in Strasbourg. Percival and Restarick try to threaten him into giving away what he knows. When Mond refuses they threaten to destroy the career of Mond and his squadron since they‚Äôve broken a number of rules to get Mond out of Germany. Mond gives up and asks for his paper. When he is alone he thinks about the motto of the Squadron (Res Unius, Res Omnium ‚Äì one for all and all for one) and, touched by the loyalty of Gray and his men, he cuts his throat with a penknife.

History =Early years= The band was formed in Bad Aussee, Austria. Andreas Schweitzer (born 26 February 1960), Alfred Jaklitsch (born 22 January 1960) and Manfred Temmel (born 25 February 1959) met during High School. At that time, they played in different amateur bands together. But, after graduation, they pursued into different careers: Andy was a policeman, Freddy taught German language and history at school, and Manfred was a popular DJ in Orion disco club in Traunreut, Germany. They met again in 1984, and decided to focus their joint efforts on a professional musical career. Quickly enough, they got a record deal with an Austrian label OK Musica. The record owners appointed Michael Scheickl (who was part of Mess at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982, where their track \\"Sonntag\\" reached #10) as the band's producer. Their first single, \\"Lost in Hong Kong\\" (composed by Michael Scheickl, under M. Mell), was released in February 1985. Despite becoming a minor hit, the band began to gain attention. =Success= The next single \\"Touch by Touch\\", composed by Schweitzer and Jaklitsch, was released in September 1985. It immediately reached European Top 20 Dance Charts, and topped the Austrian national chart. It even reached Gold status in their native Austria, Portugal and Spain, wherein more than 50,000 copies were sold. Their third single, \\"Hello\\", also composed by Michael Scheickl, again became a hit - and reached 26th position in Austrian national chart. The first album - also entitled Hello \\\\- immediately entered Austrian national chart, and charted in many European countries as well. That brought worldwide popularity to the band with their albums sold in more than 30 countries. \\"Valerie\\" became a hit in Eastern Europe, notably in the USSR, where it reached No. 3 in the charts by Krugozor magazine in 1987. In Hungary, a few years later a local group Inflagranty recorded a cover version entitled \\"Te meg en\\". Since 1986, they began performing on various TV shows, such as the GDR-based TV-show Kessel Buntes. In 1986, the trio recorded a second album Joy and Tears. The album included the single \\"Japanese Girls\\". It reached No. 14 in the Austrian national chart, and their popularity had reached Asia. In 1986, the trio won the most popular international act in South Korea. Their Asian tour, which occurred on January and February 1987 in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Seoul, was attended by more than 60,000 spectators. In Seoul, South Korea, Joy twice played for 12,000 people at the sold out Jamsil Olympic Stadium, and performed a version of their hit \\"Japanese Girls\\", re-titled as \\"Korean Girls\\". Later on, they went on a mini tour in USA, notably at the Shrine Auditorium and in San-Jose - mainly for Chinese and Vietnamese-American audiences. A picture taken in San Jose was later used on a sleeve for the \\"It Happens Tonight\\" single. In 1987, the trio went on a European tour, performing in Portugal (twice), Spain and Italy. In between shows, they recorded \\"Destination Heartbeat\\", which became a soundtrack for the film Flucht in der Tod. Also in 1987, OK-Musica released a compilation album, Best of Joy, on compact disc. =Line-up changes and break-up= In 1988, Andy Schweitzer left the band and was replaced by Anzo (Hans Morawitz). They signed with Polydor Records and recorded their self-titled album, which includes the singles \\"Kissin' Like Friends\\", \\"She's Dancing Alone\\" and \\"Born to Sing a Love Song\\". However, the album and singles failed to chart. In 1994, the duo signed with BMG Ariola and released a new single, \\"Hello, Mrs. Johnson\\". At this time, they began working on their fourth album, Full of Joy. The next year, Johannes Groebl (born 30 January 1960) joined the duo, and released another single, \\"Felicidad\\". Their album was slated for release in 1995. However, despite heavy promotion, BMG decided not to release the album. As a result, the album was shelved for good and the duo took a break. =Later years and reunion= In 1997, Jaklitsch and Temmel moved on to form Seer, which later became one of the more successful projects on the Austrian music scene. In 2008, Seer left the band. In June 1997, the duo performed in Gorky Park, at the 'Dancing City' open air festival. On 29 November 2002, the duo took part in the first 'Diskoteka 80-x' festival, organized by one of the popular radio stations in Russia - AvtoRadio. The festival took place in Luzhniki Palace of Sports. In 2010, all three members of the original line-up reunited to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their first success. On 10 October that year, the trio performed at the 'Legends of Retro FM' festival in Moscow. In July 2011, the trio released Enjoy, their 1st album in more than two decades. It contained new songs, as well as remakes of such hits as \\"Touch by Touch\\" and \\"Valerie\\". The album was released in Austria by the label Major Babies, and reached No. 21 in Austrian national chart. In September 2011 the album was released in Russia on the CD-Land label, and in Hungary ‚Äì distributed by Hargent Media. On 15 July 2011, the trio performed in Estonia, at the Viljandi Retrofest for more than seven thousand viewers from Estonia and Latvia. In November 2011, Joy performed in Moscow once more ‚Äì at the Diskoteka 80-x festival. This time the festival took place in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow.

It is located on the west side of Bigelow Terrace, a dead-end spur extending southward from Boyd Street in neighboring Watertown. The mailing address of this property is in Watertown.City of Newton assessment property record for 15 Bigelow Terrace The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side gable roof and clapboard siding. Its Greek Revival features include corner pilasters and an entablature below the eave. The center entrance is sheltered by a single-story hip-roofed porch, with square posts supporting an entablature and hip roof with balustrade. This house appears to have been built in the 1840s, and was first located on Washington Street, where it is described as being owned by the Pool family. By 1850, it is owned by the family of Henry F. Bigelow. Bigelow is locally prominent as a leading member of the school board, and as a driving force behind the creation of the Newton Free Library and Newton Cemetery. At the time of his tenure, Newton's schools were recognized as among the nation's most progressive. Bigelow Terrace and the Bigelow Middle School are named in his honor. The house was moved from Washington Street to this location in 1895, occasioned by the widening of the railroad right-of-way next to that road.

Nisonoff's monograph, ‚ÄúThe Antibody Molecule,‚Äù was the most important and in-depth paper on the antibody during his time. Biography Nisonoff's parents immigrated from Hungary and Russia to New York City as teenagers. He was born in Corona, Queens on January 26, 1923. His parents moved the family to South River, New Jersey, where they operated a butcher shop and a grocery store throughout Alfred's childhood.Piehler, G. Kurt. An Interview with Alfred Nisonoff, for the Rutgers Oral History Archives of World War II. , Rutgers University, August 1, 1994. Accessed February 6, 2011. \\"AN: His first stores were butcher shops. He had the kosher butcher shop in South River, and that goes all the way back to when I was five or so. Yeah, I was born in Corona, Long Island, but, then, when I was a couple of years old, they moved to South River and he opened that kosher butcher shop there.\\" Education As a child, Nisonoff was an extremely well educated person. At the age of 6 he was in the third grade, and went on to graduate from high school at the age of 15. After graduation, he received a state scholarship to attend college and enrolled in Rutgers University, within less than 50 miles of his home. Nisonoff's interest in chemistry began when he was introduced to a home laboratory of a high-school friend. From this experience, Nisonoff made the decision to major in chemistry at Rutgers. In 1942, at age 19, Nisonoff graduated from Rutgers with a chemistry degree, and went to work for the U.S. Rubber company in Detroit, Michigan. He was assigned to determine a way to adhere nylon cords to rubber airline tires in order to add strength to the tires, previously manufactured using cotton cords. In passing through the factory, he stopped to watch a process in which nylon cords were used in strengthening self-sealing gas tanks made of rubber, and adapted this same process to the problem that faced him in strengthening the airplane tires. This type of analytical and creative thinking would prove to be useful in his future research on the structure of the antibody. In Detroit, Nisonoff met Sarah Weismann, his future wife. In 1943, Nisonoff joined the U.S. Navy to help in the war effort. He missed the battle of Okinawa by only a month due to engine problems with his ship. 2 He served until the end of the war in 1945, and was finally discharged in July, 1946. He then took the opportunity to pursue graduate research in biochemistry in September 1946, with Frederick W. Barnes at Johns Hopkins University through funds provided by the G.I. Bill. He received his M.A. in 1948 and his Ph.D. in 1951. His research with Barnes was on the enzymatic mechanism of transamination. Research work Nisonoff was introduced to the subject of antibodies while studying at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo with a man named David Pressman. David Pressman was working in one of Linus Pauling‚Äôs groups exploring the antigenic specificity of antibodies against haptenic determinants. This research took advantage of the technique of quantitative hapten inhibition, originally developed by Karl Landsteiner. While conducting these experiments in Pressman‚Äôs lab, Nisonoff contributed to an important paper explaining an idea that eventually led to important conclusions about the structure of the antibody molecule. In this early paper he demonstrated that the antibody molecule has two combining sites with the same specificity for an antigenic determinant. This helped to disprove the ‚Äúinstructional theories‚Äù of antibody formation. Nisonoff's most important work started when he began the enzymatic cleavage of rabbit antibodies to better determine the structure that contributed to their specificity in disease. He was continuing the work of Rodney Porter who had performed the enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with the enzyme papain. When Nisonoff used a different enzyme, pepsin, to digest the antibodies, he discovered that the enzymes cleave the proteins at different sites on opposite sides of the disulfide bridge connecting the two heavy chains of rabbit IgG. This led to the conclusion that papain cleaves on the amino-terminal side of the disulfide bond, and pepsin cleaves on the carboxyl-terminal side. Nisonoff's work also contributed to the identification of the F(ab‚Äô)2 fragment of the antibody molecule, which is the single bivalent fragment that is produced after pepsin cleavage. Later, it was found that this fragment is responsible for antigen interaction and agglutination and precipitation reactions. Nisonoff's experiment led to many conclusions about the structure of the antibody. It was determined that the two antigen binding sites of the antibody are located opposite the Fc fragment, the part of the antibody responsible for binding to receptor cells. Through the further work of his colleagues, with the help of Nisonoff's previous work, the full structure of the antibody molecule as well as its amino acid composition were determined. Nisonoff's work continued to concentrate on efforts to determine how the structure of the antibody reflects its function and specificity as an immunological tool. In 1975, Nisonoff, John Hopper, and Susan Spring published the monograph \\"The Antibody Molecule\\". This piece reviewed the comprehensive information available at the time on the structure and function of the B-cell receptor. Nisonoff focused the remainder of his career in a variety of positions within the immunology community, including work for the Department of Biological Chemistry in Chicago and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Nisonoff's research work in determining the structure and functions of small proteins called antibodies made major steps towards our modern understanding of the immune system. Without his work we may still be years behind our current understanding of the antibody molecule. Nisonoff died on March 12, 2001.

Courtesy M.C. Farach-Carson. Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions of the plasma membrane that are associated with degradation of the extracellular matrix in cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Very similar to podosomes, invadopodia are found in invasive cancer cells and are important for their ability to invade through the extracellular matrix, especially in cancer cell extravasation. Invadopodia are generally visualized by the holes they create in ECM (fibronectin, collagen etc.)-coated plates, in combination with immunohistochemistry for the invadopodia localizing proteins such as cortactin, actin, Tks5 etc. Invadopodia can also be used as a marker to quantify the invasiveness of cancer cell lines in vitro using a hyaluronic acid hydrogel assay. History and controversy In the early 1980s, researchers noticed protrusions coming from the ventral membrane of cells that had been transformed by the Rous Sarcoma Virus and that they were at the sites of cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. They termed these structures podosomes, or cellular feet, but it was later noticed that degradation of the ECM was occurring at these sites and the name invadopodia was coined to highlight the invasive nature of these protrusions. Since then, researchers have often used the two names interchangeably, but it is generally accepted that podosomes are the structures involved in normal biological processes (as when immune cells must cross tissue barriers or in bone remodeling) and invadopodia are the structures in invading cancer cells. However, there remains controversy around this nomenclature, with some scientists arguing that the two are different enough to be considered distinct structures while others argue that invadopodia are simply disregulated podosomes and cancer cells don‚Äôt simply \\"invent\\" new mechanisms. Due to this confusion and the high similarity between the two structures, many have begun to group the two under the collective term invadosomes. Structure and formation Invadopodia have an actin core, which is surrounded by a ring structure enriched in actin-binding proteins, adhesion molecules, integrins, and scaffold proteins. Invadopodia are generally longer than podosomes, with a width of 0.5- 2.0 um and a length greater than 2 um, and they last much longer than podosomes. Invadopodia also penetrate deep into the ECM, while podosomes generally extend upward into the cytoplasm and do not cause as much ECM degradation. Invadopodia formation is a complex process that involves multiple signaling pathways and can be described as having three steps: initiation, stabilization, and maturation. Initiation of invadopodia involves the formation of buds in the plasma membrane and is initiated by growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which act through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to activate Src family kinases. These kinases have key roles in the formation of invadopodia and when activated, phosphorylate multiple proteins involved in invadopodia formation including Tks5, synaptjanin-2, and the Abl-family kinase Arg4. The phosphorylation of these proteins leads to the recruitment of the Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-Wasp) to invadopodia, which requires Arp2/3, to activate actin polymerization and thus invadopodia elongation. A key step during invadopodia formation is the stabilization of invadopodia, which involves the interaction of PX domain of Tks5 (a scaffold protein) with phospholipid, PI(3,4)P2 to anchor the invadopodia core to the plasma membrane. Maturation of invadopodia requires sustained actin polymerization and there are several regulators of actin polymerization involved in this step, including cofilin, fascin, Arg kinase, and mDia2. Invadopodia are considered mature when matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), specifically MMP2, 9, and 14, are recruited to the invadopodium to be released into the extracellular matrix. Role in cancer metastasis Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients; it relies on the ability of cancer cells to degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix and invade other tissues. The mechanisms of this process are still not completely understood, and because of the invasive properties of invadopodia, they have been investigated in this context. Indeed, invadopodia have been implicated in many cancers and cancer cells. Increased invasiveness of cancer cells correlates with invadopodia presence, and cancer cells have been observed to project them into the endothelium of blood vessels during extravasation, an important step in metastasis. Invadopodia have also been shown to correlate with a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Tks5, a protein specific for invadopodia, has been implicated in cancer invasiveness. Increased levels of tks5 have been detected in prostate cancer and overexpression of Tks5 was sufficient to induce invadopodia formation and degradation of the extracellular matrix in an Src-dependent manner. Increased Tks5 expression has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis in gliomas. In a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, invasive tumors were shown to have an increased expression of a long isoform of tks5 while non-metastatic tumors had a short isoform. It was also shown that overexpression of the long isoform of tks5 was sufficient to cause non-metastatic tumors to become invasive. Therapeutic relevance Due to the invasive nature of invadopodia in cancer cells, research has focused on targeting invadopodia as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit metastasis. Inhibiting invadopodia formation by targeting Src kinase with Saracatanib in a chicken model system showed a decreased incidence of invadopodia and decreased cancer extravasation. In mice, inhibiting invadopodia formation directly, through RNAi against tks4 or tks5, significantly reduced cancer extravasation. Screening for drug activators and inhibitors of invadopodia revealed that Cdc5 can be a target for inhibiting invadopodia formation and also that, paradoxically, paclitaxel, a drug commonly used to treat cancer, induces invadopodia formation. These results show potential for invadopodia as a therapeutic target, and research in this field continues.

His work is not easily lumped into traditional generic categories, as it spans and combines elements of poetry, prose fiction, and theatre. Life and work Born in Buenos Aires, Lamborghini's first book appeared in that city in 1969.Most information in this section is taken from C√©sar Aira, \\"Nota del compilador,\\" the epilogue to Osvaldo Lamborghini's Novelas y cuentos, published in Buenos Aires by Sudamericana in 2003. An abbreviated version is accessible at http://www.literatura.org/OLamborghini/OLamborghini.html It was titled El fiord, and it is a complex, violent allegory of radical politics in 1960s Argentina. It circulated clandestinely, could only be found at one bookstore, and acquired a mythical status within the Argentine literary scene. His second book, Sebregondi retrocede appeared in 1973. It is a long poem in prose centered on the figure of the Marquis of Sebregondi (according to the author an incarnation of Witold Gombrowicz), Pepe Bianco, and an Italian uncle of Lamborghini. Poemas appeared in 1980 and was the last of his books published during his lifetime. During the 1970s, Lamborghini was associated with the avant-garde magazine Literal on which he published several poems. The magazine was heavily influenced by the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, particularly by way of the writings of Oscar Masotta, who was instrumental in bringing Lacanian thought to the Spanish-speaking world. Other notable figures associated with Literal include Luis Gusm√°n, H√©ctor Libertella, and Josefina Ludmer. Lamborghini published several other texts during his lifetime, mostly in small magazines such as Sitio. In the early eighties he lived in Barcelona and returned in 1982 to Mar del Plata, Argentina, where, convalescent, he wrote the novel-length triptych Las hijas de Hegel. During his final years he wrote the long text Tadeys and the seven volumes of the multimedia Teatro proletario de c√°mara. He died of a heart attack in Barcelona in 1985. Lamborghini is commonly associated with the neobarroco (neobaroque) aesthetic, of which his friends Arturo Carrera and N√©stor Perlongher were prominent representatives and which follows on the work of Cuban writers Jos√© Lezama Lima and Severo Sarduy. The Argentine novelist, translator, and essayist C√©sar Aira has been responsible for the posthumous diffusion of his work. The first of these posthumous volumes appeared in 1988 under the title Novelas y cuentos, and it included an important epilogue by Aira himself. The collection was reprinted in 2003 in two volumes by the editorial Sudamericana. His collected poetry and Tadeys followed shortly after. The Teatro proletario de c√°mara appeared in a limited-edition deluxe version in Spain in 2008.

Along with Hotel Dieu Hospital and Providence Care, the hospital is a partner within Kingston's university hospitals in the Southeast LHIN, delivering health care, conducting research and training health care professionals. KGH is oldest public hospital in Canada still in operation with most of its buildings intact. Architecturally reflecting the evolution of health care in the 19th and 20th centuries, KGH was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.Kingston General Hospital, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada History =19th century= In 1832 an Act of Parliament named a commission to \\"superintend and manage the erection and completion of a hospital in or near the town of Kingston\\". In 1835 the first building was completed on the site where KGH stands today, on land purchased from Archdeacon George O'Kill Stuart. The building, designed to accommodate 72 patients, remained unoccupied until three years later when the city had the money to purchase equipment and furnishings. In 1838 the hospital briefly housed its first patients, twenty wounded Americans taken prisoner in the Battle of the Windmill during the Rebellion of 1837. When Kingston was named the capital of the Province of Canada in 1841 and the United Provinces required an unoccupied building to serve as the first house of Parliament, the hospital was chosen. Parliament met in the hospital from the time of the Union of the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada from 1841 until 1844 when the capital and parliament were moved to Montreal. In 1845, the building was returned to its original purpose and, thanks to the Female Benevolent Society, began its seasonal operation as a charitable institution. The hospital grounds also held the remains of 1,400 Irish immigrants who had died in Kingston in fever sheds along the waterfront, during the typhus epidemic of 1847, while fleeing the Great Famine. Their remains were re-interred to the city's St. Mary's Cemetery in 1966. Initial resident staff included a housekeeper-nurse and an assistant. In time, a house surgeon and caretaker also lived on site. The Female Benevolent Society provided volunteers while local doctors took turns offering their services free-of-charge. The hospital cared mainly for the poor, many of them recent immigrants, until the 20th century. The hospital's affiliation with the Queen's University Faculty of Medicine began in 1854. A much-needed addition to the main building and funded by local businessman John Watkins, the Watkins Wing opened in January 1863 to treat patients with infectious diseases. Recognizing the value of professionally trained nurses, surgeon Kenneth Fenwick was instrumental in convincing the board to establish an in-house training program for nurses in 1886. The hospital recognized the importance of isolating patients with infectious disease when the Nickle Wing was built. Named after local businessman and benefactor William Nickle, the Nickle Wing opened in 1891. Then, in view of the increasing number of maternity patients and their particular needs, the hospital board proposed a new building for women. A bequest from the estate of foundry-owner Michael Doran provided for the Doran Building, which began admitting patients in 1894. The 19th century discovery of ether and chloroform and their potential for eliminating pain and suffering during surgery along with the importance of antisepsis led to the construction of appropriate facilities for surgery. In 1892 at the Kingston Hospital, surgeon Kenneth Fenwick offered to fund the construction of a surgical amphitheatre which was completed and in operation by 1895. =20th century= The board approved construction of a nurses' home in response to the expanding role of nursing and the success of the nursing school. The Nurses' Home (later named after Ann Baillie) opened in 1904. Formalizing the role of the community's volunteer women, the hospital's Women's Aid was founded in 1905 and within a year had 110 members. This organization, now known as the KGH Auxiliary, was one of the first of its kind in Ontario. Almost immediately, the women began to raise funds for the hospital. Their efforts contributed to funding the Empire Wing in 1914 which was built to provide additional private accommodation for paying patients. Although the hospital continued to serve as a charitable institution, an increasing number of paying patients reflected the growing acceptance of the hospital by community members who traditionally received health care at home. In 1924, Kingston General Hospital suffered from a number of personnel and management problems. Based on the recommendation of Dr. Horace Brittain, the hospital's Board of Governors decided to appoint someone with an administrative rather than medical background to run the hospital. In March 1925, civil engineer R. Fraser Armstrong was appointed superintendent of KGH, a position he kept until 1957. As the need for diagnostic services increased, a long fund-raising campaign resulted in construction of the Richardson Laboratories and the Douglas Wing in 1925. During the Great Depression, Armstrong developed the Community Cooperative Group Hospital Plan, Ontario's first public health insurance plan. In 1932, the entire hospital staff donated five percent of their salaries to the hospital to help offset rate reductions caused by the Depression. 1947, the Victory Wing was completed. Beds were reserved for patients from Veterans Affairs Canada. Victory also housed clinical facilities for the Ontario Cancer Foundation. Another lengthy fund-raising campaign resulted in construction of the Angada Children's Hospital which opened in 1953. The hospital chose the name Angada - an Arabic word meaning \\"to bring help unto you\\"- in recognition of generous financial support from the Shriners. In 1960, the hospital built the Walter T. Connell Wing, named after the longtime head of the Department of Medicine at KGH and Queen's University. Two more floors were added to the Connell Wing in 1970. The Fraser Armstrong Patient Centre, which offered a range of outpatient clinics, opened its doors in 1975. An Emergency Department followed in 1976. In 1977, the Ronald C. Burr Wing opened with facilities for regional rehabilitation. In 1981, the T. Ashmore Kidd Wing opened with a new operating room, medical records and radiology facilities. Three years later, renovations made way for new facilities including laboratories, ophthalmology, prosthetics, endoscopy, renal unit and a pulmonary function lab; space for the KGH Auxiliary was also added. Named after a prominent Kingston couple known for their contributions to the community (and beyond), the Syl and Molly Apps Medical Research Centre opened in 1987. The Kidd/Davies Patient Tower and new main entrance made their debut in 1989. Among the services available in the new wing were a neonatal intensive-care unit, a renal unit and cardiac services. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment was installed at KGH in 1994, making Kingston one of Ontario's regional diagnostic imaging centres. Major renovations to floors 9 and 10 of the hospital's Connell Wing were completed in 1995. The Same Day Admission Centre was built on Dietary 2 in 1997. Major renovations to the Emergency Services area were completed in 1998. =21st century= Major renovations to the Syl and Molly Apps wing were undertaken in 2002. Sections D&E; of the emergency department were renovated and opened in 2003. The Kingston Regional Cancer Centre integrated with KGH and became the Cancer Care South East at KGH in 2004. The Centre for Advanced Urological Research opened at 62 Barrie Street in 2005. A replacement MRI machine was installed in 2005. In 2009, two new floors were added to the Kidd Wing, and a major expansion of the Cancer Centre in the Burr Wing has recently been completed. Outpatient clinics were transferred to Hotel Dieu Hospital as KGH consolidated as the tertiary (acute care) hospital for the Southeast LHIN. 2008 marked a change in direction for the hospital when patient and family- centered care became a focus. As one of the first hospitals in Canada to embrace patient and family-centered care, KGH attracted media attention and several awards. Launched in 2010, the Kingston General Hospital Research Institute (KGHRI) has a mission to create and advance knowledge that brings evidence into practice for the benefit and empowerment of patients, families and the medical community. The institute is affiliated with a number of other Kingston-based hospitals and the Faculty of Health Sciences at Queen's University, which together receive over $80 million per year in external research funding. The Research Institute is currently developing the W.J. Henderson Centre, a new 12,000 square foot clinical research space to house a multi-disciplinary hub that brings together scientists, treatment teams, patients and families. The centre will feature modular labs that can be shared by several research teams, as well as patient-friendly observation areas for overnight studies and clinical trials. In April, 2017, Kingston General Hospital and Hotel Dieu Hospital were combined in a corporation known as the Kingston Health Sciences Centre. The new CEO mentioned that \\"\\"Together, our two hospitals will be able to make the most of our shared resources to deliver better access to care and provide our communities a broader range of services close to home.\\"Hotel Dieu Hospital - Kingston Health Sciences Centre officially launched Retrieved 6 January 2018 In 2017, a Canadian-first medical innovation, the hybrid ablation treatment of atrial fibrillation, was performed at Kingston Health Sciences Centre and Queen's University by a multidisciplinary team of cardiac surgeons (Dr. Gianluigi Bisleri) and cardiologists (Dr. Benedict Glover).

He was the Laithwaite fellow of Modern History at Trinity College, Oxford, from 1979 to 2008. His major early work concentrated on the history of Diponegoro, the British in Java, 1811‚Äì16 and the Java War (1825‚Äì30), on which he has published extensively. His biography of Diponegoro, The Power of Prophecy, appeared in 2007, and a succinct version, Destiny; The Life of Prince Diponegoro of Yogyakarta, 1785‚Äì1855, was published in 2014. He has conducted research in Lisbon and the United Kingdom amongst the exile East Timorese student community for an oral history of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, 1975‚Äì99, part of which was published in the Cornell University journal Indonesia (no. 76 [October 2003], pp. 23‚Äì67). Carey regularly comments on the history and politics of Southeast Asia to the British media.Opinion  News  The First Post He is adjunct professor at the Department of Humanities of the University of Indonesia in Jakarta (since 2013), and was previously Indonesia country director of the Cambodia Trust (2008‚Äì2012), a UK disability charity that he co-founded in November 1989 to address the needs of mine victims in Cambodia. Biography Carey was born to British businessman Thomas Brian Carey and his wife Wendy in Rangoon, Burma ‚Äî now known as Yangon ‚Äî on 30 April 1948. At the age of seven he and his family moved to the United Kingdom. In 1969, Carey passed his BA degree in modern history from Trinity College, Oxford, with First Class Honors. He continued on an English Speaking Union scholarship to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, studying there from 1969 to 1970. While at Cornell, Carey found out about the Javanese prince Diponegoro, who led a revolt against the Dutch colonial government in the East Indies in the 1820s. He later recalled that his interest in the prince was sparked by Diponegoro's closeness to the common people, despite his noble background. Between 1971 and 1973 he stayed in Indonesia, completing research into Diponegoro for his doctoral thesis. He graduated in 1976, with a thesis entitled \\"Dipanagara and the Making of the Java War: Yogyakarta History, 1785-1825\\". Carey taught at Oxford, first being elected to a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen College in 1974. He served there until 1979, when he became the Laithwaite fellow and tutor in modern history at Trinity College. In 2006, he was made a grand officer in the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator by the government of Portugal. Carey retired in 2008 and moved to Indonesia. Carey appeared in a film, Prabowo: Sang Patriot (Prabowo: The Patriot), promoting Prabowo Subianto, a candidate in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election. In the film, Prabowo is presented as having an illustrious family with at least two family members having assisted Diponegoro during the Java War, and Carey praises the self- sacrifice of these two ancestors. However, Carey later stated that the footage of his interview on Prabowo's ancestry had been taken from an entirely separate interview on the Java War without his permission. He then requested that Gerindra both remove his scenes, which was done, and withdraw the film, which was not. This attracted criticism. One critic claimed that Carey was \\"selling his soul\\", and another scholar asserted that Carey has a longstanding and close relationship with Prabowo, that Carey had not asked to be removed from the movie and that Carey had been vague and obfuscating and introduced irrelevancies in defending his appearance in the film. Carey responded, maintaining that his words had been taken out of context and pointing out that his original interview had not been done as a piece of political propaganda, but as an historical reflection on the impact of the Java War on Indonesian society. At no point in the original interview was any question asked about Prabowo, whom Carey has never met. Carey is married to Lina Surjanti and lives in Tangerang, Banten. Aside from his continued studies into Javanese culture, including a project to preserve manuscripts from the Majapahit era, he owns a wallpaper shop which has since closed down. He is currently involved in heritage issues, and co-curated the \\"Diponegoro Room,\\" a permanent exhibit in the Jakarta History Museum (Museum Sejarah Jakarta, Taman Fatahillah), which was opened by the Governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan, on 1 April 2019. Academic career An 1835 lithograph of Diponegoro, the focus of many of Carey's academic works Carey has published on Javanese culture and history, as well as on the histories of Burma and East Timor. His \\"fascination\\" is with the 19th-century prince Diponegoro, and by 1983 he was established as \\"an authority on the Java War (1825-30)\\". He has written several books on the prince, including a translation and analysis of the Babad Dipanegara (Diponegoro Chronicles) titled Babad Dipanagara: An Account of the Outbreak of the Java War and a biography of the prince, The Power of Prophecy: Prince Dipanagara and the End of an Old Order in Java, 1785‚Äì1855. In a 2014 interview, Carey said that, \\"In every journey and trial Diponegoro faced, he did not lose his spirit. He still maintained his creativity and his humanity by becoming a writer, a leader, a statesman, a mystique, a clean administrator and performed very good financial management under his ruling.\\" Babad Dipanagara: An Account of the Outbreak of the Java War, published in 1981, is based in part on Carey's doctoral thesis. It presents a romanised transcription of the Surakarta court version of the Babad Diponegoro, faced with an English-language translation; an Indonesian translation is included after the transcription and English text. The book opens with a 60-page introduction that discusses the manuscript and text, including a review of contemporary literature related to the Java War, and closes with 30 pages of notes, glossaries, bibliography, index and maps. Reviewing for the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Heather Sutherland described the book as \\"a pleasure to read\\" and a tribute to its publisher. The English used, she found, was \\"clear and smooth, if not poetic\\", and the interspersing of \\"valuable, scattered information\\" in the notes led readers to become \\"impatient\\" for a social history of Java. She concluded that the book was \\"exemplary\\", and its usefulness and origin as a \\"by-product of a major research effort\\" became \\"a tribute to Carey's careful scholarship and historical imagination\\". The 2007 publication The Power of Prophecy: Prince Dipanagara and the End of an Old Order in Java, 1785‚Äì1855 is an almost thousand-page biography of Diponegoro, including his rarely discussed exile in Manado and Makassar. There is also extensive discussion of related topics, which both presents Carey's analysis and provides sufficient references to let readers draw their own conclusions.

Gomperts differed only on the discussion of Diponegoro's adopted title Sultan Erucakra, writing that \\"By taking up ... the epithet of Erucakra (literally, 'arrows and discus'), Diponegoro may have intended to underline the belligerent nature of his proclaimed kingship\\", and emphasising that the prince had used arrows and a shield as his coat of arms.

He often played guitar on one or two songs on his albums and at live performances. In 1936 he relocated to Chicago, where he recorded between 1937 and 1941 on Vocalion, Bluebird, and OKeh. Among his best-known tunes from these recordings were the hit \\"Lonesome Bedroom Blues\\" and the song \\"Tin Pan Alley\\". His \\"Decoration Blues\\" though unissued at the time, was recorded by Sonny Boy Williamson I in 1938. World War II interrupted his recording career, which he did not resume until 1953, when a single of his, \\"Wrong Blues\\"/\\"Cool Playing Blues\\", was released on Parrot, featuring L. C. McKinley on guitar. Jones's first full-length album appeared in 1960 on Bluesville, by which time he had become a noted performer on the Chicago folk music scene. A solo album was released in 1962, by which time Jones had moved to Europe. He lived there and in Morocco for the rest of his life. He made further albums in the UK, including one in 1968 that featured Alexis Korner on guitar. One of Jones' songs, \\"Highway 51\\", was included on Bob Dylan's 1962 debut album, Bob Dylan.

The federation was founded in June 1967, and is a member of the IOF. History =History of Orienteering in UK before the BOF= Orienteering was introduced to the UK in the 1950s and was heavily supported by renowned Olympians including John Disley and Chris Brasher. The early years were helped by orienteers from Sweden: in 1962 Baron 'Rak' Largerfelt of the Stockholm Orienteering Club came to Scotland to help develop the sport. This culminated in the first championship being held in May 1962 at Dunkeld, and the formation of the Scottish Orienteering Association. Later visitors from Sweden included Jan Kjellstr√∂m, a son of Silva compass founder Alvar Kjellstr√∂m. Kjellstr√∂m played an important role in the development of the sport and helped to accelerate developments in orienteering competition, mapping and coaching. Kjellstr√∂m died in a road accident early in the year of 1967. 1967 saw the first Jan Kjellstr√∂m International Festival of Orienteering or \\"JK\\", held in memory of Kjellstr√∂m. Later that year the British Orienteering Federation was formed by the amalgamation of the English and Scottish Associations leading to the first British Orienteering Championships held at Hamsterley Forest. =After the Founding of BOF= With the growth of the sport BOF was founded in 1967, and continued to develop. There were 12 national and regional associations by 1972; the British Schools Orienteering Association joining in 1995 when it was formed to promote orienteering in schools. The Federation's membership had reached around 10,000 by 1998 and the club membership had increased to more 150 clubs. Structure The federation is made up of thirteen constituent associations, one each for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; nine for the English regions; and the British Schools Orienteering Association. The nine English regions are also Members of the English Orienteering Council (EOC).

On 31 March 2008, Pippa Bacca disappeared in Gebze in Turkey. Her body was discovered in the same city on 11 April 2008. The police arrested a man who later led them to her body. \\"Brides on Tour\\" Bacca was part of a world peace effort known as \\"Brides on Tour,\\" for which she and fellow artist Silvia Moro had departed from Milan, Italy on 8 March 2008. The artists, wearing white wedding dresses, then travelled through the Balkans and arrived in Turkey on 20 March 2008. They had planned to hitchhike through the Middle East, their final destination being Jerusalem. Concerning their attire, they reported on their website that \\"That's the only dress we'll carry along ‚Äî with all stains accumulated during the journey.\\" On her sister's hitchhiking plans, and in light of the discovery of her body, her sibling Maria stated to Italian news agency ANSA that \\"Her travels were for an artistic performance and to give a message of peace and of trust, but not everyone deserves trust... We weren't particularly worried because she had been hitchhiking for a lot of time, and thus was capable of avoiding risky situations... She was a determined person when it had to do with working for art.\\" Disappearance Bacca and her companion split up just prior to arriving in Istanbul, planning to meet up again in Beirut. Bacca disappeared after 31 March. Her credit card was reportedly used at noon of that day. Bacca's naked, strangled and decomposing body was found near some bushes near Gebze, about southeast of Istanbul. The man who led the police to her body, Murat Karata≈ü, was detained and arrested after reportedly confessing to raping and strangling Bacca on 31 March after taking her in his Jeep from a gas station. DNA testing suggested that Bacca was raped by multiple people, and not just Karata≈ü. The suspect said he was \\"under the influence of drugs and alcohol\\" and could not remember what happened. He had been traced after he inserted his own SIM card into the victim's mobile phone‚Äîwhich alerted police, since he had a previous conviction for theft. Bacca's own information was wiped from the mobile device, implicating, according to the lawyer for Bacca's family, at least one other accomplice since Karata≈ü could not speak English and left school after the third grade. Reactions The Turkish president Abdullah G√ºl called the Italian president Giorgio Napolitano to express his grief. A commentary in Today's Zaman, while expressing sadness for the woman's death, criticised the supposed obsequiousness of Turkish politicians to \\"foreigners\\" in the Bacca case, writing: \\"Let's face it, if Pippa were a Turk, some people would feel free to say that a hitchhiking woman deserves to be raped.\\" The columnist argued that local problems such as violence against women should be addressed regardless of Turkey's concern for being shamed before foreigners. H√ºrriyet, a top selling Turkish newspaper, printed an article on the murder entitled \\"We are ashamed\\". Film A documentary, La Mari√©e (The Bride), about the story of Bacca, was directed by the French filmmaker Jo√´l Curtz in 2012. This documentary features video archives from her camera that the film team recovered during the shooting of the film.

The poetry produced by and for the Consistori was heavily influenced by the troubadours.Lo gay saber has been referred to as a \\"troubadour revival\\" (Robert Archer, \\"Tradition, Genre, Ethics and Politics in Ausi√†s March's maldit,\\" Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 68:3 (1991:July), p. 376) or even a \\"Proven√ßal renaissance\\" (to be distinguished from the 19th-century renaissance of Joseph Roumanille and Fr√©d√©ric Mistral). The Consistori's chief purpose was to promote \\"correct\\" styles and themes and discourage vices (vicis) by awarding prizes in competition to poets who adhered to the \\"rules\\" of poetic composition. The names of few poets laureate have come down to us and despite some excellent descriptions of the Consistori's activities, associated persons and poems are obscure. Prehistory and origins Floral decoration from a privilege of Ferdinand I given to the Consistori in 1413 At Pentecost, 31 May 1338, a contest was held at Lleida before Peter the Ceremonious, John's predecessor, at which those poems adjudged the best were given awards.Roger Boase (1977), The Origin and Meaning of Courtly Love: A Critical Study of European Scholarship (Manchester: Manchester University Press, .), 6, refers to Peter's promotion of \\"Proven√ßal\\" poetry and also to a mysterious annexation of Toulouse in 1344, but the historical annexation of 1344 was of the Kingdom of Majorca. A panel of judges was designated in advance by the king. It was to pass judgement super arte dictandi et faciendi pulcra carmina sive cantars: \\"on the art of speaking and composing beautiful songs, that is, cantars\\".Mart√≠ de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 565. The winning poets received a rosa d'or (golden rose) and piece of expensive golden satin called diasprell. With its floral prize, the 1338 contest emulated the jocs florals (floral games) already being held in Toulouse and to be held eventually in Barcelona as well. Much about this event, however, remains unknown: the language of composition was vernacular (cantars), but which vernacular is uncertain (Occitan or Catalan), and the names of the poets or any portions of their work have not survived. Nonetheless, Mart√≠ de Riquer presumes that similar festivals occurred in years prior and recurred in subsequent years, though there are no records. It need not be assumed that such contests took place in the royal presence; they may have been held by the great lords. At Valencia on 20 February 1393, John the Hunter founded an annual festival (la festa de la Gaya Sci√®ncia) to be celebrated in honour of the Virgin Mary on the day of Annunciation (15 May) or the following Sunday at Barcelona.Riquer, 565. King John had a very high view of the miraculous, curing properties of the Gay Science. It could, for example, make rudes erudit (the rude erudite), inertes excitat (excite the inert), occulta elicit (draw out the occulted), and obscura lucidat (lighten the dark), or so wrote John in his act of foundation, now folios 149-50 in reg. 1924 of the Arxiu de la Corona d'Arag√≥ (Boase, 54 n12). The festival included a vernacular poetry contest, modelled after those held in Toulouse, Paris, and other illustrious cities,The poetic academy of Toulouse is well known, that of Paris is only mentioned here, and the other unspecified cities remain unidentified. One poet, Jacme Scriv√†, has been tentatively connected with the Paris contests. and the poems submitted were judged by Jaume March II and Luys d'Aver√ß√≥, entitled magistros et defensores (teachers and defenders) of poetry.Riquer, 567, sees in this a parallel to the chivalric passage of arms, where one knight (or several) defends a pass while another (or several) adventures to pass through it. Similarly, the judges, mantenidors, maintain the integrity of the Gay Science from \\"adventurous\\" composers. The document of the king's foundation, which was written up by the scribe Bartomeu Sirvent, also mentions that the initiative for the festival had been March and Aver√ß√≥'s and that they had requested it of the king. The expertise of judges for the festival was also set out by the king, in Latin: , that is, \\"gay and joyful, and by another name inventive science\\".Riquer, 566. The Latin terms and were direct translations of the vernacular terms gay sauber (gay science) and ci√®ncia de trobar (science of troubadour composition). Competitions The first recorded contest held by the Consistori de Barcelona was held probably on 28 March 1395 with the king in attendance. He had only been in Barcelona since 25 March. This festival is known from a letter the king wrote, which he sent on 19 February 1396 recording the bella festa ... a honor de la dita gaya ci√®ncia, the prizes for which were provided by the municipal government.Riquer, 567. There is no record of the names of the winners, the prizes, or their poems. The letter of 1396 was written in Catalan by Bernat Metge on behalf of the king and sent from Perpignan to Barcelona, foretelling the king's arrival for the festival and asking the city to commit some funds to it. Jaume March brought the letter before the Consell dels Cents Jurats sometime in the middle of march, but the timing was horrible. The Consell was intriguing against the king and the city had largely rejected his control. Then the Consell dels Trenta sent an embassy to John to report on el fet de la gaya sci√®ncia, but the city's response was que les dites joies no sien donades per la Ciutat (that the aforesaid jewellery shall not be donated by the City) and that was the end of the year's floral games.Riquer, 568. The place of competition, the square of the Palau Reial Major John died two months later, having only held two of his planned annual festivals (1394 and 1395). The festival disappeared for two more years until 1 May 1398, when John's successor, Martin the Humane, agreed, from Zaragoza, to subsidise the Consistori's annual festival, to be held again on Pentecost, with forty Aragonese gold florins to cover the cost of the golden and silver prizes for the winners, to be chosen by mantenidors named by the king. On 12 August 1399 at Zaragoza, Martin renominated Jaume March and Luys d'Aver√ß√≥ as rectors, maintainers, and defenders of the Gaya Sci√®ncia de Barcelona. Martin's two acts do not refer to the previous efforts of King John and rather seem to treat the Consistori as a new royal foundation distinct from the municipally- run foundation of his predecessor. Martin's 1398 act also made mention of Toulouse and Paris (again) in a lengthy preamble outlining the merits of the various sciences: arithmetic, astrology, dialectic, geometry, law, medicine, music, politics, strategy, composing (trobar), theology, etc. Under Martin a great festa was held in 1408 beneath the walls where the Mirador del rei Mart√≠ --a recent addition the royal palace complex--and the Palau del Lloctinent meet in Barcelona.Riquer, 571. The Consistori lapsed with Martin's death (1410) and the political confusion leading up to the Compromise of Caspe (1412) prevented its activity, but on 17 March 1413 Ferdinand of Antequera, who succeeded Martin in accord with the Compromise, confirmed to the Consistori (consistorio, collegio seu cetu inventorum) all that Martin had decreed in 1398, conceded to it the right to elect the four maintainers, and permitted it to meet at any time of the year other than the annual festival.Riquer, 574. The annual contest was confirmed to occur on 1 May, and Ferdinand became its greatest patron. His ties to Castile helped increase the accessibility of Catalan (and Occitan) culture and was a catalyst for the first Castilian poetic treatise, the Arte de trovar.Boase, 7. Speeches of Felip de Malla In February 1413, one month before Ferdinand's privilege, the Consistori held one of its best-recorded competitions at the Palau Reial Major. The opening speech (presuposici√≥) of one of the maintainers (the master of theology, Felip de Malla) and the declaration of the winner have both been preserved. Both of these speeches were transcribed (and presumably delivered) in a Catalan liberally seasoned with classical and ecclesiastical Latin. Felip displays knowledge of classics, of Pindar, Alcaeus, Horace, Catullus, and Serenus Sammonicus. Not surprisingly from a master of theology, it is intensely religious: {  :Per tal com D√©us √©s rei de tot la terra, monarca, pr√≠ncep, preceptor, provisor, administrador e triunfador universal, vostres metres, ¬°oh trobadors estudiosos!, vostres gais e ret√≤rics dictats, sien limats, brunits, cementats, soldats e ormejats ab dol√ß estil, mesura e comp√†s de sancta saviesa . . .  :For as God is king of all the earth, monarch, prince, preceptor, provider, administrator and universal conqueror, our poems, o studious troubadours, our gay and rhetorical words, are being filed, burnished, cemented, brazed and outfitted by the sweet style, measuring rod, and compass of the holy wisdom . . . } Felip's speeches are interesting and very erudite, but he shows a penchant for Scholastic digressions and tolerated only religious poetry dedicated to God or the Virgin. Felip praises Ferdinand, who was apparently present, for lending prestige to the Consistori (collegi). He then presents the theme. In light of the fact that Ferdinand is involved in a war with the James II, Count of Urgell, Felip asks for short, sharp pieces about war, namely, for a sirventes. Felip's closing speech is similar in style to his opening, being filled with Latin references and lengthy commentary, but absent is the mention of the winner's name or poem. Probably the speech was written in advance of the final judgement before a winner was known.Riquer, 576. Description of Enrique de Villena One of the best descriptions of the Consistori de Barcelona is found in the Arte de trovar of the Castilian writer Enrique de Villena, who was at Barcelona in 1408. Though written in 1423, it probably describes the Consistori during the era of Martin the Humane as well. Enrique's account of the foundation of the Consistori, however, is a jumble of historical events that took places decades and almost centuries apart: {  :El consistorio de la Gaya Sciencia se form√≥ en Francia, en la cibdad de Tolosa, por Ram√≥n Vidal de Besald√∫, esmer√°ndose con aquellas reglas los entendidos de los grosseros. . . . Este Ram√≥n, por ser comen√ßador, no fabl√≥ tan complidamente. Sucedi√≥le Jofre de Fox√°, monge negro, e dilat√≥ la materia, llamando a la obra que hizo Continuaci√≥n de trobar. . . . Vino despu√©s d'√©ste de Mallorca Verenguel de Troya, e fizo un libro de figuras y colores rept√≥ricos. . . .Riquer, 569-70\\\\. This passage confuses the following: Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun, who wrote the grammar Razos de trobar in the early 13th century; Jofre de Foix√†, a Benedictine monk, who wrote a continuation of Raimon's work called the Regles de trobar in the late thirteenth century; and Berenguer d'Anoia, who was from Majorca, and who wrote his own grammar treatise entitled Mirall de trobar (c. 1300). Enrique does seem to understand that the consistory of Toulouse, the collegio de Tholosa de trobadores, was founded later and correctly attaches to its name the Leys d'amor of Guilhem Molinier, the Doctrinal of Raimon de Cornet (\\"persona no mucho entendido\\"), and the Comentari (\\"de los vicios esquivadores\\") of Joan de Castellnou. El rey don Joan de Arag√≥n, primero d'este nombre, fijo del rey don Pedro segundo, fizo solepne embaxada al rey de Francia pidi√©ndole mandase al collegio de los trobadores que viniesen a plantar en su reyno el estudio de la gaya sciencia, e obt√∫volo, e fundaron estudio d'ello en la √ßibdat de Barcelona dos mantenedores que vinierion de Tolosa para esto.Riquer, 570. Peter the Ceremonious was Peter II as King of Valencia.  :The consistory of the Gay Science was formed in France, in the city of Toulouse, by Raimon Vidal of Besal√∫, polishing with those rules the understanding of the uncouth. . . . This Raimon, by being the founder, did not discuss everything completely. He was succeeded by Jofre de Foix√†, a black monk, who expanded the material, calling his work A Continuation of Inventing. . . . After came this one from Majorca, Berenguer d'Anoia, and he mad a book of rhetorical figures and devices. . . . The king don John of Aragon, first of this name, son of the king don Peter the second, made a solemn embassy to the king of France asking him to send to the college of troubadours that they might plant in his kingdom the study of the gay science, and he obtained it, and two maintainers that had come from Toulouse for this founded the study of it in the city of Barcelona. } Enrique is the sole authority for the statement that John the Hunter sent an embassy to the King of France, Charles VI, evidently before 1393, to request that he send two men from his Consistori at Toulouse to found one at Barcelona. According to Jer√≥nimo Zurita in his (Zaragoza: D. a Portonariis de Ursinus, 1578), in 1388 an embassy was sent to France (\\"so that the vernacular language might be celebrated in Spain, translated from the school of the province of the Narbonnaise: and poetic studies, which is called the gay science, instituted\\").Boase, 53-54 n9. Boase, 7, says the foundation of an imitation of the Toulousain academy took place in Barcelona in 1390, but fails to cite a source. Zurita's source is also unknown. The story is not implausible, however, and may explain the obscure references to Paris in the acts of John and Martin.Henry John Chaytor (1933), A History of Aragon and Catalonia (London: Methuen Publishing), 198, believes the story to be apocryphal. It is also plausible that two scholars left Toulouse with the purpose of founding a second academy at Barcelona, considering the history of Occitan literature in Catalonia.Riquer, 570. Chaytor, 198, finds the story implausible for precisely the reason that March and Aver√ß√≥ were already in Catalonia and not at Toulouse. According to Enrique, who is the only source for the organisational structure of the Consistori, it was run by four mantenidors: a knight, a master of theology, a master of laws, and an honourable citizen. Since all other existing documentation shows John and Martin naming two mantenidors, it follows that Ferdinand of Antequera, under whom Enrique was writing, raised it to four.Riquer, 570. At one point Enrique seems also to say that prizes (vergas de plata, silver rods) were given out each month (cada mes), but this may represent a corruption in the manuscript and should perhaps refer to each year. According to Enrique, the \\"collegio de Barcelona\\" lapsed after the death of Martin in 1410. The sixteenth-century Toledan √Ålvar G√≥mez de Castro glossed the Arte de trobar manuscript with the fact that Enrique came into the service of Ferdinand after his election to succeed Martin in 1412 that he procur√≥ la reformaci√≥n del consistorio y se√±al√°ronle por el principal d'ellos (\\"procured the reformation of the consistory and was marked as the principal among them\\").Riquer, 570 n13. Enrique held a post in the Consistori similar to that of a president, but it is possible that he exaggerated his own importance. Enrique described the festas of the Gay Science as occurring in two sessions, perhaps on two separate days. At the first session, one of the mantenidors gives a lecture (called the presuposici√≥n), then the poets recited their work de la materia a ellos asignada (on the theme assigned to them). The themes were algunas vezes loores de Santa Mar√≠a, otras de armas, otras de amores e de buenas costumbres: sometimes the praises of the Virgin Mary, other times of arms, other times of love and good customs. These three themes were understand by the Romantics as those of faith (f√©), patriotism (patria), and love (amor).Riquer, 572. After the first session, the poems were put into writing and taken by the mantenidors for secret deliberations (the jurat), where the poems were examined for fidelity to the rules and their faults were carefully enumerated. Stress was laid upon the identification of vicis (vices, faults) in the esteemed llibres de l'art (books of the art), the treatises carried by the mantenidors. The second session was held after the judgement was passed and there the winner was declared and the prizes awarded.Riquer, 574, sees another possible comparison to contemporary chivalric practices (this time the hastilude), which were very popular at the time in Spain. Poetic content and style The isolation and their classicism of the Consistoris (of Toulouse and Barcelona) cut them off from the literary movements giving life to other vernaculars, such as the dolce stil novo and the Renaissance in Italian and the work of Ausias March associated with the zenith of medieval Catalan. Mart√≠n de Riquer is highly critical of the negative influence of the Toulousain academy on Catalan poetry through the exportation occitanisms and support of an outmoded literary language. For its thematically limited, narrow conception of art and imposing rules for form and content, he compares it to French neoclassicism and its \\"tyranny of the monotonous alexandrine\\".Riquer, 352: \\"tiranitzar pels mon√≤tons alexandrins\\". All these bad influences continued their negative effect from Barcelona, where the rhetorical style of Toulouse was copied. The picture of judges marking of \\"vices\\" in the margins of the poems submitted for competition is emblematic of the \\"tyranny\\" the rules held over creativity.Riquer, 577. In these respects the Consistori was much like a medieval university. It was also more bourgeois, being essentially created by citizens for citizens, with their tastes and their concerns in mind. The essential difference between the activities and the poetry of the Consistori and that of the earlier troubadours is that the latter composed (originally) in a courtly environment and share courtly tastes and concerns. In this respect the movement mirrored that of the dolce stil novo in Italy, but it was less successful. The failure of the city of Barcelona to support the Consistori and its falling back on royal patronage in 1396 best exemplifies the problems of consciously continuing the troubadour tradition in an atmosphere that was not made for it. Few poems have survived from the Consistori's contests, preserved in chansonniers with other troubadour songs. The Can√ßoner dels Masdovelles is one of the most important songbooks, yet only three songs can be connected to the Consistori de Barcelona with any certainty. Gilabert de Pr√≥xita wrote Le souvenirs qu'amors fina me porta, a secular song on love, in the manner of the troubadours. According to its forty-second line, it was presented al novell consistori (to the new consistory), probably the re-creation of Martin the Humane. Andreu Febrer composed Sobre.l pus naut element de tots quatre, an astrological and mythological panegyric for an unnamed queen of Sicily. It alludes to the cossistori, but this may be a reference to some competition held in Sicily. Another troubadour with surviving work presented at Barcelona is Guillem de Masdovelles, who also competed (and won) at Toulouse. His canso of love Pus li prat son de verdura guarnit was \\"coronada\\" (crowned) the winner at a contest in Barcelona. Guillem's work is written in an Occitan sprinkled with catalanisms and Andreu's in Catalan with occitanisms. Apparently, the language of the poetry presented at the Catalan consistori was not constant (besides being romance). Guillem's nephew, Joan Berenguer de Masdovelles, did translate his uncle's winning poem from llemov√≠ (Occitan) into Catalan.For Guillem de Masdovelles at the contests of Toulouse and Barcelona, see Riquer, 688-90. Joan Berenguer's translations of his uncle's Occitan works demonstrates the conscious use of a literary idiom as opposed to the language of conversation and the consciously archaic nature of occitanisms in Catalan writing.Riquer, 689. For the differences between early fifteenth-century literary Catalan and Occitan see Le temps presens de guaya primavera by Guillem and its translation, Lo temps present de bella primavera, by his nephew. Legacy and influence The Consistori of Barcelona is generally considered a transitional period in Catalan literature, away from the prestigious treatment of Occitan and the pervasiveness of occitanisms and towards an independent Catalan poetry. In many respects it is the last phase of medieval literature and of the troubadours, opening the way to what can be considered Renaissance literature in Catalan.Isabel de Riquer (1989), \\"La literatura francesa en la Corona de Arag√≥n en el reinado de Pedro el Ceremonioso (1336-1387),\\" Im√°genes de Francia en las letras hisp√°nicas, Colloquy at the University of Barcelona, 15-18 November 1988, coord. by Francisco Lafarga Maduell (Barcelona, ), p. 125. The Consistori, or more specifically the Gay Science that it fostered in the Iberian peninsula, extended its influence slowly over Castile and Portugal to the west. Enrique de Villena's Castilian Arte de trovar was probably written with the intention of exhorting its dedicatee, the Marqu√©s de Santillana, to found and patronise a Consistori in Castile modelled after the Barcelonan example: {  :. . . vos informado por el dicho tratado seas originidat donde tomen lumbre, y dotrina todos los otros del Regno que se dizen trobadores, para que lo sean verdaderamente.  :. . . that you might be informed by the said treatise of the origin from which they obtain this light and this teaching, they all the others of the realm, who are called \\"troubadours\\", because they are truly such. } Somehow anyway the Marqu√©s did absorb the concept of the Gay Science, for he wrote to Duke Pedro of Coimbra a famous letter, Prohemio e carta, which extols the divinely inspired, charismatic yet frenetic nature of the gaya s√ßien√ßia. This conception of the troubadours' art was fundamentally altered by the infusion of neoplatonism that came with the Renaissance and Italian influence.Boase, 7, who quotes the Marqu√©s in full with regards to the attributes of the gay science: un zelo √ßeleste, una affecti√≥n divina, un isa√ßiable √ßibo del √°nimo; el qual, as√Ω como la materia busca la forma e lo imperfecto la perfecci√≥n, nunca esta s√ßien√ßia de la poesia e gaya s√ßien√ßia buscaron nin se fallaron, sinon en los √°nimos gentiles, claros ingenios e elevados sp√≠ritus (\\"a celestial zeal, a divine affection, an insatiable appetite of the soul; which, as matter seeks form and the imperfect perfection, never do this science of poetry and this gay science seek nor be found but in the gentle souls, clear geniuses, and elevated spirits\\"). Nonetheless, Spanish poetry of the fifteenth century, more so than anywhere else, sought to emulate classic Occitan poetry. Alfonso the Magnanimous in particular, despite his classicism, brought a distinctly medieval, Occitan, and troubadour-esque poetry to Naples with his 1443 conquest. This Spanish literary tradition at Naples remained outside Renaissance currents. In Spain, troubadour scholarship got off to a quick start in the sixteenth century, but the influence of the Consistori can hardly be spoken of past the mid-fifteenth century.

In 1901, The Ladies Home Journal featured her and six other photographers as \\"The Foremost Women Photographers in America\\".Ladies Home Journal November 1901 In 2008, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery mounted an exhibition dedicated solely to Ben-Yusuf's work, re-establishing her as a key figure in the early development of fine art photography.Zaida Ben Yusuf exhibition at the Smithsonian  Biography  =Early life= Ben- Yusuf was born as Esther Zeghdda Ben Youseph Nathan in London, England, on 21 November 1869, the eldest daughter of a German mother, Anna Kind Ben-Youseph Nathan and an Algerian father, Mustapha Moussa Ben Youseph Nathan.Chronology of Zaida Ben-Yusuf, 1869‚Äì1898 on the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery website, accessed 30 March 2009 By 1881, her mother was living in Ramsgate and working as a governess after separating from her husband and four daughters {Zaida (aged 11), Heidi (8), Leila (4) and Pearl (3)}. Later in 1888, Anna Ben-Yusuf emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts where she had established a milliner's shop on Washington Street in Boston by 1891. In 1895, Ben-Yusuf followed in her mother's footsteps and emigrated to the United States where she worked as a milliner at 251 Fifth Avenue, New York. She continued this for some time after becoming a photographer, writing occasional articles for Harpers Bazaar and The Ladies Home Journal on millinery.Chronology of Zaida Ben-Yusuf, 1898‚Äì1900 on the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery website, accessed 30 March 2009 Harpers Bazaar, Vol. 30 No. 5, published 30 January 1897 =Photography career= The Odor of Pomegranates (1899) In 1896, Ben-Yusuf began to be known as a photographer. In April 1896, two of her pictures were reproduced in The Cosmopolitan Magazine, and another study was exhibited in London as part of an exhibition put on by The Linked Ring. She traveled to Europe later that year, where she met with George Davison, one of the co-founders of The Linked Ring, who encouraged her to continue her photography. She exhibited at their annual exhibitions until 1902. In the spring of 1897, Ben-Yusuf opened her portrait photography studio at 124 Fifth Avenue, New York. On 7 November 1897, the New York Daily Tribune ran an article about Ben-Yusuf's studio and her work creating advertising posters, which was followed by another profile in Frank Leslie's Weekly on 30 December. Through 1898, she became increasingly popular as a photographer, with ten of her works in the National Academy of Design-hosted 67th Annual Fair of the American Institute. This was where her portrait of actress Virginia Earle won her third place in the Portraits and Groups class. During November 1898, Ben-Yusuf and Frances Benjamin Johnston held a two-woman show with their works at the Camera Club of New York. Elsie Leslie as Lydia Languish in Sheridan's play The Rivals (1899) In 1899, Ben-Yusuf met with F. Holland Day in Boston, and was photographed by him. She relocated her studio to 578 Fifth Avenue, and exhibited in a number of exhibitions, including the second Philadelphia Photographic Salon. She was also profiled in a number of publications, including an article on female photographers in The American Amateur Photographer, and a long piece in The Photographic Times in which Sadakichi Hartmann described her as an \\"interesting exponent of portrait photography\\". In 1896 Ben-Yusuf was included in an exhibition organized by Linked Ring, Brotherhood of the London and continued to exhibit with them until 1902.Schwendener, Martha. \\"Ben-Yusuf, Zaida.\\" Grove Art Online. 11 Feb. 2013; Accessed 26 Mar. 2020. https://www-oxfordartonline- com.ezproxy.ithaca.edu/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7002229182. In 1900, Ben-Yusuf corresponded with Johnston about an exhibition of American women photographers in Paris timed to coincide with the Universal Exposition. Ben-Yusuf had five portraits in the show, which traveled to Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Washington, D.C. She was also exhibited in Holland Day's exhibition, The New School of American Photography, for the Royal Photographic Society in London, and had four photographs selected by Alfred Stieglitz for the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901, Scotland.Chronology of Zaida Ben-Yusuf, 1901‚Äì1906 on the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery website, accessed 30 March 2009. \\"Chronology of Zaida Ben-Yusuf, 1898‚Äì1900\\", 31 October 2018 Elbert Hubbard c. 1900 In 1901, Ben-Yusuf wrote an article, \\"Celebrities Under the Camera\\", for the Saturday Evening Post, where she described her experiences with her sitters. By this stage she had photographed Grover Cleveland, Franklin Roosevelt, and Leonard Wood, amongst others. For the September issue of Metropolitan Magazine she wrote another article, \\"The New Photography ‚Äì What It Has Done and Is Doing for Modern Portraiture\\", where she described her work as being more artistic than most commercial photographers, but less radical than some of the better-known art photographers. The Ladies Home Journal that November declared her to be one of the \\"foremost women photographers in America\\", as she began the first of a series of six illustrated articles on \\"Advanced Photography for Amateurs\\" in the Saturday Evening Post. Ben-Yusuf was listed as a member of the first American Photographic Salon when it opened in December 1904, although her participation in exhibitions was beginning to drop off. In 1906, she showed one portrait in the third annual exhibition of photographs at Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts, the last known exhibition of her work in her lifetime. =Travels to Japan= Ekai Kawaguchi, a Japanese Buddhist monk (1904) In 1903, Ben-Yusuf traveled to Japan, where she toured Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, Kyoto( where she rented a house), Tokyo and Nikk≈ç. This tour formed the basis for a series of four illustrated articles, \\"Japan Through My Camera\\", published in the Saturday Evening Post from 23 April 1904. In February 1905, her essay on Kyoto appeared in Booklovers Magazine and Leslie's Monthly Magazine published an illustrated article on \\"Women in Japan\\". She also wrote about Japanese architecture and lectured on the subject, with some of her photographs illustrating a January 1906 article by Katharine Budd in Architectural Record, for which she submitted an article, \\"The Period of Daikan\\", which appeared the next month. In 1906, she published three photographs from a visit to Capri in the September issue of Photo Era, and in 1908, wrote three essays on life in England for the Saturday Evening Post. She returned to New York in November 1908, but was back in London the following year. The London phone book for 1911 listed her as a photographer in Chelsea.Chronology of Zaida Ben-Yusuf, 1907‚Äì1933 on the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery website, accessed 30 March 2009 In 1912, Sadakichi Hartmann wrote that Ben-Yusuf had given up photography, and was living in the South Sea Islands. On 15 September, following the outbreak of World War I and the German invasion of France, Ben-Yusuf returned to New York from Paris, where she had been living at the time. She applied for naturalization in 1919, describing herself as a photographer, and taking ten years off her age. She continued to travel, visiting Cuba in 1920 and Jamaica in 1921. =Later life= Ben-Yusuf took a post with the Reed Fashion Service in New York City in 1924, and lectured at local department stores on fashion related subjects. In 1926, she was appointed style director for the Retail Millinery Association of New York, an organisation for which she later became director. By 1930, census records showed that Ben-Yusuf had married a textile designer, Frederick J. Norris. She died three years later on 27 September in the Methodist Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn. Exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery Ben-Yusuf's work was the subject of an exhibition, Zaida Ben-Yusuf: New York Portrait Photographer at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, which ran from 11 April through 1 September 2008. The curator, Frank H. Goodyear III, first learned about Ben-Yusuf when he discovered two of her photographs in 2003, depicting Daniel Chester French and Everett Shinn, and set forth to discover more about a photographer who had been almost completely forgotten. Goodyear suggested that gender discrimination might have led to Ben-Yusuf being forgotten, despite her significant contributions towards developing photography as a medium of artistic expression. Photographic history had tended to focus on male photographers such as Stieglitz, and less so on the female photographers, even though it was one of the few occupations considered a respectable career for a single woman in late 19th and early 20th century New York. Even in relatively progressive New York, where innovators in the arts, science, journalism and politics gathered, it was difficult for a single professional woman to support herself. Another reason for Ben-Yusuf's obscurity was that she had not bequeathed a significant archive of her work to a single institution, making it difficult to pull together enough examples to give her career the appropriate historical assessment. Goodyear's exhibition at the Smithsonian acted as a showcase for Ben-Yusuf's work, re-establishing her as a key figure in fine art photographic history.

As the Pedi paramount leader he was faced with political challenges from boer settlers, the independent South African Republic (Dutch: Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek) the British Empire, and considerable social change caused by Christian missionaries. Sekhukhune was the son of Sekwati I, and succeeded him upon his death in 20 September 1861 after forcibly taking the throne from his half-brother and the heir apparent Mampuru II. His other known siblings were; Legolwana, Johannes Dinkwanyane, and Kgoloko. Sekhukhune married Legoadi IV in 1862, and lived at a mountain, now known as or Leolo Mountains which he fortified. To strengthen his kingdom and to guard against European colonisation, he had his young subjects work in white mines and on farms so that their salaries could be used to buy guns from the Portuguese in Delagoa Bay, as well as livestock. Sekhukhune fought two notable wars. The first war was successfully fought in 1876, against the ZAR and their Swazi allies. The second war, against the British and Swazi in 1879 in what became known as the Sekhukhune Wars, was less successful. Sekhukhune was detained in Pretoria until 1881. After a return to his kingdom, he was fatally stabbed by an assassin in 1882, at Manoge. The assassins are presumed to have been sent by his brother and competitor, Mampuru II.  Sekhukhune Wars  = First Sekhukhune War = On 16 May 1876, President Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers of the South African Republic (Transvaal) declared war against Sekhukhune and the Pedi. Sekhukhune managed to defeat the Transvaal army on 1 August 1876. Bergers' government later launched another attack by hiring the services of the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps commanded by a German mercenary, Conrad von Schlickmann (killed later that year in a Pedi ambush), but it was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties, mediated by Alexander Merensky, signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo. The Boers inability to subdue Sekhukhune and the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of Paul Kruger and the British annexation of the South African Republic(Transvaal) on 12 April 1877 by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, secretary for native affairs of Natal. = Second Sekhukhune War = Although the British had first condemned the Transvaal war against Sekhukhune, it was continued after the annexation. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until Sir Garnet Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis. On 2 December 1879, Sekhukhune was captured and on 9 December 1879 he was imprisoned in Pretoria. = Aftermath = On 3 August, 1881, the Pretoria Convention was signed, which stipulated in Article 23 that Sekhukhune would be released. Because his capital had been burned to the ground, he left for a place called Manoge. On 13 August 1882, Sekhukhune was murdered by his half-brother Mampuru II, who claimed to be the lawful king. Mampuru was captured by the Boers, tried for murder and hanged in Pretoria in 21 November 1883.  Legacy  After his death, Bopedi (Pedi kingdom) was divided into small powerless units conducted by the native commissioners. His grandson Sekhukhune II in an effort to rebuild the Bapedi kingdom launched an unsuccessful war against the South African Republic. The defeat marked the end of Pedi resistance against foreign forces. The London Times, which at the time was not known to report on the deaths of African leaders, published an article on 30 August 1882, acknowledging his resistance against the Boers and the British: The Sekhukhune District Municipality in Limpopo Province has been named after him in 2000; the area is also known as Sekhukhuneland. Making him the only African royal to have a district and region named after him.

The first prototype, called the Ayota Modem, has a maximum speed of only 300 bit/s, too slow to render fullscreen NES quality graphics typical of an action game. It was unveiled at the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it received a fairly good reception. Bushnell later dropped out of the project, and Keith Rupp founded the company Baton Technologies. He continued to develop the modem, changing its name to the Teleplay Modem, increasing the speed to 2400 bit/s. He conceived the idea of allowing cross-platform play between compatibly designed games for Nintendo and Sega systems. Three games were developed internally (Battle Storm, Terran Wars, and Sea Battle) but never released. Both Nintendo and Sega refused to license the Teleplay Modem or the games developed for it. Sega instead licensed AT&T; and PF Magic to develop a modem for the Sega Genesis called the Edge 16, but AT&T; ultimately dropped plans to release the device so that they could devote their attentions to developing new telephone technologies. The venture capitalists behind Baton Technologies feared competing against AT&T; and attempting to sell hardware and games without the all-important licensing, so Baton was unable to fulfill its first $300,000 order, and quickly folded thereafter in mid-1993. In an unrelated venture, Catapult Entertainment later developed the 2400 bit/s XBand modem, similar to the Teleplay Modem in many respects. Although well funded by Viacom, Catapult failed to receive sufficient developer and gamer backing, folding in early 1997.

EMDB entry . Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a large, multisubunit, oxygen-carrying, metalloprotein that is found in the hemolymph of the giant keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata, a species of keyhole limpet that lives off the coast of California, from Monterey Bay to Isla Asuncion off Baja California. Protein properties There are two keyhole limpet hemocyanin genes, termed KLH1 and KLH2 which share around 60% identity at the protein level. Both encode large glycosylated proteins consisting of around 3400 amino acids and a molecular weight of around 390,000 Daltons, excluding the glycosylation. The protein oligomerises to form a barrel shaped didecameric complex which is composed of 20 monomers. Each domain of a KLH subunit contains two copper atoms that together bind a single oxygen molecule (O2). When oxygen is bound to hemocyanin, the molecule takes on a distinctive transparent, opalescent blue color, due to the Cu2+ state of the copper. In the absence of oxygen, the bound copper is found as Cu1+ and hemocyanin is colorless. The KLH protein is potently immunogenic, but does not cause an adverse immune response in humans. It is therefore highly prized as a vaccine carrier protein. Because of its size and glycosylation, KLH protein cannot be reproduced synthetically; it is available only as a purified biological product from the keyhole limpet Megathura crenulata. Purification KLH is purified from the hemolymph of Megathura crenulata by a series of steps that typically includes ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis, and may involve chromatographic purification to obtain the highest purity. KLH purification may also include endotoxin removal, but this step is often unnecessary because the endotoxin serves as an adjuvant when injected for antibody production. If the protein becomes denatured or if the copper ions are lost in the purification process, the opalescent blue color disappears and the solution becomes a dull grayish color. Denaturation of KLH also results in a tendency of the protein to aggregate and precipitate from solution. Use in biotechnology Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is used extensively as a carrier protein in the production of antibodies for research, biotechnology and therapeutic applications. Haptens are substances with a low molecular weight such as peptides, small proteins and drug molecules that are generally not immunogenic and require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate a response from the immune system in the form of antibody production. KLH is the most widely employed carrier protein for this purpose. KLH is an effective carrier protein for several reasons. Its large size and numerous epitopes generate a substantial immune response, and abundance of lysine residues for coupling haptens allows a high hapten:carrier protein ratio, increasing the likelihood of generating hapten-specific antibodies. In addition, because KLH is derived from the limpet, a gastropod, it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins, thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms. KLH can also be a challenging molecule to work with because of its propensity to aggregate and precipitate. Aggregates remain immunogenic, but limit the ability to conjugate haptens, and are difficult to manipulate in the laboratory. A high-quality KLH preparation with clear opalescent blue color is the best indicator of KLH solubility. Hapten coupling Haptens can be coupled to KLH using several methods. A simple one-step coupling can be performed using the carbodiimide crosslinker EDC to covalently attach carboxyls to primary amines. This method is the simplest to perform and the \\"random\\" orientation allows for antibody generation against all possible epitopes, but it generally results in some degree of polymerization, which decreases solubility making the conjugate more difficult to handle. KLH can be activated with the crosslinker Sulfo-SMCC, which converts lysine residues to sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide groups. A sulfhydryl-containing hapten can then be reacted with the KLH to complete the immunogen without causing polymerization. The specificity of this reaction is ideal for situations where the cysteine is located away from the desired epitope (e.g. in peptides where a terminal cysteine can be added to either end of the peptide). Maleimide activated KLH, where the first part of this two step procedure has been completed, is commercially available. Other carrier proteins *Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (marketed as Blue Carrier) *Bovine serum albumin (BSA) *Cationized BSA (cBSA) *Ovalbumin Use in cancer therapy KLH is being tested in a variety of cancer vaccines, including non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous melanoma, breast and bladder cancer. These vaccines contain specific tumor-associated antigens conjugated to KLH to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses which can destroy tumor cells. The rapidly growing interest in therapeutic vaccines (i.e. active immunotherapies) for cancer and the documented efficacy of KLH as a superior carrier protein for cancer vaccines are creating a significant biopharmaceutical market for KLH formulations. Assays to monitor humoral immune responses against KLH in human serum have been developed to facilitate optimal use of biomedical KLH applications. Ecological considerations Because of the beneficial uses of KLH, the Giant Keyhole Limpet, from which KLH is derived, has been a subject of growing concern among fisheries biologists in the state of California due to the possibility of overharvest of the species for commercial purposes. Giant Keyhole Limpets are not an abundant species to begin with, and some divers have reported a decline in their populations. In a 2006 report from the Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, scientists state that they are \\"very concerned about the emerging fishery\\" for Giant Keyhole Limpets and suggest the potential exists to \\"decimate their populations\\". To help assure a secure long-term source of KLH for the many Federally sponsored biomedical research programs using KLH, Federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have also sponsored research to establish sustainable mariculture production of the Giant Keyhole Limpet.

It employs a variety of initiatives that include multi-year policy programs, conferences on issues of French-American interest, and leadership and professional exchanges of decision-makers from France and the United States. Founded in 1976, the Foundation is an operating organization that relies on outside financial support to carry out its mission and does not provide grants. It is an independent, non-partisan, nonprofit organization.  History  The idea was born in 1973 between Ambassador James G. Lowenstein, James Chace, editor-in- chief of Foreign Affairs, both members of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank, and Nicholas Wahl, a specialist of post-war France at Princeton University. In order to counter an anti-French sentiment within the State Department, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the press, as well as anti-Americanism among the French elite, the three men grew the desire to create a structure dedicated to friendship between the U.S.A. and its oldest ally, and outside government control, unlike the existing exchange programs led by the State Department since 1941.  Young Leaders  The Young Leaders program is the flagship program of the French-American Foundation. The program was created in 1981, under the sponsorship of Princeton French- American economist who remained its president until 2000. It was initially intended as a response to observations that the close working relationships between French and American leaders in the post-war period were waning as new, younger leaders rose with little exposure to their transatlantic counterparts. 38 years later, it still plays a key role in the creation of transatlantic bonds, with more than 500 leaders in government, business, media, military, culture and the non-profit sector having taken part. Every year, juries in France and the United States select a small group (around twenty) of French and Americans between 30 and 40, that are destined to hold a leadership position in their field and to play an important role in a globalized world. The selected Young Leaders then participate in two five-day seminars, alternatively in the U.S. and France, with the opportunity to discuss issues of common concern and, more importantly, get to know each other and create durable bonds. = Notable alumni = Young Leaders alumni include prominent Americans such as: * Former President Bill Clinton * Former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton * Executive Dina Powell * Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti * Senator Evan Bayh * Senator Bill Bradley * Entrepreneur Auren Hoffman * General Wesley Clark * Former White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten * Former World Bank President Robert Zoellick * Oscar-winning filmmaker Charles Ferguson * Frank Herringer (Transamerica Corporation) * John Thain (CIT Group) * Journalist Gwen Ifill Notable French participants include: * French President Emmanuel Macron * Former French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe * Former French President Fran√ßois Hollande * Astronaut Thomas Pesquet * Pierre Moscovici * Arnaud Montebourg * Najat Vallaud-Belkacem * Fleur Pellerin * Former Prime Minister Alain Jupp√© * Henri de Castries (AXA) * Alexandre de Juniac (Air France-KLM) * Michel Combes (Alcatel-Lucent) * Fr√©d√©ric Lemoine (Wendel) * Anne Lauvergeon (former Chair & CEO of AREVA) * Michel Bon (former CEO of France T√©l√©com).

It was built as the centerpiece of the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900. Its construction was instigated in 1892 by Fran√ßois Deloncle (1856‚Äì1922), a member of the French Chambre des D√©put√©s. Since it was built for exhibit purposes within a large metropolis, and its design made it difficult to aim at astronomical objects, it was not suited for scientific use. When the year-long exposition was over, its builders were unable to sell it. It was ultimately broken up for scrap; the lenses are still stored away at the Paris Observatory. Design The telescope: overall side view (top); the siderostat (left) and lens tube (right); ocular lens end (inset) The telescope had two interchangeable objective lenses (for visual and photographic use respectively) in diameter, with a focal length of . Due to its extremely large size, the telescope was mounted in a fixed horizontal position. Light from astronomical objects was redirected into the optical tube assembly via a Foucault siderostat, a movable plane mirror in diameter, mounted in a large cast-iron frame at the objective lens end of the telescope. The horizontal steel tube was long. The telescope‚Äôs eyepiece/plate end could be shifted five feet on rails for focusing. With the lowest power of 500√ó, the field of view was 3 arc minutes. Construction of the telescope The eye-piece holder The mirror for the siderostat was ground mechanically by the Gautier Company (headed by Paul Gautier, 1842‚Äì1909) and took nine months to finish. The blank for the mirror was cast by Georges Despret, director of the Jeumont glassworks in northern France. The lens blanks were cast by √âdouard Mantois (1848‚Äì1900) and ground by Gautier.Launay, pp. 463-466. By the time the Paris Exhibition opened only the object lens for photographic observation was ready. The visual object lens, unfinished, was put on display nearby. Erection of the telescope The instrument in place The telescope was erected in the Palais de l‚ÄôOptique on the Champ de Mars, near the Eiffel Tower. The tube, oriented north-south, was made up of 24 cylinders in diameter and rested on 7 concrete and steel pillars; its axis was above the floor. The room at the end which housed siderostat with the mirror had a movable dome to allow direct access to the sky.Launay, pp. 467-468. Scientific observations A few scientific observations were made using the giant telescope, even though it was not designed for scientific use. Th√©ophile Moreux (1867‚Äì1954) observed sunspots through the telescope and made drawings of them. And Eug√®ne Michel Antoniadi (1870‚Äì1944) made several drawings of nebulae. As well several large photographs of the surface of the Moon, made by Charles Le Morvan (1865‚Äì1933), were published in the Strand Magazine, November 1900.Launay, pp. 471-473. Aftermath An 1892 cartoon ridiculing Fran√ßois Deloncle who proposed the project The company which had organized in 1886 to build the telescope declared bankruptcy after the Expo, and the telescope was put up for auction in 1909. No buyer was found and eventually the components were scrapped. The diameter mirror is on display at the Observatoire de Paris, and two of the lenses have recently been discovered in packing crates in the basement.Launay, p. 468-471. Poor optics were not why the telescope did not work well. The telescope was located at a fair with much light pollution and near a very large city with much air pollution, and near sea level. The tube was not ventilated and the air inside was likely humid. Throughout its existence the telescope was the butt of many derisive jokes and unflattering cartoons. In part this was due to the belief of the academic community that the telescope would be completely useless, which it certainly was as far as science is concerned. As the centrepiece of an exhibition showcasing the best of the recent advances in industry and technology, it nonetheless served a purpose.Launay, pp. 461‚Äì462.

SS Collections: RuSHA (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt) ‚Äì Stenger Historica One of its duties was to oversee the marriages of SS personnel in accordance with the racial policy of Nazi Germany. After Heinrich Himmler introduced the \\"marriage order\\" on December 31, 1931, the RuSHA would only issue a permit to marry once detailed background investigations into the racial fitness of both prospective parents had been completed and proved both of them to be of Aryan descent back to 1800. Formation The RuSHA was founded in 1931 by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and Richard Walther Darr√©, who later rose to the rank of SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer. In 1935, it was upgraded to an SS Main Office. Under its first director, Darr√©, it propagated the Nazi ideology of blood and soil. Darr√© was dismissed by Himmler in 1938 and was succeeded by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer G√ºnther Pancke, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Otto Hofmann in 1940, and SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer Richard Hildebrandt in 1943. The RuSHA was created in part to monitor Himmler's 1931 order that the marital decisions of unmarried SS men should be supervised by the Nazi state. SS men would thereafter have to apply for a marriage permit three months before getting married so that the parents of the fianc√©e could be investigated to ensure her racial purity. With time, the marriage laws became less strict. SS Collections: RuSHA (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt) ‚Äì Stenger Historica Thereafter, in December 1935 Himmler ordered the RuSHA to establish the Lebensborn network of maternity homes, whose purpose was \\"to accommodate and look after racially and genetically valuable expectant mothers.\\" The RuSHA increasingly focused on processing SS marriage applications, genealogy, \\"racial-biological\\" investigations and the social welfare services of SS members. Organization Babies born during the SS Lebensborn program in 1943. In 1935 the RuSHA consisted of seven departments (): *Amt Organisation und Verwaltungsamt () *Amt Rassenamt (Race) *Amt Schulungsamt (Education) *Amt Sippen und Heiratsamt (Family and Marriage) *Amt Siedlungsamt (Settlement) *Amt f√ºr Archiv und Zeitungswesen (Records and Press) *Amt f√ºr Bev√∂lkerungspolitik (Population Policy) In 1940 it was reorganized to create four main departments: *Verwaltungsamt (Administration Office). *Rassenamt (Racial Office), it selected future SS personnel and conducted racial selections. *Heiratsamt (Marriage Office) it controlled the selection of suitable wives by SS men. *Siedlungsamt (Settlement Office), it dealt with the settlement of discharged SS men, especially in the annexed eastern areas. The Race and Settlement Departments were further divided into the Hauptabteilungen (Main Branches). One of these managed welfare and pensions in cooperation with the SS-Hauptf√ºrsorge- und Versorgungsamt (SS Main Welfare and Pension Department) at the Reich Ministry of the Interior. =Leadership= Racial policies By 1937 more than 300 SS men had been expelled from the SS for violating Nazi race laws (Rassenschande), although an order later stated that they could remain if they were already married and could satisfy racial criteria. In November 1940, Himmler reinstated all SS personnel expelled under the marriage laws, provided they met racial requirements of the Nazi Party. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the RuSHA worked in partnership with VOMI in the \\"germanization\\" of captured territory, monitoring of settler welfare, and the plantation of ethnic Germans in areas designated for settlement by the SS, particularly in occupied Ukraine. This involved in part, the resetting of Germans in the Nazi occupied Eastern territories and ejecting the native families from those lands. The RuSHA was also an advisory and executive office for all questions of racial selection. Racial examinations were performed by Rasse und Siedlungs (RUS) leaders or their racial examiners (Eignungspr√ºfer) in connection with: * Cases where sexual intercourse had occurred between Eastern European POWs or workers and Germans * Children born to Eastern European workers * Classification of people of German descent * Selection of enemy nationals, particularly Poles, for slave labour and Germanization * Kidnapping of children suitable for Germanization * Population transfers * The persecution and liquidation of Jews The RuSHA also employed Josef Mengele for a short time from November 1940 to early 1941, in Department II of its Family Office, where he was responsible for \\"care of genetic health\\" and \\"genetic health tests\\". He went on to become one of the team of doctors responsible for the selection of victims to be killed in the gas chambers and for performing deadly human experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp. Postwar Some of the 14 defendants in the RuSHA Trial at Nuremberg read the indictments against them in July 1947. In July 1947, 14 officials from the organization were indicted in the RuSHA Trial and tried by the Allied powers at Nuremberg. All were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes and membership in a criminal organization (the SS). All but one (who was acquitted on the two more serious charges) were found guilty and sentenced to between three and 25 years imprisonment.

Modeled after foreign rock and roll and pop music, Al Jeel became oriented around dance/pop, and had a background similar to reggae. Al Jeel also included many distinctively Egyptian characteristics, somewhat related to past Egyptian musical influences.  Overview  The style was called new wave by many, emphasizing the transition from the first form of Egyptian pop music to spring up in the 1960s, Sha'abi. Sha'abi had sprung up in the slums of Egypt as a type of ghetto music, but after a decade of popularity the educated youth of Egypt began to look for different styles of music. Internationally savvy, high-tech Al Jeel became the music of the educated, well-to-do youth. Sharing common roots with Algerian Ra√Ø and Pop-Ra√Ø, Al-Jeel incorporates Bedouin, Nubian, and Egyptian rhythms with bass and synthesizers.Middle East Report, No. 169, Crossing the Line, (Mar. ‚Äì Apr., 1991), pp. 39‚Äì42 Although radio stations frowned upon the simple lyrics and music of the Al Jeel performers, the under-25 crowd embraced Al Jeel more than any other style of Egyptian music. Jeel usually shares the same central themes with traditional and popular Egyptian music, yet it is usually about love and often about lament rather than joy. As for the sound of al Jeel music itself, just as rock and roll is perceived differently by different people, the same is true of al Jeel. The music style is simple, yet carries with it a beat that one is able to dance to, almost always produced by a Roland TR-707 drum machine. With regard to belly dancers, al Jeel is quite often the genre of choice. Al Jeel, as well as other classical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt, often consists of instruments such as the 'oud, qƒÅn≈´n, rabab, ney, and violin.

Around the same time as the emergence of VXML, a research group at the University of Windsor in Canada were developing an alternative approach, in which speech applications deployed on the web can be accessed by client-side speech browsers which provide the speech-recognition capability, that is tailored to the application by downloading an application-specific recognition grammar from the remote speech application web site. Input that is recognized by the client-side browser is sent to the remote server which processes it and returns a text result to the browsers for output as synthesized voice. The term SpeechWeb was used, in 1999,Frost, R.

The term \\"speechweb\\" has also been used, since the 1990s, in a different context to describe a web based network of information on speech, language and speech-language pathology. In addition, it was also hoped to provide a meeting place for professionals and those who have been affected by communication disorders. The term \\"speechWeb\\" has been trademarked by the company PipeBeach, which is now owned by HP, and refers to a software product which bridges telephone networks and conventional web servers. In 2005, it was recognized that very few voice applications were available to the public through the Internet, despite the maturity of VXML at that time. It was also observed that nearly all VXML applications that were available had been constructed by people working in commerce and industry. This was in stark contrast to the huge growth of the conventional web, and the huge involvement of the public in the development of regular web pages, only a few years after the development of HTML. This observation led to the call for a Public-Domain SpeechWeb Frost, R. A. \\"A call for a public-domain SpeechWeb.\\" Commun. ACM 48, 11, Year: 2005, Pages: 45 ‚Äì 49. which is accessible to the public through existing web browsers (with speech plugins) and which contains hyperlinked speech applications that are created and deployed by the public in a manner that is analogous to the creation and deployment of HTML pages on the conventional web. A browser for the Public-Domain SpeechWeb was demonstrated at the 16th International World Wide Web Conference, held in Banff, Canada in 2007.Frost, R.

Imports of foodstuffs and war materiel of European belligerents came primarily from the Americas and had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, thus Britain and Germany both aimed to blockade each other. The British had the Royal Navy which was superior in numbers and could operate throughout the British Empire, while the German Kaiserliche Marine surface fleet was mainly restricted to the German Bight, and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare elsewhere.  Background  Prior to World War I, a series of conferences were held at Whitehall in 1905‚Äì1906 concerning military cooperation with France in the event of a war with Germany. The Director of Naval Intelligence‚ÄîCharles Ottley‚Äîasserted that two of the Royal Navy's functions in such a war would be the capture of German commercial shipping and the blockade of German ports. A blockade was considered useful for two reasons: it could force the enemy's fleet to fight and it could also act as an economic weapon to destroy German commerce. It was not until 1908, however, that a blockade of Germany formally appeared in the Navy's war plans and even then some officials were divided over how feasible it was. The plans remained in a state of constant change and revision until 1914, the Navy undecided over how best to operate such a blockade. Meanwhile, Germany had made no plans to manage its wartime food supplies since, in peacetime, it was able to produce some 80% of its total consumption. Furthermore, overland imports from the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Romania would be unaffected by any naval blockade. However, the combined issues of conscription of farm laborers, the requisition of horses, poor weather, and the diversion of nitrogen from fertilizer manufacture into military explosives, all combined to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. Blockade The British ‚Äî with their overwhelming sea power ‚Äî established a naval blockade of Germany immediately on the outbreak of war in August 1914, issuing a comprehensive list of contraband that all but prohibited American trade with the Central Powers, and in early November 1914 stated the North Sea to be a war zone, with any ships entering the North Sea doing so at their own risk. The blockade was unusually restrictive in that even foodstuffs were considered \\"contraband of war\\". There were complaints about breaches of international law; however, most neutral merchant vessels agreed to dock at British ports to be inspected and then escorted‚Äîless any \\"illegal\\" cargo destined for Germany‚Äîthrough the British minefields to their destinations. The Northern Patrol and Dover Patrol closed off access to the North Sea and the English Channel respectively. The German government regarded the blockade as an illegal attempt to starve its civilian population and wanted to retaliate in kind. The German High Seas Fleet set out multiple times, from 1914 to 1916, to reduce the British Grand Fleet and regain access to vital imports. The sea conflicts culminated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. The blockade hurt American exports. Under pressure especially from commercial interests wishing to profit from wartime trade with both sides, Washington protested vigorously. Britain did not wish to antagonize the U.S. It set up a program to buy American cotton, guaranteeing the price stayed above peacetime levels and mollifying cotton traders. When American ships were stopped with contraband, the British purchased the entire cargo, and released the empty ship.Lake, 1960 A memorandum to the British War Cabinet on 1 January 1917 stated that very few supplies were reaching Germany or its allies either via the North Sea or other areas such as Austria's Adriatic ports (which had been subject to a French blockade since 1914).  Effects on war  The first accounts of the effects of the blockade in English were by humanitarians, diplomats, and medical professionals. They were sympathetic to the suffering of the German people Henry Noel Brailsford, Across the Blockade: A Record of Travels in Enemy Europe (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1919); Ruth von der Leyan, The English Food Blockade in Its Effects on Juvenile Criminality and Degradation (Berlin, 1919); and Lina Richter, Family Life in Germany under the Blockade (from Reports of Doctors, School Nurses, Children‚Äôs Judges and Teacher) (London: National Labor Press, 1919); Ernest Starling, ‚ÄúThe Food Supply of Germany during the War,‚Äù Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 83 (1920): 225-254. The official German account, based on data about disease, growth of children, and mortality, judged the British harshly, calling the blockade a crime against innocent people. Reichsgesundheitsamt, Sch√§gigungen.The first account commissioned by the Allies, written by Professor A. C. Bell and Brigadier-General Sir James E. Edmonds, hypothesized that the blockade led to revolutionary movements but concluded that, based on the evidence, \\"it is more than doubtful whether this is the proper explanation.\\" Germans wanted to end the war because of the food shortage, while workers staged a revolution because of the long term theory of socialism. The revolutionaries claimed in their slogans, for example, that they were \\"Arbeitssklaven\\" (work slaves) to the monarchy.Archibald Colquhoun Bell, A History of the Blockade of Germany and of the countries associated with her in the Great War, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, 1914‚Äì1918. London: H.M. Stationery Off., 1937, p. 691. Edmonds, on the other hand, supported by Colonel Irwin L. Hunt, who was in charge of civil affairs in the American occupied zone of the Rhineland, held that food shortages were a post- armistice phenomenon caused solely by the disruptions of the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19.Howard, 1993 More recent studies also disagree on the severity of the blockade's impact on the affected populations at the time of the revolution and the armistice. Some hold that the blockade starved Germany and the Central Powers into defeat in 1918. Others hold that the armistice on 11 November was forced primarily by events on the Western Front, rather than any actions of the civilian population. The idea that a revolt of the home front forced a German surrender was part of the Stab-in-the-back myth. Also, Germany's largest ally Austria-Hungary had already signed an armistice on 3 November 1918, exposing Germany to an invasion from the south. On 29 September 1918 General Erich Ludendorff#Downfall told the Kaiser that the military front was going to collapse immediately. A bread queue in Berlin, 1918. All scholars agree that the blockade made a large contribution to the outcome of the war. By 1915, Germany's imports had already fallen by 55% from its prewar levels and the exports were 53% of what they were in 1914. Apart from leading to shortages in vital raw materials such as coal and nonferrous metals, the blockade also deprived Germany of supplies of fertiliser that were vital to agriculture. That led to staples such as grain, potatoes, meat, and dairy products becoming so scarce by the end of 1916 that many people were obliged to instead consume ersatz products including Kriegsbrot (\\"war bread\\") and powdered milk. The food shortages caused looting and riots not only in Germany but also in Vienna and Budapest. The food shortages got so bad that by the autumn of 1918, Austria-Hungary hijacked barges on the Danube full of Rumanian wheat bound for Germany, who in turn threatened military retaliation.Fischer 2010, p. 75 Also, during the winter of 1916 to 1917, there was a failure of the potato crop, which resulted in the urban population having to subsist largely on Swedish turnips. That period became known as the Steckr√ºbenwinter or Turnip Winter. Food riots in Berlin, 1918; a looted shop in Invalidenstra√üe. The German government made strong attempts to counter the effects of the blockade; the Hindenburg Programme of German economic mobilisation was launched on 31 August 1916 and designed to raise productivity by the compulsory employment of all men between the ages of 17 and 60. A complicated rationing system initially introduced in January 1915 aimed to ensure that a minimum nutritional need was met, with \\"war kitchens\\" providing cheap mass meals to impoverished civilians in larger cities. All of those schemes enjoyed only limited success, and the average daily diet of 1,000 calories was insufficient to maintain a good standard of health, resulting by 1917 in widespread disorders caused by malnutrition such as scurvy, tuberculosis and dysentery. German official statistics estimated 763,000 civilian malnutrition and disease deaths were caused by the blockade of Germany. That figure was disputed by a subsequent academic study, which put the death toll at 424,000. The German official statistics came from a German government report published in December 1918 that estimated the blockade to be responsible for the deaths of 762,796 civilians, and the report claimed that that figure did not include deaths caused by the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. The figures for the last six months of 1918 were estimated.Germany. Gesundheits-Amt. Schaedigung der deutschen Volkskraft durch die feindliche Blockade. Denkschrift des Reichsgesundheitsamtes, Dezember 1918. (Parallel English translation) Injuries inflicted to the German national strength through the enemy blockade. Memorial of the German Board of Public Health, 27 December 1918 [Berlin, Reichsdruckerei,] the German Board of Health report provided an English translation of the German text. On page 17, it stated, \\"The high accumulation of cases of death from influenza which is to be noticed only in the second half-year of 1918 has consequently not been taken into account at all, although a considerable part of these cases of death was the consequence of bad constitution of the body, caused by malnutrition\\". Maurice Parmelle maintained that \\"it is very far from accurate to attribute to the blockade all of the excess deaths above pre-war mortality\\" and believed that the German figures were \\"somewhat exaggerated\\".Blockade and sea power; the blockade, 1914‚Äì1919, and its significance for a world state, by Maurice Parmelle New York, Thomas Y. Crowell Co. [1924] pages 221‚Äì226 The German claims were made at a time that Germany was waging a propaganda campaign to end the Allied blockade of Germany after the armistice that lasted from November 1918 until June 1919. Also in 1919, Germany raised the issue of the Allied blockade to counter charges against the German use of submarine warfare.The Times London January 18, 1919The Blockade of Germany after the Armistice 1918‚Äì1919 Bane, S.L. 1942 Stanford University Press pages 699‚Äì700 In 1928, a German academic study sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace provided a thorough analysis of the German civilian deaths during the war. The study estimated 424,000 war related deaths of civilians over the age of one in Germany, not including Alsace-Lorraine, and the authors attributed the civilian deaths over the prewar level primarily to food and fuel shortages in 1917‚Äì1918. The study also estimated an additional 209,000 Spanish flu deaths in 1918Bumm, Franz, ed., Deutschlands Gesundheitsverh√§ltnisse unter dem Einfluss des Weltkrieges, Stuttgart, Berlin [etc.] Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt; New Haven, Yale University Press, 1928, p. 22 to 61 A study sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1940 estimated the German civilian death toll at over 600,000. Based on the above-mentioned German study of 1928, they maintained, \\"A thorough inquiry has led to the conclusion that the number of 'civilian' deaths traceable to the war was 424,000, to which number must be added about 200,000 deaths caused by the influenza epidemic\\". Historian and demographer Jay Winter estimated that there were 300,000 excess deaths in Germany due to the blockade, after subtracting deaths due to the influenza epidemic.Jay Winter, ‚ÄúSome Paradoxes of the First World War,‚Äù in The Upheaval of War: Family, Work and Welfare in Europe, 1914-1918, ed. Richard Wall and Jay Winter, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988 After armistice In March 1919 Winston Churchill told the House of Commons: \\"We are holding all our means of coercion in full operation or in immediate readiness for use. We are enforcing the blockade with vigor. We have strong armies ready to advance at the shortest notice. Germany is very near starvation. The evidence I have received from the officers sent by the War Office all over Germany shows first of all, the great privations which the German people are suffering, and secondly, the great danger of a collapse of the entire structure of German social and national life under the pressure of hunger and malnutrition. Now is therefore the moment to settle.\\" The blockade was maintained for eight months after the Armistice in November 1918, into the following year of 1919. According to the New Cambridge Modern History food imports into Germany were controlled by the Allies after the Armistice with Germany until Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919.The New Cambridge modern history Vol 12(2nd ed)Cambridge University Press 1968 pp. 213 From January 1919 to March 1919, Germany refused to agree to the demand by the Allies that Germany surrender its merchant ships to Allied ports to transport food supplies. Germans considered the armistice a temporary cessation of the war. They feared that, if fighting broke out again, the ships would be confiscated outright.Sally Marks, ‚ÄòMistakes and Myths: The Allies, Germany, and the Versailles Treaty, 1918‚Äì1921‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 85, No. 3 (September 2013), p. 650. In January, hoping to buy time, the German government notified an American representative in Berlin that the shortage of food would not become critical until late spring. Facing food riots at home, German finally agreed to surrender its fleet on 14 March 1919. The Allies allowed Germany, under their supervision, to import 300,000 tons of grain and 70,000 tons of cured pork per month until August 1919. \\"Lebensmittelabkommen in Br√ºssel,\\" https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/1000/sch/sch1p/kap1_2/kap2_17/para3_1.html In April this food from America arrived in Germany.Marks, pp. 650-651. The restrictions on food imports were finally lifted on 12 July 1919 after Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles. C. Paul Vincent maintains that for the German people, these were the most devastating months of the blockade because \\"in the weeks and months following the armistice, Germany's deplorable state further deteriorated.\\"C. Paul Vincent, The politics of hunger : the allied blockade of Germany, 1915‚Äì1919 Athens, Ohio : Ohio University Press, c1985ISBN 978-0-8214-0831-5 Page 145 Sally Marks has argued that the German accounts of a hunger blockade are a \\"myth,\\" as Germany did not face the starvation level of Belgium and the regions of Poland and northern France that it occupied. At the armistice discussions in January 1919, the Allies offered to let Germany import food if it agreed to turn over its merchant fleet, a condition that Germany refused until the last armistice discussions in March.Marks, p. 651. The head of the German armistice delegation, Matthias Erzberger, balked at first at giving up the merchant fleet. He feared that if Germany surrendered it, the Allies would confiscate it as reparations. Before he surrendered the fleet, he wanted guarantees that the food imports could be financed with foreign credit owed German businesses.Verhandlung der verfassungsgebenden Nationalversammlung: Stenographische Berichte und Drucksachen, Vol 24, Berlin, Norddeutschen Buchdruckerei, 1919, pp. 631-635 Leaders in industry and government feared that, by taking the fleet, the Allies aimed to sever Germany from world markets. The Allies would gain an unfair competitive edge over the German steel industries, which depended on import of ore and sale to countries abroad, by charging high prices for ocean transport.Peter Kr√ºger, Deutschland und die Reparation 1918/19: Die Genese des Reparationsproblems in Deutschland zwischen Waffenstillstand und Versailler Friedensschlu√ü, Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1973, p. 93 In the German Republic's official mouthpiece, the Deputy State Secretary of the German Food Office Braun made known his fear that, if the Allies took the ships, the dockworkers in the ports would revolt and rekindle the Spartacist uprising that aimed to overthrow the republic.‚ÄúDie Finanzierung des Lebensmittels,‚Äù Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, 2 February 1919. The leaders of the German Republic had to weigh these considerations against the reality that, in early 1919, rations in German cities were on average 1,500 calories per day. Anne Roerkohl, Hungerblockade und Heimatfront: Die kommunale Lebensmittelversorgung in Westfalen w√§hrend des Ersten Weltkrieges, Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 1991, p. 348; Wilfried Rudloff, Die Wohlfahrtsstadt: Kommunale Ern√§hrungs-, F√ºrsorge, und Wohnungspolitik am Beispiel M√ºnchens 1910-1933, G√∂ttingen, Vandenhooeck & Ruprecht, 1998, p. 184 Not included in the German government's December 1918 figure of 763,000 deaths are civilian famine related deaths during 1919. A recent academic study maintains that there is no statistical data for the death toll of the period immediately following the Armistice in November 1918. Dr. Max Rubner in an April 1919 article claimed that 100,000 German civilians had died due to the continuation blockade of Germany after the armistice.Dr. Max Rubner, Von der Blockde und Aehlichen, Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift Berlin, 10 April 1919 Vol. 45 Nr.15 In the UK a Labour Party anti-war activist Robert Smillie issued a statement in June 1919 condemning continuation of the blockade, and claiming that 100,000 German civilians had died.Common Sense(London)July 5, 1919.The Blockade of Germany after the Armistice 1918‚Äì1919 Bane, S.L. 1942 Stanford University Press page 791 Impact on children The impact on childhood was assessed by Mary E. Cox using a newly-discovered dataset based on heights and weights of nearly 600,000 German schoolchildren measured between 1914 and 1924. These data indicate that children suffered severe malnutrition. Family class was a major factor, as the working-class children suffered the most but were the quickest to recover after the war. Recovery to normality was made possible by massive food aid organized by the United States and other former enemies.Mary Elisabeth Cox, \\"Hunger games: or how the Allied blockade in the First World War deprived German children of nutrition, and Allied food aid subsequently saved them.\\" Economic History Review 68.2 (2015): 600-631.\\"Hunger in War and Peace: Women and Children in Germany 1914-1924\\" Cox, Mary E. 2019.

Under Swaminarayan‚Äôs leadership the sampradaya grew to more than 100,000 followers and 3,000 swamis (monks) by the time of his death in 1830. Early in his leadership of the group, Sahajanand Swami directed his devotees to chant the Swaminarayan mantra, which is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Swami and Narayan. Both the religious group and then its leader became popularly known by the new mantra they had begun chanting, Swaminarayan. In the Vachanamrut, the principal theological text of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan identifies five eternal and distinct entities: Parabrahman, Aksharbrahman, maya (mƒÅyƒÅ), ishwar (i≈õvara), and jiva (jƒ´va). He further explains that the ultimate goal of life is moksha (mok·π£a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths that is characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. Swaminarayan instituted the sampradaya‚Äôs mandir tradition to facilitate followers‚Äô devotional worship of God. During his lifetime, Swaminarayan constructed six mandirs: Ahmedabad (1822), Bhuj (1823), Vadtal (1824), Dholera (1826), Junagadh (1828), and Gadhada (1828). Socially, Swaminarayan‚Äôs doctrine that everyone‚Äôs true self is the atman within which God resides, led him to reject caste-based discrimination within the religious community. Swaminarayan also inspired followers to engage in humanitarian service activities, leading various denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya to currently provide humanitarian service globally. After Swaminarayan‚Äôs death, different interpretations of successorship have emerged resulting in numerous groups within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya that regard Swaminarayan as God but differ in their theology and the religious leadership they accept. Due to the commentarial work of Bhadreshdas Swami, Swaminarayan's teachings were recognized as a separate school of Vedanta by the Shri Kashi Vidvat Parishad in 2017BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute, HH Mahant Swami Maharaj Inaugurates the SvƒÅminƒÅrƒÅya·πáasiddhƒÅntasudhƒÅ and Announces Parabrahman SvƒÅminƒÅrƒÅya·πáa‚Äôs Dar≈õana as the Ak·π£ara-Puru·π£ottama Dar≈õanaBAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Acclamation by th Sri Kasi Vidvat Parisad and by members of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference in 2018.17th World Sanskrit Conference Recognizes Bhagwan Swaminarayan‚Äôs Akshar-Purushottam Darshan as a Distinct Vedanta Tradition  Early history  =Sahajanand Swami= The Swaminarayan Sampradaya, founded in 1801, takes its name from its founder, Swaminarayan, also known as Sahajanand Swami. Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 in the village of Chhapaiya in present- day Uttar Pradesh, India. After his parents‚Äô death, he renounced his home at the age of 11 and traveled for 7 years as a child yogi around India before settling in the hermitage of Ramanand Swami, a Vaishnava religious leader in present-day Gujarat. Ramanand Swami initiated him as Sahajanand Swami on 28 October 1800 and appointed him to be his successor and the leader of the sampradaya in 1801, giving him the second name, Narayan Muni. Textual sources from as early as 1804 indicate Sahajanand Swami was regarded as the manifestation of God, and over his life, he would be worshipped as God by thousands of followers. Ramanand Swami died on 17 December 1801. Upon the conclusion of his funeral rites, Sahajanand Swami directed devotees to chant a new mantra: Swaminarayan (SvƒÅmƒ´nƒÅrƒÅya·πáa). The word Swaminarayan is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Swami (SvƒÅmƒ´) and Narayan (NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa). There are various interpretations of the mantra, with some branches believing the name refers to one entity, while others believe that that Swami denotes Aksharbrahman (God's ideal devotee), namely Gunatitanand Swami, as identified by Sahajanand Swami, and Narayan denotes Parabrahman (God), a reference to Sahajanand Swami himself. The latter interpretation recalls an earlier Vaishnava tradition of the divine companionship between the perfect devotee and God (for example, Radha and Krishna or Shri and Vishnu). As devotees began to chant this new Swaminarayan mantra, society began to identify the group by the mantra they chanted, thus referring to the group as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Soon after, the group‚Äôs new leader, Sahajanand Swami, was also popularly identified by the mantra he had given, and became known as Swaminarayan. The sampradaya grew quickly over the 30 years under Swaminarayan‚Äôs leadership, with British sources estimating at least 100,000 followers by the 1820s. Before his death, Swaminarayan divided his followers into two administrative dioceses, separate from the spiritual lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus. Swaminarayan died on 1 June 1830, but the sampradaya continued to grow, with British officials estimating it had 288,000 followers by 1872. = Early monasticism = Swaminarayan and his senior disciplesSwaminarayan's ministry \\"faced great opposition,\\" most strongly in the first fifteen years untill the arrival of the British colonisators in Gujarat. A number of attempts at his life, \\"by both religious and secular powers,\\" are reported. His followers also faced harassment, particularly his swamis (monks). Swaminarayan had instructed the swamis to maintain an austere code of conduct as part of their spiritual practice. This code of conduct included refraining from retaliation when harassed by others, which left them vulnerable to physical assault. To help them escape such harassment, at 30 June 1807 Swaminarayan ordained 500 swamis into the highest monastic order as paramhansas (paramha·πÉsas), thereby allowing them to temporarily suspend certain practices, like applying sacred marks, that allowed opponents to identify them as one of his followers. Altogether, Swaminarayan ordained 3,000 swamis over the span of his leadership. The swamis expressed their devotion to Swaminarayan in various ways, ranging from composing bhakti poetry to authoring scriptural commentaries. Swaminarayan also encouraged his swamis to serve others. During the devastating famine of 1813-14 in Kathiawar, for example, the swamis collected alms in unaffected regions of Gujarat to distribute among the afflicted. Beliefs Swaminarayan‚Äôs teachings are found in the Vachanamrut (VacanƒÅm·πõta), the principal theological text of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be Parabrahman (Parabrahman, or Purushottam, Puru·π£ottama), his teachings are considered a direct revelation of God. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan describes that the ultimate goal of life is moksha (mok·π£a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths and characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. = Background = Swaminayaran's philosophy emerged within the Vedanta tradition, particularly the Vaishnava tradition as articulated by Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, and Chaitanya. He engaged with this Vedanta tradition by presenting his own theological system, which has similarities and differences with many of those that came before it. Some scholars highlight particular similarities with Ramanuja's Vishistadvaita and Swaminarayan‚Äôs stated affinity for it to suggest that it served as foundational for Swaminarayan‚Äôs philosophy. Other scholars point to significant differences between Swaminarayan‚Äôs and Ramanuja‚Äôs systems to assert fundamental metaphysical and philosophical divergences between the two. Raymond Williams explicitly notes that the Swaminarayan tradition‚Äôs followers ‚Äúare not Shrivaishnavas‚Äù who affirm Ramanuja‚Äôs philosophical tradition, while Paramtattvadas states that the similarities between Vishishtadvaita and Swaminarayan's theology lead those who do not have a complete understanding of the Swaminarayan Hindu tradition to ‚Äúerroneously identify it as a ‚Äòmodified‚Äô version of Vi≈õi·π£·π≠ƒÅdvaita VedƒÅnta.‚Äù He cautions that one should not conflate the two distinct schools of Vedanta, nor should one then see Swaminarayan‚Äôs philosophy as foundationally based in Ramanuja‚Äôs. = Metaphysics = While his preference for Ramunaja‚Äôs theology is stated in the sacred text, the Shikshapatri (≈öik·π£ƒÅpatrƒ´), Swaminarayan actually teaches a significantly different system of metaphysics in the Vachanamrut. In Ramunaja‚Äôs system, there are three entities: Parabrahman, maya (mƒÅyƒÅ), and jiva (jƒ´va). Throughout the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan identifies five eternal and distinct entities: Parabrahman, Aksharbrahman (Ak·π£arabrahman, also Akshara, Ak·π£ara, or Brahman), maya, ishwar (ƒ´≈õvara), and jiva.See Gadhada I.7, Gadhada I.39, Gadhada I.42, Gadhada III.10 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Parabrahman is God, who is sarvopari (sarvoparƒ´, transcends all entities), karta (kartƒÅ, omniagent), sakar (sƒÅkƒÅr, possesses an eternal and divine form), and pragat (pragat, forever manifests on Earth to liberate spiritual seekers).See Gadhada I.71, Loya 4, Kariyani 10, Vartal 19 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Swaminarayan taught that Purushottam, or God, possesses a divine form whose shape is human-like. Most followers believe that Swaminarayan was the ‚Äòmanifest‚Äô form of this supreme God. By ‚Äòmanifest‚Äô, it is understood that the very same transcendent entity who possesses a divine form in his abode assumes a human form that is still ‚Äútotally divine,‚Äù but ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù to his human devotees. The majority of the followers believe thus that Swaminarayan was ‚Äúnot a manifestation of Krishna, as some believed,‚Äù but the supreme entity superior to all other manifestations of God, including Rama and Krishna. These other manifestations of God, of which Rama and Krishna are two examples, are known as avatars, and Purushottam (or God) is believed to be ‚Äúmetaphysically different‚Äù from them and their cause, the avatarin, whom Swaminarayan revealed as himself. Aksharbrahman, is the second highest entity and has four forms: 1) Parabrahman‚Äôs divine abode; 2) the ideal devotee of Parabrahman, eternally residing in that divine abode; 3) the sentient substratum pervading and supporting the cosmos (chidakash, cidƒÅkƒÅ≈õa); and 4) the Aksharbrahman Guru, who serves as the manifest form of God on earth through whom God guides aspirants to moksha. This understanding of Akshar having four forms is one of the features that distinguishes Swaminarayan‚Äôs theology from others. In Vachanamrut Gadhada I-63, Swaminarayan emphasizes the need to understand Akshar in order to understand God (Parabrahman) perfectly and completely. Maya refers to the universal material source used by Parabrahman to create the world.See Gadhada I.13, Gadhada III.10, Loya 17 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Maya has three gunas (gu·πáas, qualities) which are found to varying degrees in everything formed of it: serenity (sattva), passion (rajas), and darkness (tamas).See Loya 10 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Maya also refers to the ignorance which enshrouds both ishwars and jivas, which results in their bondage to the cycle of births and deaths (transmigration) and subsequently suffering.See Gadhada I.13, Gadhada I.1, Gadhada II.36, Gadhada III.39 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Ishwars are sentient beings responsible for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos, at the behest of Parabrahman.See Gadhada II.31, Gadhada II.66, Gadhada III.38, Sarangpur 1, Panchala 4 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . While they are metaphysically higher than jivas, they too are bound by maya and must transcend it to attain moksha.See Gadhada II.31, Kariyani 12, Sarangpur 5, Panchala 2 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Jivas, also known as atmans, are distinct, eternal entities, composed of consciousness that can reside in bodies, animating them. The jiva is inherently pure and flawless, though under the influence of maya, jivas falsely believe themselves to be the bodies they inhabit and remain bound to the cycle of transmigration.See Gadhada I.21, Gadhada I.44, Gadhada III.22, Gadhada III.39, Jetalpur 2 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . = Moksha = In Swaminarayan‚Äôs soteriology, the ultimate goal of life is moksha, a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. To attain moksha, an individual must overcome the ignorance of maya, which Swaminarayan describes as self-identification with the physical body, personal talents, and material possessions.See Gadhada II.50, Gadhada III.39, Kariyani 12 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Swaminarayan explains in the Vachanamrut that ekantik dharma is a means to earn God‚Äôs grace and attain liberation. Ekantik dharma (ekƒÅntik dharma) consists of dharma (dharma; religious and moral duties), gnan (j√±ƒÅna; realization of the atman and Paramatman) vairagya (vairƒÅgya; dispassion for worldly objects), and bhakti (bhakti; devotion to God coupled with the understanding of God‚Äôs greatness).See Gadhada II.21, Gadhada III.21, Sarangpur 11 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . The jiva must become brahmarup (brahmar≈´p), or like Aksharbrahman, under the guidance of the manifest form of God to attain moksha.See Gadhada I.21, Gadhada II.28, Gadhada II.45, Gadhada II.66, Gadhada III.2, Gadhada III.7, Gadhada III.10, Sarangpur 9 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . This is possible by earning the grace of Parabrahman and Aksharbrahman through ekantik dharma. In this highest state, the jiva or ishwar never becomes Aksharbrahman but transcends maya and experiences God‚Äôs bliss through eternally serving Parabrahman. In BAPS, followers point to Swaminarayan‚Äôs teachings in the Vachanamrut and other scriptures emphasizing the role of God manifest through the Aksharbrahman guru to attain moksha. The Swaminarayan Gadi believes that moksha can be attained through the lineage of gurus beginning with Gopalanand Swami. The Narnarayan and Laxminarayan Gadis believe moksha is attained by worshiping the sacred images of Swaminarayan installed by acharyas.  Practices  According to Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died in 1830 the movement had 1.8 million followers, which, by 2001, had grown to an estimated 5 million followers. Lay followers of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya are known as satsangis and are expected to maintain integrity in their actions while avoiding meat, intoxicants, theft, gambling, and adultery. The practices Swaminarayan prescribed were in part consistent with \\"Vaishnava and Krishnite traditions.\\" Shruti Patel argues that such a consistency with existing practices would have aided in \\"sanctioning [the] novelty\\" of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. =Ekantik dharma= alt=Ekantik dharma (ekƒÅntik dharma) is an important spiritual practice of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, and its establishment is one of the reasons why Swaminarayan is believed to have incarnated. Ekantik dharma consists of dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. See Sarangpur 11, Gadhada II.21, and Gadhada III.21 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Dharma consists of religious and moral duties according to one‚Äôs responsibilities and situation. All Swaminarayan Hindus who are householders maintain five basic vows: abstaining from theft, gambling, adultery, meat, and intoxicants like alcohol. As part of their dharma, swamis additionally endeavor to perfect the five virtues of non-lust (nishkam/ni·π£kƒÅma), non-greed (nirlobh/nirlobha), non-attachment (nissneh/nissneha), non-taste (niswad/nissvada), and non-ego (nirman/nirmƒÅna). Another aspect of the practice of dharma is the Swaminarayan diet, a type of vegetarianism, similar to that practiced generally by Vaishnava sampradayas, that entails abstaining from animal flesh, eggs, onions, and garlic. Gnan is knowledge of Parabrahman and realizing oneself as the atman. Basic practices of gnan include the daily study of scriptures like the Vachanamrut and Shikshapatri and weekly participation in congregational worship services (sabha/sabhƒÅ) at the mandir (temple), in which scriptural discourses geared towards personal and spiritual growth occur. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan explains that adhering to the Aksharbrahman Guru‚Äôs commands is commensurate to perfectly embodying gnan‚Äîthat is, realizing oneself as the atman.See Gadhada II.51 Vairagya is dispassion for worldly objects, through practices like fasting on Ekadashi days, two of which occur every month, and observing extra fasts, during the holy months of Chaturmas (a period of four months between July and October) Vairagya is realized by adhering to the codes of conduct, inclusive of these practices, serving other devotees physically, listening to discourses, and engaging in devotion.See Gadhada III.34 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Bhakti involves devotion towards God, while understanding God‚Äôs greatness and believing oneself‚Äîthe atman‚Äîas one with Aksharbrahman.See Panchala 9 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015). The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Important bhakti rituals for Swaminarayan Hindus include puja (p≈´jƒÅ; personal worship of God), arti (ƒÅrtƒ´; the ritual waving of lighted wicks around murtis, or images), thal (thƒÅl; the offering of food to murtis of God), and cheshta (ce·π£tƒÅ; the singing of devotional songs that celebrate the divine acts and form of Swaminarayan). During puja, adherents ritually worship Swaminarayan, and depending on their denominational affiliation, also the lineage of gurus through whom Swaminarayan is believed to be manifest. At the beginning of the puja ritual, men imprint a symbol known as the tilak chandlo on their forehead, and women imprint a chandlo. The tilak which is a u-shaped saffron-colored symbol made of sandalwood, symbolizing God's feet, and the chandlo is a red symbol made of kumkum, symbolizing God‚Äôs ideal devotee. Other bhakti rituals included in Swaminarayan religious practice are abhishek (abhi≈õeka), the bathing of a murti of God, mahapuja (mƒÅhƒÅp≈´jƒÅ), a collective worship of God usually performed on auspicious days or festivals, and mansi (mƒÅnsi) puja, worship of God offered mentally.  Mandir tradition  Harikrishna Maharaj - Vadtal The Swaminarayan Sampradaya is well-known for its mandirs, or Hindu places of worship. From Swaminarayan‚Äôs time through the present, mandirs functioned as centers of worship and gathering as well as hubs for cultural and theological education.Kim, Hanna H., \\"Public Engagement and Personal Desires: BAPS Swaminarayan Temples and their Contribution to the Discourses on Religion\\" (2010). Anthropology Faculty Publications. They can vary in consecration rituals and architecture, which can be adapted to the means of the local congregation. = History = Swaminarayan instituted the mandir tradition of the sampradaya to provide followers a space for devotional worship (upasana, upƒÅsanƒÅ) to God. He constructed six mandirs in the following locations: Ahmedabad (1822), Bhuj (1823), Vadtal (1824), Dholera (1826), Junagadh (1828), and Gadhada (1828). Swaminarayan installed the murtis, or sacred images, of various manifestations of God and his devotee in the central shrines of each of these mandirs. He also installed his own image in the form of Harikrishna in the mandir at Vadtal, signifying his own divinity. Swaminarayan‚Äôs successors have continued the tradition of installing murtis of God (Swaminarayan) and his ideal devotee to facilitate his followers‚Äô pursuit of moksha. = Murti puja = The Swaminarayan Sampradaya is a bhakti tradition that believes God possesses an eternal, divine, human-like, transcendent form. Thus, Swaminarayan mandirs facilitate devotion to God by housing murtis which are believed to resemble God‚Äôs divine form. The murtis are consecrated through the prana pratishta (prƒÅ·πÖa prati·π£·π≠ha) ceremony, after which God is believed to reside in the murtis. Consequently, the worship practiced in Swaminarayan mandirs is believed to directly reach God. After the consecration of a mandir, various rituals are regularly performed in it. Arti is a ritual which involves singing a devotional song of praise, while waving a flame before the murtis. Arti is performed five times per day in shikharbaddha mandirs and twice per day in hari mandirs. Thal, a ritual offering of food to God accompanied by devotional songs, is also regularly offered three times per day to the murtis in Swaminarayan mandirs. The sanctified food is distributed to devotees after the ritual. Devotees also engage with the murtis in a Swaminarayan mandir through other worship rituals, including darshan, dandvat, and pradakshina. Darshan is the devotional act of viewing the murtis, which are adorned with elegant clothing and ornaments. Dandvats (da·πádavat), or prostrations, before the murtis symbolize surrendering to God. Pradakshina (pradak·π£i·πáƒÅ), or circumambulations around the murtis, express the desire to keep God at the center of the devotees‚Äô lives. Swaminarayan Akshardham, New Delhialt= = Community building and worship = Swaminarayan mandirs also serve as hubs for congregational worship and theological and cultural education. Singing devotional songs, delivering katha (sermons), and performing rituals such as arti all occur daily in Swaminarayan mandirs. In addition, devotees from the surrounding community gather at least once per week, often on a weekend, to perform these activities congregationally. Cultural and theological instruction is also delivered on this day of weekly congregation. Cultural instruction may include Gujarati language instruction; training in music and dance; and preparation for festival performances. Theological instruction includes classes on the tradition‚Äôs history and doctrines, and the life and work of the tradition‚Äôs gurus. = Types of Swaminarayan mandirs = Swaminarayan followers conduct their worship in various types of mandirs. The homes of Swaminarayan devotees contain ghar mandirs, or home shrines, which serve as spaces for the daily performance of worship and ritual activities such as arti, thal, and reading sermons or scripture. The majority of freestanding public Swaminarayan mandirs are hari mandirs, whose architectural style and consecration rituals are adopted to the means available to the local congregation. As a means of expressing their devotion to Swaminarayan and their guru, some congregations elect to construct stone, shikharbaddha mandirs following Hindu architectural scriptures. In addition to being an expression of devotion, congregants strengthen their sense of community by cooperatively volunteering to construct these mandirs. A fourth type of mandir, called a mahamandiram (mahƒÅmandiram) can be found in India, in New Delhi and Gandhinagar, Gujarat. These mahamandirs are the largest type of mandir constructed and they contain exhibits which present the life of Swaminarayan and the history of Hinduism in various formats with the goal of inspiring introspection and self-improvement. Scriptural tradition alt= In addition to Swaminarayan‚Äôs acceptance of perennial Hindu texts such as the four Vedas, Vedanta-sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita, Swaminarayan encouraged the creation of a scriptural tradition specific to the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Along with theological texts with revelatory status, the genres of textual production in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya include sacred biographies, ethical precepts, commentaries, and philosophical treatises. = Vachanamrut = The Vachanamrut, literally the ‚Äòimmortalizing ambrosia in the form of words‚Äô, is the fundamental theological text of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya owing to the followers‚Äô belief that Swaminarayan himself is the self- manifestation of Parabrahman. The text is a compilation of 273 discourses, with each discourse within the collection also called a Vachanamrut. Swaminarayan delivered these discourses in Gujarati between the years of 1819-1829, and his senior disciples noted his teachings while they were delivered and compiled them during Swaminarayan‚Äôs lifetime. In this scripture, Swaminarayan outlines his system of metaphysics which includes five eternal entities: jiva, ishwar, maya, Aksharbrahman, Parabrahman. He also describes the ultimate goal of life, moksha (mok·π£a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths and characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. To attain this state, Swaminarayan states that the jiva needs to follow the four-fold practice of ekantik dharmaSee Sarangpur 11 under the guidance of the Aksharbrahman Guru to transcend mayaSee Gadhada III-39 and become brahmarup to reside in the service of God. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be God, the Vachanamrut is considered a direct revelation of God and thus the most precise interpretation of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and other important Hindu scriptures. This scripture is read by followers regularly and discourses are conducted daily in Swaminarayan temples around the world.An illustration of Swaminarayan writing the Shiskhapatri = Shikshapatri = The Shikshapatri is a composition of 212 Sanskrit verses believed to be authored by Swaminarayan and completed in 1826. As an ‚Äòepistle of precepts,‚Äô the verses primarily communicate the Swaminarayan Sampradaya‚Äôs moral injunctions for devotees which should be read daily.See Gadhada III I-14 SahajƒÅnanda, Swami (2015), The VachanƒÅmrut: spiritual discourses of BhagwƒÅn SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan (3rd ed.). Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha Swaminarayan states that the Shikshapatri is not merely his words but his personified form and merits worship in its own right. = Swamini Vato = The Swamini Vato is a compilation of teachings delivered by Gunatitanand Swami over the course of his forty-year ministry, He was one of Swaminarayan‚Äôs foremost disciple, and according to some denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, he was the first manifestation of Swaminarayan in a lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus. Similarly to the Vachanamrut, Gunatitanand Swami‚Äôs followers recorded his teachings, which were compiled in his lifetime and reviewed by Gunatitanand Swami himself. These teachings were first published by Balmukund Swami in 5 chapters and then 7 chapters by Krishnaji Ada.https://www.baps.org/Spiritual-Living/Scriptures/Central-Swaminarayan- Scriptures/Swamini-Vato.aspx The text consists of approximately 1,478 excerpts taken from Gunatitanand Swami‚Äôs sermons.Mamtora, Bhakti. The making of a modern scripture: SvƒÅmƒ´nƒ´ VƒÅto and the formation of religious subjectivities in Gujarat. PhD diss., (University of Florida, 2019) In his teachings, he reflects on the nature of human experience and offers thoughts on how one ought to frame the intentions with which they act in this world, while also elaborating on Swaminarayan‚Äôs supremacy, the importance of the sadhu, and the means for attaining liberation. Often, Gunatitanand Swami elaborates upon topics or passages from the Vachanamrut, which lends the text to be considered a ‚Äònatural commentary‚Äô on the Vachanamrut within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. In addition, he often made references to other Hindu texts, parables, and occurrences in daily life in order not only to explain spiritual concepts, but also to provide guidance on how to live them. = Sacred biographies = The Swaminarayan Sampradaya has produced voluminous biographical literature on Swaminarayan. The Satsangi Jivan, a five volume Sanskrit sacred biography of Swaminarayan, consists of 17,627 verses written by Shatananda Muni that also incorporates some of Swaminarayan‚Äôs teachings. According to Peter Schreiner, it is one of the ‚Äúoldest and most authentic sources on the life‚Äù of Swaminarayan. The Bhaktachintamani is a sacred biography of Swaminarayan composed by Nishkulanand Swami. Consisting of 8,536 couplets, this biography serves as a record of Swaminarayan‚Äôs life and teachings. The Harililamrut is a longer biographical text in verse written by Dalpatram and published in 1907. The Harilila Kalpataru a 33,000-verse Sanskrit biographical text, was written by Achintyanand Brahmachari, at the suggestion of Gunatitanand Swami. These and many other sacred biographies complement the theological texts, insofar as their incidents serve as practical applications of the theology. = Vedanta commentaries = 200x200px From its early history, the Swaminarayan Sampradaya has also been involved in the practice of producing Sanskrit commentarial work as a way of engaging with the broader scholastic community. The classical Vedanta school of philosophy and theology is of particular import for the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, which has produced exegetical work on the three canonical Vedanta texts‚Äîthe Upanishads, Brahmasutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. While Swaminarayan himself did not author a commentary on these texts, he engaged with them and their interpretations in the Vachanamrut. Since Swaminarayan‚Äôs metaphysical framework consists of five eternal entities, it differs from Ramanuja‚Äôs and that of the other commentators, and therefore forms a distinct system within the Vedanta school, known as the Akshar- Purushottam Darshan. The earliest Vedanta commentarial literature in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya reflects a heavy dependence on the Vedanta systems of Ramanuja and Vallabha. Although authorship of these nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century texts are attributed to two of Swaminarayan‚Äôs eminent disciples, Muktanand Swami and Gopalanand Swami, textual evidence indicates that they were composed by Vishishtadvaita scholars from southern India, who were called to Gujarat to head the Vadtal Sanskrit Pathshala. The most comprehensive commentarial work on Vedanta in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya is the Swaminarayan Bhashyam authored by Bhadreshdas Swami, an ordained monk of BAPS. It is a five-volume work written in Sanskrit and published between 2009 and 2012. The format and style of exegesis and argument conform with the classical tradition of Vedanta commentarial writing. In more than two thousand pages, the commentator Bhadreshdas Swami, offers detailed interpretations of the principal ten Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahmasutras (Vedanta Sutras) that articulate Swaminarayan‚Äôs theology and philosophy. The Shri Kashi Vidvat Parishad, a highly eminent scholarly council for adjudicating matters of Vedic studies and tradition throughout India, stated in a meeting in Varanasi on 31 July 2017 that \\"MahƒÅmahopƒÅdyƒÅya Sadhu Bhadreshdas is an ƒÅcƒÅrya and a contemporary commentator in the lineage of commentators on the PrasthƒÅnatrayƒ´.\\" They also stated that it is \\"appropriate to identify Sri SvƒÅminƒÅrƒÅya·πáa‚Äôs VedƒÅnta by the title: Ak·π£arapuru·π£ottama Dar≈õana,\\" and that his teachings are \\"distinct from Advaita, Vi≈õi·π£·π≠ƒÅdvaita, and all other doctrines.\\" Akshar-Purushottam Darshan was also recognised as a distinct school of Vedanta in 2018, by members of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference. Paramtattvadas Swami describes Swaminarayan's teachings as \\"a distinct school of thought within the larger expanse of classical Vedanta,\\" presenting Swaminarayan's teachings as a seventh school of Vedanta.  Major branches  Swaminarayan temple Ahmedabad 1866 In the 20th century, due to \\"different interpretations of authentic successorship,\\" the sampradaya split-up into various denominations. All groups regard Swaminarayan as God but differ in their theology and the religious leadership they accept. In the early years of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan personally directed control of the spiritual and administrative duties. Swaminarayan later delegated responsibilities amongst swamis, householders, and the members of his family. In the Lekh, Swaminarayan established two \\"administrative dioceses,\\" the Vadtal diocese (Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi) and Ahmedabad diocese (Nar Narayan Dev Gadi), and appointed two acharyas to \\"administer his temple properties\\" which are distributed among them, establishing a hereditary line of succession. The first acharyas of the two dioceses were Swaminarayan's two nephews, Raghuvir (Vadtal) and Ayodhyaprasad (Ahmedabad), whose descendants continue the hereditary line of succesion. According to a number of traditions, Swaminarayan introduced a spiritual lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus through which he manifests. BAPS adherents believe Swaminarayan introduced Gunatitanand Swami as his ideal devotee, from which a spiritual lineage of gurus began, reflecting the principle that a form of God who lives ‚Äúbefore one‚Äôs eyes‚Äù is necessary for aspirants to attain moksha (liberation). Swaminarayan Gadi adherents believe a spiritual succession begins from a lineage starting with Gopalanand Swami. = Laxminarayan Gadi (Vadtal) and Narnarayan Gadi (Ahmedabad) = Per the Lekh, Swaminarayan appointed two of his nephews as acharyas to administer the two gadis, or dioceses. Ayodhyaprasadji, son of his elder brother Rampratap, became acharya of the Nar Narayan Dev Gadi (Ahmedabad diocese), and Raghuvirji, son of his younger brother Ichcharam, became acharya of the Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi (Vadtal diocese). In the twentieth century, several controversies involving the acharyas led to litigation resulting in restrictions on the acharyas‚Äô authority along with schisms and the formation of new subgroups within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. The current acharya of the Nar Narayan Dev Gadi is Koshalendraprasad Pande. There is currently an active case regarding the Vadtal Gadi centered around a factional dispute between Dev paksh, the faction led by Rakeshprasad Pande, and Siddhant paksh, which is led by Ajendraprasad Pande. Gujarat high court has stayed the Nadiad court order removing Ajendraprasad until a final verdict is reached. He is restrained from enjoying the rights of acharya during the proceedings. Dev paksh, governing the Vadtal temple trust, has appointed Rakeshprasad to act and officiate as acharya. Siddhant paksh believes Ajendraprasad is the current acharya and welcome his son, Nrigendraprasad, to officiate at functions in Swaminarayan temples in his absence. Mahant Swami Maharaj, current guru and president of BAPS = Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) = The Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) was formed in 1907, by Shastriji Maharaj (Shastri Yagnapurushdas). Shastriji Maharaj's primary reason for separation from the Vadtal diocese and creation of BAPS had been due to doctrinal differences in the interpretation of Akshar (Aksharbrahma) and Purushottam. As articulated in the theology of Akshar- Purushottam Darshan, followers believe Swaminarayan manifests through a lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus beginning with Gunatitanand Swami and currently Mahant Swami Maharaj. = Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) = The Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) was founded in the 1940s by Muktajivandas Swami after he left the Ahmedabad diocese with the belief that Gopalanand Swami, a paramhansa from Swaminarayan's time, was the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan. On 9 July 2020, Jitendrapriyadasji Swami was appointed as the spiritual leader. Followers of the Swaminarayan Gadi accept the Rahasyarth Pradeepika Tika, a five-volume work written by Abji Bapa, as an authentic exegesis of the Vachanamrut. = Gunatit Samaj = The Yogi Divine Society (YDS) was established in 1966, by Dadubhai Patel and his brother, Babubhai after they were excommunicated from BAPS by Yogiji Maharaj. The brothers were expelled after it was discovered that Dadubhai illicitly collected and misappropriated funds and, falsely claiming that he was acting on the organization‚Äôs behalf, led a number of young women to renounce their families and join his ashram under his leadership.Swaminarayan Prakash. June 1966. Mumbai (Dadar): Akshar Bhavan. After Dadubhai‚Äôs death in 1986, an ascetic named Hariprasad Swami became the leader of the Yogi Divine Society. Yogi Divine Society became known as the Gunatit Samaj and consists of several wings: namely, YDS, The Anoopam Mission, and The Gunatit Jyot.  Influence on society  = Humanitarian Service = In addition to his efforts in social reform, Swaminarayan was instrumental in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Gujarat during turbulent times of famine. When given the opportunity to receive two boons from his guru, Swaminarayan asked to receive any miseries destined for followers and to bear any scarcities of food or clothing in place of any followers. In the initial years of the sampradaya, Swaminaryan maintained almshouses throughout Gujarat and directed swamis to maintain the almshouses even under the threat of physical injury by opponents. During a particularly harsh famine in 1813-14, Swaminarayan himself collected and distributed grains to those who were suffering, and he had step wells and water reservoirs dug in various villages. He codified devotees‚Äô engagement with humanitarian service in the Shikshapatri, instructing followers to help the poor and those in need during natural disasters, to establish schools, and to serve the ill, according to their ability. Consequently, various denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya currently engage in humanitarian service at a global scale. For example, BAPS has been involved with coordinating responses to major natural disasters, building various residential and day schools, organizing blood donation drives and free medical clinics as well as constructing and running seven hospitals and treatment centers through its humanitarian services wing, BAPS Charities. Following the devastating earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, they rebuilt 15 villages and neighborhoods and 39 schools. For its work, BAPS has been granted consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. ISSO Seva, a subsidiary of the Ahmedabad diocese, is involved in disaster relief, food and blood donation drives in the United States and providing accessible healthcare in Africa. The Gunatit Samaj also hosts medical camps, provides educational services, healthcare, and other social services in India. The Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) diocese primarily hosts health camps and other social services in the UK, Africa and North America. SVG Charity, a subsidiary of the Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi, is involved in disaster relief, food and medicine donations, blood drives, and organ donation registration drives across the United States, Europe, Canada, and India. = Caste = During Swaminarayan‚Äôs time, the oppressive nature of caste-based customs, like endogamy, dress codes, and commensality, pervaded many aspects of society. Religious groups and other institutions often regulated membership based on caste. Swaminarayan opposed caste-based discrimination and has been credited as one of the foremost social reformers of 19th century India for his efforts in reducing caste-based oppression. In fact, Swaminarayan‚Äôs opposition of caste-based discrimination through his spiritual teachings and practices incited vehement criticism and violence from some high-caste Hindus. Kishore Mashruwala, a Gandhian scholar writes that ‚ÄúSwaminarayan was the first to bring about religious advancement of Shudras in Gujarat and Kathiawad region‚Ä¶And that became the main reason for many to oppose the Sampraday‚Äù. It is noted in an 1823 memorandum published in The Asiatic Journal that upper-caste Hindus ‚Äúregret the levelling nature of [Swaminarayan's] system‚Äù often resulting in frequent violence against followers of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Swaminarayan's doctrine that everyone's true self is the pure atma within which God resides, led him to reject caste-based discrimination and welcome those of all caste backgrounds equally into the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. In his public writings, Swaminarayan allowed for some caste rules to protect his followers from violence incited by his opposition of caste-based discrimination. For example, in the Shikshapatri, Swaminarayan states that his followers should follow rules of the caste system when consuming food and water. Based on these public writings some have criticized Swaminarayan of supporting caste-based discrimination. However, numerous scholars have demonstrated that this criticism is unfounded, citing Swaminarayan‚Äôs continued actions in combating caste-based oppression and promoting inclusivity. In fact, Swaminarayan not only accepted people from all castes into the sampradaya but also Muslims and tribal peoples. Additionally, various historical sources indicate that Swaminarayan himself often ignored caste rules and urged his followers to do the same. When asked about his views on caste by Bishop Reginald Heber, Swaminarayan stated that he did not believe in the caste system but sometimes accommodated it publicly so as to not offend the masses. Taken together, Swaminarayan‚Äôs contemporaries and modern scholars both credit him for reducing caste-based oppression and discrimination through his actions and teachings. Swaminarayan‚Äôs actions uplifted many of the oppressed and drew them to the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Notes References Further reading * Williams, Raymond Brady (2018).

Wilson. It is widely regarded as a seminal piece in island biogeography and ecology. The Princeton University Press reprinted the book in 2001 as a part of the \\"Princeton Landmarks in Biology\\" series. The book popularized the theory that insular biota maintain a dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction rates. The book also popularized the concepts and terminology of r/K selection theory. Background The Theory of Island Biogeography has its roots in Wilson's work on the ants of Melanesia. MacArthur synthesized Wilson's ideas about competition, colonization and equilibrium into a simple graphical representation of immigration and extinction curves, from which one can determine the equilibrial species number on an island. MacArthur and Wilson's ideas were first presented in a paper published in 1963, and were further developed into a book.  Summary  = Introduction = In the introductory chapter, MacArthur and Wilson highlight the significance of studying island biogeography. Since islands are less complex and more numerous than larger ecosystems, islands provide better opportunities to develop insights and perform replicable field research. Given that insular microcosms are common to all ecosystems, principles from island biogeography can be applied generally. This graph portrays the immigration rate of new species and the extinction rate of resident species versus the number of species present on an island. The intersection point gives the equilibrial species number. = Area- diversity pattern = In Chapters 2 and 3, MacArthur and Wilson postulate that insular species richness depends on island size and isolation from source regions. The authors present an equilibrium model that is based on the following concept: when there is an addition of the number of species on an island, the island's immigration rate of new species will decrease while the extinction rate of resident species will increase. MacArthur and Wilson thus assume that there will be an equilibrial point where the immigration rate equals the extinction rate. They further hypothesize that an increase in island size will lower extinction curves while a decrease in distance between the island and the source region will raise immigration curves. Since the intersection of immigration and extinction rate curves determines the species number, the authors predict that larger islands will have more species than smaller islands (assuming these islands are comparably isolated) and isolated islands will have fewer species than islands more proximal to source regions (assuming these islands are equally large). There is additional discourse on how insular clusters and stepping stones affect this model. = Modeling colonization and dispersion = Chapter 4 discusses survivorship theory. The authors describe a model which states that the probability for successful colonization is dependent on birth rate, death rate, and carrying capacity of the environment. From this model, conclusions are made on the average survival time for a propagule's offspring, the average survival time of a saturated population, and characteristics of successful propagules. In Chapter 5, MacArthur and Wilson examine why species can be excluded from insular environments and how the niche of a species changes after introduction. The authors surmise that pioneering species can be excluded for the following reasons: the island has saturated levels of pre-existing competition, the pioneering species cannot maintain a population large enough to avoid extinction, and the island hosts too many or too few natural predators. When a species colonizes a new area, the authors state that the species will either shift, expand or contract its realized niche. Chapter 6 is a theoretical exploration of dispersal models. The authors consider how insular stepping stones affect the dispersion of species‚Äîparticularly, the effects that size and isolation of stepping stones have on dispersion. Further consideration is given to how dispersal curves and average distance travelled by pioneers impacts this study. In Chapter 7, the authors state that there are generally 3 consecutive phases to the evolution of populations after colonization. Initially, there is a trend for colonizers to evolve from r-strategists into K-strategists. The founder effect may also influence colonizing populations during this first phase. The second phase is marked by long term adaptations to the local environment. In this period, abilities for dispersal are commonly reduced, and colonizers will either differentiate or assimilate with competing species. In the third phase, the evolution of colonizing populations may result in speciation and/or adaptive radiation.  Field testing  The insular biota equilibrium theory was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his then-graduate student Daniel Simberloff in six small mangrove islands in the Florida Keys. The islands were fumigated to clear the arthropod populations. Immigration of species onto the island was then observed in a first and second year census. Wilson and Simberloff confirmed that there was an inverse relationship between the number of species on an island and the distance to the source region as predicted in The Theory of Island Biogeography.  Impact  = Applications = MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography has been widely applied outside of island ecosystems. For microbiota, the theory has been applied to the distribution of ectomycorrihzal fungi on trees, the distribution of bacteria in water-filled treeholes, and the distribution of fungi among shrubs. While for flora and fauna, the theory's predictions have been realized with the species richness of plants on mountains and with the species richness of aquatic snails in bodies of water. Novel applications looked at plants as islands for insect speciesOpler PA (1974). Oaks as evolutionary islands for leaf-mining insects. American Scientist. 62: 67-73. and the dependence of the species richness of mites on the areas of the host ranges of rodent species.Dritschilo W, Cornell H, Nafus D, O'Connor B (1975). Insular biogeography: of mice and mites. Science. 190 (4213):467-9. MacArthur and Wilson's work has been used as a basis in other ecological theories, notably the unified neutral theory of biodiversity, and has been foundational for the fields of landscape ecology, invasion biology, and conservation biology. = Criticism = Several studies have disputed the underlying assumptions in MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography: specifically, the interchangeability of species and islands, the independence between immigration and extinction, and the insignificance of non-equilibrial processes. In the 2001 preface, Wilson stated that \\"the flaws of the book lie in its oversimplification and incompleteness\\". = Legacy = In 2007, a symposium was held at Harvard University honoring the fortieth anniversary of The Theory of Island Biogeography. Following this conference, a collection of papers was published in the book The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited. The SLOSS Debate is based on the authors suggestion that a single large reserve was preferable to several small reserves.

The technology, created by major software vendors, including IBM, Oracle Corporation and TIBCO Software, encompasses a wide range of technologies and as such is specified in independent specifications to maintain programming language and application environment neutrality. Many times it uses an enterprise service bus (ESB).  History The original partners announced on November 30, 2005 were: BEA Systems, IBM, IONA Technologies, Oracle Corporation, SAP AG, Sybase, Xcalia and Zend Technologies. Additional members announced on July 26, 2006 were Cape Clear, Interface21, Primeton Technologies, Progress Software, Red Hat, Rogue Wave Software, Software AG, Sun Microsystems and TIBCO Software.Technology srinivas vendors extend collaboration on SOA technologies http://www.hoise.com/primeur/06/articles/monthly/AE-PR-08-06-92.html Siemens AG joined the collaboration of companies working on the technology on September 18, 2006. In addition to the partners, the SCA community had some formal supporters.OSOA Technology Supporters http://www.osoa.org/display/Main/Current+OSOA+Supporters+Community  Definition  On March 21, 2007, the OSOA Collaboration released the first version of specification. The specifications said that an application designed with SCA should have: * Decoupling of application business logic from the details of its invoked service calls * Target services in a multitude of languages including C++, Java, COBOL, and PHP as well as XML, BPEL, and XSLT * The ability to work with various communications constructs including one-way, asynchronous, call-return, and notification * The ability to \\"bind\\" to legacy components or services, accessed normally by technologies such as Web Services, EJB, JMS, JCA, RMI, RPC, CORBA and others * The ability to declare (outside of business logic) the quality of service requirements, such as security, transactions and the use of reliable messaging * Data could be represented in Service Data Objects SCA, therefore, was promoted to offer flexibility for composite applications, flexibly incorporating reusable components in an SOA programming style. Marketing firm Gartner Group published a short brief that promoted the SCA and its included technology of Service Data Objects (SDO) in December 2005 . Advantages: * caters for all existing Java platform technologies and C++ * less technology dependence ‚Äì does not have to rely on the Java programming language or XML * Service Data Objects is a technology specification for data access Disadvantages: * Specification does not address performance of SOA applications, which continues to be a detractor of adoption. * Focusing on portability (instead of interoperability), SCA & SDO, the next Corba? making it vulnerable to repeating CORBA's mistakes. The rise and fall of CORBA SCA was said to provide interoperability through an approach called \\"Activation\\". It is the method that provides the highest degree of component autonomy, compared to older \\"mediation\\" (e.g., JBI) or \\"Invocation\\" method used in JCA, as explained by an architect at SAP. Artifacts The SCA Assembly Model consists of a series of artifacts, which are defined by elements contained in XML files. An SCA runtime may have other non-standard representations of the artifacts represented by these XML files, and may allow for the configuration of systems to be modified dynamically. However, the XML files define the portable representation of the SCA artifacts. The basic artifact is the composite, which is the unit of deployment for SCA and which holds services that can be accessed remotely. A composite contains one or more components, which contain the business function provided by the module. Components offer their function as services, which can either be used by other components within the same module or which can be made available for use outside the module through Entry Points. Components may also depend on services provided by other components -- these dependencies are called references. References can either be linked to services provided by other components in the same module, or references can be linked to services provided outside the module, which can be provided by other modules. References to services provided outside the module, including services provided by other modules, are defined by External Services in the module. Also contained in the module are the linkages between references and services, represented by wires. A component consists of a configured implementation, where an implementation is the piece of program code implementing business functions. The component configures the implementation with specific values for settable properties declared by the implementation. The component can also configure the implementation with wiring of references declared by the implementation to specific target services. Composites are deployed within an SCA System. An SCA System represents a set of services providing an area of business functionality that is controlled by a single organization. As an example, for the accounts department in a business, the SCA System might cover all financial-related functions, and it might contain a series of modules dealing with specific areas of accounting, with one for customer accounts and another dealing with accounts payable. To help build and configure the SCA System, Composites can be used as component implementations, in the same way as Java classes or BPEL processes. In other words, SCA allows a hierarchy of composites that is arbitrarily deep ‚Äì such a nested model is termed recursive. The capture and expression of non-functional requirements, such as security, is an important aspect of service definition, and affects SCA throughout the life-cycle of components and compositions. SCA provides the Policy Framework to support specification of constraints, capabilities and Quality of Service (QoS) expectations, from component design through to concrete deployment. Transition to a standards body After several years of incubation under an informal industry collaboration, early (V1.0) implementations of the specification are now coming to market. The collaboration partners indicated that formal industry standardization would be the appropriate next step and announced their intentions in March 2007. The chosen Standards Development Organization is the OASIS organization, and a new OASIS Open CSA Member Section has been established. Charters for six new Technical Committees (TCs) have been submitted to OASIS and a Call for Participation for Technical Committee members has been issued within the OASIS organization. The Technical Committees planned to start their work in September 2007. Participation in these OASIS SCA TCs remains open to all companies, non-profit groups, governments, academic institutions, and individuals. Archives of the work will be accessible to both members and non-members, and OASIS will offer a mechanism for public comment.

The series focuses on the \\"Rabbit Doubt\\" cell phone game, with rules similar to Mafia. The players must find the wolf, or killer, amongst their group of rabbits as they are picked off one-by-one. Six players of this game find themselves trapped in a building with one of the group already dead; to avoid the same fate, the remaining five must play a real-life game of \\"Rabbit Doubt\\" and find the wolf (liar) hiding among them. The manga was first serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan on July 12, 2007 and ended its run on February 12, 2009. Square Enix also released the first volume on December 22, 2007 and released the fourth and final volume on February 12, 2009. The series has continued with two spiritual sequels, titled Judge, from January 12, 2010 to August 11, 2012, and Secret, from October 12, 2013 to February 12, 2015. Plot Doubt revolves around a fictional cell phone game called \\"Rabbit Doubt\\", in which the players are rabbits in a colony; one of these players is randomly chosen to act as a wolf infiltrating the group. Each round, the rabbits guess which is the wolf as the rabbits are eaten one-by-one until only the wolf is left. In the story, four players of the \\"Rabbit Doubt\\" game Y≈´ Aikawa, Eiji Hoshi, Haruka Akechi, Rei Hazama and a non-player Mitsuki H≈çyama meet to relax together. They are knocked unconscious and awaken in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, filled with security cameras, to meet Hajime Komaba, a medical student, and discover Rei hanged. The group finds Rei's cell phone and realize that they're playing a real-life game of \\"Rabbit Doubt\\". To survive, the wolf, described as the liar, must die. Later, the groups tries to find an exit and the wolf using bar codes found imprinted on their bodies. However, their chances are limited as each bar code will open only one door. Y≈´ discovers that he does not have a barcode anywhere on his body. He tries to hide this fact by lying, saying his code was on his stomach so no one would doubt him and say he was the wolf. Eiji is furious that this game has someone killing each other and only ceases to cause pain and anger. Accusing Hajime, who was not with the group when captured, of being the wolf and hitting Y≈´, he is locked in a room. After unlocking a room with surveillance cameras in them, the group find a mysterious guy under a rabbit's headgear. He later dies from a poison thumbtack under the headgear, which, when removed, would prick the unknown guy. They use Hajime's barcode to unlock a library, and there they find a book of everyone's hidden secrets, even Mitsuki. This causes the group to doubt one another. Haruka accuses Mitsuki being the wolf, attacks her and locks her in the bathroom. The group tie up Y≈´ in the surveillance room where he witnesses Eiji's death for a brief second. Hajime unties Y≈´ to check on Eiji, just to find his hand chopped off and the door stuck. Afterwards, the roles are reversed and Hajime is tied up and Mitsuki is placed in the hospital bed from Haruka's attack. Y≈´ checks the wolf's room which was unlocked thanks to the mysterious guy's barcode. He checks the rabbit headgears and finds Haruka's head in one of them. Y≈´ runs back to check on Mitsuki only to find Hajime on the floor, untied and attacked, and Mitsuki has been hung. Both accuse each other of being the wolf. Later, Hajime is attacked by Mitsuki, who had faked her own death. Mitsuki accuses Y≈´ of lying to not only the group, but to her, personally. She says she gave everyone a barcode except Y≈´ to throw suspicion on him so they would lock him up, so Mitsuki could kill everyone and escape with Y≈´. Mitsuki reveals to Y≈´ how everyone in the group had lied. Eiji had lied about being a friendly guy, but in reality he had gotten someone killed when he went to war with a neighboring city. Haruka seemed charismatic and kind but was actually the leader of her high school's prostitution ring, where she even blackmailed the customers. Hajime had killed a little girl while practicing at his father's hospital, but the news was swept under the rug to protect him. She receives a call on her cellphone and steps away to answer. It is revealed to be Mitsuki's father (who has planned the game) calling. He had agreed to be the guarantor on a friend's loan, but he was betrayed and saddled with an enormous debt, and he attempted suicide. For this Mitsuki explains that she wants to punish all liars to achieve her father's revenge, and thus she no longer trusts Y≈´, because he lied to her about not being able to hang out with her after school a week ago. In reality, he had been out with a female classmate to secretly buy Mitsuki a birthday present, but Mitsuki saw them together and assumed that they were a couple, even killing the classmate. When Mitsuki leaves to kill Hajime, Hajime reaches Y≈´ and reveals his real identity as a detective investigating teenage disappearances and hands him a scalpel to use as a weapon. Y≈´ and Hajime successfully knock Mitsuki out. When Y≈´ tries to open the exit with Mitsuki's bar code, Rei is revealed to be alive and she identifies herself as the actual wolf. Previously, Mitsuki had gone to Rei seeking advice help to ease her pain with hypnosis, but led her down a path of revenge. Rei is seeking revenge because the media believed her hypnosis was a sham, causing her parents who supported her to commit suicide. In order to achieve revenge, she lied about her accident, manipulated Mitsuki, using hypnosis to pretend to be her father, who actually died in the hospital, and giving her orders as 'him'. Rei had used the mysterious man to kill previous players of Rabbit's Doubt. Rei orders Mitsuki to kill Yuu, however, the love Mitsuki has for Y≈´ occasionally overpowers the hypnosis. Rei releases the surviving players and calls the police. Mitsuki, who has fallen into a coma, is accused of the murders as there is no evidence of Rei being there. At the hospital, Y≈´ receives a call from Rei. She reveals that the reason there was no evidence of her presence at the game site is because one of the forensics agents working the scene is one of her Wolves, and although Y≈´ tries to contact Hajime (who is at the scene to find evidence) about it, he is too late to save him from being strangled. Rei also tricks him into saying a phrase that causes Mitsuki to awaken in her \\"wolf mode\\": 'For the ones I love'. In the last scene, she approaches Y≈´ with a knife.

After Hiro shifts an appointment Hikari had with Atsuya, he finds out his brother was hit by a truck and died, leaving him consumed by remorse. Two years later, he wakes up one day handcuffed in a dark building, wearing a heavy rabbit mask. After a few steps, he enters a courtroom where seven other teenagers, also dressed in animal masks, await him, as well as a young boy who has died. Each animal mask represents one of the seven deadly sins: gluttony (pig), avarice (fox), sloth (bear), pride (lion), lust (cat), envy (rabbit) and anger (horse). A video tells them through a stuffed toy the rules of the game in which they are forced to participate: every twelve hours, a voting takes place during which they would have to choose to sacrifice one of them until only four survivors remain in the game. * Hiroyuki \\"Hiro\\" Sakurai: he is the main character of the manga. He was in love with his childhood friend Hikari, who was dating his older brother Atsuya. He decides one day, nevertheless, to confess his feelings, by shifting an appointment that she had with Atsuya, but this initiative indirectly caused the death of the latter, hit by a truck. Two years later, Hiro finds himself in a dark place, handcuffed and wearing a rabbit mask, symbol of the sin of envy, for provoking the death of his brother, before meeting eight other teenagers in a courtroom, one of whom died before his arrival. The end of the manga reveals that Hiro was the mastermind of the game alongside Hikari, with both aiming to make the judge and jury members who acquitted the drunken truck driver who ran over his brother watch their family members die before being killed themselves. However, Hiro is poisoned himself by Hikari, who found out that he was the one who shifted Atsuya's appointment with her. * Kazuyuki \\"Kazu\\" Asai: a brown-haired boy who is in high school and quickly sympathizes with Hiro. He claims to be homosexual, which constitutes his sin, judged of lust. He found himself wearing a cat mask, like Asami. The third victim of the game, killing himself with a poisoned needle. * Rina Okamoto: a high-school girl whose alleged sin is avarice, represented by a fox mask, although she shows no trace of this trait. Everything suggests that she is the only one who has committed no sin, and that she is only a victim of the game. It turns out that, despite being a member of the jury that acquitted the truck driver, Rina's mother rejected the bribery attempt, and both mother and daughter managed to survive the game. * Nobuyuki Yamaguchi: a long-haired boy who found himself wearing a bear mask, an animal symbol of sloth. He seems to have a fairly violent past, apparently having killed his own mother because she criticized the way he lived. The second victim, killed with a poisoned needle. * Ry√ªhei Shinomiya: a tall, thin young man, with gray hair capped in a Visual Kei style. He claims to have no real purpose in life, and was found wearing the mask of the horse, having sinned in wrath. His crime is unknown, but his reality is unquestionable given his aggressive and provocative personality. The fourth victim of the game, stabbed with a pair of scissors by Hiro when both received an equal number of votes and had to fight until one of them died. * Hayato Takizawa: a law student, dressed in a suit, with black hair and glasses. He seems silent and contemptuous, and says he is ready to do anything to get out of the game and take revenge on his father, Kazunori. He is calm and manipulative. His sin is pride, represented by his lion mask, referring to his status as a student of law and also to his haughty and manipulative character. Killed by his own father, Kazuyuki Takizawa (the judge of the drunk driver's trial, who never assumed Hayato's paternity) with a cross-bow arrow shot through his heart, after he tried to betray and kill his very own father (Kazuyuki then falls from the stairs and dies shortly afterwards). * Asami Kimura: a blonde girl wearing a Christian cross in a wooden pendant. She displays a sexual behavior, trying to seduce Hiro to make him follow her votes. Found herself wearing a cat mask, representing the sin of lust. After seeing her fianc√© being part of another game, she vowed to win for the sake of seeing him again. The fifth victim of the game, repeatedly stabbed in the neck with glass shards by Miku when both received an equal number of votes and had to fight until one of them died. * Miku Sanada: a shy, timid girl with long black hair and glasses. Her sin, gluttony (represented by her pig mask), is derived from her past as an obese teenager before becoming thin with an operation paid by the bribe her grandfather accepted to acquit the drunk driver who killed Atsuya. After seeing her grandfather in another game, she vowed to somehow save him. Killed by Hayato's father with a cross-bow arrow shot through her forehead. * \\"The Pig Guy\\": an overweight boy, found dead next to a pig mask as soon as the other participants were allowed to remove their masks, due to removing his mask before he was authorized to do so by Kazu. Kazu was following orders from his captives who threatened to kill his mother via cellphone contact. His sin is gluttony. *Kazuyuki Takizawa: the paternal parent of Hayato Takizawa. He had an affair with another woman and she gave birth to Hayato. Trying to sweep this secret under the rug, he paid the family off to silence them. Later, Hayato's mother dies and Hayato grows to resent his father. Kazuyuki kill's Miku's grandfather when he could not stand the old man's whining to see his granddaughter. With only four people making it out of this game alive (including the captured loved ones), he continues his killing spree by killing Miku and later Hayato after he has been betrayed. In a ruse to get back at Kazuyuki, Hayato had begun already planned to expose his father, a lawful judge, of his misdoings (i.e. bribery) in the court room. Hiro and Hikari plan to use the information found in Hayato's home to frame Kazuyuki and get away with the game. Later, Kazuyaki falls and is hung with a pipe and chain. *Hikari: a sweet-looking girl, who is best friends with Hiro. She had gotten advice to ask out the person she loves and asks out Hiro's brother, Atsuya, without knowing Hiro has deep feelings for her. Hiro devises a plan to tell his brother that Hikari had changed plans to meet up one hour later than the original time, in hopes to swoop in and show up himself, and Atsuya tells his boss about this change. Later, Hikari gets a message saying Atsuya had been hit by a drunk driver and tells Hiro, who feels guilty about what he has done. During the events of the game, Hiro and Hikari had been planning to exact revenge on the judges, jury and their loved ones who had been paid off to say the driver was innocent when proof showed the driver was not. With the loved ones playing the game, the judges and jury watch. Kazuyuki was the only one to figure out their plans, but it was too late. He had already been captured, killed and framed for the game. When exiting the building, Hikari had previously handed Hiro water which was laced with poison. As Hiro is dying, Hikari towers over him and tells him he is guilty for his actions. She found out Hiro's ruse after she asked Atsuya's boss why Atsuya was late.

He tries several times to find the criminals, but comes to the conclusion that he is one too, since he believes himself to have caused the death of one of his classmates by removing the bar that had pierced her back after the accident, at her request. Even if he did not remove the bar, the bus explosion would have killed her and burned her alive. It is revealed he had killed his mother due to complications from his birth leading to his father becoming an alcoholic. * Rika Konno: a young idol, who was forced to abandon her career following an injury to the right eye caused by the accident, is still obsessed with having fans and her looks. She is manipulated by Mitomo, who tells her that Sanada and Amano are the culprits of the accident. This leads her to capturing them both and burning Amano's house down, unaware that they survived. After watching the news, a reporter reveals the sleeping pills from Amano Hospital were stolen by a nurse. After discovering she has been tricked, she attacks Mitomo with a knife after he had been contained. It is not revealed whether he died or not, but it is implied Mitomo turned her into the third murderer by unknowingly using himself as the victim. * Eiji Amano: a quiet student, whose brother works in the hospital where strong sleeping pills had been stolen. Because of this, he is seen as a suspect by his comrades. Under Mitomo's manipulation, he gets seriously injured by Konno, but survives with Sanada's help and hiding in a storage space. It is revealed he is stressed due to his parents pressuring him to succeed like his older brother. Mitomo planned to use the stolen sleeping pills story to tie it in with the inebriated bus driver. It is never revealed what caused the bus driver to become sedated. * Tsuyoshi Odzu: a red- haired teenager who is Sanada's best friend and saved his life at the end of the series when Mitomo tries to hang him. Odzu had injured his left arm in the accident which caused him to wear a cast. He was in love with a classmate, a girl named Kisaragi, and feels guilty of her death since they exchanged seats shortly before the accident. Odzu and Sanada set up a plan to get Mitomo to confess his crimes and records it through his phone which was hidden in his cast. * Ryoko Kunikida: she takes care of other people to divert attention to the fact that she apparently killed Futami, accidentally, who she was in love with. Her version of the story is she accidentally made him fall from the roof of the school, during a discussion caused by her jealousy. Kunikida had found Toono's bookmark that she gave to Futami and was planning to throw it over the roof. Futami grabs her and lets go of the bookmark, which causes Futami to leap over the roof's railing in an attempt to catch it. As he does, he falls to his death. Kunikida saw Shima attack Odzu so she manipulated Shima to attempt to kill Mitomo at the school. Mitomo thinks she is the second killer. * Yukito Shima: a chubby teenager, who killed a classmate in a fit of rage just after the accident. He tries to injure Odzu after he claims to have seen someone standing on the bus. Afterwards, he tries to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the school. Shima is saved by a suicide net. After being arrested, Mitomo believes Shima won't be charged to the highest degree due to being a minor. In theory, he is the only classmate who has killed anyone. * Shinichi Mitomo: the school guidance counselor who accuses three of the accident survivors of being murderers. A mysterious person, he seems to have a hidden agenda and to know more about the accident than he lets on. After discovering Toono, his half-sister (same father), was pregnant, Mitomo planned to kill every boy in her class. Especially the surviving male members, by manipulating them into turning on each other and manipulating Konno to do his bidding. *Shun Futami: a classmate of the suspected six survivors. Due to catching a fever, he did not go on the field trip. Leaving a suicide note behind, he jumps off the roof and dies. In the note, he reveals he has survivor's guilt, but his mother and Sanada did not believe this was the case. After finding evidence proving he was never suicidal, Sanada puts the clues together and finds out it was Kunikida who wrote the note and accidentally forced Futami to jump off of the roof after confessing her unrequited love for him. Due to his apparent suicide, a suicide net is placed on the roof of the school. *Ami Toono: a classmate who died in the bus accident. Shima liked her due to her kindness. Toono was dating Futami and was pregnant with his child. It is believed Futami committed suicide due to her and the baby's death. During the accident, Sanada believes he killed Toono by pulling a metal rod out of her back, but that was not the case since she would have burned alive. Later, it is revealed Toono is Mitomo's sister and that Mitomo had a one-sided incestuous love for her. *Ryou Shimizu: a classmate who is a known heartbreaker that was killed after the bus had crashed. When the accident had occurred, Shimizu was trapped under seats. He bribes Shima to save him implying he would use Toono and then throw her so Shima could pick her up in an emotional state. Due to this, Shima kills Shimizu by bashing his head in multiple times. The police did not believe Shimizu's death was an accident.

He is considered by most Russian sources to be the top ace of the Korean War, with 22 victories. Biography Sutyagin was born in 1923 near Nizhniy Novgorod, then known as Gorkiy. His parents were actors, and eventually moved to the city when Nikolai was 11. Joining the Komsomol in 1939, Nikolai was then able to get into the DOSAAF program where he was exposed to flying in the Polikarpov Po-2 biplane. In March 1941 he was conscripted into the Red Army, but was then posted to the Soviet Air Force. He then went to pilot school, graduating in 1942, and was sent to the 5th Fighter Aviation Regiment in the Far East. He remained in the Far East until the end of the war, acquiring some combat experience in the war with Japan after the Soviets declared war on the Japanese Empire. After the war, Sutyagin learned to fly the American P-63 Kingcobra, also flying as an instructor in the Soviet-converted UTI P-63 two-seater. In April 1947 Sutyagin joined the 17th Fighter Aviation Regiment, part of the 190th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) in the Far East Military District. In 1950 the 17th was moved to the new 303rd IAD, which included the 523rd Fighter Aviation Regiment and 18th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, and the entire division was equipped with the new MiG-15 jet fighter. Sutyagin completed 54 flights in the MiG-15 before the division was ordered on a \\"secret tour\\" and reassigned to the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps at Mukden in Manchuria, with its regiments forward deployed to Myaogao and Antung airfields on the Korean border, in order to counter UN airpower over Korea. Sutyagin began combat operations in April 1951. When he left Korea in February 1952, Captain Sutyagin had been credited with shooting down 22 UN aircraft. He was the highest scoring ace in the Korean war, outscoring the top U.S ace Captain Joseph C. McConnell by 6 kills. Sutyagin was awarded the Gold Star and the title Hero of the Soviet Union, and was soon promoted to Major. By 1970 he was a chief instructor and Major- General of Aviation (the equivalent of US rank of Brigadier general). Sutyagin served a further combat tour as chief instructor for flight training to the Vietnamese People's Air Force and taught combat tactics in 1970-1971, flying the MiG-21PF and MiG-17. Suffering ill health, he returned to the USSR in May 1972 and was sent to GSFG in East Germany to recuperate. Due to his failing vision Sutyagin was removed from flight status and relegated to either trainers or transports. Sutyagin retired in May 1978 at the age of 55, and spent the last years of his life with his family, dying in November 1986 at the age of 63. Over the course of his career he flew 20 types of aircraft and logged over 3,300 flight hours. He claimed 15 F-86 Sabres, three F-84 Thunderjets, two P-80 Shooting Stars and two Gloster Meteors shot down. Sutyagin's Korean War record was 149 combat missions, 66 aerial engagements and 22 enemy aircraft shot down.

Excavations and research In 2008 Fennell led summer research and excavations at the New Philadelphia Town Site in Illinois.James Janega, \\"Long-buried story of black America: Archeologists provide concrete details about African-American land speculators and utopian pioneers in the Midwest\\", Chicago Tribune.com, 8 June 2008, accessed 1 June 2009 It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009.Juliet E.K. Walker, ‚ÄúNew Philadelphia‚Äù , Center for Heritage Resource Studies, University of Maryland, 2006, accessed 1 June 2009 The town site is at New Philadelphia, Illinois. This plot of land in Pike County, Illinois was the site of the first town platted and registered by an African American before the American Civil War. It had black and white residents, and an integrated school. As a railroad was built bordering a neighboring community, the New Philadelphia expansion seemed to come to a halt. By the early 20th century, only a few homes and families remained. Today only prairie remains with no evidence of a once-flourishing community. During the fall and spring of 2002 and 2003, Fennell and a team from University of Illinois, University of Maryland and other institutions used topographical and historical maps to find the exact location of the New Philadelphia Site. They found plots of land with artifacts such as nails, ceramic pieces, and shards of glass, showing obvious signs of a previous settlement. The archaeologists are working with the New Philadelphia Land Trust to excavate and preserve the site and its history. In 1999 and 2000, Fennell performed excavations and studies in the upper Potomac River and northern Shenandoah River region surrounding Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Included were an 18th-century house and St. Peter's Church and School in Harper‚Äôs Valley. He examined three cultural processes: the formation and dissipation of social groups, the development of language and communication through material culture, and regional exchange systems.

He resisted changes which the US government and local leaders wanted to impose to achieve statehood for what became Oklahoma. These included extinguishing tribal governments and civic institutions and breaking up communal lands into allotments to individual households, with United States sales of the \\"surplus\\" to European-American and other settlers. He was the leader of the Crazy Snake Rebellion\\"Indians in Revolt; Six Whites Killed\\", New York Times, March 29, 1909, p1 on March 25, 1909 in Oklahoma. At the time this was called the last \\"Indian uprising\\". Early life Born in the Muscogee Creek Nation in Indian Territory after the tribe was removed from Alabama in the 1830s, Wilson Jones was a Muscogee Creek Indian. He was better known by his Creek name of Chitto Harjo, meaning \\"Crazy Snake.\\" Chitto means \\"snake\\" and Harjo means \\"to be brave without regard for one's personal well being or 'crazy brave'.\\" He was a traditionalist, belonging to the minority of the tribe who remained loyal to the Union during the American Civil War.McIntosh, Kenneth W. \\"Harjo, Chitto (1846‚Äìca. 1911).\\" Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (retrieved 5 Sept 2011) Later in the century, traditionalists worked to reinstate the tribal government of 1867 and to enforce treaty rights with the United States. They opposed the extinguishing of government and allotment of lands to households under the Dawes Commission.JOHN BARTLETT MESERVE, \\"THE PLEA OF CRAZY SNAKE (Chitto Harjo)\\", Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 11, No. 3, September 1933, accessed 30 Apr 2010 Career While a young man, Chitto Harjo was allied with the federalists or Loyalists led by Opothleyahola, who moved the group to Kansas in 1861 with the start of the American Civil War. They remained loyal to the Union when most Creek allied with the Confederacy. He and many of these Creek men were recruited to the Union Army and served with federal forces in the Civil War. In testimony in 1906, he said that he had believed this service, in a war between the white men and one which did not concern the Indians, would help ensure the maintenance of government promises to his people. The Civil War divided the tribe, as many Creek were allied with the Confederacy. Michael Dean, \\"Roy Hoffman and Chitto Harjo\\", Oklahoma Journeys, Week of March 6, 2010, Oklahoma Historical Society, accessed 30 Apr 2010 In the late 19th century, the Muscogee Creek and other American Indian tribes in Indian Territory were pressured to change by the US government, in part to make way for a demand for statehood by European- American settlers in parts of the territory. There was national legislation to extinguish tribal government and to establish individual household allotments of land in place of tribal communal holdings. Congress created the Dawes Commission in 1896 to carry out the allotment of lands for the Five Civilized Tribes. The Dawes Rolls were the registries of tribal members who were eligible to receive allotments. These became a record of tribal members. Chitto Harjo was a leader in the Four Mothers Society, an intertribal religious movement. This group sought to revive the traditional practices and solidarity between related tribes that had been relocated to Oklahoma from the southeastern United States. In 1900 a meeting at Harjo's ceremonial grounds of Old Hickory declared the chief Pleasant Porter deposed for having violated the 1867 Creek Constitution while cooperating with the allotment process. They selected Chitto Harjo as the new principal chief of the Creek. They founded a police force, known as Lighthorse, and attempted to dissuade the Creek from accepting allotment of lands.Tom Holm. The Great Confusion in Indian Affairs: Native Americans & Whites in the Progressive Era, Austin: University of Texas Press, 2005, pp. 27-29 From 1900 to 1909, Chitto Harjo led Creek resistance to the assimilation changes. The Green Peach War took place in 1901, and Isparhecher retired. He had been a judge in the Okmulgee District and leader of Loyalists. Harjo led those Creek who opposed cultural assimilation and allotment. As the US was trying to extinguish tribal government, Crazy Snake and his followers set up a separate government for a time at the old Hickory Stomp Grounds southeast of Okmulgee. Chitto Harjo and others were arrested and convicted in US court and imprisoned briefly. They were released on parole. During the next five years, the majority of the tribe accepted the changes and were allotted individual plots of land, in preparation for the territory to be admitted to statehood as Oklahoma. Chitto Harjo and other Snakes refused to choose their allotments. In 1906 members of a Special Senate Investigating Committee visited the Indian Territory to learn more about the issues and why some of the Muscogee Creek people were resisting changes. Harjo, as the recognized as a leader of the traditionalists, testified at length to the senators. His speech to the US Congress in 1906 is considered an eloquent statement regarding US treatment of Indian peoples. It is often quoted for the phrase, \\"as long as the grass grows\\", used in regard to the promised perpetuity of Indian treaties and agreements with the US government. In 1909, after Oklahoma had achieved statehood and passed Jim Crow laws like those of neighboring states of Arkansas and Texas, a group of African Americans came to Harjo's grounds seeking refuge. They had faced discrimination and been driven out of other parts of Oklahoma. During the time of the March meeting of the Four Mothers Society, local European-Americans said that a piece of smoked meat had been stolen from them. Fearing an alliance between the Creek and the African Americans, they called together a white posse to break up the black encampment. A melee ensued in which one black man was killed, a white man wounded, and 42 blacks were arrested and jailed. Whites began to get arms, wanting to break up the Creek-black encampment and to arrest Chitto Harjo, known as a conservative leader. When a group went to his house, a gun battle broke out. Two white deputies were quickly killed and others were wounded; Harjo and his followers escaped to the old Choctaw Nation. They were helped by fellow members of the Four Mothers Society. This became known as the \\"Crazy Snake Rebellion\\". The Oklahoma governor, \\"Charles N. Haskell, ordered a militia to pursue the Creek conservatives and restore order in McIntosh and Okmulgee counties.\\" The commanding officer found that whites were causing most of the problem and forced the disbanding of posses in the area. Harjo took refuge with Daniel Bob, a Choctaw conservative leader, in McCurtain County, Oklahoma. He died in 1911, without being seen again by white enforcers.  Address to US Senate committee  Chitto Harjo, under the name Eufala Harjo, testified before the Select Committee of the Senate. Harjo, along with several representatives of Cherokee, Creek, and other tribes strongly opposed breaking up tribal land into individual allotments. Harjo told a Senate investigating committee that \\"I will never stop asking for this treaty, the old treaty that our fathers made with the Government which gave us this land forever ... as long as the grass grows, water runs, and the sun rises.\\" Statement of Eufaula Harjo to Select Committee to Investigate Matters Connected with Affairs in the Indian Territory, SR 5013, 59th Cong., 2d sess., p. 89. Harjo gave this further testimony: \\"I will begin with a recital of the relations of the Creeks with the Government of the United States from 1861 and I will explain it so you will understand it. I look to that time‚Äîto the treaties of the Creek Nation with the United States‚Äîand I abide by the provisions of the treaty made by the Creek Nation with the Government in 1861. I would like to enquire what had become of the relations between the Indians and the white people from 1492 down to 1861? \\"My ancestors and my people were the inhabitants of this great country from 1492. I mean by that from the time the white man first came to this country until now. It was my home and the home of my people from time immemorial and is today, I think, the home of my people. Away back in that time‚Äîin 1492‚Äîthere was man by the name of Columbus came from across the great ocean [Atlantic] and he discovered this country for the white man‚Äîthis country which was at that time the home of my people. What did he find when he first arrived here? Did he find a white man standing on this continent then or did he find a black man standing here? Did he find either a black man or a white man standing on this continent? I stood here first and Columbus first discovered me. \\"I want to know what did he say to the red man at that time? He was on one of the great four roads that led to light. At that time Columbus received the information that was given to him by my people. My ancestor informed him that he was ready to accept this light he proposed to give him and walk these four roads of light and have his children under his direction. He told him it was all right. He told him, 'The land is all yours; the law is all yours'. He said it is all right. He told him, 'I will always take care of you. If your people meet with any troubles, I will take these troubles away. I will stand before you and behind you and on each side of you and your people, and if any people come into your country I will take them away and you shall live in peace under me. My arms,' he said, 'are very long'. He told him to come within his protecting arms and he said, 'If anything comes against you for your ruin I will stand by you and preserve you and defend you and protect you.' \\" 'There is a law,' he said at that time, 'that is above every other law and that is away up yonder‚Äîhigh up‚Äîfor,' said he, 'if any other town or nation or any other tribe come against you I will see through that law that you are protected. It does not make any difference to you,' he said, 'if as many as twelve other nations come against you or twelve other tribes come against you it will not make any difference for I will combine with you and protect you and overthrow them all. I will protect you in all things and take care of everything about your existence so you will live in this land that is yours and your fathers' without fear.' That is what he said and we agreed upon those terms. He told me that as long as the sun shone and the sky is up yonder these agreements shall be kept. This was the first agreement that we had with the white man. He said as long as the sun rises it shall last; as long as the waters run it shall last; as long as the grass grows it shall last. [Bolding added.] That was what it was to be and we agreed upon those terms. That was what the agreement was and we signed our names to that agreement and to those terms. He said, 'Just as long as you see light here; just as long as you see this light glimmering over us, shall these agreements be kept and not until all these things shall cease and pass away shall our agreement pass away.' That is what he said and we believed it. I think there is nothing that has been done by the people should abrogate them. We have kept every term of that agreement. The grass is growing, the waters run, the sun shines, the light is with us and the agreement is with us yet for the God that is above us all witnessed that agreement. He said to me that whoever did anything against me was doing it against him and against the agreement and he said if anyone attempted to do anything against me, to notify him for whatever was done against me was against him and therefore against the agreement. He said that he would send good men amongst us to teach us about his God and to treat them good for they were his representatives and to listen to them and if anyone attempted to molest us to, tell them (the missionaries) and they would tell him. He told me that he would protect me in all ways; that he would take care of my people and look after them; that he would succor them if they needed succor and be their support at all times and I told him it was all right and he wrote the agreement that way. \\"Now, coming down to 1832 and referring to the agreements between the Creek people and the Government of the United States; What has occurred since 1832 until today? It seems that some people forget what has occurred. After all, we are all one blood; we have the one God and we live in the same land. I had always lived back yonder in what is now the State of Alabama. We had our homes back there; my people had their homes back there. We had our troubles back there and we had no one to defend us. At that time when I had these troubles, it was to take my country away from me. I had no other troubles. The troubles were always about taking my country from me. I could live in peace with all else, but they wanted my country and I was in trouble defending it. It was no use. They were bound to take my country away from me. It may have been that my country had to, be taken away from me, but it was not justice. I have always been asking for justice. I have never asked for anything else but justice. I never had justice. First, it was this and then it was something else that was taken away from me and my people, so we couldn't stay there any more. It was not because a man had to stand on the outside of what was right that brought the troubles. What was to be done was all set out yonder in the light and all men knew what the law and the agreement was. It was a treaty‚Äîa solemn treaty‚Äîbut what difference did that make? I want to say this to you today, because I don't want these ancient agreements between the Indian and the white man violated and I went as far as Washington and had them sustained and made treaties about it. We made terms of peace, for it had been war, but we made new terms of peace and made new treaties. Then it was the overtures of the Government to my people to leave their land, the home of their fathers, the land that they loved. He said, 'It will be better for you to do as I want, for these old treaties cannot be kept any longer.' He said, 'You look away off to the West, away over backward and there you will see a great river called the Mississippi River and away over beyond that is another river called the Arkansas River.' And he said, 'You go way out there and you will find a land that is fair to look upon and is fertile, and you go there with your people and I will give that country to you and your people forever.' He said, 'Go way out there beyond these two rivers; away out the direction of the setting sun and select your land‚Äîwhat you want of it‚Äîand I will locate you and your people there and I will give you that land forever and I will protect you and your children in it forever.' That was the agreement and the treaty and I and my people came out here and settled on this land and I carried out these agreements and treaties in all points and violated none. I came over and located here. \\"What took place in 1861? I had made my home here with my people and I was living well out here with my people. We were all prospering. We had a great deal of property here, all over this country. We had come here and taken possession of it under our treaty. We had laws that were living laws and I was living here under then laws. You are my fathers and I tell you that in 1861, I was living here in peace and plenty with my people and we were happy; and then my white fathers rose in arms against each other to, fight each other. They did fight each other. At that day Abraham Lincoln was President of the United States and our Great Father. He was in Washington and I was away off down here. My white brothers divided into factions and went to war. When the white people raised in arms and tried to destroy one another, it was not for the purpose of destroying my people at all. It was not for the purpose of destroying treaties with the Indians. They did not think of that and the Indian was not the cause of that great war at all. The cause of that war was because there was a people that were black in skin and color who had always been in slavery. In my old home in Alabama and all through the south part of the Nation and out in this country, these black people were held in slavery and up in the North there were no slaves. The people of that part of the United States determined to set the black man free and the people in the South determined that they should not and they went to war about it. In that war the Indians had not any part. It was not their war at all. The purpose of the war was to set these black people at liberty and I had nothing to, do with it. He told me to come out here and have my laws back, and I came out here with my people and had my own laws and was living under them. On account of some of your own sons‚Äîthe ancient brothers of mine‚Äîthey came over here and caused me to enroll along with my people on your side. I left my home and my country and everything I had in the world and went rolling on toward the Federal Army. I left my laws and my government; I left my people and my country and my home; I left everything and went with the Federal Army for my father in Washington. I left them in order to stand by my treaties. I left everything and I arrived in Kansas‚ÄîI mean it was at Leavenworth where I arrived. It was a town away up in Kansas on the Missouri River. I arrived at Fort Leavenworth to do what I could for my father's country and stand by my treaties. There at Fort Leavenworth was the orator of the Federal Army and I went and fell before the orator of the Federal Army. It was terrible hard times with me then. In that day I was under the Sons of my father in Washington. I was with the Federal soldiers. \\"I am speaking now of this orator in the Federal Army. I went and fell before him and I and my people joined the Federal Army because we wanted to, keep our treaties with the father in Washington. Things should not have been that way but that is the way they were. The father at Washington was not able to keep his treaty with me and I had to leave my country, as I have stated, and go into the Federal Army. I went in as a Union soldier. When I took the oath, I raised my hand and called God to witness that I was ready to die in the cause that was right and to help my father defend his treaties. All this time the fire was going on and the war and the battles were going on, and today I have conquered all and regained these treaties that I have with the Government. I believe that everything wholly and fully came back to me on account of the position I took in that war. I think that. I thought then and I think today that is the way to do‚Äîto stand up and be a man that keeps his word all the time and under all circumstances. That is what I did and I know that in doing so I regained again all my old treaties for the father at Washington conquered in that war and he promised me that if I was faithful to, my treaties, I should have them all back again. I was faithful to my treaties and I got them all back again and today I am living under them and with them. I never agreed to the exchanging of lands and I never agreed to the allotting of my lands. I knew it would never do for my people and I never could say a b c so far as that is concerned. I never knew anything about English. I can't speak the tongue. I can't read it. I can't write it. I and my people, great masses of them, are unenlightened and uneducated. I am notifying you of these things because your Government officials have told me and my people that they would take care of my relations with the Government and I think they ought to be taking care of them as they promised. He said that if anyone trespassed on my rights or questioned them to let him know and he would take care of them and protect them. I always thought that this would be done. I believe yet it will be done. I don't know what the trouble is now. I don't know anything about it. I think my lands are all cut up. I have never asked that be done but I understand it has been done. I don't know why it was done. My treaty said that it never would be done unless I wanted it done. That anything I did not want to be done contrary to that treaty would not be done. I never made these requests. I went through death for this cause and I now hold the release this Government gave me. I served the father faithfully and as a reward, I regained my country back again and I and my children will remain on it and live upon it as we did in the old time. I believe it. I know it is right. I know it is justice. \\"I hear the Government is cutting up my land and is giving it away to black people. I want to know if this is so. It can't be so for it is not in the treaty. These black people, who are they? They are negroes who came in here as slaves. They have no right to this land. It never was given to them. It was given to me and my people and we paid for it with our land back in Alabama. The black people have no right to it. Then can it be that the Government is giving it‚Äîmy land‚Äîto the negro? I hear it is and they are selling it. This can't be so. It wouldn't be justice. I am informed and believe it to be true that some citizens of the United States have title to land that was given to my fathers and my people by the Government. If it was given to me, what right has the United States to take it from me without first asking my consent? That I would like to know. There are many things that I don't know and can't understand but I want to understand them if I can. I believe the officers of the United States ought to take care of the rights of me and my people first and then afterwards look out for their own interests. I have reason to believe and I do believe that they are more concerned in their own welfare than the welfare of rights of the Indian‚Äîlots of them are. I believe some of them are honest men, but not many. A plan ought fiat to dispossess himself of all thought or wish to do me or my country wrong. He should never think of doing wrong to this country or to the rights of my people. After he has done that, then maybe he can do something for himself in that regard; but first he must protect the Indians and their rights in this country. He is the servant of the Government and he is sent here to, do that and he should not be permitted to do anything else. \\"All that I am begging of you, Honorable Senators, is that these ancient agreements and treaties wherein you promised to take care of me and my people, be fulfilled and that you will remove all the difficulties that have been raised in reference to my people and their country and I ask you to see that these promises are faithfully kept. I understand you are the representatives of the Government sent here to look into these things and I hope you will relieve us. That is all I desire to say.\\" In response to, an interrogatory by the Chairman of the Committee, the old Indian responded, \\"Oh, yes, I am a farmer. I have a farm and a home there on it. I used to have horses and hogs and cattle but I have precious few left now.

Dissidents within the congregation put forward Stephen Kaminski, a Polish nationalist and Franciscan friar, as their priest. The bishop did not agree with this choice (and at that time, parishioners did not have the right to choose). Those who supported Kaminski held title to the building and its land.

Biography Bellow was born in Bucharest, Romania, on August 30, 1935, as Alexandra Bagdasar. Her parents were both physicians. Her mother, Florica Bagdasar (n√©e Ciumetti), was a child psychiatrist. Her father, , was a neurosurgeon. She received her M.S. in mathematics from the University of Bucharest in 1957, where she met and married her first husband, Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea. She accompanied her husband to the United States in 1957 and received her Ph.D. from Yale University in 1959 under the direction of Shizuo Kakutani with thesis Ergodic Theory of Random Series. After receiving her degree, she worked as a research associate at Yale from 1959 until 1961, and as an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1962 to 1964. From 1964 until 1967 she was an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. In 1967 she moved to Northwestern University as a Professor of Mathematics. She was at Northwestern until her retirement in 1996, when she became Professor Emeritus. During her marriage to Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea (1956‚Äì1969), she and her husband wrote a number of papers together, as well as a research monograph on lifting theory. Alexandra's second husband was the writer Saul Bellow, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976, during their marriage (1975‚Äì1985). Alexandra features in Bellow's writings; she is portrayed lovingly in his memoir To Jerusalem and Back (1976), and, his novel The Dean's December (1982), more critically, satirically in his last novel, Ravelstein (2000), which was written many years after their divorce. The decade of the nineties was for Alexandra a period of personal and professional fulfillment, brought about by her marriage in 1989 to the mathematician, Alberto P. Calder√≥n. More details about her personal and professional life can be found in her autobiographical article, and a more recent interview. Mathematical work Some of her early work involved properties and consequences of lifting. Lifting theory, which had started with the pioneering papers of John von Neumann and later Dorothy Maharam, came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s with the work of the Ionescu Tulceas and provided the definitive treatment for the representation theory of linear operators arising in probability, the process of disintegration of measures. Their Ergebnisse monograph from 1969 became a standard reference in this area. By applying a lifting to a stochastic process, the Ionescu Tulceas obtained a ‚Äòseparable‚Äô process; this gives a rapid proof of Joseph Leo Doob's theorem concerning the existence of a separable modification of a stochastic process (also a ‚Äòcanonical‚Äô way of obtaining the separable modification). Furthermore, by applying a lifting to a ‚Äòweakly‚Äô measurable function with values in a weakly compact set of a Banach space, one obtains a strongly measurable function; this gives a one line proof of Phillips's classical theorem (also a ‚Äòcanonical‚Äô way of obtaining the strongly measurable version). We say that a set H of measurable functions satisfies the \\"separation property\\" if any two distinct functions in H belong to distinct equivalence classes. The range of a lifting is always a set of measurable functions with the \\"separation property\\". The following ‚Äòmetrization criterion‚Äô gives some idea why the functions in the range of a lifting are so much better behaved. Let H be a set of measurable functions with the following properties: (I) H is compact (for the topology of pointwise convergence); (II) H is convex; (III) H satisfies the \\"separation property\\". Then H is metrizable. The proof of the existence of a lifting commuting with the left translations of an arbitrary locally compact group, by the Ionescu Tulceas, is highly non-trivial; it makes use of approximation by Lie groups, and martingale-type arguments tailored to the group structure. In the early 1960s she worked with C. Ionescu Tulcea on martingales taking values in a Banach space. In a certain sense, this work launched the study of vector- valued martingales, with the first proof of the ‚Äòstrong‚Äô almost everywhere convergence for martingales taking values in a Banach space with (what later became known as) the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property; this, by the way, opened the doors to a new area of analysis, the \\"geometry of Banach spaces\\". These ideas were later extended by Bellow to the theory of ‚Äòuniform amarts‚Äô, (in the context of Banach spaces, uniform amarts are the natural generalization of martingales, quasi-martingales and possess remarkable stability properties, such as optional sampling), now an important chapter in probability theory. In 1960 Donald Samuel Ornstein constructed an example of a non-singular transformation on the Lebesgue space of the unit interval, which does not admit a \\\\sigma‚Äìfinite invariant measure equivalent to Lebesgue measure, thus solving a long-standing problem in ergodic theory. A few years later, Rafael V. Chac√≥n gave an example of a positive (linear) isometry of L_1 for which the individual ergodic theorem fails in L_1. Her work unifies and extends these two remarkable results. It shows, by methods of Baire category, that the seemingly isolated examples of non-singular transformations first discovered by Ornstein and later by Chac√≥n, were in fact the typical case. Beginning in the early 1980s Bellow began a series of papers that brought about a revival of that area of ergodic theory dealing with limit theorems and the delicate question of pointwise a.e. convergence. This was accomplished by exploiting the interplay with probability and harmonic analysis, in the modern context (the Central limit theorem, transference principles, square functions and other singular integral techniques are now part of the daily arsenal of people working in this area of ergodic theory) and by attracting a number of talented mathematicians who were very active in this area. One of the two problems that she raised at the Oberwolfach meeting on \\"Measure Theory\\" in 1981, was the question of the validity, for f in L_1, of the pointwise ergodic theorem along the ‚Äòsequence of squares‚Äô, and along the ‚Äòsequence of primes‚Äô (A similar question was raised independently, a year later, by Hillel Furstenberg). This problem was solved several years later by Jean Bourgain, for f in L_p, p>1 in the case of the \\"squares\\", and for p > (1+\\\\sqrt{3})/2 in the case of the \\"primes\\" (the argument was pushed through to p>1 by M√°t√© Wierdl; the case of L_1 however has remained open). Bourgain was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994, in part for this work in ergodic theory. It was Ulrich Krengel who first gave, in 1971, an ingenious construction of an increasing sequence of positive integers along which the pointwise ergodic theorem fails in L_1 for every ergodic transformation. The existence of such a \\"bad universal sequence\\" came as a surprise. Bellow showed that every lacunary sequence of integers is in fact a \\"bad universal sequence\\" in L_1. Thus lacunary sequences are ‚Äòcanonical‚Äô examples of \\"bad universal sequences\\". Later she was able to show that from the point of view of the pointwise ergodic theorem, a sequence of positive integers may be \\"good universal\\" in L_p, but \\"bad universal\\" in L_q, for all 1\\\\le q < p. This was rather surprising and answered a question raised by Roger Jones. A place in this area of research is occupied by the \\"strong sweeping out property\\" (that a sequence of linear operators may exhibit). This describes the situation when almost everywhere convergence breaks down even in L_{\\\\infty} and in the worst possible way. Instances of this appear in several of her papers. The \\"strong sweeping out property\\" plays a important role in this area of research. Bellow and her collaborators did an extensive and systematic study of this notion, giving various criteria and numerous examples of the strong sweeping out property. Working with Krengel, she was able to give a negative answer to a long-standing conjecture of Eberhard Hopf. Later, Bellow and Krengel working with Calder√≥n were able to show that in fact the Hopf operators have the \\"strong sweeping out\\" property. In the study of aperiodic flows, sampling at nearly periodic times, as for example, t_n= n+\\\\varepsilon (n), where \\\\varepsilon is positive and tends to zero, does not lead to a.e. convergence; in fact strong sweeping out occurs. This shows the possibility of serious errors when using the ergodic theorem for the study of physical systems. Such results can be of practical value for statisticians and other scientists. In the study of discrete ergodic systems, which can be observed only over certain blocks of time, one has the following dichotomy of behavior of the corresponding averages: either the averages converge a.e. for all functions in L_1, or the strong sweeping out property holds. This depends on the geometric properties of the blocks. Several mathematicians (including Bourgain) worked on problems posed by Bellow and answered those questions in their papers.

He wrote The Pilgrim's Progress, arguably the most famous published Christian allegory. In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 30 August. In 1672, the congregation led by Bunyan purchased a barn which they used to conduct worship. Eventually, a church, which came to be called the Bunyan Meeting Free Church, was built on the site of the barn. In 1849, a second church was built which is still used for services. A separate museum building was constructed in the compound in 1998 and the Bunyan artefacts and memorabilia formerly housed in a small museum room in the church were moved into it.Bunyan Meeting The museum's displays recreate a number of scenes from Bunyan's life which also show some of Bedford's social history in the seventeenth century.

This is an effect of intravascular hemolysis, in which hemoglobin separates from red blood cells, a form of anemia. Hemoglobinemia can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic factors. When hemoglobinemia is internally caused, it is a result of recessive genetic defects that cause the red blood cells to lyse, letting the hemoglobin spill out of the cell into the blood plasma. In intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobin is released and binds with haptoglobin. This causes haptoglobin levels to decrease. Once haptoglobin is saturated, free hemoglobin readily distributes to tissues where it might be exposed to oxidative conditions. In such conditions, heme can be released from ferric hemoglobin. The free heme can then accelerate tissue damage by promoting peroxidative reactions and activation of inflammatory cascades. Hemopexin (Hx) is another plasma glycoprotein able to bind heme with high affinity. Hx sequesters heme in an inert, non-toxic form and transports it to the liver for catabolism and excretion. As long as both haptoglobin and hemopexin are saturated, the remaining free hemoglobins are filtered in the kidney and some of them will be reabsorbed by way of proximal tubules. In externally caused hemoglobinemia, an outside attacker acts as an antibody against the red blood cells. This can cause the cells to be destroyed and their hemoglobin released. In extravascular hemolysis, red blood cells are phagocytized by macrophages in the spleen and liver. Abnormal value of hemoglobin does not necessarily indicate a medical problem needing treatment. Diet, activity level, medications, a women's menstrual cycle, and other considerations can affect the results. Additionally to these, one may have higher than normal hemoglobin if he/she lives in a high altitude area.  Causes  There are other causes besides what happens within the body in the blood cells. Other factors that can cause an excess amount of hemoglobin are: * Smoking (which may result in low blood oxygen levels) * Higher altitudes where your red blood cell production naturally increases to compensate for the lower oxygen supply there Specific disorders or other factors that may cause a high hemoglobin count include: *Lung disease *Heart disease * COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) * Dehydration * Emphysema * Heart failure * Kidney cancer * Liver cancer * Other types of heart disease * Other types of lung disease * Polycythemia vera, a disorder in which your body makes too many red blood cells. It can cause headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Diagnosis = Normal hemoglobin levels = Normal hemoglobin levels correlate with the person's age and sex. Levels can vary between different testing systems and under their doctor's consultation. A hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in your blood. If a hemoglobin tests shows that a person's levels are below normal, it means they have a low red blood cell count, which is known as anemia. If the test shows higher levels than normal, it means they have hemoglobinemia. The normal range for hemoglobin is: * For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 13.5 and 18 g/dl are the lower and upper limits of the accepatable range. * For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter 12 and 16 g/dl are the lower and upper limits of the accepatable range. Symptoms of anemia  Treatment  High hemoglobin levels are a rare occurrence but is usually treated as a symptom for an underling disease. Consulting a doctor is the best treatment, so he/she can diagnose your illness and give a recommended treatment plan to lower hemoglobin levels back to normal.

From 1998 to 2000, he sat by assignment in trial and appellate courts as a senior judge. Judge Holcomb was elected to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000 as a Republican. His term on the Court of Criminal Appeals began in 2001. Holcomb, then seventy-one, was required by law not to serve as an active judge after he turned seventy-five in September 2008.Burnt Orange Report - Robert Francis for Court of Criminal Appeals He faced two challengers for re-election in the Republican primary election in 2006, Judge Robert Francis of Dallas, and then State Representative Terry Keel of Austin.Dallas Morning News  News for Dallas, Texas  Texas Southwest Keel challenged both Holcomb and Francis for technical flaws in their applications to be on the ballot. Holcomb's candidacy was affirmed by the Texas Supreme Court and he won re-nomination and reelection. After his re-election, the Texas Constitution was amended to allow judges who turn seventy-five during their term to serve-out a four-year term, meaning Holcomb could serve four years of his six-year term. Holcomb retired from the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2010 and decided to run for the Senate election in 2012, but the nomination instead went to Ted Cruz, who won the party runoff election against David Dewhurst.

The Institute was founded in 1968 to assist the international community in formulating and implementing improved policies in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice. History In 1965, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined in Resolution 1086 B (XXXIX) the organisational arrangements for a United Nations Social Defence Programme. In 1967, UN Secretary-General U Thant issued Bulletin ST/SGB/134, which established the United Nations Social Defence Research Institute (UNSDRI), mandated to develop \\"new knowledge and the application thereof in advancing policy and practice in the prevention and control of both juvenile delinquency and adult criminality\\" through research and technical support. The United Nations and the Italian Government signed an agreement in 1968 for the establishment of UNSDRI's Headquarters in Rome and the Institute was formally inaugurated the following year by the UN Secretary-General. Under ECOSOC Resolution No. 1989/56, the Institute was renamed the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) in 1989. Its mandate was enlarged through the adoption of its present statute.http://www.unicri.it/institute/structure/mission_statute/ UNICRI moved its headquarters from Rome to Turin in 2000. Aims and functions The Institute carries out action-oriented research, training and technical cooperation programmes, with the aim of assisting governments and the international community at large in tackling the threats that crime poses to social peace, development and political stability and in fostering the development of just and efficient justice systems. UNICRI supports the formulation and implementation of improved policies in the field of crime prevention and justice, the promotion of national self-reliance and the development of institutional capabilities. The Institute works to advance the understanding of crime-related problems, supporting the respect for international instruments and standards; it facilitates the exchange and dissemination of information, cooperation in international law enforcement and judicial assistance. UNICRI structures its activities to meet the identified needs of member states. Its programme activities arise from priorities identified by the UN Annual Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Commission. The Institute current priorities include, inter alia, activities related to organised crime; judicial reform; juvenile justice; counter-terrorism; major event security; international criminal law; the crime, justice and security perspectives to new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics; corruption; human trafficking; victim protection; counterfeiting; cybercrime; crimes against the environment; and drug abuse. The Institute is committed to close international and cross-regional cooperation andencourages the sharing of information and experiences at all levels. Location UNICRI has its headquarters on the United Nations Campus in Turin, Italy. It also has a Liaison Office in Rome, Geneva and offices around the world, as well as the specialized Centre for AI and Robotics in The Hague. Activities UNICRI's Applied Research Programme is organised into three main areas: * Emerging Crimes * Security Governance and Counter Terrorism * Training and Advanced Education =Emerging Crimes= The Emerging Crimes Unit is actively involved in efforts to reduce the impact of emerging crimes such as trafficking in human beings; corruption; crimes against the environment; counterfeiting and cybercrimes. The Emerging Crimes Unit also acts to protect those at most risk of being victimised, including women and underage victims of trafficking; youth at risk or in conflict with the law; and the victims of counterfeiting - both consumers and legitimate producers. =Security Governance and Counter- Terrorism= Projects in this area focus on terrorism prevention; security during major events; protection of vulnerable targets; prevention of radicalization; and prevention of illicit trafficking of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials. Activities are specifically designed to offer Member States a comprehensive range of effective strategies to prevent acts of terrorism and to enhance institutional capacity through effective security governance whilst upholding the rule of law and respect for human rights. Operating from a flexible and responsive cooperation platform, the Institute offers advisory services, strategic assistance and action-oriented analysis across a wide spectrum of security topics. UNICRI cooperates with other entities of the United Nations and many other international and regional organizations to deliver coordinated response packages. UNICRI is a member of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, which seeks to strengthen a common action approach to coordination and coherence in the counter-terrorism and prevention of violent extremism work of the United Nations system, and to strengthen support to Member States, at their request, in the implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and other relevant United Nations resolutions and mandates. Within this framework, the Institute co-chairs a working group on emerging threats and critical infrastructure protection. =Training and Advanced Education= As part of its commitment to sharing knowledge between nations around the world, UNICRI provides many training programmes and educational courses on issues relating to crime prevention and criminal justice. It maintains partnerships with many universities and educational institutes to assist in running its courses. Courses offered include: * Master of Laws in International Crime and Justice (LL.M.) * International Summer School on Migration - Challenges and Opportunities for Europe A special focus is given to education and training in developing countries, with support given to academic and para-academic institutions to assist them in the development of activities and initiatives designed to benefit the public at large. UNICRI also provides tailor-made, specialised training programmes for judicial personnel at the request of Member States. =UNICRI Documentation Centre= The centre is a major resource of crime-prevention related material and is available to researchers worldwide for use in the development and implementation of technical interventions and research. It also supports training activities and organises initiatives targeting the general public. The activities of the centre include the collection, analysis and dissemination of legislative, statistical and bibliographic documents in the library. The library holds more than 18,000 monographs; 1,250 journals and yearbooks; tens of thousands of documents produced by the United Nations System and other organisations; multimedia material; and grey literature on crime prevention and criminal justice issues. The centre offers on-line access to all its services, such as the library catalogue, the Criminological Thesaurus, bibliographic databases, directories, full-text articles, and abstracts of monographs. =Rome Liaison Office= UNICRI‚Äôs Liaison Office in Rome liaises with the host country, the Diplomatic Corps, governmental and non governmental organisations, academic, media and civil society to promote UN goals and objectives. The Office supports the Regional United Nations Information Centre for Europe and provides support to the Secretary General and other senior United Nations officials during official visits to Italy. The Office maintains its own website (www.onuitalia.it), which publishes news related to the UN System in Italian. Funding UNICRI is entirely financed from voluntary contributions and does not receive any funding from the regular budget of the United Nations. UNICRI implements its programmes with the generous support of a number of Member States and other donors, including international and regional organizations charities and foundations. Official partners UNICRI cooperates with a number of official partners including national government agencies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations and universities.

A native of France, she was acquitted for the murder of her husband that many believed she had committed. After her trial, she studied law and became the first female lawyer admitted to the bar in the Washington Territory and in the state of Oregon.

Marie immigrated about 1870 to the United States and became Mary Gisan. Some stories say she moved in order to provide income for her poor family, others recount that she was attempting to make it on her own. She moved to Portland, Oregon, by the 1870 census and was likely working as a maid for the R. R. Riley family.Abrams, Kerry. Folk Hero, Hell Raiser, Mad Woman, Lady Lawyer: What is the Truth about Mary Leonard? Women's Legal History Biography Project. Stanford Law School. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. In 1873, her younger sister Rosa immigrated to America and moved to Portland in 1874. Mary would then begin working as a seamstress until she married Daniel Leonard in late May 1875. Marriage, divorce, murder Daniel Leonard owned a hotel and ferry in the Columbia River Gorge along the Oregon Trail. The hotel was east of Wasco, Oregon, at the point where the Oregon Trail crossed the John Day River. Daniel was 57, but he claimed 50 at the time of marriage while Mary claimed to be 30 when they were married at the St. Charles Hotel in Portland with the Reverend John Gantenbein presiding on May 18, 1875. In the Fall of 1877, Daniel filed for divorce, claiming Mary was having an affair with one of the boarders at the hotel, Nathaniel Lindsay. In December 1877, the divorce went to trial. Daniel was represented by Colonel Nathaniel H. Gates who was also the mayor of The Dalles, Oregon. In the divorce, Mary claimed Daniel physically abused her, that she worked all the time at the hotel until she became ill, and that Daniel had promised her lots of money after they were married. Daniel said Mary was the abuser, denied him sexual relations, that she stole money and the deeds to his property, and the affair with Lindsay among other charges. At the end of the month, the court ordered Daniel to provide for Mary's maintenance, but he refused. In late December Mary wrote a scathing letter to Daniel warning him to follow the court's instructions to provide maintenance and threatened to get even with him. On January 4, 1878, Daniel Leonard was shot in the head with a small- caliber gun, but there were no witnesses. Daniel lived until January 16, 1878, but did not identify who shot him, though his lawyer N. H. Gates blamed Mary. Meanwhile, Mary was arrested on assault and attempted murder charges for the shooting on January 5. Mary remained in jail, but was taken out for walks accompanied by the sheriff. On June 26, 1878, Mary and Lindsay were indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Daniel Leonard. Lindsay was charged with counseling, inciting, and abetting murder, and spent 11 months in jail. In July, the trial was postponed on request of district attorney L. B. Ison. While the trial was pending, women's right activist Abigail Scott Duniway used her newspaper, The New Northwest, to support Mary's defense. On November 18, 1878, Mary Leonard went to trial represented by William Lair Hill. He was able to get separate trials for Mary and Lindsay, and after a three-day trial won an acquittal for Mary on November 20. With the acquittal, the state dropped the charges against Lindsay. At the time, many believed that she was in fact guilty of killing Daniel, but as he was disliked, people felt sympathy for her. Later that year Mary collected Daniel's estate as the sole heir and moved to Portland where she went into business as the owner of boardinghouses. Lawyer Some records indicate Leonard began studying law in Portland in the early 1880s. In 1883, Washington Territory passed a law to establish women's suffrage. Leonard moved that year to Seattle where she began reading law under the guidance of J. C. Haines at the offices of Struve, Haines, and McMicken. In October 1884, she passed the bar and was then admitted to practice in the Washington courts on March 11, 1885. Leonard thus became the first woman lawyer in the history of Washington, though she returned to Portland before practicing law in that then territory.Pacific States Bar Association 7/18/97. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. On March 18 the Oregon Supreme Court refused to admit her to Oregon's bar, though the court previously admitted lawyers who had passed the bars of other states. The court ruled in its decision that Oregon's law only allowed for men to be admitted to the bar, and that the legislature needed to change the law. On March 27, federal judge Matthew Deady of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon admitted Leonard to the federal bar in Oregon. In November, the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a law supported by Leonard and sponsored by J. M. Siglin that altered existing law to allow for women to be admitted to the bar. Governor Zenas Ferry Moody signed the bill into law on November 20. On April 13, 1886, the Oregon Supreme Court admitted her to the state bar as Oregon's first female lawyer, though they attempted to keep her out via a one-year residency requirement. She successfully argued that the requirement had never been enforced, and the court relented. Later years Mary Leonard then developed a law practice in Portland with a reputation for poor writing but good courtroom skills. She worked mainly with clients that were charged in the police courts and demanded others to call her Judge Mary A. Leonard. She was not very successful financially as an attorney and opened a boardinghouse to supplement her legal income. She also developed a reputation for fighting and for drinking with male attorneys. In 1897, she was arrested for threatening to kill the landlord of her boardinghouse. After a trial described as a circus, she was acquitted of the charges, but did admit on the witness stand that she carried a small gun and a hammer. The next year, she became involved in a lawsuit as counsel for Annie Branson. During the ongoing case, Leonard was arrested for assault, suborning perjury, and embezzlement. She was convicted for the embezzlement of $1.40 relating to refusing to pay a witness in the Branson case, but did not pay the $18 fine and was sent to jail. She was released after a short time on a writ of habeas corpus drawn up by other attorneys, as the minimum fine for the charge was $25. Leonard continued to practice law in Portland until June 1912. However, her reputation as an attorney declined. Mary Leonard died at the Multnomah County Hospital on October 24, 1912, of heart disease. Her remains were donated to the University of Oregon Medical School (now part of Oregon Health & Science University), but records of where the body was buried were destroyed in a fire.

The film follows four wealthy, high-powered women living in Beijing during the Chinese New Year. The film had its North American premiere on September 10, 2005 at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Perpetual Motion was co- written by Ning, musician and author Liu Sola, and publisher Hung Huang (Hung and Liu also star) and was produced by Beijing Happy Village, Ltd. The film opened in Chinese cities in late February 2006 to some controversy due to its depiction of assertive, sexually confident women. The version shown was slightly edited compared to the versions shown abroad in Toronto and Venice, with some of the more explicit discussions on sex as well as a scene involving the four main characters listening to an old revolutionary song in high heels and makeup being edited or cut. Given its content, Perpetual Motion is often referred to as a Chinese version of the American television series Sex and the City.  Plot  Niuniu, a wealthy middle aged woman living in Beijing, discovers that her husband is having an affair after coming upon a romantic e-mail. She knows only that it is one of her close friends but not which one. Determined to discover the truth, she invites her friends Qinqin, a ditsy actress, Lala, a successful artist, and Madam Ye, a property developer over to her lavish siheyuan home. There the four women share stories of their sexual past over food and mahjong. Niuniu, however, still has her plan to execute...  Cast  *Hung Huang as Niuniu; Hung Huang, a publisher in reality, plays the main character, a high powered woman in Beijing who invites her three friends to dinner on Lunar New Year's Eve for the purpose of discovering which of her friends is having an affair with her husband. *Li Qinqin as Qinqin, an actress; Li Qinqin unlike the other three \\"actresses\\" is a professional performer. *Liu Sola as Lala, a successful artist; author and musician Liu Sola also served as the film's music composer and shared co-screenwriter's credit. *Ping Yanni as Madam Ye, a property developer; Ping Yanni is an actual businesswoman working in Beijing. *Zhang Hanzi as Niuniu's maid and cook; Zhang Hanzi, actually Hung Huang's mother, served as one of the English translators for Mao Zedong in her younger days.  Reception  Though the film's concept of four middle-aged wealthy Chinese women engaging in frank discussions of sex raised eyebrows, the execution of that concept was ultimately found lacking by many western critics. Derek Elley of Variety, for example, suggested that the film's \\"script remains unfocused,\\" and that its uneven performances (from non-professionals) consigned the film to the festival circuit.

Pasha is a common attribute of Ganesha, the Lord of obstacles; a pasha represents his power to bind and free obstacles. Yama, the god of death, uses the Pasha to extract a soul from a being's body at the time of death. In sculpture, it is depicted as two or three bound into one or a double loop. The Sanskrit word \\"pasha\\" originally meant \\"knot\\" or \\"loop\\". In general usage, the pasha is used to bind a foe's arms and legs or for hunting animals. Pasha represents worldly attachment as well as power of a deity to capture and bind evil and ignorance. Ananda Coomaraswamy explores the connection of pasha to worldly bonds. In the Shaiva Siddhanta school of Hinduism, pasha is part of the trinity Pati-pashu-pasha, meaning \\"Master, animal, tether\\", symbolizing God, man and world.

Barth, a leading 20th-century theologian, was a Reformed Protestant. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the Mother of God. Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God. Background =Theology of Karl Barth= Karl Barth (May 10, 1886 - December 10, 1968) a Swiss Reformed theologian, was one of the most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century. Beginning with his experience as a pastor, he rejected the predominant liberal theology typical of 19th-century Protestantism, especially German, and instead embarked on a unique theological path, often labelled neo-orthodoxy by critics (a label emphatically rejected by Barth himself), that emphasized the sovereignty of God particularly through his innovative doctrine of election. Barth's theology swept through Europe and Britain. Barth was originally trained in German Protestant Liberalism under such teachers as Wilhelm Herrmann, but reacted against this theology at the time of the First World War. His reaction was fed by several factors, including his commitment to the German and Swiss Religious Socialist movement surrounding men like Hermann Kutter, the influence of the Biblical Realism movement surrounding men like Christoph Blumhardt and S√∏ren Kierkegaard, and the impact of the skeptical philosophy of Franz Overbeck. =Epistle to the Romans= In his commentary The Epistle to the Romans (Ger. Der R√∂merbrief; particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922) Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the cross of Jesus challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions. Many theologians believe this work to be the most important theological treatise since Friedrich Schleiermacher's On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers. In the decade following the First World War, Barth was linked with a number of other theologians, actually very diverse in outlook, who had reacted against their teachers' liberalism, in a movement known as dialectical theology.(Ger. Dialektische Theologie). Other members of the movement included Rudolf Bultmann, Eduard Thurneysen, Emil Brunner, and Friedrich Gogarten. Marian views =The nativity mystery= * The nativity mystery ‚Äúconceived from the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary‚Äù, means, that God became human, truly human out of his own grace. The miracle of the existence of Jesus , his ‚Äúclimbing down of God‚Äù is: Holy Spirit and Virgin Mary! Here is a human being, the Virgin Mary, and as he comes from God, Jesus comes also from this human being. Born of the Virgin Mary means a human origin for God. Jesus Christ is not only truly God, he is human like every one of us. He is human without limitation. He is not only similar to us, he is like us.Barth, Dogmatik im Grundriss, 1947, 125,127 This means to Barth, God's presence in our world, His presence as man among men and therefore God's revelation to humanity. It also means humanity's reconciliation with God. To Barth, this happened and still happens, it is the substance of the Christmas message. This God is conceived where we all are conceived. He is born of Mary. She who conceived and bore Him, plays our part in the wonder of Christmas, for it concerns us. God has come to us. \\"Disguised in our flesh and blood, is the Eternal God.\\" = Virgin Birth = The Nicene Creed says: Et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est (\\"and he [God the Son] became body from the Virgin Mary and was made man\\"). In Barth's theology ‚Äì in contrast to much of the contemporary liberal theology ‚Äì this statement is interpreted to mean the dogma of the Virgin Birth. It means that Jesus as a human does not have a father, in the same way that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2, 219 Mary is \\"full of grace\\" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. This is quite similar to Catholic teaching, in which Mary, \\"by sheer grace,\\" received the fullness of grace from God at the moment of her conception, that she might give her consent at the annunciation.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 722 Barth argues that the Church adopted its doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary not because of Mary, but in defence of its Christology. = Mother of God = Karl Barth states that as a Christian and theologian, he does not reject the description of Mary as the \\"Mother of God.\\" To him, this is a legitimate expression of Christological truth. The description of Mary as the \\"Mother of God\\" was and is sensible, permissible and necessary as an auxiliary Christological proposition.Church Dogmatics, I, 2, Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1963, 138) =Critique of the Catholic view = Barth on the other hand sees the term \\"Mother of God,\\" as \\"being overloaded by the so-called Mariology of the Roman Catholic Church\\".Church Dogmatics, 138 He considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and heresy. * Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist.Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 154 * Mariology is an excrescence, i.e., a diseased construct of theological thought. Excrescences must be excised. Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 153 He warns however, of extending this critique too far: And, Barth equally attacks Protestant theology on this issue: \\"For justice sake, one has to say, that the Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic mariology and Marian cult is dishonest, as long as Protestantism is caught in the same unreal problem\\".Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic, I,2,160 He was a close friend of Hans Urs von Balthasar, who published about him. Barth‚Äôs dogmatic theology was partly based on Thomas Aquinas, although he departed from Aquinas on many characteristically Catholic points.

Although intended as one of several publications which flooded the country with official works approved by the Soviet authorities, from the very beginning the idea of the editors was to turn it unobtrusively into a journal for anti-Soviet literature. The name of the journal may have been a play on the famous Soviet journal Ogonek (the little flame). History and profile Fakel was launched in 1981. The Bulgarian poet Georgi Borissov was first appointed as its vice editor-in-chief before becoming editor-in-chief in 1990. He is the founder and director of the publishing houses Fakel (1991‚Äì1995) and Fakel Express (1995). He has been the editor-in-chief of the magazine since 1990. Poet and translator Rumen Leonidov is another co-founder of Fakel magazine. The journal became quite unexpectedly very popular for it started publishing authors such as Bulgakov, Zamyatin, Platonov, Nabokov, Pasternak, Grossman, Varlam Shalamov, Venedikt Erofeev, Vladimir Voinovich, as well as poems and essays by Khlebnikov, Osip Mandelstam, Marina Tsvetaeva, Akhmatova, Joseph Brodsky, and Vladimir Vysotsky. With the fall of communism in Bulgaria Fakel, due to its previous notoriety, served as a natural intellectual catalyst in what is widely described as the \\"transition period\\" in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The journal published along the works of Andrei Platonov, Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, Daniil Kharms, Yuz Aleshkovsky, Tatyana Tolstaya, Dmitri Prigov, Eduard Uspensky, Eduard Limonov, Alexander Genis, Vladimir Bukovsky etc., works by authors such as Marquis de Custine, G.

However, with the installation a piped supply of water to the village and district the use of the pump was discontinued. The tank on top of the house provided the main supply of water for this very large house. The Farmyard tank supplied the water for the 200 head of milking cows and fattening bullocks on the farm, and also for the large herd of pigs that were also kept at Home Farm.

It is assigned to the 23d Fighter Group, Air Combat Command and stationed at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The squadron is equipped with the Fairchild Republic A-10C Thunderbolt II attack fighter. During World War II, the 75th Fighter Squadron was one of the three original squadrons (74th, 75th, 76th) of the 23rd Fighter Group. On 17 December 1941, the AVG 2nd Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 23rd Pursuit Group 75th Pursuit Squadron and subsequently the 75th Fighter Squadron. History =World War II= P-40 fighters of the Flying Tigers The 75th Fighter Squadron's first assignment as an active unit was in the China-Burma-India theatre. Some members of the famous American Volunteer Group known as the \\"Flying Tigers\\" joined the 75th Fighter Squadron after the AVG was disbanded. This group of men, under the leadership of General Claire Lee Chennault, engaged in aerial combat against the Japanese very soon after 7 December 1941. On the same day as its activation, the 75th scored its first major victory during a night interception flight against Japanese bombers. This was the first night interception ever attempted over the China theatre and gave the Japanese quite a shock. The intercepting pilots were credited with the destruction of two enemy bombers and two probables. During the early days of its history, the 75th's mission was to attack and destroy the enemy by strafing airfields, troops, and supply depots, while maintaining air superiority so that the Japanese could not locate and bomb targets in China. Operating from numerous airfields within China, the 75th Fighter Squadron compiled an impressive record during World War II and received the Presidential Unit Citation. After World War II, the squadron returned to the United States and was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. There the squadron was inactivated on 5 January 1946. =Air Defense Command= 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron North American F-86A Sabre 49-1280 with a Navy Grumman F9F-6 Cougar over Long Island, 1952 Following a period of activations and inactivations, during which the squadron was assigned to such bases as Northwest Field, Guam, and Howard Air Force Base, Canal Zone, the squadron returned to active duty on 12 January 1951 as the 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. During this period, the 75th served under the Air Defense Command and flew the F-86 Sabre day interceptors with a mission to maintain a high degree of operational proficiency so that it might repel any possible enemy air attack. It upgraded to the F-86D Sabre Interceptor in 1953 at Suffolk County Air Force Base, New York, where the squadron remained for three years before moving to Dow Air Force Base, Maine. Upon return to Maine in 1959 the squadron converted to the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo supersonic interceptor and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable. On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed one third of its force, equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Niagara Falls International Airport at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis.McMullen, pp. 10-12NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, p. 16 These planes returned to Dow after the crisis. The squadron remained at Dow Air Force Base until 1968 when it was transferred to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan. The squadron inactivated there on 30 November 1969 as part of the drawdown of ADC interceptor bases, the aircraft being passed along to the Air National Guard. =Tactical Air Command= Ling-Temco-Vought A-7D Corsair II 71-0338 of the 75th Tactical Fighter Squadron in May 1973 On 18 May 1972, the squadron was redesignated the 75th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and on 1 July 1972 was activated at England Air Force Base, Louisiana. There the squadron began flying the A-7D Corsair II ground attack aircraft. It took part in a variety of operational exercises both in the United States and overseas, including tactical bombing competitions against the Royal Air Force at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, during October 1977 and July 1978. It flew the A-7D until 1981 when conversion to the A-10 Thunderbolt II was completed. It became an A-10 training unit and remained at England AFB supporting the deployments of the 74th and 76th TFS. On 2 December 1991, the 75th Fighter Squadron was inactivated as part of the conversion to the Objective Wing and drawdown of the Air Force after the end of the Cold War. =Modern era= On 3 April 1992, the squadron was again activated, as the 75th Fighter Squadron located at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. Received A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft transferred from the 353d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina prior to the 353d's inactivation and the base's closure in January 1993. The first operational deployment of a composite wing happened in October 1994, when Iraqi troops began massing near the Kuwaiti Border. Within 72 hours, the 75th Fighter Squadron redeployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, becoming the first U.S. fixed-wing aircraft to be stationed in that country since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. The squadron moved to Moody AFB, Georgia in 2007 due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) panel recommendations. At the same time the unit received their newly upgraded A-10C fighters, which allow for greater employment guided munitions. On 19 December 2007, the last three of the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft left for Moody AFB and assumed its current mission. 2013 Sequestration Air Combat Command officials announced a stand down and reallocation of flying hours for the rest of the fiscal year 2013 due to mandatory budget cuts. The across-the board spending cuts, called sequestration, took effect 1 March when Congress failed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan. Squadrons either stood down on a rotating basis or kept combat ready or at a reduced readiness level called \\"basic mission capable\\" for part or all of the remaining months in fiscal 2013. This affected the 75th Fighter Squadron with a reduction of its flying hours, placing it into a basic mission capable status from 5 April-30 July 2013. =War on Terror= The 75th Fighter Squadron has deployed several times in the battle against global terrorism.

He also won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for his production design on the HBO documentary The Number on Great-Grandpa's Arm. Juried Animation Winners Announced For 70th Emmy Awards-Cartoon Brew Emmys Film Methodology As an underground filmmaker, Scher uses lights, abstractions and visual effects all paired with music to create experimental short films. His films have been described as animated still life as they are made from various drawings in which the images change to trigger responses within the human mind. He uses his paintings and collages by overlapping the colors and textures to seem as if they are in fact ‚Äúmoving‚Äù in a hypnotic fashion. Images of influential behaviorists, Hermann Rorschach and Ivan Pavlov, appear in some of his films. The films are highly irrational in their juxtapositions, but this is the intention of the filmmaker. Scher wants his viewers to create their own stories from the visuals he provides. Films such as All the Wrong Reasons seek to create of feeling of dreaming. One should have a sense of dreaming while awake and a connection to the subconscious mind. Scher‚Äôs abstract films are all approximately two and a half minutes long. He feels that this amount of time is more than enough to allow the viewer to become engaged. Although digital tools are cheaper and faster for creating film, Scher prefers vintage machinery and technologies to create his image-rich films to effectively affect the senses. He uses the rotoscopic technique which involves projecting film frames on to paper and then tracing them by hand. After this, the paper images are animated by separately shooting each sheet as a single frame.

Self- starvation was common among religious women, as a way to imitate the suffering of Jesus in his torments during the Passion, as women were largely restricted to causing themselves voluntary pain by fasting, whereas holy men experienced suffering through physical punishment, voluntary poverty, and celibacy.  Overview  = Etymology = Anorexia mirabilis comes from the latin meaning \\"miraculously inspired loss of appetite\\", whereas inedia prodigiosa means \\"great starvation\\". = Description = Anorexia mirabilis is primarily characterized by the refusal to eat, resulting in starvation, malnutrition, and oftentimes, death, but differs from anorexia nervosa in that the disease is associated with religion as opposed to personal aesthetics, although this behavior was usually not approved by religious authorities as a holy one. Though anorexia mirabilis is, by definition, connected to religion, particularly Catholicism, sufferers have been known to defy the orders of their religious superior to cease fasting and their refusal to eat sometimes preceded their involvement in religious activities. Additionally, sufferers engaged in worrisome and bizarre behaviors designed to cause them pain, so that they might be reminded of Jesus Christ's suffering, and desired to appear unattractive in hopes of avoiding marriage and sexual contact. The self- starvation practice of anorexia mirabilis was a behavior only adopted by women, particularly in the Middle Age, as a way to imitate the suffering of Jesus in his torments during the Passion, as women preferred to experience this voluntary pain by fasting, whereas holy men experienced suffering through physical punishment. For this reason, they were often colloquially called \\"fasting girls\\", as there were no \\"fasting boys\\". This colloquial naming became the most common one in the Victorian era, with anorexia mirabilis being the term used only in medical circles. Documentation exists regarding about two thirds of the holy women officially regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as saints, blesseds, venerables, or servants of God and who lived after 1200 AD showing that more than half of these displayed clear signs of anorexia, with extensive and highly reliable documentation being available for about two dozen of these. = History = The earliest reported sufferer of anorexia mirabilis is St. Wilgefortis, a legendary princess who reportedly lived sometime between the 8th century and 10th century in Galicia, who starved herself and took a vow of chastity to avoid an arranged marriage. She asked for God to make her ugly and she subsequently grew excessive facial and body hair, which is a common symptom of malnutrition in women. Her suitor rejected her based on her appearance and so, as punishment for sabotaging the union, her father, the king of Portugal, had her crucified. For her suffering, she was venerated in the Catholic Church. Though the disease was most prominent during the Middle Ages, modern cases do exist. Notably, in 2014, medical researchers published an article about the case of an unidentified woman in her sixties, born in Chicago, Illinois, who'd suffered from anorexia mirabilis. The woman entered a convent at the age of 13 and began to restrict her eating in hopes of achieving sainthood. = Notable cases = *Marie of Oignies (1177‚Äì1213) went to great lengths to cause herself physical pain, wanting to suffer as Jesus Christ had. She deprived herself of sleep and, when she did eat, which was very little, she favored bread so stale that it would cause her gums to bleed. She additionally made the choices to live in poverty despite being from a wealthy family and abstain from sex despite being married. Like other sufferers of anorexia mirabilis, she eventually refused to eat any food other than the consecrated Hosts and died at the age of 36.Spearing, Elizabeth. Medieval writings on female spirituality. New York: Penguin Books, 2002. pg 105 *Wilgefortis of Portugal was a legendary Portuguese infanta who took a vow of virginity and began to starve herself to avoid marriage. She reportedly prayed to be made ugly, which resulted in her growing hair all over her body, which people likely assumed to be a work of God but is actually a common symptom in those with anorexia nervosa. She was ultimately crucified and later venerated as a saint within the Catholic church. *Catherine of Siena (1347‚Äì1380) was known to fast for long periods of time and, towards the end of her life, when her disease was at its worst, the only food she consumed was a single consecrated Host given to her as part of the daily Eucharist. She defied orders from her religious superiors to eat, claiming she was too ill to do so, and in the month before she died, at the age of 33, she lost the use of her legs and her ability to swallow. In addition to restricting her food intake, Catherine was known to use insert sticks into her throat in order to activate her gag reflex and induce vomiting, as someone with bulimia nervosa would do, and was known to drink the pus from the ulcers of the poor. *Columba of Rieti (1467‚Äì1501) bears a number of similarities to that of Catherine of Siena, including the cutting of her hair to avoid an arranged marriage and the refusal to eat prior to her involvement in religious work. Also like Catherine, towards the end of her life, Columba restricted her food consumption to only what was given to her as part of the daily Eucharist and died at the age of 34. Additionally, she wore a hairshirt and slept on thorns. *Therese Neumann (1923-1962) professed to have consumed no food other than The Holy Eucharist her whole life, nor to have drunk any water from 1926 until her death, despite her \\"stocky build\\".Vogl, p. 17Wilson, Ian. (1988). The Bleeding Mind: An Investigation into the Mysterious Phenomena of Stigmata. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. pp. 114-115. *Jane (born c. 1948) was a woman from Chicago who began to restrict her eating at the age of 13 in hopes of being a nun and later, a saint. Her weight worried those at the convent and she was dismissed from her religious training due to concerns over her health. Her malnutrition caused amenorrhea and likely affected her development as she grew to be only 4' 10\\" tall but did not suffer from any form of dwarfism. At the age of 66, she weighed only 60 pounds.  Comparing anorexia mirabilis and \\"anorexia nervosa\\"  Anorexia mirabilis has in many ways, both similarities to and clear distinctions from the more modern, well-known \\"anorexia nervosa\\". In anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. In contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong virginity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted penitential practices. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as \\"miraculous maids\\". The anorexia nervosa of the 20th century has historical correlates in the religiously inspired cases of anorexia mirabilis in female saints, such as Catherine of Siena (1347‚Äì1380) in whom fasting denoted female holiness or humility and underscored purity. The investigation of anorexia nervosa in the 20th century has focused on the psychological, physiological, and various other factors. For Caroline Walker Bynum (Holy Feast and Holy Fast), anorexia mirabilis, rather than misdiagnosed anorexia, was a legitimate form of self-expression with motives set in contrast to the modern disease paradigm. She considers cases such as that of Julian of Norwich and other Christian anchorites, as using fasting as a legitimate means for communing with Christ. Joan Jacobs Brumberg (Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa) suggests that anorexia mirabilis no longer exists not because the motives of those who starve themselves have changed, but because the paradigms for coding these behaviors have shifted. If a young woman were to make the decision to self-starve as a means to communicate with Christ, healthcare professionals would code her as anorexia nervosa regardless of her motives. Whether or not there is historical continuity between anorexia mirabilis and anorexia nervosa is a subject of debate with both medieval historiographers and the psychiatric community. Some have argued that there is historical continuity between the two conditions, while others maintain that anorexia mirabilis should be comprehended as a distinct medieval form of female religious piety within the historical context of such societies.  Historical instances  Anorexia mirabilis was frequently accompanied by behaviors most medical professionals today would find worrisome and dangerous. Angela of Foligno was known to eat the scabs of the poor and Catherine of Siena was known to drain the pus from sick individuals into a cup to drink. Many women notoriously refused all food except for the holy Eucharist, signifying not only their devotion to God and Jesus, but also demonstrating, to them, the separation of body and spirit. That the body could exist for extended periods without nourishment gave people of the time a clear picture of how much stronger, and therefore how much more important, the spirit was. It mattered not in popular opinion that the reported periods of female fasting were impossibly long (from months to many years) and simply added to the allure of this very specifically female achievement. Angela of Foligno Both Angela of Foligno (1248‚Äì1309) and Catherine of Siena (1347‚Äì1380) were reportedly anorexia mirabilis sufferers. They both refused food, but drank the pus from the sores of the sick. Angela of Foligno is reported to have said it was as \\"sweet as the Eucharist\\", and also to have eaten the scabs and lice from those same patients, though precious little else.Connecting with the God-Man In the time of Catherine of Siena, celibacy and fasting were held in high regard. Ritualistic fasting was both a means to avoid gluttony (one of the seven deadly sins), and to atone for past sins. Catherine initially fasted as a teenager to protest an arranged marriage to her late sister Bonaventura's husband. Bonaventura herself had taught this technique to Catherine, refusing to eat until her husband showed better manners. Fasting then was a means of exercising some control, taking power back for the individual and as such it is similar to one of the underlying factors in anorexia nervosa today. Thus, women could gain more freedom and respect remaining virgins than they would becoming wives. Catherine managed to pursue her interests in theology and papal politics, opportunities less likely available to a wife and mother. She purportedly lived for long intervals on practically no food save the Eucharist, leading to an untimely death at thirty-three years from starvation and emaciation. Any additional food she was forced to eat she would expel through vomiting induced by pushing a twig or small branch down her throat.Anorexia Mirabilis. Marie of Oignies (1167‚Äì1213) reportedly lived as a hermit, wore only white, cut off pieces of her body to expunge her desire, and both she and Beatrice of Nazareth claimed that not only did the smell of meat make them vomit, but also that the slightest whiff of food would cause their throats to close up entirely. A gang of would-be rapists got as far as removing the clothing of Columba of Rieti (1467‚Äì1501), but they retreated as she had mutilated her breasts and hips so thoroughly with spiked whipping chains that they were unable or unwilling to continue. Columba did eventually starve herself to death.B.M.Ashley ‚Äì Italian Dominican Women Mystics  Perceived benefits  Saint Margaret of Cortona Many of these women felt that they possessed at least some measure of spiritual enlightenment from their asceticism. They variously said they felt \\"inebriation\\" with the sacramental wine, \\"hunger\\" for God, and conversely, that they sat at the \\"delicious banquet of God\\". Margaret of Cortona (1247‚Äì1297) believed she had extended communications with God himself. Columba of Rieti believed her spirit \\"toured the holy land\\" in visions, and virtually every one of these women was apparently possessed of some level of psychic prowess. These women's exercises in self-denial and suffering did yield them a measure of fame and notoriety. They were said to alternately be able to make a feast out of crumbs, exude oil from their fingertips, heal with their saliva, fill barrels with drink out of thin air, lactate even though virginal and malnourished, and perform other miracles of note. The practice of anorexia mirabilis faded out during the Renaissance, when it began to be seen by the Church as heretical, socially dangerous, or possibly even Satanically inspired. It managed to survive in practice until nearly the 20th century, when it was overtaken by its more popularly known counterpart, anorexia nervosa.Speaking about eating disorders Contemporary accounts of anorexia mirabilis do exist, most notably that of a fundamentalist Christian girl in Colombia, as reported by medical anthropologist Carlos Alberto Uribe.

It also has information on the local area schools, along with local companies and families. It is listed on the National Register of Historical Sites and the Michigan Register of Historical Sites as the plaques in front of the house show. Corking The term \\"pop\\", for carbonated soft drinks, originated in northern Michigan. The museum claims that perhaps it came from the Northwestern Bottling Works Company. It turns out in the early bottling techniques the beverage in its bottle with the cork could not withstand the pressure of the carbonation. On occasion then the cork would blow out of the bottle from the pressure and a loud \\"POP\\" sound would be produced. Children Early in the opening of the Kaleva Bottle House Museum, the children coming through it often just wanted to see the bathroom, as the bathtub had been featured in a Nickelodeon show with a sock puppet.

The light novel series has ranked five times in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! published yearly: eighth in 2007, third in 2008 and 2010, first in 2009, and sixth in 2011. In the 2009 issue of the guidebook, Tohko Amano was voted the No. 1 ranked female light novel character. In Kadokawa Shoten's Light Novel Award contest held in 2007, Book Girl and the Suicidal Mime won an award in the mystery category. In a review of the first light novel Book Girl and the Suicidal Mime by Anime News Network contributor Carlo Santos, the author Mizuki Nomura is cited as being \\"too ambitious\\" for her use of several differing genres of storytelling, such as the use of mystery, character-driven comedy, and 20th-century Japanese literature. Santos notes how these subjects, while present, are not expounded upon, and several plot points are pointed out as being left open (because there are more novels). The murder-mystery portion is described as being \\"awkwardly written\\", which reads more like \\"plot summary than actual dialogue.\\" The reviewer makes comparisons with the Haruhi Suzumiya light novel series in how Kyon and Haruhi Suzumiya are similar to the main characters Konoha Inoue and Tohko Amano from the Book Girl series. Santos further notes how the character-driven comedy is similar in style to that used in the Haruhi Suzumiya series.

It is located on the shores of the eastern channel of the Ottawa River at Calumet Island. Its settlements include Vinton (once known as St-Elizabeth-de-Franktown) and Goldwin. Notable lakes include Litchfield, Leslie, and Ours (Bear) Lakes. History Litchfield Township (spelled \\"Licthfield\\" on the Gale and Duberger map of 1795) was officially created in 1834. It was probably named after Lichfield, an English town in Staffordshire, north of Birmingham. On November 20, 1846, the township was incorporated with Alfred Lancaster as its first mayor. It was abolished the next year and became part of the Ottawa County Municipality. It was reestablished in 1855. In 1863, the Municipality of Portage-du-Fort Village separated from Litchfield's territory, followed by Bryson in 1873, and by Campbell's Bay in 1904. Because Bryson was located in the narrowest part of the municipality, between L'√éle-du-Grand-Calumet and Clarendon, it separated the municipality's territory in two.

A Personal Job-Seeking Odyssey. ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics. Volume 31. Issue 2. May 1997 It was the first San Diego company to produce 3-D computer animation and its clients have included Coca-Cola, General Dynamics, Union Oil, Southwestern Cable, Metrocast, Honda, and a number of TV stations across the country.Steven Churchill's Homepage While Odyssey focused primarily on 35mm back-lit motion graphics and special effects for the first 5 years of its existence, its award-winning release of the world's first home entertainment video of computer animation, State Of the Art Of Computer Animation in 1988 brought about a shift in focus to 3D computer animation. The accolades and sales successes achieved by State Of the Art Of Computer Animation prompted the 1990 release of The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey, a title that would become the first member of the successful The Mind's Eye series. The next decade (1990‚Äì2000) would be taken up almost entirely with the production of 19 feature-length 3-D computer animated package films for home release. The company's name became Odyssey Productions in 1995 and the last 12 3D computer animated films were released under this name. In 2003 the company again changed its name to AnimationTrip and broadened its focus to encompass photography to a greater extent. Under this new corporate name, the company added a business enterprise in 2004 focused primarily on photographic art and has launched a series of international art exhibitions in San Diego, California called the Art of Photography Show and the Art of Digital Show. Since 2006, exhibiting photographic art and promoting photo artists has been the full focus of the business. In 2010 the company was named PhotoCulture, Inc. The Mind's Eye series The Mind's Eye series consists of several package art films rendered using computer-generated imagery of varying levels of sophistication. The main series consists of 4 titles that were released between 1990 and 1996. The series was released on VHS (by BMG) and LaserDisc (by Image EntertainmentBusiness Wire. \\"Image Entertainment Signs Exclusive Agreement With Odyssey Productions for DVD and VHS Release of State-of-the-Art Computer Animation Programs\\". Aug 18, 1999.) and later re-released on DVD (by the now-defunct Simitar Entertainment). A number of Odyssey's videos additionally contain oblique references to the Mind's Eye series in their titles. These references are found in the tagline portions of the title and take the form of either \\"From the Makers of the Mind's Eye\\" or \\"The Mind's Eye Presents.\\" The main series consists of: *The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey (1990) *Beyond the Mind's Eye (1992) *The Gate to the Mind's Eye (1994) *Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye (1996) The Computer Animation series Like the Mind's Eye series, the Computer Animation series consists of a main series of 3 computer-generated package films.

In this picturesque location, surrounded by beautiful low hills and good terrain, the Lower T√°pi√≥ and S√°pi streams add to making the town a beauty spot. Communications Primary route 31 serves the town by road. Express and stopping trains of the Hungarian State Railways serve the town on suburban line 120a (Budapest-√öjsz√°sz-Szolnok) at the main station (S√ºlys√°p) and a smaller station halt (Sz≈ël≈ësnyaral√∂). \\"Sz≈ël≈ësnyaral√∂\\" is best translated as \\"Vineyard retreat\\"; the village was built as holiday homes for workers from Budapest. Over the years these holiday homes have been converted and extended and are used as main homes. The nearest airport is the main international airport for the capital, Budapest-Ferihegy. Economy There are around 360 small and medium enterprises in the town, providing the livelihood of a large segment of the population. After the collapse of the collective farming system, the lands around S√ºlys√°p were privatized, and farmers became self-employed. The Agricultural Service Co-op was founded not long after, and currently leases almost half of the land from the owners, with a large number of members.

Sz≈ëdliget has around 4500 inhabitants and is situated on the east bank of the Danube surrounded by agricultural land. Sz≈ëdliget acts as a commuter town for Budapest (27 km to the south), and to some extent for V√°c (7 km to the north) with good train and road links to both. It is also home to some small businesses and farming families. There has been a shift in demographic since the 1980s when there were older and less mobile residents - now the village is seeing more families with children staying and a sense of community is more evident. A new cycling path, also suitable for walkers, passes along the Danube bank at Sz≈ëdliget, linking Dunakeszi to V√°c. Flooding has occasionally affected low-lying land in the village. Sz≈ëdliget faces an uninhabited part of the Szentendre Island across a 90m stretch of the Danube.  Cricket at Sz≈ëdliget  In 2009, the Hungarian Cricket Association (HCA) identified the playing fields of the lapsed Sz≈ëdliget football club 25 km north of Budapest as a potential site for the building of Hungary's first full-sized cricket ground. The land was bought privately and, after one or two false starts, landscaping and the building of a pavilion were started in autumn 2010. The pitch was initially the home ground of the now lapsed Spartans CC. An artificial wicket was installed and the landscaping was completed in June 2011. Around 30 matches were played at Sz≈ëdliget in its first season, culminating in the EuroTwenty20 tournament week in mid August 2011. That tournament saw the Hungarian Senior Men's XI defend their title by beating Bulgaria in the final of an eight team knock-out cup. League and cup double-winners in 2011 were the Budapest Falcons CC. Matches are usually played at Sz≈ëdliget on Saturdays and Sundays between mid-April and late September. The cricket pitch's boundary is 73m at its longest (from centre to boundary) and 63m at its shortest, making it one of Central Europe's largest cricket pitches. Mowing the whole pitch involves a journey of around 19 km on the tractor-mower. 2012 saw many cricket matches played at Sz≈ëdliget's GB Oval pitch, either top league games, international friendlies or other fixtures and training sessions. Very few local people come to watch matches, which is a pity since matches are free to watch, are often tense but good-humoured and the cricketing fraternity would be only too happy to try to explain the game to any visitor (who has the requisite time, patience and language skills). In autumn 2012 and spring 2013, surface repairs were made to several worn-out areas of the pitch. Despite late snow and plenty of rain, matches organised by the HCA resumed at the ground in April 2013. The season saw 20-25 league and cup matches on Saturdays and Sundays, including matches for juniors and women's teams, as well as various training sessions and some tour matches and international friendly matches played at Sz≈ëdliget. The HCA warmly invites all visitors to come and watch matches free of charge. The highlight of the 2013 Sz≈ëdliget season was arguably the triangular International Cricket weekend on September 28/29, which saw decent matches between Hungary, Poland and Croatia. Domestic Cup winners 2013 were the Falcons and 40-over winners were the Tigers. Flooding in June 2013 *** The whole cricket pitch was under Danube flood-water for 11 days in early June 2013, the field only being 3.5m above the usual level of the river, which is 1500m to the west. 80% of the grass was lost. Matches continued on the damaged but playable surface from July 12, 2013 onwards. Re-seeding started in late October and will be completed in March/April 2014. = Naturewatch at the GB Oval = On the south side of the pitch there is a drainage stream. There, and elsewhere at the cricket pitch's borders, the following wildlife has been seen: kingfishers, buzzards, herons, lapwings, egrets, sticklebacks and other small fish, common frogs, toads, fresh-water shrimps up to 12 cm long, \\"Sikl√≥\\" non-venomous water snakes, grass-snakes, ducks, wagtails, ravens and jackdaws, both common woodpeckers, finches, pheasants, bees, voles, foxes, several species of butterfly, various cycadas, dragonflies, much insect life, spiders, grey squirrels, wild mint, thyme, orchids, rushes, laurel and perhaps an eagle - moles are less welcome but are also in residence.

The architecture of Istanbul describes a large mixture of structures which reflect the many influences that have made an indelible mark in all districts of the city. The ancient part of the city (the historic peninsula) is still partially surrounded by the Walls of Constantinople, erected in the 5th century by Emperor Theodosius II to protect the city from invasion. The architecture inside the city proper contains buildings and structures which came from Byzantine, Genoese, Ottoman, and modern Turkish sources. The city has many architecturally significant entities. Throughout its long history, Istanbul has acquired a reputation for being a cultural and ethnic melting pot. As a result, there are many historical mosques, churches, synagogues, palaces, castles and towers to visit in the city. Ancient Greek and Roman structures =Serpent Column= The Serpent Column, the oldest surviving Greek monument in Istanbul One of the oldest monuments still surviving from antiquity is the Serpent Column, a monument built originally to honor Apollo for the victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479 BC. The column was moved by Constantine the Great when Constantinople became the new capital, and has stood at the Hippodrome of Constantinople ever since. According to legend, a member of the Polish Embassy visiting in 1700 damaged the top of it severely, breaking off the serpent heads, although in reality at least one of the heads had been reported as badly damaged two centuries earlier. The accepted version states that Mehmed II shattered it upon entering the city in triumph as its conqueror. The upper jaw of one of the snakes heads is on display at the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul. =Column of Constantine= Column of the Goths in G√ºlhane Park The most important monuments of Roman architecture in the city include the Column of Constantine (), which was erected in 330 by Constantine the Great for marking the declaration of the new capital city of the Roman Empire and contained several fragments of the True Cross and other artifacts belonging to Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary, the Mazulkemer Aqueduct, the Valens Aqueduct, the Column of the Goths in G√ºlhane Park, the Milion which served for calculating the distances between Constantinople and other cities of the Roman Empire, and the Hippodrome of Constantinople which was built following the model of the Circus Maximus in Rome. Byzantine and Genoese structures =Walls of Constantinople and environs= triple land walls of Constantinople was later filled with earth and used for agriculture Construction of the Walls of Constantinople began under Constantine the Great, who enlarged the previously existing walls of Byzantium in order to defend the new Roman capital city which quickly grew following its proclamation as Nova Roma. A new set of walls was built further west during the reign of Theodosius II, and rebuilt after an earthquake in 447 in their current shape. The sea walls in the Seraglio Point area, which have continuously existed since Lygos and Byzantium, are the oldest part of the city walls; while the double land walls of Theodosius II at the western end of the city are the strongest parts. The northwestern section of the land walls was built in 627, during the reign of Heraclius (610‚Äì641), in order to accommodate the suburb of Blachernae, and added to by later emperors. The Yedikule Fortress The city walls had 55 gates, the largest of which was the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate), the ceremonial entrance gate used by the Emperors, at the southwestern end of the triple land walls, close to the Sea of Marmara. Unlike the city walls which were built of brick and limestone, the Porta Aurea was built of large clean-cut white marble blocks in order to distinguish it from the rest, and a quadriga with elephant statues stood on its top.Byzantium 1200: Porta Aurea The doors of the Porta Aurea were made of gold, hence the name, which means \\"Golden Gate\\" in Latin. In 1458, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II built the Yedikule Fortress to defend the Porta Aurea, which was incorporated into this castle and still stands as a part of the pentagon-shaped layout of the castle walls. The Column of Marcian () erected by Marcianus (reigned 450‚Äì457) dates from the same period as the triple land walls of Theodosius II. The most extant Byzantine structure which has survived from the reign of Heraclius is the Prison of Anemas,Emporis: Anemas Dungeons incorporated into the city walls, at Blachernae. It is a huge castle-like structure with several towers and a network of underground Byzantine prisons. =Hagia Sophia and Little Hagia Sophia= The Hagia Sophia, built by Justinian between 532 and 537, is widely regarded as the masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. It was the largest ever cathedral built in the world for more than a thousand years, until the completion of the Seville Cathedral in 1575, during the Renaissance The early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but further improved these architectural concepts, as evidenced with the Hagia Sophia, which was designed by Isidorus and Anthemius as the third church to rise on this location, between 532 and 537, following the Nika riots (532) during which the second church was destroyed (the first church, known as the Megala Ekklessia (Great Church) was inaugurated by Constantius II in 360; the second church was inaugurated by Theodosius II in 405, while the third and current one was inaugurated by Justinian in 537). The Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Little Hagia Sophia), which was the first church built by Justinian in Constantinople and constructed between 527 and 536, had earlier signaled such an improvement in the design of domed buildings, which require complex solutions for carrying the structure. The present-day Hagia Irene (which was originally built by Constantine in the 4th century, but was later enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century) and the Basilica Cistern are also from this period. =Stoudios Monastery= Most Byzantine churches that were built or enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century were originally built in the 4th century at the time of Constantine. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul with its original form is the Stoudios (ƒ∞mrahor) Monastery, which was built in 462. The monastery is also known as St. John Stoudios because it was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The roof of the building doesn't exist today, but its surrounding walls as well as its splendid floor decorations are still intact. Many important decisions regarding Christianity were made inside this building, including the heated debates on the identity of Virgin Mary (whether or not she was Theotokos (Mother of God) and whether it was right to condemn Nestorius who opposed this definition) as well as the debates and clashes on Iconoclasm. =Hagia Irene= The 4th century Hagia Irene, built by Constantine, is the oldest standing Byzantine church in the city Following the decision by Theodora, wife of Theophilus, to restore the icons in 843, many churches and other prominent Byzantine buildings in the city were adorned with new icons, but some, like Hagia Irene, still bear the signs of the iconoclastic period. The Boukoleon Palace largely dates from the reign of Theophilus.Byzantium 1200: Boukoleon Palace =Blachernae Palace and the Palace of Porphryogenitus= The Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (), which is the only surviving part of the Blachernae Palace, dates from the period of the Fourth Crusade. In these years, on the northern side of the Golden Horn, the Dominican priests of the Catholic Church built the Church of Saint Paul in 1233. =Chora Church and Pammakaristos Church= The Chora Church, known as the Kariye Muzesi The most important churches which were built after the Byzantines took Constantinople back in 1261 include the Chora Church and the Pammakaristos Church. The final structure of the Chora Church that exists reflects the five additions that were finished during the tenure of the last ktetor, Theodore Metochites, from 1316 to 1321. In the year 1511 the church was officially converted into a mosque, and named Kariye Camii. In 1945, the mosque was converted into a museum, and has been named Kariye Muzesi to this day. After many centuries, only the church, the southern chapel, and another building to the north remain. The Pammakaristos Church was constructed in the early part of the 12th century for Michael VII Ducas and his wife Mary (sister of Alexius II Comnenus). It was the largest church in the city at that time that served a monastery for women. Before the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the sarcophagii of Alexius I Comnenus and his daughter Anna rested within the chapel inside the monastery. In 1453, the nuns were removed, but the church was allowed to remain untouched, except for a giant cross which existed on the dome. The cross was removed by Sultan Suleiman in 1547 after numerous complaints. In 1586, Sultan Murad III converted it into a mosque, naming it the Fethiye Camii. =Palazzo del Comune= Maiden's (Leander's) Tower was originally built as a wooden structure by Emperor Alexios Komnenos Also in this period, the Genoese Podest√† of Galata, Montano de Marinis, built the Palazzo del Comune (1314), a copy of the San Giorgio Palace in Genoa, which still stands in ruins on the back streets of Bankalar Caddesi in Galata, together with its adjacent buildings and numerous Genoese houses from the early 14th century. =Leander's Tower= Ancient Athenian general Alcibiades, after the naval victory at Cyzicus, possibly built a custom station for ships coming from Black Sea on a small rock in front of Chrysopolis (today's √úsk√ºdar).M√ºller-Wiener (1976), p. 334 In 1110 Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comnenus built on this site a wooden tower protected by a stone wall. The structure, known as Leander's Tower after the legend of Hero and Leander (which took place in the Dardanelles), was rebuilt and restored several times by the Ottoman Turks, until in 1763 it was erected using stone. The most recent restoration took place in 1998. Steel supports were added around the ancient tower as a precaution after the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake. Galata Tower dominates the skyline of the medieval Genoese citadel at the northern shore of the Golden Horn, facing the Old City (peninsula of Constantinople) at the southern shore =Galata Tower= The Genoese also built the Galata Tower, which they named as Christea Turris (Tower of Christ), at the highest point of the citadel of Galata, in 1348. Ottoman structures Topkapƒ± Palace The Ottoman Turks built the Anadoluhisarƒ± on the Asian side of the Bosphorus in 1394, and the Rumelihisarƒ± at the opposite (European) shore, in 1452, a year before the conquest of Constantinople. The main purpose of these castles, armed with the long range Balyemez (Faule Metze) cannons, was to block the sea traffic of the Bosphorus and prevent the support ships from the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea ports, such as Caffa, Sinop, and Amasra, from reaching Constantinople and helping the Byzantines during the Turkish siege of the city. Following the Ottoman conquest of the city, Sultan Mehmed II initiated a wide scale reconstruction plan, which included the construction of grand buildings such as the Ey√ºp Sultan Mosque, Fatih Mosque, Topkapƒ± Palace, The Grand Bazaar and the Yedikule (Seven Towers) Castle which guarded the main entrance gate of the city, the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate). In the centuries following Mehmed II, many new important buildings, such as the S√ºleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque, Yeni Mosque and numerous others were constructed. Sultan Ahmed Mosque Traditionally, Ottoman buildings were built of ornate wood. Only \\"state buildings\\" such as palaces and mosques were built of stone. Starting from the 18th and 19th centuries, wood was gradually replaced with stone as the primary building material, while traditional Ottoman architectural styles were gradually replaced with European styles, such as the Baroque style interiors of the Aynalƒ±kavak Palace (1677‚Äì1679) and Nuruosmaniye Mosque (1748‚Äì1755, the first Baroque style mosque in the city, also famous for its Baroque fountain), and the 18th century Baroque additions to the Harem section of Topkapƒ± Palace. Following the Tanzimat reforms which effectively started Turkey's Europeanization process in 1839, new palaces and mosques were built in Neoclassical, Baroque and Rococo styles, or a mixture of all three, such as the Dolmabah√ße Palace, Beylerbeyi Palace and Ortak√∂y (Mecidiye) Mosque designed and constructed by the Balyan family members: Turkish Cultural Foundation . Even Neo-Gothic mosques were built, such as the Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque and Yƒ±ldƒ±z Hamidiye Mosque. Large state buildings like schools or military barracks were also built in various European styles. Ortak√∂y Mosque and the Bosphorus Bridge Starting from the early 19th century, the areas around ƒ∞stiklal Avenue were filled with grandiose embassy buildings belonging to prominent European states, and rows of European (mostly Neoclassical and later Art Nouveau) style buildings started to appear on both flanks of the avenue. Istanbul especially became a major center of the Art Nouveau movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with famous architects of this style like Raimondo D'Aronco building many palaces and mansions in the city proper and on the Princes' Islands. His most important works in the city include several buildings of the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace complex, and the Botter House on ƒ∞stiklal Avenue. The famous Camondo Stairs on Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Karak√∂y (Galata) is also a beautiful example of Art Nouveau architecture. Other important examples are the Hƒ±div Kasrƒ± (Khedive Palace) on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, Flora Han in Sirkeci, and Frej Apartmanƒ± in the ≈ûi≈ühane quarter of Beyoƒülu. Thus, by the mid-19th century, the southern part of the Golden Horn (the historic peninsula of Constantinople) had a traditionally Ottoman Turkish appearance and population, while the northern part of the Golden Horn became more and more Europeanized both in terms of architecture and in terms of demographics. The Galata Bridge had become a connection between the oriental and occidental (southern and northern) parts of the European side of Istanbul. The Bosphorus was regarded as a summer resort during the Ottoman period and the traditional wooden houses and mansions, called yalƒ±, were the choice of the wealthy Ottoman elite. Most of the development happened during the Tulip Period, a period which is best represented by the Sadullah Pa≈üa Yalƒ±sƒ± built in 1783. The oldest surviving yalƒ± is the Amcazade K√∂pr√ºl√º H√ºseyin Pasha yalƒ± located in Kandilli on the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus and dates from 1699. The wooden seaside chalet mansions retained their basic architectural principles until the middle of the 19th century, when they were gradually replaced by less flammable brick houses especially during the First Constitutional Period. The development of yalƒ±s lasted until the First World War.

Exercise Northern Edge is Alaska's premier military joint training exercise. Alaskan Command (ALCOM) uses expansive Alaskan training ranges to conduct this joint training operation.  History  = Jack Frost 1975‚Äì1977 and 1979 = Northern Edge evolved over the years from the Jack Frost, Brim Frost and Arctic Warrior exercises. The first of these was Jack Frost '75, an Alaskan Command-sponsored exercise, which ran from January 7 to February 14, 1975. Jack Frost '75 focused on joint operations and training in an Arctic environment. Jack Frost '76 marked the beginning of the exercises sponsored by the United States Readiness Command. This year units from the 9th INF Div., from Ft. Lewis, WA included the 3/34FA and 2/47 Inf deployed in the field to test cold weather operations. Also in 1976 a detachment of the 337th Army Security Agency Company provided electronic warfare training including electronic countermeasures (ECM), electronic counter countermeasures (ECCM) and communications security. Jack Frost '77 exercised command and control techniques and procedures for joint task force operations. Later that year, US Readiness Command learned that the nickname, Jack Frost, was prohibited by JCS publications. The command received approval for the name Brim Frost, and the final Jack Frost exercise ran in 1979. = Brim Frost 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987 and 1989 = Brim Frost '81 was sponsored by US Readiness Command. Brim Frost 83 was conducted from January 10 to February 11, 1983. Brim Frost '85 began December 10, 1984 and concluded January 24, 1985, with more than 18,000 military troops participating. All three of these operations exercised the ability of Joint Task Force Alaska to conduct winter operations. Brim Frost '87 involved more than 24,000 active and reserve Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy personnel. More than 143 Air Force aircraft, 130 Army aircraft, and five major Coast Guard cutters were employed during Brim Frost '87. Brim Frost '89, sponsored by Forces Command, involved more than 26,000 troops and cost $15 million. This exercise involved numerous communications initiatives such as Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, satellites, and electronic intelligence. Brim Frost '89 was to include more than 26,000 troops, however nearly all of the units that were slated to participate dropped out of the exercise following the crash due to extreme weather of a Canadian C-130 military transport plane and the death of 9 Canadians at Ft. Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska. The only units to participate were the 4th and 5th Battalions of the U.S. Army's 9th Infantry Regiment, 6th Infantry Division, some units of the Alaska National Guard and their necessary support units. Also the 2nd Battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment who were deployed to Kodiak Island for the duration of the exercise. During this exercise temperatures as low as -80 F and colder were reported along with a North American-record high atmospheric pressure of 31.85 inches. The Official temperature recorded in Fairbanks, Alaska was -67 F. = Arctic Warrior 1991 = Arctic Warrior '91 replaced the Brim Frost exercises with the reestablishment of Alaska Command in 1990. It also transferred the exercise sponsorship from Forces Command to Pacific Command. The exercise ran from January 25 to February 6, 1991. It featured live fire and had more than 10,000 troops participating. = Northern Edge 1993‚Äì2004 = The first Northern Edge exercise took place in 1993. This exercise was scaled in comparison. ALCOM designed it to be an internal training event for the headquarters and component headquarters staffs. The exercise emphasized the joint operations, campaign planning and logistics planning. Northern Edge '94 field training exercise from March 11 to March 18, 1994, was considerably larger than 1993, involving more than 14,600 military personnel. ALCOM activated the joint task force Northern Edge in response to a simulated National Command Authority mission that provided forces to conduct peace enforcement operations. To add realism, the Red Cross, International Medical Corps, Feed the Children and other non-government agencies participated. Northern Edge '95 and '96 each consisted of three phases, and included more than 14,000 personnel participated in the joint exercise. This exercise tested and validated ALCOM's ability to field a deployable joint task force. Northern Edge '97, with more than 9,000 personnel, divided its field training into two parts, held in different locations. Major air and ground maneuvers were held at Fort Greely. The naval harbor defense portion was held at Seward, Alaska. Planners focused on night high-tech activities, air interdiction, deep strike missions and the land maneuver forces during conventional ground combat. Northern Edge '98 began with a mass airborne drop of 600 troops in training areas southeast of Fairbanks, while maritime forces began protecting the harbor in Ketchikan. The mock town of Simpsonville was used for joint live fire exercises, which became a pivotal part of the field training. Apache helicopters supported a brigade air assault and more than 1,200 sorties assisted air operations. The was the high value unit for the port security portion of the exercise and the U. S. Marine Corps Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team (FAST) was the main defender alongside Navy and Coast Guard active and reserve harbor defense units and personnel. Northern Edge '99 included a night airborne mass jump, a brigade air assault, more than 1,200 air sorties flown, theater missile defense, information operations, harbor defense, and a three-day-and-night live fire at mock town Simpsonville. The harbor defense exercise was conducted in Seward this year, with U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and Canadian Navy units participating in a combined Harbor Defense Command. The USMC Reserve Unit from Anchorage provided opposition force (OPFOR) assets for the harbor defense portion of the exercise. During Northern Edge 2000, there were a number of live-fire exercises, an airborne operation, and multiple close air support missions flown. A robust theater missile defense cell took part in the exercise by conducting anti-ballistic missile operations against a simulated attack. Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle, made its first appearance in Northern Edge providing battlefield commanders with near real-time aerial imagery. Northern Edge 2001 facilitated unit level training, theater engagement, and joint operations in a cold climate. Additionally, the naval exercise emphasized joint and combined port security and harbor defense operations in a friendly host nation. The highlight of the naval exercise, for the second year in a row, was the use of trained dolphins to help detect underwater intruders. Northern Edge 2002 had the benefit of training with crews from an aircraft carrier and its accompanying support ships. The operated from the Gulf of Alaska, and its aircraft, including the new F-18 Super Hornet, flew into the interior of the state to hone their warfighting skills training with and against other military participants. Some of the skills practiced include air interdiction against main supply routes, precision strikes, combat search and rescue of downed aircrew and tactical airlift support. The area around Valdez served as the backdrop for the maritime activities and ground defense maneuvers, which centered on protecting the visiting and the Valdez Marine Terminal. The war in Iraq forced the scope of Northern Edge 2003 exercise to contract, but it was still the state's largest annual joint training exercise. The exercise focused on homeland defense scenarios and incorporated theater missile defense, force protection, air-to-air fighter aircraft engagements, joint exercises, combat search and rescue, harbor defense and maritime operations. = Northern Edge 2004 = More than 9,000 Airmen, Sailors, Marines, Soldiers and Coast Guardsmen from active duty, reserve and National Guard units participated in Northern Edge 2004, which focused on air-centric tactics and procedures with an emphasis on air-to-air, air-to-ground and personnel recovery operations in remote areas of the Pacific Alaska Range Complex near Fairbanks, Alaska and over water in the Gulf. While traditionally held in the cold weather months, for 2004, Northern Edge was moved to June to accommodate the worldwide scheduling of combat forces and availability of the carrier strike group. Held from June 7 through June 16, 2004, Northern Edge training focused on air-centric tactics and procedures with an emphasis on air-to-air, air-to-ground and personnel recovery operations in remote areas of the Pacific Alaska Range Complex (PARC) near Fairbanks, Alaska, and over water in the Gulf. Though most flight operations went according to plan, naval aviators frequently operated in low visibility conditions with thick cloud ceilings over the Gulf. Along with aircraft from Carrier Group Seven, several other air units participated, including the Pacific Air Forces, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing from Okinawa, Japan, and several fighter units from Pacific Air Forces, robust aerial tanker support, multi-service helicopter support, and a fighter unit from Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The carrier paid a port visit to Esquimalt, British Columbia, between June 18‚Äì21, 2004, and carried out bi-lateral exercises with the Royal Canadian Navy between June 22‚Äì29, 2004. Carrier Strike Group Three also paid a port visit to Pearl Harbor between June 22‚Äì26, 2004, prior to RIMPAC 2004.2004 Command History, p. 6. Subsequent Northern Edge exercises focus on homeland defense/homeland security operations during odd-numbered years and on joint warfare operations during even-numbered years. = Alaska Shield/Northern Edge 2005 = Northern Edge 2005 took place from August 15‚Äì19, 2005. It was combined with the State of Alaska's homeland security exercise called Alaska Shield, and incorporated federal, state and local organizations in natural and human-made disaster and terrorist-related scenarios. After more than a year of planning and preparation, the U.S. Northern Command with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and others conducted Alaska Shield and Northern Edge 2005. A wide range of simulated natural disasters and terrorist events occurred in 21 communities throughout Alaska designed to train military and civilian \\"first responders\\" and test organizational skills at all levels of government. It was considered a capstone event for Alaska's three year Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Plan. Scenario elements included an earthquake in Juneau, bio-terrorism in Ketchikan and Juneau, critical infrastructure protection at Fort Greely refinery, and terrorist attacks in various cities throughout Alaska. = Northern Edge 2006 = Northern Edge 2006 was a joint training exercise from June 5‚Äì16, 2006. The exercise was aimed at helping prepare forces to respond to crises in the Asian Pacific region. Approximately 5,000 US active duty and reserve component soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines participated in the exercise by executing defensive counter-air, close-air support, air interdiction of maritime targets and personnel recovery missions. The exercise involved over 110 aircraft and two US Navy destroyers, namely the out of Seward and the out of Homer. = Alaska Shield/Northern Edge 2007 = Northern Edge 2007 combined with Alaska Shield took place from April 30 to May 17, 2007. Its purpose was for local, state, federal, DoD, and non-governmental organizations and agencies to exercise how to respond to a national crisis in a full range of training scenarios. This was the largest response readiness exercise in the history of the State of Alaska, involving more than 75 agencies and approximately 7,000 people. Military and civilian participants worked together to intercept aircraft, respond to attacks on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the North Pole Industrial Complex, and conducted medical evacuations after mass casualty incidents. =Northern Edge 2008= Northern Edge 2008 was held May 5‚Äì16, 2008. More than 5,000 participants from five of the United States Armed Forces (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard) from active duty, reserve and National Guard units were involved. =Northern Edge 2009= USS John C. Stennis (June 19, 2009) -Operation Northern Edge was held between 15‚Äì26 June 2009. This joint exercise provided real-world proficiency in detection and tracking of units at sea, in the air and on land and response to multiple crises, with approximately 9,000 U.S. active-duty and reserve- component military personnel participating. It was designed to be an air- centric exercise to train units in joint air operations tactics and command and control in a cost-effective and low-risk environment, with more than 200 aircraft from every branch of the U.S. military involved. Lt. General Dana T. Atkins, USAF, the commanding general of Alaskan Command and Eleventh Air Force, noted: :Northern Edge is the premier exercise conducted within the Pacific Command's area of responsibility. It lets our joint warfighters learn about each other. Northern Edge operations was conducted within the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, which includes more than 60,000 square miles (155,399.29 square kilometers) of air space, and the Gulf of Alaska, which encompasses 50,000 square miles (129,499.40 square kilometers) of air space. On 22 June 2009, during the Northern Edge exercise, Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin visited the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . Stennis (pictured) was the flagship of Carrier Strike Group Three which also consisted of carrier Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) and the guided-missile cruiser . =Northern Edge 2015= The 2013 exercise was canceled due to budget sequestration in 2013. The military did not publicly communicate the dates for Northern Edge ‚Äò15, and a Freedom of Information Act request was required. Several Southcentral communities protested in May. The City Council of Cordova, Alaska passed a resolution to formally oppose the Navy‚Äôs training exercises.

It has been widely used in exploring a wide variety of economic issues including business-cycle fluctuations, monetary and fiscal policy, trade related phenomena, and regularities in asset price co-movements. This is the equilibrium associated with dynamic programs that represent the decision problem when agents must distinguish between aggregate and individual state variables. These state variables embody the prior and current information of the economy. The decisions and the realizations of exogenous uncertainty determine the values of the state variables in the next sequential time period. Hence the problem is recursive. A RCE is characterized by time invariant functions of a limited number of 'state variables', which summarize the effects of past decisions and current information. These functions (decision rules) include (a) a pricing function, (b) a value function, (c) a period allocation policy specifying the individual's decision, (d) period allocation policy specifying the decision of each firm and (e) a function specifying the law of motion of the capital stock.

It has an adjustable diameter so that it can hold hanks of many sizes, and rotates around a central rod.Handwoven Magazine. \\"Weaving Terms.\\" Weaving Resources. Interweave Press. March 1, 2008 . Developed in the United States, they are generally made out of wood or metal, though other materials may also be used. In the 18th and 19th centuries, swifts were sometimes made of whale ivoryOverview of Scrimshaw: The Whaler's Art. New Bedford Whaling Museum, January 15, 2011. and they are now sought-after antiques. Swifts are not used very much in the textile industry but are used more by knitters and crocheters who buy their yarn in hank form. The swift allows for easy balling without the yarn getting tangled and knotted. Typology A swift can be as simple as four rods fixed into an axis, with bands connecting them. By sliding the bands the effective diameter changes, for different sized hanks. However, most swifts are more complicated than this. The 'umbrella swift' is one of the more common varieties, the advantage of it being that it folds up when not in use. Wooden umbrella swifts are the most common type of swift in use. They are preferred by hand spinners because they fold up, which is good for storage, and they are generally more stable, of higher quality, and look nicer than metal umbrella swifts. Another type is the 'Amish style' swift, a rotating cross with positionable pegs to adjust for different diameters of hanks. A spinners weasel is similar to a swift, however it does not adjust to various sized hanks. While today this is a big disadvantage, as different manufacturers don't always make hanks the same size, it was not an issue when all yarn was hand spun. At this time hanks from one spinner would all be the same size, as they would have been made on the same niddy noddy, thus only one diameter was needed.

One substitute for a swift is to have someone else hold the hank.Breiter, Barbara; Diven, Gail. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Knitting and Crocheting Illustrated. 2nd ed. Alpha Books, 2003. . Google Book Search. Retrieved on May 3, 2008. This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has had a lot of practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn. Another common substitute is the back of a chair. The disadvantages of this is that the hank is not kept under tension, and thus the yarn has a tendency to get tangled, and one has to stop very often to untangle it. Uses Using a swift to ball a hank Swifts are most commonly used to ball a hank of yarn. An increasing percentage of yarn is sold in hank form, especially hand dyed or hand spun yarns, which necessitates balling for knitters and crocheters. Swifts are also sometimes used by weavers in preparing the warp: if the yarn for the warp comes in a hank, the warp can be wound directly onto the warping board from the swift. As weaving yarns generally come on cones though, this use isn't as prevalent.

He does not so much attempt to prove that materialism is right (although he presents his 'Causal argument' for it in the first chapter) as analyse why dualism seems intuitively plausible. He makes various propositions for future research in his book. Causal argument In the first chapter of his book, Papineau offers the causal argument as what he considers the best argument for materialism: # Conscious mental occurrences have physical effects # All physical effects are fully caused by purely physical prior histories # The physical effects of conscious states are not always overdetermined by distinct causes. Materialism follows. Although Papineau recognises that it is possible to reject these premisses, he claims that to do so leads to empirically implausible conclusions. Conceptual dualism Not to be confused with property dualism, or ontological dualism, conceptual dualism suggests that we have two different ways of thinking about the properties of a single substance. The distinctness between these different kinds of concepts is what causes the 'intuition of distinctness,' which Papineau suggests is responsible for dualism, and why it is such an attractive hypothesis. Specifically, Papineau says that these two types of concepts are distinct, because the phenomenal concepts possess some part of the actual experience. Our concept of red includes a 'faint copy' of red, whereas our conception of the human perceptual system includes no such faint copy. Reaction Susan Blackmore characterized Papineau's book as \\"definitely written for philosophers rather than psychologists or neuroscientists\\" because of its focus on abstruse philosophical arguments. She concludes that \\"Papineau has helped explain why\\" it's so easy for us to think there's an explanatory gap for consciousness, though she doubts that Papineau's insistence that consciousness is an inherently vague concept will dampen neuroscientific efforts to understand it better.

In 1918 he was introduced to dadaism and Eastern philosophy by Cl√©ment Pansaers. He also started to study literature and philosophy at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles that year, but he left the studies in 1920. In 1922, he published the highly acclaimed Demonstrations, his first collection of poetry. In 1924 he founded a group named Correspondence with Paul Noug√© and Camille Goemans from which he was excommunicated the following year; however, they became close again thanks to common interest in surrealism. Yet he was not a strict surrealist, being more interested in the metaphysics of the dailiness. The same year he was excluded from the group, Lecomte published his second book of poetry entitled Applications. The work featured two illustrations from his friend Ren√© Magritte. Magritte's growing interest in Surrealism maybe have begun with Lecomte. The artist often recounted the moment Lecomte took him to view a reproduction of Giorgio de Chirico's The Song of Love as a moment when he uncontrollably wept. Lecomte also inspired a number of Magritte's paintings and was portrayed in his \\"Souvenir de Voyage\\" (\\"In Memory of a Journey\\", 1955). Between 1934 and 1945 he was a teacher at a secondary school. While he continued to write poetry, Lecomte focused on critical work and reviews of art, philosophy and poetry, writing for a variety of newspapers, including a weekly column in La Laterne. From 1958, he also worked as a counsellor for the Brussels¬¥ Museum of Art. In 2013, University of Maryland doctoral student K. A. Wisniewski began translating selected poems by Lecomte into English. These poems have appeared in the Chariton Review at Truman State University and basalt from the Eastern Oregon University.

These interactions between species can be considered in several ways. One such way is to depict interactions in the form of a network, which identifies the members and the patterns that connect them. Species interactions are considered primarily in terms of trophic interactions, which depict which species feed on others. Currently, ecological networks that integrate non-trophic interactions are being built. The type of interactions they can contain can be classified into six categories: mutualism, commensalism, neutralism, amensalism, antagonism, and competition. Observing and estimating the fitness costs and benefits of species interactions can be very problematic. The way interactions are interpreted can profoundly affect the ensuing conclusions. Interaction characteristics Characterization of interactions can be made according to various measures, or any combination of them. *Prevalence Prevalence identifies the proportion of the population affected by a given interaction, and thus quantifies whether it is relatively rare or common. Generally, only common interactions are considered. *Negative/ Positive Whether the interaction is beneficial or harmful to the species involved determines the sign of the interaction, and what type of interaction it is classified as. To establish whether they are harmful or beneficial, careful observational and/or experimental studies can be conducted, in an attempt to establish the cost/benefit balance experienced by the members. *Strength The sign of an interaction does not capture the impact on fitness of that interaction. One example of this is of antagonism, in which predators may have a much stronger impact on their prey species (death), than parasites (reduction in fitness). Similarly, positive interactions can produce anything from a negligible change in fitness to a life or death impact. *Relationship in space and time The relationship in space and time is not currently considered within a network structure, though it has been observed by naturalists for centuries. It would be highly informative to include geographical proximity, duration, and seasonal patterns of interactions into network analysis. Importance of interactions In the same way that a trophic cascade can occur, it is expected that 'interaction cascades' take place. Thus, it should be possible to construct 'effect' networks which parallel in many ways the energy or matter networks common in the literature. By assessing the network topology and constructing models, we might better understand how interacting species affect each other and how these effects spread through the network. In certain instances, it has been shown that indirect trophic effects tend to dominate direct ones (Patten, 1995)‚Äîperhaps this pattern will also emerge in non-trophic interactions. Keystone species By analyzing network structures, one can determine keystone species that are of particular importance. A different class of keystone species is what are termed 'ecosystem engineers'. Certain organisms alter the environment so drastically that it affects many interactions that take place within a habitat. This term is used for organisms that \\"directly or indirectly modulate availability of resources (other than themselves) to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials\\". Beavers are an example of such engineers. Other examples include earthworms, trees, coral reefs, and planktonic organisms. Such 'network engineers' can be seen as \\"interaction modifiers\\", meaning that a change in their population density affects the interactions between two or more other species. Interesting examples Certain interactions may be particularly problematic to understand. These may include *Wolbachia *Beneficial endosymbionts *Vectors *Viruses Criticisms *Can the complexities of biology ever be captured in schematics? *How do we accurately detect and evaluate non-visible interactions? *How much predictive power do these networks have for population dynamics?

It operated until 1868. There is a historical marker in a city park in remembrance of its history. History The station and military post, first called Camp Tyler, was established in 1859. It is estimated that the Pike's Peak Gold Rush drew about 100,000 people to Colorado. The South Platte Trail was the safest route. In 1859, a branch of the trail away from the South Platte River was established in the wilderness near the present day city of Fort Morgan during the gold rush to reduce the length of the trip to Denver. Fort Morgan was established in the mid-1860s as a defensive measure against the threat of attack by Native Americans. The military post was also called Camp Wardwell. Made a permanent fort with adobe and sod buildings in July 1865, the fort was manned that year by Confederate prisoners of war, nicknamed \\"galvanized rebels\\", who had enlisted in the Union Army rather than continue their fate as POWs. Stationed with the soldiers was Captain M. H. Slater of the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment. The goal of the post was to protect travelers along the Overland Trail (South Platte Trail) as well as neighboring ranchers. It was renamed Fort Morgan in 1866 for Christopher Morgan, the commanding officer of the 1st Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. He died January 20, 1866. The Union Pacific Railway was built in the area and began offering rail service, which made the fort unnecessary by May 18, 1868 when it was abandoned. A historical marker was established at the site of the fort at 229 Riverview Avenue by the Fort Morgan chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

While the Ro.43 had serious problems, the Ro.44 was an utter failure. Armed with two 12.7 mm machine guns fitted in the nose, the rear fuselage of the R.43 was redesigned to dispense with the observer's position, and changes were made to the tail. Overall, performance remained almost identical to that of the Ro.43, although the Ro.44 was more maneuverable. Although it was fast enough to intercept machines like the Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Seafox, its actual performance (and sea-keeping capabilities) was so poor, that out of 51 ordered, only 35 were produced. They were used only in the Aegean Sea, with 161 Squadriglia having seven examples in service at the beginning of World War II but was soon retired from the front line and sent to seaplane schools. This was the last OFM/IMAM biplane to be designed.

Located along Bloor Street, it encompasses all businesses along Bloor Street between South Kingsway and Ellis Park Road, consisting of more than 400 shops, restaurants and services. The mix of stores include specialty clothing stores, book stores, restaurants and cafes. The businesses organized in 1970 into the first mandatory business improvement district, an idea that has spread to numerous other commercial streets in Toronto and to cities around the world. History Bloor West Village is located between two neighbourhoods. To the north is Runnymede, a former streetcar suburb and to the south is Swansea, a former village dating to the 19th century. Bloor West Village is also considered the name of the immediate vicinity of Bloor Street. Runnymede Public Library was opened in Bloor West Village in 1930, serving the neighbourhoods around the Village. On February 25, 1966, the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth subway line opened in the area, allowing shoppers to shop downtown instead of the businesses along Bloor Street. Competition was also developing from enclosed shopping centres. Businessmen of the district attempted to set up a business association to pay for improvements to the area, but received only partial support from businesses in the area, and not enough to pay the estimated expenses to renovate and market the area. The businessmen lobbied the Toronto and Ontario governments for legislation to compel all business owners within a designated area to pay towards improvements, as directed by an elected body. The Ontario Municipal Act was amended in 1970 and the Bloor West Village Business Improvement Association (BIA) was founded as the first of its kind in the world, first chaired by Alex Ling. In 1980, Ling founded the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA), an organization that now represents 66 BIAs across Toronto. Ling was chairman of the Bloor West Village BIA for 24 years. The organization promotes business activity in the area by holding several annual events and festivals. It also puts efforts into the beautification of the area. The BIA hosts: *Annual Ukrainian Festival in September (music, foods and crafts). * July Festival, which is a local fair of amusements and entertainment. *Halloween Festival on Armadale Avenue, Beresford Avenue and Glendonwynne Road (family-friendly activities). *Participates in the Toronto citywide \\"Cavalcade of Lights\\" (December) In Fall 2017, the City of Toronto started a study to designate Bloor West Village as a Heritage Conservation District. The city explained that the neighbourhood is an established main street that was developed in early to mid-20th century, and it has been historically demarcating road, dividing distinct communities such as Swansea, West Toronto, Brockton Village prior to amalgamation. It also reflects past communities and broader city developments, such as opening of Bloor streetcar line in the 1920s and opening of Bloor-Danforth subway line in the 1960s.

As a member of the Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party (DFL), he represents District 61, which includes portions of Minneapolis in Hennepin County. Education Dibble attended both the University of Minnesota and the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul. Early Activism Dibble first became involved in politics in the mid-1980s working on issues concerning the civil rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities including advocacy for those with HIV/AIDS. He was an activist and organizer for \\"It's Time, Minnesota,\\" a statewide LGBT rights organization that helped pass the 1993 Minnesota Human Rights Act.Preston, Joshua. \\"Allan Spear and the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\\" Minnesota History 65 (2016): 76-87. This involvement led to organizing on issues of social and economic justice‚Äîespecially in the areas of neighborhood livability, transportation, housing, energy and the environment. Dibble later worked as an aide to Minneapolis City Council Member Dor√© Mead for about 6 years. In 2000, Dibble ran for a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives, becoming the third openly gay legislator to serve in the Minnesota Legislature. Minnesota Legislature Prior to his election to the Senate, Dibble served one term in the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 60B. Dibble was first elected to the Senate in November 2002 and re-elected in 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016. Dibble played a pivotal role in the override of Governor Tim Pawlenty's veto of a transportation improvement bill that would allow the Twin Cities to build a modern transit system. Issues =Marriage Equality= Following his leadership in the campaign against the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in Minnesota, he alongside House Representative Karen Clark and several other colleagues in the Legislature, proposed an amendment during the 2013 legislative session in the state of Minnesota to legalize same-sex marriage. The bill passed and same-sex marriage took effect on August 1, 2013. =The Environment= Senator Dibble has helped position Minnesota as a leader among the states that are working to solve critical clean air, global warming, and economic challenges. He has served as chief author or as a lead negotiator on groundbreaking energy efficiency standards, implementation of a nation-leading renewable energy standard, establishment of a carbon dioxide reduction mandate, instituting the nation's most stringent mercury emission reduction requirements for coal-fired energy, the first legislation in the country on hybrid plug in electric cars, programs to aid the construction of green buildings and to assist local governments in building more energy efficient facilities. Senator Dibble helped author and served on the state's Green Jobs Task Force charged with developing a comprehensive economic development policy charged with shaping Minnesota's participation in the Green Economy for generations to come. =Medical Cannabis= In 2014, Senator Dibble was the chief author of a bill that allowed limited use of medical cannabis for patients who have debilitating or terminal illnesses. He has also worked to legalize cannabis for recreational use. =Transportation= Senator Dibble continues to be the DFL leader in the Minnesota Senate on legislation relating to transportation and transit, energy efficiency, the environment, housing and economic development. Personal life Dibble is openly gay. His husband is Richard Leyva. They married in California before the passage of Proposition 8. In November 2019, Dibble announced that a man whom Dibble had had an extramarital relationship with had allegedly attempted to blackmail him through revenge porn. Scott (1443) near the finish of a Minneapolis 10k race in 2016 Dibble is a runner and has completed several marathons.http://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio_personal.php?mem_id=1010&ls;=85&file;_to_display=/senators/60Dibble/bio/main_bio.htmhttps://www.athlinks.com/Result/Search?searchTerm=Scott%20Dibble References External links *Senator Scott Dibble official Minnesota Senate website *Minnesota Public Radio Vote Tracker: Sen.

The duo remain the only core members of the \\"band,\\" but they enlisted the help of guest musicians in the production of their critically acclaimed debut album, Awaken the Man, which was released by Zenwater Music/Digital Din on November 13, 2007. The album was written over a course of several years by Gollihur and Sager, which, as they state on their website, was a time of \\"great personal struggle and growth.\\" Indeed, most of the lyrical concepts on their debut release seem to deal with personal issues of self-discovery and redemption. Style The band's style, a blend of styles such as Symphonic rock, neo-prog, Album-oriented rock (AOR) and traditional Progressive rock, is heavily influenced by a large variety of progressive rock groups from both sides of the Atlantic and several decades, including the likes of Spock's Beard, Genesis, Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd, Dream Theater, Kansas and many more. Cover art for Awaken the Man Their music also leans heavily on another prog-rock mainstay: the long-format song. With multiple tracks on Awaken the Man surpassing 10 minutes in length, it is another aspect of their music that betrays their Art rock influences. Background Prior to the release of their album, the members of Din Within were relative unknowns; previously, Gollihur co-founded and performed with Second Story, a well-regarded female-fronted symfo group which created good regional buzz and strong critical reviews, but failed to capture commercial success. Both Josh and Mark also performed in several other progressive bands and other groups throughout their youth and early adulthood. Record and song releases A very early demo version of \\"Hey You (Part I)\\" appears on the benefit album The Tsunami Projekt; the song is largely the same but had the original programmed drum tracks and earlier takes of the vocals and guitar tracks rather than the more polished version found on the 2007 release. In 2012, a new tribute album to Yes, featuring \\"cover\\" versions from across the discography of the popular long-running band, featured Din Within's unique take on the song \\"Changes\\" (from 90125). Released by Mellow Records (Italy) in May 2012, it is a two-disc compilation featuring progressive rock bands from around the world.

Gameplay The player takes the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization thousands of light years from earth. The game, through a shifting perspective, contains action gameplay elements. When the game starts, the player has four lives. Gameplay involves navigating through a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors, and eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to complete the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. Some of these jumps require Dash to run. The player also has a limited oxygen supply. Dash can become invincible each stage by collecting ten stars. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have an overhead view, and include difficult block-moving puzzles that can fatally trap a player. There are also hidden and bonus rooms throughout the game. Reception Helium.com wrote that Dash Galaxy \\"had potential, but falls under its own weight in the end\\" while giving the game a score of 41%.

The best-known defender of the argument is C. S. Lewis. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, Miracles: A Preliminary Study. In the second edition of Miracles (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument. Contemporary defenders of the argument from reason include Alvin Plantinga, Victor Reppert and William Harker. The argument Metaphysical naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe. The argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible. According to Lewis, More precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows: > 1\\\\. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms > of nonrational causes. Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or \\"valid\\", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor‚Äôs dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor‚Äôs dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A‚Äôs reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference. > 2\\\\. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms > of nonrational causes. Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational. > 3\\\\. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred > (from 1 and 2). > 4\\\\. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally > inferred from good evidence. > 5\\\\. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept > naturalism.Adapted from Victor Reppert, author of C.S. Lewis's Dangerous > Idea, in his \\"The Argument from Reason and Lewis's Post-Anscombe Revision\\" In short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else. In some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states: > 1\\\\. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of > nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing > conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have > a source outside of nature. > 2\\\\. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational > credentials and would cease to be reason. > 3\\\\. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2). > 4\\\\. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself > rational (from 1 and 3). > 5\\\\. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some > further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on > forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non- > dependent source of human reason. > 6\\\\. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is > the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). > (Lewis, Miracles, chap. 4) Anscombe's criticism On 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe read a paper to the Oxford Socratic Club criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's Miracles. Her first criticism was against the use of the word \\"irrational\\" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article). Anscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between \\"valid\\" and \\"invalid\\" reasoning. She wrote: \\"What can you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?\\" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast \\"valid\\" and \\"invalid\\" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that \\"valid\\" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is \\"veridical\\", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes. Anscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms \\"why\\", \\"because\\", and \\"explanation\\", and that what counts as a \\"full\\" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31). In the context of ordinary life, \\"because he wants a cup of tea\\" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between \\"because\\" in the sense of physical causality, and \\"because\\" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument (this is the version described in this article).For Anscombe's critical appraisal of Lewis's revised argument from reason, see Elizabeth Anscombe, \\"C. S. Lewis's Rewrite of Chapter III of Miracles\\", in Roger White, Judith Wolfe, and Brendan N. Wolfe, eds., C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 15-23. More recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes.See, e.g., David Kyle Johnson, \\"Con: Naturalism Undefeated,\\" in Gregory Bassham, ed. C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 95-96. So-called \\"broad\\" naturalists that see consciousness as an \\"emergent\\" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.See, e.g., Charles Taliaferro, \\"On Naturalism,\\" in Robert MacSwain and Michael Wards, eds. The Cambridge Companion to C. S. Lewis. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 108. Other critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that \\"if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something‚Äîthen his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him\\" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the \\"veridicalness\\" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.  Criticism by eliminative materialists  The argument from reason claims that if beliefs, desires, and other contentful mental states cannot be accounted for in naturalism then naturalism is false. Eliminative materialism maintains that propositional attitudes such as beliefs and desires, among other intentional mental states that have content, cannot be explained on naturalism and therefore concludes that such entities do not exist. Even if successful, the argument from reason only rules out certain forms of naturalism and fails to argue against a conception of naturalism which accepts eliminative materialism to be the correct scientific account of human cognition.  Criticism by computationalists  Some people think it is easy to refute any argument from reason just by appealing to the existence of computers. Computers, according to the objection, reason, they are also undeniably a physical system, but they are also rational. So whatever incompatibility there might be between mechanism and reason must be illusory. Since computers do not operate on beliefs and desires and yet come to justified conclusions about the world as in object recognition or proving mathematical theorems, it should not be a surprise on naturalism that human brains can do the same. According to John Searle, computation and syntax are observer-relative but the cognition of the human mind is not observer-relative. Such a position seems to be bolstered by arguments from the indeterminacy of translation offered by Quine and Kripke's skeptical paradox regarding meaning which support the conclusion that the interpretation of algorithms is observer-relative. However, according to the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis the human brain is a computer and computationalism is a viable and developing research program in neuroscience for understanding how the brain works. Moreover, any indeterminacy of brain cognition does not entail human cognitive faculties are unreliable because natural selection has ensured they result in the survival of biological organisms, contrary to claims by the evolutionary argument against naturalism. Similar views by other thinkers Philosophers such as Victor Reppert,Victor Reppert, C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from Reason. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003; Victor Reppert, \\"The Argument from Reason Defended,\\" in Gregory Bassham, ed., C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 75-89. William HaskerWilliam Hasker, The Emergent Self. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999, chap. 3. and Alvin PlantingaAlvin Plantinga, Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, chap. 10. have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking. Lewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a \\"venerable philosophical chestnut.\\"C. S. Lewis, Collected Letters, vol. 2, Walter Hooper ed. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004, p. 715. Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., The Foundations of Belief, 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book Orthodoxy, in a chapter titled \\"The Suicide of Thought\\", he writes of the \\"great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself....It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, \\"Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?\\"G. K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy. New York: Image Books, 1959, p. 33. Similarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book St. Thomas Aquinas: \\"The Dumb Ox\\": > Thus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other > matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many > now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the > primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. > Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to > suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in > the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, > never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true > in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be > anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a > man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his > mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to > attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to > survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all > fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if > for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw > an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of > final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he > accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was > not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes > in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never > struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously > were no other philosophers to profess it.G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Aquinas: > The Dumb Ox. New York: Image Books, 1933, pp. 148-49. In Miracles, Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, Possible Worlds: \\"If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.\\"J. B. S. Haldane, Possible Worlds and Other Essays. London: Chatto & Windus, 1929, p. 209. Other versions of the argument from reason occur in C.E.M. Joad's Guide to Modern Philosophy (London: Faber, 1933, pp. 58‚Äì59), Richard Taylor's Metaphysics (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp. 104‚Äì05), and J. P. Moreland's Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3). Peter Kreeft used the argument from reason to create a formulation of the argument from consciousness for the existence of God. He phrased it as follows: #\\"We experience the universe as intelligible. This intelligibility means that the universe is graspable by intelligence.\\" #\\"Either this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence, or both intelligibility and intelligence are the products of blind chance.\\" #\\"Not blind chance.\\" #\\"Therefore this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence.\\" He used the argument from reason to affirm the third premise.

Precisely, it is the loop version of the Hilbert curve, and it may be thought as the union of four copies of the Hilbert curves combined in such a way to make the endpoints coincide. Because the Moore curve is plane-filling, its Hausdorff dimension is 2. The following figure shows the initial stages of the Moore curve: File:Moore-curve- stages-0-through-5.png  Representation as Lindenmayer system  The Moore curve can be expressed by a rewrite system (L-system). :Alphabet: L, R :Constants: F, +, ‚àí :Axiom: LFL+F+LFL :Production rules: : L -> ‚àíRF+LFL+FR‚àí : R -> +LF‚àíRFR‚àíFL+ Here, F means \\"draw forward\\", ‚àí means \\"turn left 90¬∞\\", and + means \\"turn right 90¬∞\\" (see turtle graphics).  Generalization to higher dimensions  Order 3 Moore curve in three dimensions There is an elegant generalization of the Hilbert curve to arbitrary higher dimensions. Traversing the polyhedron vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube in Gray code order produces a generator for the n-dimensional Hilbert curve. See MathWorld. To construct the order N Moore curve in K dimensions, you place 2^K copies of the order N-1 K-dimensional Hilbert curve at each corner of a K-dimensional hypercube, rotate them and connect them by line segments. The added line segments follow the path of an order 1 Hilbert curve. This construction even works for the order 1 Moore curve if you define the order 0 Hilbert curve to be a geometric point. It then follows that an order 1 Moore curve is the same as an order 1 Hilbert curve. To construct the order N Moore curve in three dimensions, you place 8 copies of the order N-1 3D Hilbert curve at the corners of a cube, rotate them and connect them by line segments.

Monte Hale was the voice of the Sounds' inaugural 1978 season. The Nashville Sounds Minor League Baseball team has played in Nashville, Tennessee, since its establishment in 1978. The team was created as an expansion team of the Double-A Southern League, but moved to the Triple-A American Association in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. In the history of the franchise, the Sounds have employed seven play-by-play announcers to provide running commentary for their games' radio broadcasts on thirteen radio stations. During the inaugural 1978 season, Sounds games were broadcast on WMTS by station owner Monte Hale, who also called football and basketball games for the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. WMTS, located some away in Murfreesboro, was selected because it was the only station to make a firm offer to purchase broadcasting rights. The team and station received numerous complaints from listeners who were unable to pick up the signal in Nashville and surrounding communities. In response, the team switched to WKDA, which had wider reception, in 1979. This was the first of many such times the team would switch stations to either broaden the reach of their broadcasts or for business reasons. Along with a new station for 1979, Bob Jamison of the International League's Richmond Braves was hired to announce games. He was behind the microphone for Nashville's 1979 and 1982 Southern League championship seasons. In 1980 and 1982, Jamison was recognized as the Southern League Broadcaster of the Year. He was also chosen to represent the American Association on the 1990 Triple-A All-Star Game broadcast team. Jamison served as the Sounds' play-by-play voice for 12 years until being hired to fill the same role with Major League Baseball's California Angels in 1991. The announcer's seat was then filled by Steve Carroll, who had spent the previous three seasons with the Southern League's Huntsville Stars. He helped call the 1994 Triple-A All-Star Game, which was held at Nashville's Herschel Greer Stadium. Carroll left to become the radio voice of the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers after the 1995 campaign. Steve Selby, another former Huntsville announcer, moved up to Nashville in 1996. Chuck Valenches, formerly an assistant broadcaster with Selby over the two previous seasons and of the Southern League's Jacksonville Suns for two years prior to that, was promoted to the lead role in 2000. He was the PCL's representative on the 2001 Triple-A All-Star Game broadcast team. Valenches called the Sounds' 2005 PCL championship season as well as two perfect games by Nashville pitchers: one by John Wasdin in 2003 and one by Manny Parra in 2007. Stu Paul, who had been with the Texas League's San Antonio Missions for nine seasons, was hired to call games beginning in 2010. Jeff Hem became the team's play-by-play announcer in 2012 after serving in the same capacity with the Midwest League's Kane County Cougars for seven seasons. He was on the call for the Sounds's final season at Greer Stadium in 2014 and their first season at First Tennessee Park in 2015. From 1978 to 1999, games were sporadically televised in the Nashville market. The first game to be shown live from Greer was the September 1, 1978, inaugural season home finale on WDCN. In 1979, five road games were scheduled for broadcast on WNGE. From 1982 to 1992, games occasionally aired on WZTV, including ten games in 1983 and 1984, eight games in 1987, and four games in 1988. WNPX broadcast five games in 1999. Excluding the 1979 season, when play-by-play commentary was handled by Dick Palmer, the Sounds' radio announcers also provided television commentary. As of 2019, all Sounds home and road games are broadcast on WNRQ-HD2 97.5 FM. Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the team's website and the MiLB First Pitch, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn apps. Games can be viewed through the MiLB.TV subscription feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball, with audio provided by a radio simulcast.

Funnel ball is a common playground game. American Playground Corporation A giant fiberglass or plastic funnel, roughly in diameter with a 45 degree pitch, is placed atop a post. The exits of the funnel are multiple holes or tubes, projected parallel to the ground, and spaced equally around the bottom. Play consists of tossing a ball (such as a basketball or small medicine ball) into the mouth of the funnel and waiting for it to exit through one of the holes. Each hole is marked with a point value, e.g. 2, 4, 6 and 8 points. The ball usually bounces around inside the funnel for a short time, making the outcome of the shot nearly random. Shots which exit through a desired hole are rare because they require incredible accuracy, and because the target is somewhat hidden. There is no formal score to which games are played, and games can be played with high score winner or low score winner. Both team and \\"every-player-for-themselves\\" games are commonplace.

It consists of twelve primary schools, three middle schools, two high schools, and an adult school.  History  The district itself was founded on March 20, 1893, with the first school opening in September of that year. Enrollment grew until it reached a peak of 15,576 students in 1967. Afterwards, enrollment declined sharply, forcing the district to close many schools. Enrollment was at its lowest in 1989 with only 7,452 students.Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School Website - History Retrieved March 1, 2008 Jordan Middle School was reopened when enrollment increased again. Barron Park Elementary School was added in 1998, and Terman Middle School was reopened in 2001. In 2013 the district had 12,268 students. All district schools were closed on March 16, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A plan passed on September 29, 2020 to reopen elementary schools on October 12, and high schools on January 7, 2021, caused widespread debate, including criticism from teachers and staff citing safety concerns. =Cluster suicide= Palo Alto high schools received national attention in 2009 after five of its students committed suicide over a span of nine months, mainly by walking in front of trains at a local crossing. As a result, steps have been taken to limit access to the tracks. Attempts have since been made to try to improve the emotional health of students attending the schools. , cluster suicide has remained a problem in the district's high schools. In February 2016, a team of suicide prevention specialists from Epidemiologic Assistance (Epi-Aids) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) paid a two-week visit to the area to determine risk factors. In July 2016, the Epi-Aids team released preliminary findings.  High schools  = Gunn High School = Gunn High School Henry M. Gunn High School is one of two public high schools in Palo Alto. The school is named after Henry M. Gunn (1898‚Äì1988), who served as the Palo Alto superintendent from 1950‚Äì1961. During his tenure he saw the district expand from 5,500 students to 14,000, adding 17 new schools, and is credited with the establishment of De Anza College and Foothill College, two local community colleges. In 1964, the Palo Alto Unified School District announced it would name its third high school after him. Its first class graduated in 1966. The school's mascot is Timmy the Titan. The student newspaper is The Oracle, part of the High School National Ad Network. There is an internal student-run television news show called theTitan Broadcast Network. = Palo Alto High School = Palo Alto High School Palo Alto Senior High School, known locally as Paly, is among the oldest high schools in the region. Founded in 1898, its enrollment today is over 1700 students. \\"Paly\\", as the school is known locally, draws high-achieving and scholastically-minded students due to the demographics of its location in the heart of Silicon Valley and its proximity to Stanford University. In 2002 Newsweek ranked it among the top 200 public high schools, based on test scores. In 2007 U.S. News & World Report ranked it #85 out of over 18,000 public high schools. Palo Alto High also carries on a distinguished athletic tradition, marked in recent years by a rivalry with crosstown foe Gunn. Titles won by teams from Paly include California State Championships in Boys Varsity Basketball in 1993 (during which the team went undefeated) and 2006, and a California State Championship in Football in 2010 (as well as CCS Championships in 2006 and 2007). The Paly Girls Varsity Volleyball team won back-to-back state championships in 2010 and 2011. Palo Alto High School also received a multimillion-dollar performing arts center, officially opening on October 1, 2016.  Middle schools  = Greene Middle School = Greene Middle School Frank S. Greene Middle School, formerly David S. Jordan Middle School, is located at 750 N. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94303. The school mascot is the jaguar. The 2018‚Äì19 school year had 1,050 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 40% Caucasian, 30% Asian, 14% Hispanic, 2% African American, and 13% Other (including multiple races). Named after Stanford University president David Starr Jordan, Jordan Middle School was founded in 1937. It was closed in 1985 due to lack of enrollment in the district, then reopened in 1991 after remodeling. A bond was approved by the city of Palo Alto in 1995 to allow for further technological upgrades to the school. The school mascot from 1937‚Äì1985 was a dolphin. When Jordan reopened in 1991, the students voted to have the jaguar become the mascot. In 1999, the students voted to have the dolphin returned to its status as co-mascot with the jaguar. Due to Jordan's involvement in eugenics, the school was renamed Frank Greene Middle School beginning in the 2018‚Äì2019 school year, after venture capitalist Frank S. Greene Jr. = J. L. Stanford Middle School = J. L. Stanford Middle School Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School, formerly Ray Lyman Wilbur Junior High School and known locally as JLS, is located at 480 East Meadow Dr., Palo Alto, CA 94306. The school mascot is the panther. The 2018‚Äì19 school year had 1,137 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 44% Asian, 32% Caucasian, 12% Hispanic, 1% African American, and 11% Other (including multiple races). The land that Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School and the adjoining Fairmeadow Elementary School now sit on were once owned by three farmers. The farmers sold their land to real estate developer Joseph Eichler, who later donated the land to the district. Founded in 1953, the school was originally named after Ray Lyman Wilbur, one of the early presidents of Stanford University. After Jordan Middle School closed due to lack of enrollment in 1985, the two schools were merged at the Wilbur school location and it was renamed Jane Lathrop Stanford after Jane Stanford, the wife of Stanford University founder Leland Stanford. = Fletcher Middle School = Fletcher Middle School Ellen T. Fletcher Middle School, formerly Terman Middle School, is located at 655 Arastradero Road in Palo Alto. The school mascot is the tiger. The 2018‚Äì19 school year had 668 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 38% Asian, 30% White, 16% Hispanic, 12% Two or More Races, 1% Black and 1% Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander. The original name of the school located on the site was Terman Junior High School (named after Lewis Madison Terman), unrelated to the school currently at the site. It was closed in 1978 due to declining enrollment in the district. The district placed a new middle school named Terman Middle School at the site in 1999 to deal with rising enrollment. The first school year was 2001‚Äì2002. The new school was named after both Terman and his son Frederick Terman, a Silicon Valley pioneer. The relocation was met with great controversy by local residents as the district sought to potentially overtake the land by eminent domain from the residing Jewish Community Center. As a result, land from the Cubberley Community Center was instead traded for the land the district needed at Terman. The JCC continued to lease district land at Cubberley until it made other plans. Beginning in the 2018‚Äì2019 school year the school was renamed Ellen T. Fletcher Middle School after a Palo Alto city councilwoman because the elder Terman, like David Starr Jordan, espoused eugenics.
