The archaeological assemblage identified with this culture is related to the finds from the middle Volga and Kama basin, indicating that they originated from the east. Volosovo culture emerged sometime between the third and fourth millennium B.C. and lasted until the second millennium BC. A more specific estimate was the period between 1800 and 1500 BC, overlapping with the Early Bronze Age Fatyanovo culture. The people of the Volosovo culture has been described as forest foragers.  Discovery  The Volosovo culture was discovered in the 1900s. Like other groups with forest origin such as the Garin-Bor and other northern cultures, the Volosovo lived in the forest steppes of the Volga-Ural region, particularly the area of the present-day Samara oblast. Specific sites include those in central Russia, the Middle and Lower Oka, Lower Kama, and Middle Volga. The culture also inhabited the Veletma River area adjacent to Murom, a city that is part of Vladimir Oblast. The Veletma River site was excavated from 1877 to 1928. Since the discovery of the Volosovo culture, it has been investigated extensively but it remains controversial due to some unresolved aspects, particularly the chronology of its history, cultural attributes, origin, and ethnic affiliations. For example, it was believed that Volosovo was a separate cultural entity but other studies show that it is related to cultures associated with the Volga and Kama basin. The habitations of the Volosovo culture were often found within the vicinity of lakes and rivers such as the Oka River.  Characteristics  The stone and ceramic artifacts that are used to describe the Volosovo culture were from the semisubterranean dwellings, which are often situated in river floors and within the area of lakes. These dwellings have lower and upper cultural layers. The artifacts found in the lower layer indicates a cultural affinity with the Russian Pit- marked Pottery culture called Balakhna. The upper level, which is considered the actual Volosovo phase, included ceramics that were distinct from the pit- marked pottery as well as those attributed to contemporaneous cultures such as the Fatyanovo culture. Based on excavated artifacts, the Volosovo culture first used stones and bone tools and were particularly adept at bone carving and sculpture. A small art emerged, one that has been considered rich and diverse as demonstrated by the varied flaked flint sculptures that represented the human form. This phenomenon was distinguished from what manifested in the Tokareva culture. The culture transitioned out of the Neolithic Age and abandoned its stone and bone technologies after learning early metal working. Later in its development, an early form of agriculture emerged with evidence of domestic animals. Discovered cranial and long bones of a primitive turbary dog, for example, showed improved animal breeding. However, the culture still favored foraging, hunting, and fishing. It is suggested that there emerged an animal cult among the Volosovo population after 1500 BCE as evidenced by the use of animal teeth and bones on ornaments such as necklaces. According to this theory, bears were worshiped for their power while dogs and pigs were revered for their economic value. A late Volosovo culture emerged later on and this phase was associated with the sites located in the upper Volodary and Panfilovo.  Cultural contacts  There is evidence that the Volosovo culture had extensive contacts with other cultures such as the Balanovo culture, a group considered to be the metal-working aspect of the eastern Fatyanovo. This is also demonstrated by the existence of Fatyanovo ceramics in Volosovo sites as well as the discovery of Volosovo ceramics in Fatyanovo graves. Evidence showed that the late Volosovo phase also had extensive contact with the Abashevo population, helping spread cattle-breeding economies as well as metallurgy among the northern forest cultures. There were also Volosovo populations that were absorbed into the Abashevo culture before 2500 BCE while others were moving north. The Volosovo people also maintained contacts with linguistic relatives who settled in Finland and Russian Karelia as well as Proto-Baltic speakers, who were later absorbed into the culture. Genetics A genetic study published at bioRxiv in July 2020 examined the remains of a male (BER001) ascribed to the Volosovo culture or Lyalovo culture buried near Yaroslavl, Russia ca. 4,300 BC. He was determined to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup Q-L54 and the maternal haplogroup K. Haplogroup Q-L54 has earlier been found among Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHGs). The examined individual was found to be closely related to EHGs and previous hunter- gatherers of the Veretye culture. He was determined to have had brown eyes and black or brown hair. The examined Volosovo/Lyalovo individual was determined to be genetically significantly different from peoples of the succeeding Fatyaonovo culture, with whom they do not appear to have mixed, suggesting that the demise of the Volosovo culture was caused by a rapid migration of peoples with steppe ancestry from the south-west.

Prior to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, women were not permitted to practice law in the United Kingdom. By 1931 there were around 100 female solicitors. The first female-only law partnership was founded in 1933. By 2019 51% of British solicitors were women. Background thumb Eliza Orme was the first woman in the United Kingdom to obtain a law degree, in 1888. In 1892 Cornelia Sorabji became the first woman to study law at Oxford University. Barristers The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1919. The next day Helena Normanton became the first woman to join an Inns of Court. In 1903 Bertha Cave applied to join Gray's Inn; the application was ultimately rejected. In 1913 the Law Society refused to allow women to take legal exams; this was challenged in the Court of Appeal in the case of Bebb v The Law Society, where the Law Society's stance was upheld. The plaintiff in that case was Gwyneth Bebb, who was expected to be the first female to be called to the bar but died before that could happen. In 1922 Ivy Williams was the first woman called to the bar (although she never practiced), and Helena Normanton became the first practising female barrister in the UK. In September 2018 a barristers' chambers was renamed in her honour. Williams was also the first woman to teach law at an English university, whilst Normanton, along with Rose Heilbron, were the first two female barristers to be appointed Kings Counsel, in 1949. Heibron was also the first woman to achieve a first class honours degree in law at the University of Liverpool (in 1935), England's first woman judge as Recorder of Burnley (in 1956), the first woman to sit as a judge in the Old Bailey (in 1972), the second female High Court judge (in 1974), and the first woman Presiding Judge of any Circuit when she became Presiding Judge on the Northern Circuit (in 1978). Elizabeth Lane became the first female County Court judge, and the first English High Court judge. In 2002 the Law Society appointed its first female President, Carolyn Kirby. In 2017 Baroness Hale became the first female president of the Supreme Court. Solicitors In 1922 Carrie Morrison, Mary Pickup, Mary Sykes, and Maud Crofts became the first women in England to qualify as solicitors; Morrison was the first of them admitted as a solicitor. In 2010, a report by The Lawyer found that 22 per cent of partners at the UK’s top 100 firms were women; a follow-up report in 2015 found that figure had not changed. Since 2014, a number of large corporate firms of solicitors have set gender diversity targets to increase the percentage of women within their partnerships.

On 3 March 1903, Cave applied to become the first female member of the Gray's Inn to allow her to be called to the bar. She was mistakenly accepted which was soon changed and she was rejected on the basis of her gender. Cave appealed and in December of the same year, the case was heard, in proceedings that lasted 10 minutes, in the House of Lords. It was argued that women \\"were under a disability by reason of their sex\\". Again, she was unsuccessful, however, undeterred she continued her campaign alongside Christabel Pankhurst. In November 1904 she attempted to represent her father in court (regarding non-payment of a bicycle) however, objections were raised regarding her gender and she was forced to move from the counsel benches.

The sea port is located in Dili, the capital of Timor- Leste. The port sits in the Banda Sea. The site was chosen because of a reef along the perimeter, which provides natural protection. Protection of this kind is crucial for seaports located in South East Asia during monsoon season.  Capacity The ANL Timor Trader in Dili harbour The seaport is relatively small, with a maximum capacity of three vessels, as the port spans 280 meters. Two roll-on/roll-off ramps exist in the seaport- one on the east end and the other on the west end. The small size of the seaport limits maritime traffic. Container storage is limited to only 1,000 containers. The main method for loading and unloading containers is cranes operated by private companies. Plans to increase the capacity for shipping containers have been created and as of January 2014, construction was underway to add storage 9 kilometers away. Concerns  Concerns have been raised by the government about the port's capacity and maintenance. Maintenance, management manuals, and routine port checks are nonexistent. Staff size, experience and budget are not sufficient. Accident records are not available. The government pushed the port to establish a record of incidents. Government officials, especially former prime minister Dr. Mari Alkatiri, are concerned with how sea level rise (SLR) will affect the port. Another concern is that SLR causes flooding to a great portion of the island. Studies are attempting to establish effects on the port, but information and data are lacking. Operations Entrance to the port for vessels is restricted to 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The wharves, port gates, and empty containers are operational 24 hours a day. Theoretically, the sea port has the capacity to import and export 120,000 TEU/Year, but maintenance needs must be addressed first. The last records taken in 2012 have 258,782 containers passing in or out. The government has begun to focus on the improvements and plans to expand to 282,816/day containers. The Dili port experiences delays of up to 10 days for commercial container ships.  Planned improvements  To solve the problems of congestion, the government plans to * Improve the management of cargo ships by utilizing the quayside, as loading and unloading cargo ships takes more time than passenger vessels. * Increase the space of the shipping-container yard to allow for an increase of storage space for containers. * Implement night-time operation for both the general cargo and container areas. * Coordinate general cargo and passenger loading and unloading. * Establish the west end as the ferry and passenger area, and the east side to general cargo and container operations. * Improve security by constructing fencing, CCTV camera systems, security lighting, clocking systems and passenger scanners.http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12146866.pdf Progress In June 2016, the government signed an agreement with the Bolloré Group, to rebuild the port. The deal consists of a 30-year contract worth $490 million, the largest investment in Timor-Leste in history. Plans include constructing a new port in Tibar Bay that is capable of processing 350,000 TEUs yearly. Details include a 630-meter wharf, 15-meter draft and a 29-hectare container yard. Timor-Leste also contracted with China Harbour Engineering Company to construct the Dili port. This contract marked the first Public Private Partnership (PPP) Arrangementfor the government. Construction of the seaport started on June 14, 2017, and is set to be completed by the end of 2020. Once completed, the Dili sea port is projected to make the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste a position of relatively high income by 2030.

It is a compendium game based on four variations of Sixty-Six and is usually played by four players, although three may also play.  History, distribution and name  The rules of the game were published in 1981 by Weickmann and, more recently, in 2012 by Bamberger, but Schem recalls playing it in the late 1950s and early 1960s with his friends by the fishpond of the Würzburger Fischhäusla in Fürth, Bavaria.

Cards  The game is traditionally played with a pack of 24 Franconian-pattern, German-suited cards comprising, in ascending order: Nine, Unter, Ober, King, Ten and Ace (Sow). The four suits are Acorns, Leaves, Hearts and Bells.  Rules  There are typically four different sub- games within each game round that are played nauf und noo, i.e. first in the normal order, then in reverse. They are intended to represent games from Germany, Russia, England and Africa, respectively, although Cameroon is probably of German origin. The following rules are based on Bamberger (2012) except where stated:  Contracts  There are 4 sub-games - Sixty-Six, Red Ace, Call A Card and Cameroon - which are played first in that order and then in the reverse order to produce a game with 2 rounds of 4 sub-games each. * Sixty-Six (Sechsundsechzig): After shuffling and cutting, each player is dealt 6 cards (3 + 3) and the dealer reveals the bottom card of the pack for trumps. Thus the dealer automatically gains a trump. Players must follow suit, trump and overtrump if possible. * Ace of Hearts (Herz Ass) or Red Sow (Rot-Sau): Played as for Sixty-Six above but, after dealing, the player with the Red Sow (i.e. Ace of Hearts) chooses trumps. The other 2 or 3 players then form a team and play together as 'defenders' against the player who declared the trump suit. Players do not 'go out' on reaching 66, but play to the end. The player with the Red Sow may pass if his hand is too poor, conceding 2 points to each other player. If he scores over 66 card points, he earns 3 game points; if over 33 but under 66; he gets nothing and all the others get 1 game point each. * Call A Card (Rufen): After receiving the first three cards, forehand deal must, after viewing them, call another card, the 'called card' (Ruf) to form a team with the player who holds that card, who must play it to the first trick; forehand must therefore have, and lead with, a trump. At the same time this determines the trump suit. The other two players also form a team. If the caller calls himself, he plays solo against the other three. If three play, the 3rd player has to play solo against the caller and called player. Players can 'go out' on reaching 66. * Cameroon (Kamerun): This is a Ramsch where everyone plays for himself, the aim being to win the fewest card points. No trumps. Suit must be followed and players must head the trick if possible. Only if unable to do either may they play a card of a different suit (as high as possible). Card points are totted up and the player with the fewest earns 3 game points; the next player, two, and the third, one. A player with a strong hand may announce a 'march' (Durchmarsch), a bid to win all six tricks and 3 game points. If he loses, the others get 3 each.  Scoring  Each player starts each sub-game with 7 points recorded as a Roman numeral XII chalked up on a slate for each player. As players scored points the strokes (Striche) are erased: first the middle of the X is erased, leaving 6 strokes; then each of the arms of the X, followed by the two Is. At the end of each deal, the player with the most card points scores 3 game points and erases 3 strokes (or e.g. the centre of the cross plus 2 arms); the player who came second earns 2 game points; the third player 1 game point and the fourth, none.  Going out  When a player reaches 7 points he has won and sits out while the rest continue. When certain sub-games are down to two players, minor changes are required to the rules as follows: * Sixty-Six: Played as above, but using the talon (Haifler i.e. Häufchen). The bottom card of the talon determines trumps and is placed under the talon, half-visible; it may be 'robbed' with the trump 9. As in normal Sixty-Six, players may play any card until the talon is exhausted. When three are left, their aim continues to be to win the most card points, the winner erasing 2 strokes and the 2nd player, one. With two players left, a win scores 1 game point. * Red Sow: If a player has the red Sow, he need not announce trumps immediately, but must play it (and specify trumps) no later than the third trick. If no player has the red Ace, they play without trumps until one of them draws it from the Haifler. If it does not surface after the first 3 tricks, the Haifler is turned over so everyone can see the next card to be drawn. * Call A Card: When two are left, the non-dealer calls trumps after receiving the first 3 cards.  Winning  In each sub-game, when three players have reached 7 points, the remaining player is the loser and receives a 'blob' (Bolln) by his name on the slate. In some cases e.g. Cameroon there may be more than one loser. The overall game winner is the player (or players) with the fewest blobs. In a Neustadt variant, the winner of each game receives a blob and the first to seven is the overall winner. But they acknowledge that sometimes the aim is to win the fewest blobs.  Variants  Schem names other contracts - Farbensammeln (\\"Suit Collecting\\"), Grünassen (\\"Green Ace\\") and Dreck (\\"mud\\", \\"dirt\\") - alongside the usual Rotassen (\\"Red Ace\\") and Sechsundsechzig (\\"Sixty-Six\\"), but does not describe them.

Built in 1885 on the site of an earlier church which had been constructed in 1857, it was designed by Henry Ward (1854–1927), who was responsible for many of the key buildings in the town of Hastings, not least the Town Hall. The building, a \\"large urban ... church with richly detailed exteriors and interiors\\", is situated between Robertson Street and Cambridge Road and has a split-level arrangement with part of the gallery occupying a flying freehold over the alleyway adjacent to the entrance on Robertson Street. The church is listed at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. A declining congregation and the cost of maintaining the building forced the church to close in 2012. It was acquired by a Pentecostal Christian group, who had outgrown their church premises elsewhere in the borough, and is still an active place of worship with the name His Place Church.  Founding and Dedication  Original URC building viewed from Cambridge Road The church was founded by Daniel Smith in 1856 who carried out much evangelical work around the town. A Gothic Revival-style building on the site was the congregation's original chapel. The Rev. C. New, one of the most important figures in Hastings' Congregationalist community at the time, was instrumental in getting a new church funded and built after the congregation had out-grown the original building and extensive repairs were required in any case. The construction contract was put out to tender; bids ranged from £6,526 to £8,240, and the chosen contractor was John Howell with a bid of £7,090. In order to permit the expansion, the property next-door to the church had also been purchased. Whilst the congregation had no church to worship in, services were held at various locations throughout the town, including The Gaiety Theatre and Hastings Pier pavilion. The Memorial stone was laid on 11 September 1884 at 3:30pm, with a large crowd of people, mainly members of the congregation and worthies such as the Mayor, Alderman Thorpe and a number of Pastors and Ministers of surrounding churches. When the time came to lay the stone, one of the leading Congregationalists of the time, Mr Spicer was presented with a silver trowel to lay the stone. He then declared \\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I declare this stone well and truly laid\\". The stone was laid on the Cambridge Road side of the building and reads \\"This stone was laid by James Spicer Esq. J.P., of Woodford on September 11, 1884. Rev. Charles New, Minister. H. Ward Architect. John Howell & Son, builders.Hastings and St Leonards Observer - Saturday 13 September 1884 p6 The new building was dedicated on 7 October 1885 in a service that was presided over by the Rev. C. New with a large number of both Congregationalist and local dignitaries present. Associated chapels Rev. New founded other Congregational chapels during his ministry. The present Sedlescombe United Reformed Church and the former Robertsbridge United Reformed Church opened in 1879 and 1881 respectively in the villages of Sedlescombe and Robertsbridge, north of Hastings. The chapel at Robertsbridge maintained links with the Robertson Street church for much of the 20th century.  Decline and Recovery  In 1943, total number of church-members had fallen to 238. At services conducted by the Rev. A. E. Gould, in December 1944 there were only 65 attending the morning service and 42 the evening. The Reverend accepted a call to the ministry and was inducted in March 1945. Over the course of just under ten years, he had attracted nearly 400 new members which was reflected in the church roll exceeding 400 by 1955. During the course of the Rev. Gould's ministry, the church raised £1000 to install replacement electric lighting in 1948, marketing events in advertisements as \\"The church with a great past invites you to help equip it for a greater future\\".Hastings and St Leonards Observer - Saturday 18 September 1948 Gould was succeeded in 1955 by Rev. Charles A Haig. In the years that followed, the church became a centre of evangelism, with particular credit being given to the quality of its youth and children's work, under the guidance of Kay Mozely. In 1978, the Rev. Brian Bowyer came to the church and was able to see the church through difficult days when major faults were discovered in the roof. For a long while, the sanctuary was closed, with the congregation worshipping in the church hall below. A mammoth fundraising effort saw the roof repaired in time for a wedding within the church family to take place in the sanctuary as planned. A ministry team was then developed for the area and different ministries developed. However, the local churches reflected the national trend of declining numbers, and new patterns of providing ministry for the area were constantly being sought.  Further decline and closure  The membership of Robertson Street fell from 42 in January 2010 to 28 at the time of closure in December 2012, mainly as a result of deaths. From January 2012, the congregation began exploring its future, ahead of the Local Mission & Ministry Review (LMMR) process due to take place later in the year. Given that the prospects of receiving a minister were slim (due to demands on URC ministry at this time), that there were major problems with the building which would be expensive to make good, and that there were three other URCs in the town as well as churches of other denominations – all of whom would welcome new faces – the congregation began to question whether the best move might well be to disperse as a fellowship and enrich the lives of other churches through the injection of new members. The path towards closure was first chosen on 21 September 2012 and confirmed on 30 November of the same year. In its time, Robertson Street URC was an engine for evangelism; it hosted meetings of the local committee of the London Missionary Society as well as the Hastings Council of Churches. Robertson Street URC closed on 30 December 2012. The church was registered in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855; its number on the register was 28925. It was also registered for the solemnisation of marriages on 18 April 1887. Until its closure, Robertson Street United Reformed Church was in that denomination's Southern Synod, one of 13 Synods in Great Britain. As of 2010 the Synod was responsible for 168 United Reformed churches in southeast England, including Robertson Street and three others in the Borough of Hastings: Clive Vale, St Luke's and St Mark's.  Re-opening - His Place  Since 2014, the building has been owned by His Place Church under the Reverend Chris Sears, His Place having outgrown its existing premises at Duke Road which had been its base for 19 years. £35,000 was spent on roof repairs and fund-raising continues to permit repair of many parts of the building. Current usages alongside the church include a cafe, a theatre, a 'safe space', mental health support groups and many other community groups. = Repairs required = The windows and stonework, together with ironwork require repairs costing in excess of £750,000 with additional repairs needed to the Robertson Street entrance. Much of the interior finish has been damaged due to damp ingress (both from the roof which has now been repaired, and leaking/insufficient number of gutters and downpipes). Fund-raising is continuing, both by means of 'sponsorship' of individual building elements and on-going events within the building. Curved Pews at Robertson Street Congregational Church  Opus Theatre  In addition to the usage as a place of worship the venue is also utilised as a theatre - the Opus Theatre under the direction of Polo Piatti. With the horseshoe shaped auditorium providing excellent acoustics. In addition, the venue is utilised for lectures and other events  Architecture of the building  The church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 20 January 2010; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". The building is constructed of coursed ragstone with ashlar and probably terracotta dressings. The doors are made of Oak on both the Cambridge Road and Robertson Street aspects. The Robertson Street entrance has steps carved out of York Stone. A monumental staircase extends up from the Robertson Street entrance after passing a hall which is currently used as a cafeteria. A rear stair and stairs with wrought iron balustrades lead into the horseshoe shaped gallery which repeats the curved pews with under-pew heating. In total there was seating for 1100 people. It was planned that the basement (which was subdivided into a deacon's vestry, the minister's vestry, the choir vestry, a general vestry, a large hall and lavatoriesHastings and St Leonards Observer - Saturday 10 October 1885 p 5) could be utilised by the Young Mens Christian Association in addition to providing classrooms and meeting rooms.  Interior Finishes  The galleries, pews, ceiling and roof were made out of pitch pine, with the walls being finished utilising Parian cement (a fast drying cement with borax added to the mix).Hastings and St Leonards Observer - Saturday 19 July 1884 p7 At the time of dedication, the church was the only non-conformist place of worship lit by electricity. Console of Organ  Organ  The church features a Forster and Andrews two console organ with highly ornamented pipes mounted unusually above the altar behind the minister. It was later overhauled by Morgan and Smith. Some pipes are currently stored laying down due to deterioration in the mountings and other stops are believed to be inoperable.Visit to site and discussions with current owners See also *List of places of worship in Hastings * References Bibliography * * External links *His Place Church Website.

Paladino attended the College of the City of New York. In 1937, he joined Local 91 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. He soon became the representative of the local, and received a union scholarship to study economics at Harvard University. In 1958, he was appointed as assistant manager of Local 91, then in 1959 he was transferred to Local 25 on what was described as a \\"special assignment. In 1960 the AFL-CIO asked him to undertake a special assignment, travelling around Brazil. In 1961, Paladino was appointed as Director of Education for the ICFTU Inter American Regional Organisation of Workers, then in 1962 he became its assistant general secretary and director of organization. In 1964, he moved to become deputy assistant director of the American Institute for Free Labor Development, with responsibility for planning and organization. In 1967, Paladino was appointed as assistant general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), with the strong support of AFL-CIO President, George Meany. He was given charge of the Department of Organization, with responsibility for relationships with the international trade secretariats, vocational training and co-operative enterprises. In 1970, the AFL-CIO withdrew from the ICFTU, and Paladino resigned his post, instead becoming director of the Asian-American Free Labor Institute. He retired in 1985, and died in 1991. Philip Agee alleged that Paladino worked as a Central Intelligence Agency agent while holding his labor movement posts.

It allows ANNs to be studied using theoretical tools from Kernel Methods. For most common neural network architectures, in the limit of large layer width the NTK becomes constant. This enables simple closed form statements to be made about neural network predictions, training dynamics, generalization, and loss surfaces. For example, it guarantees that wide enough ANNs converge to a global minimum when trained to minimize an empirical loss. The NTK of large width networks is also related to several other large width limits of neural networks. The NTK was introduced in 2018 by Arthur Jacot, Franck Gabriel and Clément Hongler. It was also implicit in some contemporaneous work.  Definition   Scalar output case  An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with scalar output consists in a family of functions f\\\\left(\\\\cdot,\\\\theta\\\\right):\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} parametrized by a vector of parameters \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{P}. The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is a kernel \\\\Theta:\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} defined by\\\\Theta\\\\left(x,y;\\\\theta\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{p=1}^{P}\\\\partial_{\\\\theta_{p}}f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\partial_{\\\\theta_{p}}f\\\\left(y;\\\\theta\\\\right).In the language of kernel methods, the NTK \\\\Theta is the kernel associated with the feature map \\\\left(x\\\\mapsto\\\\partial_{\\\\theta_{p}}f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\right)_{p=1,\\\\ldots,P}.  Vector output case  An ANN with vector output of size n_{\\\\mathrm{out}} consists in a family of functions f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\right):\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}} parametrized by a vector of parameters \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{P}. In this case, the Neural Tangent Kernel \\\\Theta:\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{M}_{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}}\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right) is a matrix-valued kernel, with values in the space of n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}\\\\times n_{\\\\mathrm{out}} matrices, defined by\\\\Theta_{k,l}\\\\left(x,y;\\\\theta\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{p=1}^{P}\\\\partial_{\\\\theta_{p}}f_{k}\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\partial_{\\\\theta_{p}}f_{l}\\\\left(y;\\\\theta\\\\right).  Derivation  When optimizing the parameters \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{P} of an ANN to minimize an empirical loss through gradient descent, the NTK governs the dynamics of the ANN output function f_{\\\\theta} throughout the training.  Scalar output case  For a dataset \\\\left(x_{i}\\\\right)_{i=1,\\\\ldots,n}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}} with scalar labels \\\\left(z_{i}\\\\right)_{i=1,\\\\ldots,n}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R} and a loss function c:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, the associated empirical loss, defined on functions f:\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, is given by\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\left(f\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c\\\\left(f\\\\left(x_{i}\\\\right),z_{i}\\\\right).When training the ANN f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\right):\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is trained to fit the dataset (i.e. minimize \\\\mathcal{C}) via continuous-time gradient descent, the parameters \\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)_{t\\\\geq0} evolve through the ordinary differential equation: :\\\\partial_{t}\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)=- abla\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\left(f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\right). During training the ANN output function follows an evolution differential equation given in terms of the NTK: :\\\\partial_{t}f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\Theta\\\\left(x,x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\partial_{w}c\\\\left(w,z_{i}\\\\right)\\\\Big_{w=f\\\\left(x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)}. This equation shows how the NTK drives the dynamics of f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right) in the space of functions \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} during training.  Vector output case  For a dataset \\\\left(x_{i}\\\\right)_{i=1,\\\\ldots,n}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}} with vector labels \\\\left(z_{i}\\\\right)_{i=1,\\\\ldots,n}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}} and a loss function c:\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, the corresponding empirical loss on functions f:\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}} is defined by\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\left(f\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c\\\\left(f\\\\left(x_{i}\\\\right),z_{i}\\\\right).The training of f_{\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)} through continuous-time gradient descent yields the following evolution in function space driven by the NTK:\\\\partial_{t}f_{k}\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}}\\\\Theta_{k,l}\\\\left(x,x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\partial_{w_{l}}c\\\\left(\\\\left(w_{1},\\\\ldots,w_{n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}}\\\\right),z_{i}\\\\right)\\\\Big_{w=f\\\\left(x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)}. = Interpretation = The NTK \\\\Theta\\\\left(x,x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right) represents the influence of the loss gradient \\\\partial_{w}c\\\\left(w,z_{i}\\\\right)\\\\big_{w=f\\\\left(x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right)} with respect to example i on the evolution of ANN output f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\right) through a gradient descent step: in the scalar case, this readsf\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\left(t+\\\\epsilon\\\\right)\\\\right)-f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\approx\\\\epsilon\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\Theta\\\\left(x,x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\partial_{w}c\\\\left(w,z_{i}\\\\right)\\\\big_{w=f\\\\left(x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right)}.In particular, each data point x_{i} influences the evolution of the output f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta\\\\right) for each x throughout the training, in a way that is captured by the NTK \\\\Theta\\\\left(x,x_{i};\\\\theta\\\\right).  Large-width limit  Recent theoretical and empirical work in Deep Learning has shown the performance of ANNs to strictly improve as their layer widths grow larger. For various ANN architectures, the NTK yields precise insight into the training in this large-width regime.  Wide fully-connected ANNs have a deterministic NTK, which remains constant throughout training  Consider an ANN with fully-connected layers \\\\ell=0,\\\\ldots,L of widths n_{0}=n_{\\\\mathrm{in}},n_{1},\\\\ldots,n_{L}=n_{\\\\mathrm{out}}, so that f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\right)=R_{L-1}\\\\circ\\\\cdots\\\\circ R_{0}, where R_{\\\\ell}=\\\\sigma\\\\circ A_{\\\\ell} is the composition of an affine transformation A_{i} with the pointwise application of a nonlinearity \\\\sigma:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, where \\\\theta parametrizes the maps A_{0},\\\\ldots,A_{L-1}. The parameters \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{P} are initialized randomly, in an independent identically distributed way. The scale of the NTK as the widths grow is affected by the exact parametrization of the A_{i}'s and by the initialization of the parameters. This motivates the so-called NTK parametrization A_{\\\\ell}\\\\left(x\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n_{\\\\ell}}}W^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)}x+b^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)}. This parametrization ensures that if the parameters \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{P} are initialized as standard normal variables, the NTK has a finite nontrivial limit. In the large-width limit, the NTK converges to a deterministic (non- random) limit \\\\Theta_{\\\\infty}, which stays constant in time. The NTK \\\\Theta_{\\\\infty} is explicitly given by \\\\Theta_{\\\\infty}=\\\\Theta^{\\\\left(L\\\\right)}, where \\\\Theta^{\\\\left(L\\\\right)} is determined by the set of recursive equations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Theta^{\\\\left(1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) &= \\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{1}{n_{\\\\mathrm{in}}}x^{T}y+1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Theta^{\\\\left(\\\\ell+1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) &=\\\\Theta^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)\\\\dot{\\\\Sigma}^{\\\\left(\\\\ell+1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)+\\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(\\\\ell+1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(\\\\ell+1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) &= L_{\\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)}}^{\\\\sigma}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\Sigma}^{\\\\left(\\\\ell+1\\\\right)}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right) &= L_{\\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)}}^{\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}}, \\\\end{align} where L_{K}^{f} denotes the kernel defined in terms of the Gaussian expectation: :L_{K}^{f}\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)=\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\left(X,Y\\\\right)\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left(0,\\\\begin{pmatrix}K\\\\left(x,x\\\\right) & K\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ K\\\\left(y,x\\\\right) & K\\\\left(y,y\\\\right) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right)}\\\\left[f\\\\left(X\\\\right)f\\\\left(Y\\\\right)\\\\right]. In this formula the kernels \\\\Sigma^{\\\\left(\\\\ell\\\\right)} are the so-called activation kernels of the ANN.  Wide fully connected networks are linear in their parameters throughout training  The NTK describes the evolution of neural networks under gradient descent in function space. Dual to this perspective is an understanding of how neural networks evolve in parameter space, since the NTK is defined in terms of the gradient of the ANN's outputs with respect to its parameters. In the infinite width limit, the connection between these two perspectives becomes especially interesting. The NTK remaining constant throughout training at large widths co-occurs with the ANN being well described throughout training by its first order Taylor expansion around its parameters at initialization: :f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta(t)\\\\right) = f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta(0)\\\\right) + abla_{\\\\theta}f\\\\left(x;\\\\theta(0)\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\theta(t) - \\\\theta(0)\\\\right) + \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(\\\\min\\\\left(n_1 \\\\dots n_{L-1}\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\right) .  Other architectures  The NTK can be studied for various ANN architectures, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformer Neural Networks. In such settings, the large-width limit corresponds to letting the number of parameters grow, while keeping the number of layers fixed: for CNNs, this amounts to letting the number of channels grow.  Applications   Convergence to a global minimum  For a convex loss functional \\\\mathcal{C} with a global minimum, if the NTK remains positive-definite during training, the loss of the ANN \\\\mathcal{C}\\\\left(f\\\\left(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right) converges to that minimum as t\\\\to\\\\infty. This positive-definiteness property has been shown in a number of cases, yielding the first proofs that large-width ANNs converge to global minima during training.  Kernel methods  The NTK gives a rigorous connection between the inference performed by infinite-width ANNs and that performed by kernel methods: when the loss function is the least-squares loss, the inference performed by an ANN is in expectation equal to the kernel ridge regression (with zero ridge) with respect to the NTK \\\\Theta_{\\\\infty}. This suggests that the performance of large ANNs in the NTK parametrization can be replicated by kernel methods for suitably chosen kernels.  Software libraries  Neural Tangents is a free and open-source Python library used for computing and doing inference with the infinite width NTK and Neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) corresponding to various common ANN architectures.

Born in Partick, McDermid studied at Hyndland School before completing an apprenticeship as a quantity surveyor. During World War II, he volunteered as an air raid warden, then spent the last two years in the British Army, based in the UK. In the late 1940s, McDermid had two bouts of tuberculosis, and in 1950 he moved to Stonehouse, hoping that the cleaner air there would improve his health. He worked locally as a quantity surveyor, and became active in the Congregational Union of Scotland, serving on its building committee. He also served as president of the Congregational Union for several years in the 1960s. He also became a lay preacher, and from 1986 served as pastor for the Lanark Evangelical Union Church. In 1967, McDermid was elected to Hamilton District Council as an independent, but in 1970 he decided to join the Liberal Party. He stood unsuccessfully for the party in Lanark at the October 1974 and 1979 UK general elections, and also in the high-profile 1978 Hamilton by-election, at which he took only 2.6% of the vote.

He served for nearly 30 years in the Imperial East India Forestry Service and other public offices in Burma. Together with his wife Bertha as co-author, Ferrars wrote and illustrated an ethnological and photographic study of the native culture and society, entitled Burma, published in 1900. Early life and education Max Henry Ferrars was born on 28 October 1846 in Killucan, Ireland. He was the son of an Irish father and a German mother. After studies at Trinity College, Dublin, he moved to Germany in 1870 and specialised in forestry at the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry (German: Königliche-Sächsische Forstakademie) in Tharandt, Saxony, near Dresden. Cultural studies and professional life in British Burma Having completed his education, he moved to Burma, where he served for 25 years in the Imperial East India Forestry Service and later also as \\"Director of Public Instruction\\"Title given by himself in his 1919 paperback for students of English, see ref.6 below. in the British colonial service. Based on their sound knowledge of the Burmese language and wide travels in Burma, he and his wife Bertha Ferrars (née Hensler) published a book entitled Burma in 1900, with detailed ethnological descriptions of the native culture and society and illustrated by more than 400 photographs in black-and-white, taken during the couple's time in Burma. Among many other observations, the authors also took photographs of popular sports and other pastimes of different Burmese ethnic groups, for example boat races, gambling or the Burmese form of chess.Ferrars, Max and Bertha, Burma, London 1901, p.180 Later life in Germany In 1896, Ferrars returned to Europe and took up residence in the university town of Freiburg on the outskirts of the Black Forest in southern Germany. He joined the advisory committee of the city's Museum for Natural Science and Ethnology (at the time called \\"Museum für Natur- und Völkerkunde\\"), offering his knowledge of Burmese culture and donating his collection of photographs, thereby becoming one of the museum's first major sponsors. The Ferrars' collection still constitutes the key part of the museum's holdings on the culture of Burma, presenting over 100 items, among them a large group of traditional and rare Burmese marionettes, pieces of Burmese laquerware and parts of the wooden door of a Buddhist monastery. From 1899 onwards, Ferrars taught English language in the University of Freiburg's faculty of philology.In this function, he also published study materials for students of English, like his paperback \\"Curiosities of English Pronunciation and Accidence for the Use of Teachers and Students\\" of 1919. In his new surroundings, he continued his travels and documentary photography, as is shown by his photograph of a group of girls in a village in the Black Forest.

London: Offices of ̀The Studio,̀. p. 202 According to the information given in German on the museum's webpage, Ferrars' position as a British university lecturer in Germany became difficult during the years of World War I. Due to the intervention of the university, however, he could continue his teaching position until his retirement in 1921. Ferrars died on 7 February 1933.According to available sources, nothing is known about his place of death, nor about his wife Bertha during his time in Freiburg.

Warren, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2018 term. In a split opinion, the Court held that the state of Virginia's ban on uranium mining did not conflict with the Atomic Energy Act., 139 S. Ct. 1894 (2019). This case is significant because of its strong impact on environmentalism as well as its discussion of the interplay between state's rights and federal supremacy. It also featured an extensive discussion as to what extent courts should evaluate a legislature's motive for passing a law.  Background  Coles Hill, Virginia, in Pittsylvania County is the location of one of the largest known uranium deposits in the United States and the seventh largest uranium deposit in the world. The site's main uranium lode was discovered in 1979 on private land owned by the descendants of Walter Coles, who are now the founders and owners of Virginia Uranium, Incorporated. Though VUI owned the land containing the proposed uranium mine, it could not extract the uranium due to a 1982 state ban on uranium mining. Virginia enacted this law after the notorious Three Mile Island disaster in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. When uranium prices rose in the early 2000s, VUI renewed its efforts to develop the mine. Though VUI claimed that its proposed mining site would have generated up to $4.8 billion in net revenue for Virginia businesses, environmental groups criticized the plans, noting that uranium mining contributed to increased cancer rates, acidification of waterways, and air pollution. Local businesses also criticized the proposed uranium mining project, citing potential harm to agriculture, tourism, and other economic development opportunities. VUI lobbied the Virginia General Assembly to loosen the ban. State Senators John Watkins and Richard Saslaw sponsored a bill that would have created a licensing scheme for issuing uranium permits in 2013. However, following the election of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and his vow to veto any effort to lift the uranium ban, VUI decided to pursue a judicial remedy instead. Broadly speaking, the development of uranium is a three step process: physically mining the uranium from the ground; milling the ore to produce yellowcake (urania); and safely securing the waste material (known as 'tailings'). The federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 confers the responsibility for regulating the second and third steps of the process (milling ore to create yellowcake and storing the tailings) to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) following the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974). Regulating the first step (mining of ore) has traditionally been left up to the state governments. VUI's argument is that Virginia's ban on mining was in fact motivated by health and safety concerns related to milling ore and storing the waste. Though VUI conceded that the state had the authority to regulate mining, they argued that the Virginia General Assembly's improper motivation for passing the law meant that it should be preempted by the federal Atomic Energy Act and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  In lower courts  VUI first took its case to the Western District Court of Virginia in November 2015. Judge Jackson L. Kiser of the Western District granted Virginia's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ruling in part that the Atomic Energy Act did not conflict with Virginia's ban on uranium mining. Though the District Court acknowledged that prior Supreme Court precedent required states to have a non- safety rationale to regulate activities that were within the NRC's purview, it also determined that first phase of uranium development (mining) was not covered by the AEA. It also held that the District Court would not delve into the motivations of the state in passing the law. VUI appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 2016. In 2017, the Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court's determination. VUI appealed again, this time to the United States Supreme Court, which granted a writ of certiorari agreeing to hear the case on May 21, 2018. Attorney Charles J. Cooper, founder of the law firm Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, argued the case on behalf of Virginia Uranium. Toby J. Heytens, the Solicitor General of Virginia, represented the state before the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court opinion  On June 17, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Virginia and upheld the state ban. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch and joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, held that the Virginia moratorium on uranium mining was not preempted by the federal Atomic Energy Act. Gorsuch's opinion emphasized that the plain language of the Atomic Energy Act was that it regulated activity only after the uranium was removed from the earth, leaving regulation of mining activity to the states. Gorsuch also rejected the approach of examining the state legislature's purpose for enacting the ban, stating that such an inquiry would generate unnecessary inconsistencies and intrude on the state legislature's ability to have a free and open debate. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for herself and for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, wrote a separate opinion concurring with Gorsuch's final judgment. However, they did not join the part of Gorsuch's opinion which discussed role of inquiring into the state legislature's purpose, which they viewed as falling outside the scope of the case. Chief Justice John Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito. Roberts asserted that the majority failed to reckon with whether a state could indirectly regulate a preempted activity (such as the milling and storage of uranium) by regulating a non-preempted activity (such as mining).

He targeted lonely elderly people living in remote villages and robbed their houses to pay for his alcohol addiction. He was later executed for these crimes, the fifth of seven people executed before the capital punishment was abolished in Lithuania.  Early life  Varnelis was born on January 1, 1971 in the village of in the Telšiai District, in a family with six more children (three boys and three girls). The family was dysfunctional: both parents were alcoholics and all of their children, including young Antanas, were sent to various homes. Varnelis ended up in an orphanage in Viešvilė. There, he established himself as reserved and unsociable, often running away and wandering around the neighborhood. He was prone to theft and asocial behavior, for which, at the age of 11, he was transferred to a specialized boarding school for difficult teenagers in the town of Gelgaudiškis. Varnelis abused alcohol and smoked cigarettes, picked on those weaker than him but was respectful to those stronger than him. He continued to steal and run away, and showed no academic inclinations. After leaving the school, the state provided Varnelis with a workplace and dormitory room. At the same time, he tried to study at an agricultural school in Kudirkos Naumiestis, but soon abandoned it. In August 1987, at the age of 16, Varnelis was first convicted of stealing 12 beer bottles and a chicken from grocery store. He underwent an examination in a psychiatric hospital in , where he was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability with pronounced psychopathic tendencies but was judged competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months in an educational colony, but the sentence was postponed. Just a few months later, he robbed a passer-by, stealing his wallet, and was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment in Pravieniškės. He was released on January 14, 1992. Murders After his release, Varnelis cohabited with an acquaintance from the orphanage, but soon quarreled with him and left for his older brother Pranas, who worked on a private farm in Gelgaudiškis. There, Antanas, according to eyewitnesses, was parasitic, living on his brother's expenses and abusing alcohol. The farm owners quickly got tired of Antanas' behavior, and both he and his brother were kicked out. While in Gelgaudiškis, in June 1992, under the threat of a knife, Varnelis attempted to rape a 13-year-old local resident, also stealing a loaf of bread and 300 rubles from her. After this, he did not have a more permanent place and wandered around various villages. In July, together with his brother Pranas, Varnelis robbed a house of a forester in in the Šakiai District. Pranas was apprehended while Antanas escaped. On July 28, he committed his first murder in in the Šakiai District. The victim was a lonely 70-year-old local, whom Varnelis beat to death. He then stole 2,000 rubles and set the house on fire to cover his tracks. The police arrested six suspects, but they had an alibi. Varnelis traveled on foot avoiding larger settlements and sleeping in random barns. Three weeks later, on August 18, Varnelis committed the second murder in in the Telšiai District. The victim was another lonely pensioner. Varnelis stole 12,000 rubles and ate while the man was still alive. The investigators initially did not make a connection between the two murders. They did receive a description of Varnelis and were able to prepare a facial composite from two men that Varnelis sold the stolen items to. At the end of August 1992, Varnelis arrived in the town of Šimkaičiai in the Jurbarkas District, where he met a friend from the orphanage and got a job working with him on a farm. There, he was known to the locals as the young guy who often visited discos and met many girls. On the night of October 31, Varnelis attacked once again, breaking into the house of an 86-year-old. He hit him with an axe on the head several times and then robbed the house. The victim died a week later in hospital without regaining consciousness. Varnelis was almost caught red- handed at the site: while he was still in the house cooking eggs, a relative of the victim arrived to check upon the old man. Varnelis managed to convince him that he was helping the old man with housework. While the relative was checking with a neighbor, Varnelis escaped to the forest and hid to watch the commotion. On November 14, near the village of in the Kelmė District, Varnelis killed for the 4th time – another lonely pensioner, from whom he stole a bicycle, a raincoat, a coffee grinder, hair spray, several bottles of homemade wine and groceries. The body of the 68-year-old woman, who was hit a total of nine times with an axe, was found a week later covered by straws. Varnelis lived in the victim's house for at least a day after the murder. The police arrested five suspects, but they provided an alibi and were released. Between November 20 and 21, near in the Šiauliai District, Varnelis broke into an empty house but did not find anything of value. He then separately attacked two villagers with an axe – a 48-year-old man who was robbed of his motorbike and a 69-year-old woman who was robbed of 6,000 talonas. Both survived the attacks. On December 5, in the village of in the Raseiniai District, Varnelis killed two women, a 92-year-old woman and her 68-year-old daughter-in-law. He remained in the house overnight drinking found champagne, and on leaving, he stole several bottles of alcohol, two pairs of watches, two gold wedding rings, groceries and 15,000 talonas. The daughter-in-law was found still alive but she died later in hospital. Four days after the murder, Varnelis' photo was shown on TV and published by newspapers asking the public for information. The Ministry of the Interior formed a task force to catch the perpetrator. The police searched for Varnelis in Gelgaudiškis.  Arrest and trial  Upon learning that he was wanted, Varnelis changed his tactics. Now he only moved at night and slept in abandoned houses or barns during the day. He headed towards Vilnius from where he planned to escape. On the evening of December 21, 1992, in the village of in the Kaunas District, Varnelis was identified by locals based on his tattoos. Varnelis immediately confessed to the murders and robberies, but not to the attempted rape. He underwent a forensic psychiatric examination in Utena which concluded that he was competent to stand trial. At the trial, Varnelis' defense focused on his disability, difficult childhood, and the fact that he confessed and cooperated with the police. His attorney asked for a second psychiatric examination, but Varnelis refused. In his final statement, Varnelis asked the court that, taking into account all the mentioned circumstances, he be sentenced to life imprisonment. However, on February 1, 1994, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Lithuania, chaired by , found the 23-year-old Varnelis guilty of all charges and sentenced him to be executed by shooting. His clemency petition was rejected by the President of Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas on September 16, and Varnelis was executed on September 28, 1994 in Vilnius. He was buried in the in the section for those unclaimed by relatives.

Almost all of his considerable published output concerns the History of Silesia. Life and works Colmar Grünhagen was born in Trebnitz (as Trzebnica was then known) and grew up in Breslau (as Wrocław was known before 1944/45). His father was an apothecary. Between 1841 and 1847 he was a pupil initially at Breslau's St. Maria Magdalena Gymnasium (secondary school) and then at the Elizabeth Gymnasium (secondary school). On completing his schooling he moved on to study Classical Philology and History at the University of Jena. He moved again to pursue his studies at Berlin where he was influenced by Leopold von Ranke. During 1850 he studied briefly at the University of Breslau before moving on again, this time to the University of Halle. Between 1851 and 1853 he was able to combine his university studies with teaching work at secondary schools in Breslau. Meanwhile it was from the University of Halle that on 21 December 1850 Grünhagen received his doctorate for a piece of work on the pontiff who famously (for historians) launched the First Crusade with a powerful sermon preached on a hillside just outside Clermont on 27 November 1095, Pope Urban II. In March 1851 Grünhagen passed his secondary school teaching exams (\\"Oberlehrerexamen\\") in Breslau. At Easter 1853 he began work as a teaching assistant at the Friedrichs-Gymnasium (secondary school) in the city, becoming a full teacher there a few months later. Following his Habilitation from the University of Breslau in 1855, he took a university position as a History teacher (\\"...als Privatdozent\\"). In 1860 he published \\"Henrucus Pauper\\", described as a book of accounts for the city of Breslau between 1299 and 1358, using city records and other historical sources: the work comprised the third volume in the \\"Codex diplomaticus Silesiae\\" series. It was not till after he had resigned from the city's schools service, however, that on 11 March 1862 he succeeded Wilhelm Wattenbach as head of the Silesian Regional Archive (renamed \\"Silesian state/national archive\\" in 1867). For nearly forty years, till 1 April 1901, he remained in the post. During this period he received the titles of \\"Archivrat\\" in 1873 and \\"Geheim Archivrat\\" (very loosely, \\"Privy Archives Secretary\\") in 1885. The prestigious titles dated back to the late medieval period, but the core responsibilities of the head of the archives department appear to have remained broadly constant. He combined this and other positions with the editorship of the journal of the Silesian Historial Association (\\"Verein für Geschichte und Alterthum Schlesiens\\") between 1863 and 1905. Through his long tenure in these positions and as a result of the impressive quantity and detail of his output on Silesian history, Grünhagen became highly influential in his chosen specialist field, as well as with the Historical Association and the historian community more broadly. On 18 December 1866 he accepted an extraordinary professorship in History from the University of Breslau, where he continued to teach till 1911. In 1871 Colmar Grünhagen was elected to the presidency of the Silesian Historial Association, retaining this position till 1905, following which he retained the title of honorary president. He also became an honorary member of the Silesian Society for Homeland Culture and, in 1868, a board member with the Silesian Museum for Arts and Antiquities, which he later chaired. Works As editor, Grünhagen contributed extensively to the journal of the Silesian Historial Association. He was also a regular contributor to the Feuilleton (arts and literature) section of the Breslaauer Zeitung, the Preußische Jahrbücher, the Zeitschrift für Preußische Geschichte und Landeskunde and other historical periodicals.

She was key to the realisation of the importance of the solstice connection of the Newgrange structure, and the first person to create a full collection of drawings of the decorated stones of Newgrange. Career Claire O'Donovan was born in County Cork to Edward and Johanna O'Donovan, in 21 July 1916. She became a national school teacher until she went to University College Cork in the 1930s, studying archaeology under Professor Seán O'Riordan. She met her future husband, Michael J. O'Kelly, known to family as Brian, while in college, and together they were involved in work on many of Ireland's historical sites, and on the setting up of the Cork Public Museum in 1945. O'Kelly used her fluency in Irish and her knowledge of archaeology to create the necessary archaeological terms for the definitive English/Irish Dictionary edited by Tomás de Bháldraithe. She was behind the research which led to the discovery of Newgrange's solar importance, made drawings of the stones of the Boyne Valley sites, most notably Newgrange, and published accessible texts on Newgrange and Dowth. O'Kelly wrote several books for public understanding on the history and importance of Irish sites, and her content is used for the website of Newgrange, for example, even today. Her significance in archaeology and history was recognised when she was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1984. O'Kelly was also involved in artistic Irish life. She was friends with Gabriel Hayes who used her hands as the models for the stations of the cross in Galway cathedral. She had three daughters and, having survived her husband, died aged 88 in Dublin, and was buried in Cork.

Life   Early life  Sankalia was born in Sialkot, India (now part of Pakistan) in 1934 to a Maharashtrian Brahmin family. Her father worked in Indian Medical Services, educated in England, but died in 1935 when Sankalia was a year old. Her mother Rama Bakhle, a writer who graduated from Karve University, then moved the family to Mumbai to be with her uncle who was an artist and general manager of Western Railways. In 1951, at the age of 16, Sankalia joined Sir J. J. School of Art with only two other girls in her class (Rashmi Daftari and Chandramani Gandhi). After three years of schooling, she wanted to study abroad to expand her education, but lost the support of higher education from her uncle.  Work Life  Sankalia began working and teaching modern architecture at the new Academy of Architecture, giving her the education she felt she missed from school. She credits Vina Mody as a guru in the field, who hired Sankalia to work in construction sites alongside masons, carpenters, and electricians. Along side Mody she gives Pravina Meghta credit on massively inspiring her creativity within architecture, later becoming one of the first female work partners in the country. In 1957 she married Hema Bakhle, a 'pavement dweller' engineer, Until his death in 1984, he consistently supported Sankalia's career path.

As an innovation, they displayed the products in the store as if they were already in the home or office. She worked at CAC until 2005 where she retired and passed it on to her son. The store still exists today in Mumbai and Pune. Her commissions over time outside of household appliances included houses, women's hostels, printing presses, hospitals, research centers, governmental offices, and educational institutions.

Confederate forces seized USS Arctic at the beginning of the war and converted into a receiving ship. Arctic was a 328-ton screw steamer built in Philadelphia in 1851 at the navy yard by Theodore Birely. The two-decked, three-masted steamer measured in length, in beam, and in depth and displaced 125 tons. Cape Fear River CSS Arctic performed additional duty as receiving ship for Flag Officer Robert F Pinkney's North Carolina defense force. She was stationed in the Cape Fear River from 1862 to 1864, with Lieutenant C B Poindexter in command. Her machinery had been removed in the latter part of 1862 for the ironclad then completing at Richmond, Virginia. With the threat to Wilmington, created by the arrival off Fort Fisher of the joint army-navy expedition under Rear Admiral Porter and Major General Butler, Arctic was sunk on 24 December 1864 to obstruct the river channel. The location of the obstruction in front of Fort Campbell on the east side of the river is clearly indicated on a Confederate map of the period. Lightship In June 1866 salvors raised Arctic, described as \\"a dismantled hull, blackened with age and decay,\\" from the Cape Fear River. The ship was brought to the Cassidey and Beery shipyard in Wilmington, where it was repaired and refitted during January 1867. The government equipped Arctic with new rigging and lamps with the intention of converting it back into a lightship. Reports indicate that United States Lighthouse Service removed Lightship No 8 from the Cape Fear region in May 1867 for reassignment. In 1872 a new mast was stepped and minor repairs made. Lightship No 8 continued to serve as a relief lightship until a structural survey in 1878 condemned the ship. On April 16, 1879, the lightship was sold at public auction for her junk value.

Renowned for its age and size it was sketched by the artist J. M. W. Turner. At its greatest extent its canopy was said to cover of land. The tree declined in the late 18th century and lost several of its leading branches. By 1822 many of its branches were almost completely rotten and it had been supported with wooden props. The tree fell in 1950, apparently after having been struck by lightning.  History  1854 painting of the oak An 1873 depiction of the oak The oak has been said to date to the era of the Norman Conquest or even early Roman times. It was already ancient when Alexander Hunter, in his 1776 edition of John Evelyn's Sylva, wrote of it, \\"The dimensions are almost incredible... The foliage is extremely thin, so that the anatomy of the ancient branches may be distinctly seen in the height of summer. When compared to this, all other trees are but children of the forest\\". Cowthorpe's St Michael's Church was constructed nearby and a public house was named Ye Old Oak Inn after the tree. At its greatest extent its canopy was said to cover of land. In the early 19th century the tree was owned by Charles Stourton, 17th Baron Stourton and then The Honorable Mr Petre. The tree was sketched by J. M. W. Turner. Decline and death  The tree's leading branch fell in 1718 and was found to be thick and to weigh . It is said to have decayed greatly between 1773 and 1804; in 1794 another leading branch fell, causing alarm to nearby residents. In 1806 its circumference measured at a height of from the ground was and in 1822 it was measured at at ground level. By this time many of the branches are said to be completely rotten and held up only by the bark; the leading branch extended some from the trunk and had been supported by wooden props. The hollow trunk was said to be large enough to hold 70 people, if children were carried on the adults' shoulders. The Cowthorpe oak was photographed in 1904 and appeared to be in good health, though it was heavily propped. The tree died in 1950, apparently having been struck by lightning. At this time it was said to be England's oldest tree. The remains of the tree were removed by Ian Watson as it had become unsafe. The tree's lineage survives as several of its acorns were sent to New Zealand to be planted there. One of these, planted at Drury in the 1870s, is now known as the Runciman Oak and has a circumference of almost measured at a height of from ground level.

Most collective collections comprise monographs and/or serials. Other efforts have addressed acquisition and/or retention of microform, federal government documents, and digital collections.  Goals  The goal of collective collections is to preserve and provide access to the scholarly record in its original print form. Each library participating in a collective collection agrees to retain certain titles for a given period of time, usually at least ten years. This practice ensures that the collective collection contains a predetermined number of unique items (such as specific editions of books and complete runs of journals) and that these items will be cared for and made available to all libraries participating in the collective collection. To prevent the loss of a unique title, participating libraries determine an appropriate number of copies that should be retained, so that if one were lost or destroyed, other copies would remain available. Shared print programs base these decisions on the number of libraries involved, the size of the collective collection, availability of the item outside of the collective collection, and other factors. Secondarily, collective collections enable participating libraries to make informed decisions about weeding locally held volumes that are duplicated in the collective collection. In turn, this practice enables libraries to repurpose shelf space, whether to accommodate other print materials or to create a greater number and variety of spaces for users, especially students, to study, collaborate, teach, consult, and pursue other research and learning activities.  Types  Two basic types of collective collection models exist. A distributed (or decentralized) collective shared print collection is one in which items in the collection are retained at the original library but are accessible to all partnering libraries. Centralized collective collections are those in which books and journals are removed from the original library and stored in a shared shelving facility. In many cases this shared shelving facility is a high-density preservation facility built according to the Harvard model, featuring rigorous temperature and climate controls to facilitate preservation of materials, along with elevated stacks and special shelving methods to maximize storage efficiency. Library consortia generally coordinate collective collections. A consortium can create and manage a formal agreement (such as a memorandum of understanding), signed by each participating library’s director, which ensures that certain books, journals, or other materials are both retained and made available to other libraries, generally through interlibrary loan. The consortium can also manage the analysis of each library’s collection to divide the responsibility for retaining items equitably. The consortium can also establish criteria for shelving environments (to ensure long-term preservation), as well as outline the methods for providing access to titles to other participating libraries. Library catalogs generally include indicators of which materials are part of a collective collection. Many collective collections are additionally tracked at a regional or national level. The Center for Research Libraries (CRL) hosts a Print Archives Preservation Registry (PAPR) to record titles, holdings, and conditions of serials held in major shared print programs across the United States. The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries offers a similar tool called the Gold Rush Library Content Comparison System. In 2018, CRL and OCLC were awarded a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to enable collective collection retention commitments for serials to be reflected in the global union catalog WorldCat.  Programs  Collective collections may be regional or national in scale. As of May 2019, nearly eighty libraries in the United States had committed to retain nearly 18 million books for 25 years under the HathiTrust Shared Print Program. As of December 2018, more than sixty academic libraries participating in the Eastern Academic Scholars' Trust (EAST) had committed to retain more than 6 million monographs for at least 15 years. Collective collections programs outside the United States include Finland’s National Repository Library, Australia's CAVAL Archival and Research Materials (CARM) Centre, Canada's Keep@Downsview, and the United Kingdom's U.K. Research Reserve.  History  Libraries’ efforts to collectively manage and provide access to their holdings date back to antiquity and extend through twentieth-century projects such as the Farmington Plan. Funding reductions and escalating storage costs, as well as space constraints, for physical collections in the 2000s created an environment where library directors needed to rely on partnerships with consortia and other libraries. Librarians began to write about shared print collections as one possible method of dealing with these mounting constraints. In 2002 Richard Fyffe argued that librarians needed to start a dialogue with stakeholders and patrons in the scholarly community about the need to rely more on collective collections. In 2004 Bernard F. Reilly (former president of the Center for Research Libraries) envisioned “drawing together the major independent regional and national repository initiatives into a coordinated, community-wide print preservation effort.” In 2013 Lorcan Dempsey popularized the term “collective collections” in an OCLC research report.Dempsey, L. (2013) “The Emergence of the Collective Collection: Analyzing Aggregate Print Library Holdings,” 1-5. In B. Lavoie and C. Malpas, eds. Understanding the Collective Collection: Towards a System-wide Perspective on Library Print Collections. Dublin, OH: OCLC Research, 2013. The trend toward collective collections has also received significant coverage in the mainstream press.

During the orogeny from 2.14 to 1.94 billion years ago two small Archean proto-continents—including the greenstone belt-dominated Gavião Block and the calc-alkaline charnockite and enderbite-dominated Jequié Block—collided. The Contendas-Jacobina Lineament represents a suture zone where the collision occurred and the Gavião Block partially subducted under the Jequié Block. At the same time, another small continental fragment, the Serrinha Block, may have collided as well and was extensively reworked and metamorphosed, with orthogneiss and migmatite reaching amphibolite-grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. The Serrinha Block is the basement rock of the Rio Itapicuru granite-greenstone belt. Several magmatic arcs formed between the colliding proto-continent blocks, including the Salvador-Curaçá Belt, Contendas-Mirante Belt, Jacobina-Mundo Novo Belt and Itabuna-Atlantic Belt. To the west of the Gavião Block, the Guanambi-Urandi Batholith formed with monzonite, granite intrusions and syenite, which was subsequently covered by Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks. In the Guyana Shield, the Transamazonian orogeny resulted in refolding and reactivation of older tectonic features from the Guriense orogeny, producing horst and graben areas and intense pyroclastic ignimbrite and rhyolite eruptions.

Biography   Origins  Mario was allegedly born as Mario Comte Caracciolo di Melito into a wealthy noble family in Naples, Italy, in 1883 (some sources claim his birth year as 1894). His parents were Filippo Caracciolo and Emilia Compagna. Mario served as an officer in the Italian cavalry before moving to the United States. He worked as an attache at the Italian embassy in Washington, D.C., where he met and married Miriam Crosby in 1915. The pair had a son, Ludovico.  Hollywood career  Around 1920, he headed out to Hollywood alone to seek work as an actor. He also worked as a physiotherapist at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, where he met Rudolph Valentino. He also had a fling with a young actress named Lucille LeSueur (better by the stage name she took on later, Joan Crawford). Over the course of the decade, he appeared in several dozen films before returning to Italy with the aim of starting his own production company. (It does not appear that he was successful in this endeavor.)  Later life  Mario died in Rome, Italy, in 1953; he was survived by his wife.

The DGGC, integrated in the Secretariat of State for Security, is in charge of organize, direct, coordinate and execute the missions entrusted to the Civil Guard by the provisions in force, in accordance with the guidelines and orders issued by the Ministers of the Interior and of Defense, within the scope of their respective powers. The DGGC was created in 1844 as an Inspectorate-General and it was renamed as Directorate-General in 1859. Briefly, during 1932 to 1939 it was known again as Inspectorate-General. Since its inception, it has been integrated in the Ministry of the Interior and it has been dependent also from the Ministry of Defence, in all the maters related to the military nature of the agency. The Directorate-General of the Civil Guard is headed by the Director-General, an official appointed by the Prime Minister at the joint request of the Defence and Interior Ministers. To assist the Director-General there is a Deputy Director of Operations (DAO), a Civil Guard officer with the rank of Lieutenant general. The current director-general of the Civil Guard is María Gámez Gámez and the DAO is Ltn. General Laurentino Ceña Coro.  History   Historic context  The need to create a rural agency that gave security to the fields and roads of Spain was evident in the first half of the 19th century. The confiscation processes of the mentioned century, the fractionation of rural property, the dissolution of the National Militia and the political vicissitudes and continuous changes of government were some of the causes that led to the birth of the Civil Guard by Royal Decree of March 28, 1844. Duke of Ahumada, first director-general. Francisco Javier Girón, 2nd Duke of Ahumada was appointed to organize the agency. He made a report explaining how the agency and the remuneration system to the agents should be regulated, a report that considerably reduced the budget, and that caused the approval of a new Royal Decree on May 13 that repealed that of April —which did not come into force— and that is the true date of creation of the agency.  Inspectorate-General  The aforementioned decree of May 13, 1844 created a Inspectorate-General as the central administrative organ in all the matters relating the agency's organization, personnel, discipline and material, and related to both the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Interior. The creation of the Inspectorate became effective with the appointment of its first holder, Francisco Javier Girón, who was rewarded for his work in creating the agency with that position on September 1, 1844. Another decree of October 15 gave the inspector-general as functions those of \\"direction and inspection of the agency, and from its authority all branches of the service (...) depend, as well as the internal regime, administration and discipline. He will direct his organization dedicating himself with special and exquisite care to establish and perfect the privileged and interesting service to which said agency is dedicated, proposing to the Royal approval the improvements or variations that time and experience prove necessary to its perfection. And finally, he will watch over the strict observance of these regulations, as well as that of his special service and other subsequent resolutions that will be communicated to him\\". The royal decree also established that, in order to fulfill its functions, the inspector had to be dependent of the Ministry of the Interior and of War.  Veteran Civil Guard  On December 29, 1857, a Royal Decree stipulates that the Urban Guard of Madrid would depend on the Inspector-General of the Civil Guard and on March 24, 1858, another new Decree provided that the Urban Guard would depend on the Ministry of the War in terms of organization, personnel, armament and discipline and that of the Interior in relation to services, payment of salaries, quartering and material. For this reason, on April 6, 1859, it changes its name to Veteran Civil Guard (Guardia Civil Veterana) and the Inspection-General was renamed as the Directorate-General for the Civil and Veteran Guard. With this agency practically integrated into the Civil Guard, on October 12, 1864, the organ was renamed as the Directorate-General of the Civil Guard.  Second Republic and Francisco Franco's Dictatorship  After a failed coup d'etat on August 10, 1932, the government of the Second Republic reformed the law enforcement agencies and, as a result, by decree of August 16, 1932, the DGGC is abolished and the Inspection-General is recovered, with full and unique dependence from the Interior Department. The Inspectorate was structured in September of that year, being integrated by the inspector-general, the military secretariat and three offices. After the Civil War and the rebellious victory, the great part of the Carabineros remained loyal to the republic, and although a large part of the Civil Guard also, the first was punished with its dissolution and integration in the second mainly by the great prestige that, already at the time, had this last. This was done through the Law of 15 March 1940, which also integrated the Civil Guard into the Armed Forces, although it maintained the Interior Ministry and Civil Governors (provincial leaders) dependence, in all matters relating to services, barracks, wages and material. This law also recovered the Directorate-General.  Democratic era  The Spanish transition to democracy was a time of great changes in the field of public safety, although they do not affected excessively the Directorate-General. In 1994 a new phenomenon occurs, such as the integration of two important departaments, that of Justice and that of the Interior. Through this integration a super-ministry was created with powers in judicial and security affairs. The DGGC is renamed as General Secretariat-Directorate-General of the Civil Guard (since 1986 it had the rank of general secretariat) until 1996, when both departments separated. = Single control and current split = Between September 2006 and December 2011, the Directorates-General of the Police and of the Civil Guard were merged by Prime Minister Zapatero with the purpose of «carry out the tasks of both police forces in a more integral, homogeneous and coordinated way». In 2008, it was known that the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, was not comfortable with this union of command and wanted to split them again, but that was not the opinion of the Prime Minister and remained together. In 2009 it was created the University Center of the Civil Guard, integrated in the directorate-general. During this time both agencies maintained their differentiated structure and legal regime, with a different Coordination Office for each body. In addition, the positions of Deputy Directors of Operations (Director Adjunto Operativo, DAO) were created as a technical assistance organ to the director-general. There was one DAO for each law enforcement agency. With the arrival of Prime Minister Rajoy to the government and the appointment of Juan Ignacio Zoido as Interior Miniter, they decided to split the command again considering that the coordination task was a duty of the Secretary of State for Security and that every agency needed to have their own command. In July 2017, Minister Zoido abolished the positions of Deputy Directors of Operations, a decision that was reversed by Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska in July of the following year.

It is a general aviation airport with no tower, fixed base operator (FBO), or commercial services, but which is popular among smaller light sport and general aviation aircraft doing cross country flights, where the airport serves as a GA- friendly waypoint, refueling stop, and overnight layover stop.  Facilities and Aircraft  Aztec Airport covers an area of 160 acres (65 ha) at an elevation of 5,882 feet (1,783 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 08/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 4,314 by 60 feet (1,315 x 18 m). For the 12-month period ending April 15, 2019, the airport had an average of 105 aircraft operations per week: 55% transient and 45% local general aviation. The airport provides an unattended pilot lounge with restrooms, free WiFi, and a computer with printer. Notably, the airport also provides two vehicles that can be used by visiting pilots for free on a first- come-first-serve basis, limited to day or overnight use and travel in the immediate vicinity. The airport operates in Class G airspace, and Class E above it begins at 1200 feet AGL. Because of this, it has become especially popular for 'non-traditional' flying and aircraft, including fixed wing, weight shift, powered parachutes (PPC), powered paragliders (PPG), hang gliders, and even limited radio control and UAV usage. The use of a two-way aviation band radio is not required, but strongly recommended for all pilots and other operators.  Notable Features  Aztec is one of several airports located within New Mexico that features a retroreflective landing light system. Rather than electrical lighting, the system uses reflectors that are located along runways edge at standard intervals. An aircraft's landing lights will 'light up' the runway reflectors at about 1-1/2 miles out. Traditional white beacon lights are located for runway line up and end-of-runway designations, as well as a pulsating light approach slope indicator (PLASI) system. The lights and PLASI system are remotely activated by using an aircraft radio and clicking 5 times in 5 seconds on the 122.9 frequency.

Formerly a fortress, the château formed part of the defence system of the Sénéchaussée of Loudunais. Originally, four towers equipped with murder holes and connected by buildings closed an interior courtyard. The castle was attacked and partially burned by the English in June 1350 and three of the buildings disappeared. In the 17th century, the Vaucelles family undertook a restoration. In the 18th century, the Marreau de Boisguérins built the two pavilions attached to the entry towers. The octagonal dovecote situated in the courtyard dates from the 14th century and is one of the oldest in the Sénéchaussée of Loudunais. It was inscribed as a monument historique on 29 September 1987.

She was curious from an early age, always trying to understand how things work. She also says that she was inspired from an early age to become a teacher. There are four generations of teachers in her family, and as a young child, she went along to her mother's classes as there was no daycare to attend. These experiences sparked interest in being an effective teacher In 1991, when she was 21, she moved with her family to the United States, arriving with very little knowledge of English. To try to improve her language skills and progress through school, she attended three schools at once, going to morning, afternoon, and evening classes. Her first term at Santa Monica College, she took four ESL courses at the same time, and after a year, was able to begin normal coursework. After graduating from Santa Monica College in 1995 with an A.S., she began working toward a bachelor's degree at UCLA, while also work in the library in evenings to help pay for University. She also began working in a biology lab, beginning by washing glassware, before becoming more involved in experiments that further increased her interest in scientific research.  Research and career  Professor Nguyen completed her masters in 1998, and PhD in 2001, both from UCLA. In her PhD, she processed and studied conducting polymers using ultrafast spectroscopy under the supervision of Professor Benjamin Schwartz. After her PhD, Professor Nguyen worked as a research associate at Columbia University, with Professor Louis Brus. She also worked for some time after her PhD at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center.

It contrasts with internal reference pricing, where the price of one drug is compared to the domestic price of therapeutically related drugs, and with cost-plus pricing, where the price involves negotiating an acceptable markup to the unit cost to develop and produce.  Policy-making  For using ERP in medicine cost regulation policies, the Euripid collaboration recommends the following 12 key principles: # ERP is an important tool but should not be used as the sole criterion, but rather in a mix with other instruments. # ERP should compare single specific products rather than based on indices. # The reference countries basket should be chosen in accordance with the aim of the national pharmaceutical policy. # Evidence has shown that ERP is most effective when applied to pharmaceuticals without generic or therapeutic competition. # Price comparison should be done on the first price in the pharmaceutical distribution chain. # When pharmaceuticals are considered as comparable, competent authorities should describe clear and transparent procedures. # Pricing formula applied for ERP should reflect the national pricing policy objective. # ERP procedures should be done with the highest possible accuracy and completeness of data sources. # If price information is adjusted to national requirements, it should be done transparently and in a sustainable manner. # ERP activities should be carefully planned and be considered as a policy tool for price revisions and monitoring. # The procedures and price inputs to ERP should be transparent to ensure predictability and effectiveness. # Policy-makers should consider strengthening their cooperation, in particular through the contribution and benefits of existing policies.  Human rights  Access to needed essential medicines is an international human right, also named the \\"right to health\\", as stated by the United Nations and the WHO. Mirror: 2008 original publication by WHO. In 2001, the World Health Assembly passed the resolution No. 54.11 that called for exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing systems to ensure medicines affordability and availability. The WHO/HAI methodology and database is one of the projects that were created in response, along with the WHO recommending the implementation of centralized price sharing systems and the implementation of pharmaceutical price cost- containment policies.  Medication cost policies  Medicines pricing policies are defined as \\"regulations and processes used by government authorities to set the price of a medicine as part of exercising price control\\". ERP is a mechanism for price control, or cost-containment policy. A quarter of all health expenditures globally is on medicines. However, authorities may want to control other components than price, such as prescription volumes. ERP is a widely accepted tool to design cost-containment policies, used in the European Union, Brazil, Jordan, South Africa, Canada, and Australia. This is used as the main drug pricing strategy in 23 of 27 European countries in 2019. In 2010, 20 members out of 27 in the European Union and 24 countries in the OCDE were using it. For this usage, each country usually has a legal framework to define the calculation of ERP and selection of reference products, with variations across high-income countries (e.g., using the median price or instead the lowest price across the reference countries), but the majority use ex-factory prices. A basket prices are ideally drawn from countries in the same global region and similar economy. For example, Pakistan uses prices from Bangladesh and India, while Iran uses prices from Greece, Spain, Turkey and the drug country of origin. However pricing data from LMICs can be lacking, and in such situations, international medicine prices can be obtained from the International Medical Products Price Guide. The United Kingdom has a critical role in the ERP system, as it is often used as a reference country since medication prices are often low, although it is not using ERP itself. The WHO recommend in the Guideline on Country Pharmaceutical Pricing Policies that countries \\"use a combination of different pharmaceutical pricing policies that should be selected on the objective, context and health system\\". ERP superseded or completed older cost- containment strategies such as cost-plus or internal reference pricing.  High-income countries  European countries saw a 76% rise in pharmaceutical outpatient expenditure between 2000 and 2009. Furthermore, the 2008 global financial crisis added to the financial pressure, which prompted most European countries to consider health expenditures as a major target for healthcare cost reduction. European countries which were affected by the global financial crisis have reported restricted access to essential medicines. ERP is one of the major mechanism used by these countries for this purpose, along others such as direct price control (i.e., fixed maximum prices), profit ceiling, internal reference pricing and free pricing. ERP is most commonly used by high-income countries to control the prices of patented medicines, or with other intellectual property rights such as pricing monopolies, for therapeutic agents that are state-reimbursed. European Union countries started building medicine prices databases since the 1990s, which led to the creation of Hungary's Common European Drug Database in 2008 and its successor Euripid since 2009, a database with standardly formatted data on drug prices and pricing regulations, fed with data from participating countries who are the only ones who can access the data in return, and is used as a shared and centralized ERP system. Japan is an exception, using ERP to systematically adjust local prices within a range of the ERP according to a formula. Drug prices are reevaluated regularly in European countries, ranging from 3 months in Greece, to 5 years in France. Few studies have investigated the impact of ERP on high-income countries, but two studies conducted in countries both inside and outside of the European Union found no substantial decrease or increase in drug prices. Furthermore, with the widespread adoption of ERP, pharmaceutical manufacturers are developing counter strategies to limit the negative impacts on them, such as reduced drug prices. One strategy is to delay the launch of new drug products into the market, as is the case with Belgium, being usually not among the countries with the highest drug prices in the European Union. This increase in the launch delay of new medicines is however observed to some extent in all European countries implementing ERP. Another observed strategy in Germany and New Zealand is to deliberately keep the prices of some medicines high, knowing these countries would later be used as reference countries to derive higher external reference prices. These counter strategies raise the question of the sustainability of ERP as an objective measure. In several European countries, implementing ERP led to a decrease of the average drug price, but not the maximum nor minimum drug prices. Since the ERP was the sole criterion for drug pricing in these countries, the observed decrease can only be due to ERP implementation. It was also observed that prices decreases was correlated with the frequency of price revision, with countries infrequently revising prices having flat prices, whereas those with frequent revising saw a regular price decline over time. The median drug price decrease observed at 10 years was approximately 15%. A report for the European Commission simulated various ERP use strategies for drug price regulation, and found that frequent price revisions, iterative price cuts, having a large number of countries in the basket, price calculation methods, the impact of generics and prices’ sources were the most influent parameters on the drug prices evolution over time for countries using ERP as their main criterion for drug price regulation. Although it is conceptually inadequate to use ERP for drug price regulation instead of as a benchmark measure, this report concludes that ERP can be a \\"very effective tool\\", especially when several of the aforementioned strategies are combined. In the United States, medicines prices, which are not directly regulated by any cost-containment policy (\\"free pricing\\"), continually rank among the highest in the world. There are political discussions to implement ERP in the United States.  Low and moderate-income countries  High medicine price and availability are the two crucial obstacles preventing one-third of the global population, or about two billion people, mainly in low and moderate- income countries (LMICs, as defined by the World Bank), from accessing needed medication. There is evidence that medicine prices are not correlated to income differences between countries, with essential medicines being higher priced in low income countries than in high income countries due to retail markups. Whereas European Union and OCDE countries have put in place shared regulated medication cost-containment systems, low and moderate-income countries did not and lack health-care information systems to help in policy decision making, which worsened their situation as \\"price acceptors\\". Indeed, their out-of-pocked expenditure increased, with 61% to 77% (per capita) of total pharmaceutical expenditure being paid by individuals out of their pocket with no state-reimbursement. Pharmaceuticals expenditures also account for an important share of all expenditure on health, particularly in low-income countries with a mean of 30.4% in 2006 compared to 19.7% in high-income countries. Furthermore, medicines prices are usually high, particularly in the private sector and up to 80 times the price in high-income countries; availability can be low, particularly in the public sector; treatments are often unaffordable, requiring 15 days of wage to buy a 30 days treatment; government procurement can be inefficient by buying expensive original medication as well as cheaper generics; and numerous taxes and duties are being applied to medicines, including essential ones. These issues were observed in China, an upper-middle-income economy, with its bribery scandals involving GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi. However, inspired by the use of ERP by high-income countries and the lesser technical and analytical requirements to implement ERP compared to other price control mechanisms such as cost-plus or pharmacoeconomic analysis, LMICs are increasingly following suit, by using ERP in combination with other methods of cost control (cost plus, internal reference pricing, profit controls, economic evaluation, direct fixation). Similarly to high-income countries, there is only limited evidence as to the impact of ERP in LMICs. However, some countries such as Turkey and Indonesia saw a decrease in drug prices following the implementation of ERP, although there is no objectively direct evidence this decrease was caused by the introduction of ERP. , a systematic review found that markup regulation and ERP are the most commonly implemented drug pricing policies in LMICs, followed by cost-plus and the use of generics. Another review found limited evidence that implementing ERP had the effect of narrowing down the prices, by lowering drug prices in high-price countries and raising them in low-price countries. Hence, it is suggested that optimal ERP implementations are dependent on a clear set of requirements and calculation in full transparency, and that ERP should not be used as the sole pricing mechanism but rather as one benchmark for pricing decisions.  Internal reference pricing  ERP differs from internal reference pricing, or therapeutic reference pricing, where the price of a medication is compared against other domestic drugs that are its therapeutic equivalents, based on a given ATC level. This sets a reference price for a class of equivalent or similar therapeutic agents, the rest being paid out-of-pocket by the patient. Hence, a prerequisite of internal reference pricing is the availability of comparable medicines, which usually implies this can be implemented only after patents expiry and when generic or biosimilar medicines enter the market. Internal reference pricing may reduce expenditures in the short term by incentivizing people to use the reference drugs at the reference price, but the effect on drugs with a higher price than reference and on health is uncertain. Some countries, such as Denmark which has a long history of using ERP, switched to internal reference pricing. In 2016, out of 42 surveyed countries including WHO European countries, Canada and South Africa, 30 reported having internal reference pricing between generics, but only 15 also applied this policy to biosimilar medicines.

The party was rebranded from its previous party's name, United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation using the same UPKO acronym; which was a widely known Kadazan-Dusun-Murut based party in 2019. The party had earlier been renamed once before in 1999 from its initial 1994 formation name of Sabah Democratic Party.  History  Sabah Democratic Party The party started as Sabah Democratic Party or Parti Demokratik Sabah which was founded by Bernard Giluk Dompok and other detractors who split from United Sabah Party or Parti Bersatu Sabah soon after the Sabah state election in March 1994 to join the Barisan Nasional coalition. PBS had initially won a majority in the Sabah State Legislative Assembly then but with the two breakaway factions, one led by Dompok to set-up PDS and another led by Joseph Kurup to form United Sabah People's Party; had caused the crumble of PBS new Sabah government and allowed BN to form the government instead. Part of the enticement offered by BN to the defectors was the promise of a rotating Chief Ministers of Sabah post, which Dompok held from 1998 to 1999. The defection from PBS however damaged the party at the 1995 federal election, in which it won no seats. United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation PDS was renamed as United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation or Pertubuhan Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Bersatu on 8 August 1999, taking the same acronym of the now defunct original United Pasokmomogun Kadazan Organisation, which was formed and dissolved in the 1960s by Fuad Stephens. The name of the new UPKO includes the words \\"Kadazandusun\\" and \\"Murut\\", with a new logo of a silhouette of Mount Kinabalu and was not a water buffalo as in the old UPKO logo. It was redefined as an ethnically-based party striving to voice the rights and advance the development of KDM populations of Sabah and the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia. The party won three federal seats at the 1999 election, and four at the 2004 and 2008 polls. In 2009, UPKO opened four divisions in Perak, seeking a foothold among local Orang Asli indigenous people. In the Malaysian general election, 2013, the party was reduced from four to three federal seats and from six to four state assembly seats. Dompok lost his federal seat to the People's Justice Party. The following year he resigned as the party's president, a position he had held for 20 years. UPKO was one of the component parties in the Barisan Nasional coalition which ruled Malaysia until 2018. The party's core Sabahan indigenous constituency includes many Christians, while BN is, on a national scale, dominated by the United Malays National Organisation, an overtly Muslim-Malay party. While a member of the BN federal government, UPKO often spoke out about government policies affecting Christians. In 2013, the party's president Bernard Dompok distanced himself from Prime Minister Najib Razak on the contentious question of the use by Malaysian Christians of the word \\"Allah\\" to describe God. Najib had supported a government appeal to the High Court seeking to outlaw the word's use by a Christian newspaper; Dompok criticised the appeal and defended the right of Christians, especially indigenous Malaysians, to use the word. UPKO also agitated, often against the national government of which it was a part, for tougher measures against illegal immigration in Sabah. In February 2012, UPKO succeeded in forcing the establishment of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on illegal immigrants in Sabah. In the same year one of the party's federal parliamentarians, Wilfred Bumburing, quit UPKO and joined the opposition PKR in protest at what he considered to be government inaction on illegal immigration. UPKO was an advocate for the repeal of the Internal Security Act, which for over 50 years permitted detention without charge in certain circumstances. The law was repealed in 2011. In the 2018 general election, the party won only one federal seat and five state assembly seats. Following this, the party's acting president Madius Tangau announced that UPKO with five of their party state assembly seats members had left BN to form a coalition government with the Sabah Heritage Party, alongside PKR and DAP and became a partner party for the Pakatan Harapan coalition instead.

The ancestral (also termed proto-) Trans-Antarctic Mountains were uplifted earlier by the Beardmore orogeny but had eroded as a broad epicratonic sea flooded much of Antarctica in the Cambrian. Shallow water sedimentary rocks, platform carbonates and deepwater turbidites from this period are found in the mountain range. The Ross orogeny was one of the most extensive orogenic events in Antarctica, causing widespread plutonism and metamorphism. Bimodal magmatism and extension mark the beginnings of the orogeny, while during the later phase sedimentary rocks at the continental margin were deformed, metamorphosed and intruded with granite batholiths. Interpretations of rock forms in Antarctica during the 1980s suggested a westward-dipping subduction zone may have formed along the paleo-Pacific Ocean shoreline of East Antarctica. This is inferred from a large number of I-type and S-type granitoids which are similar to large circum-Pacific batholiths. During the Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician, 450-520 Ma, Cambrian sediments within the Transantarctic Mountains were uplifted, folded, metamorphosed, and intruded by granitoid batholiths. Evidence of this origin may be found in the Shackleton Range, the Pensacola Mountains, Thiel Mountains, Horlick Mountains, and the Queen Maud Mountains.

Newcomers Ajay, Sriji and Rakshai were cast to play the lead roles alongside Riyaz Khan and Anu Haasan. The film did not have an interval, songs or fights. Speaking of the film, the director said, \\"Since I do not want the screenplay to slow down, I decided to have no interval\\". The camera was handled by Chitti Babu, Sriram composed the background score and G. B. Venkatesh edited the film. Reception Behindwoods rated the film 3 out 5 and wrote, \\"There are some holes in the plot, the acting is uneven (since it involves so many novices) and the climax goes a little wrong. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise deftly conceived and shot thriller. Akku could blaze a new trend in Kollywood of taut genre thrillers, minus songs and dances\\". Sify said, \\"Akku is an attempt at a different type of thriller not seen in Tamil film genre which has human emotions and cinematic heroism to keep the audiences engrossed\\". Indiaglitz wrote, \\"'Akku' is a different attempt in Tamil by a set of newcomers. Maamani and his team should be commended for their effort to make a film which provides thrilling entertainment without adhering to the set rules of commercial films\\". Nowrunning rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and stated, \\"Sri Ram's background score is apt for a thriller. Chittibabu's camera work and Venkatesh's crisp editing enhance quality. Slick and action-packed, \\"Akku\\" is a new experience in Tamil cinema\\". Another reviewer rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Though there are one or two loopholes, the film overall was a great effort and the makers should be appreciated to come up with something so fresh and daring from the regular mainstream cinema\\". Another critic said, \\"It has many good twists and turns that will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat! It seems that the director has been influenced by thrillers like Speed, and he reworks perfectly and presents with an apt screenplay\\".

The aircraft is monitored and controlled by an aircrew in the Ground Control Station, including weapons employment. Bayraktar means \\"ensign\\" or \\"standard-bearer\\" in Turkish. The development of the UAV has been largely credited to Selçuk Bayraktar, a former MIT student. The aircraft relies heavily on imported and regulated components and technologies, such as the engines (manufactured by Rotax in Austria), missile rack (UK) and optoelectronics (FLIR sensors imported from Wescam in Canada or Hensoldt from Germany), some of which have been targeted by sanctions in response to Turkey's belligerence abroad. Development The development of the Bayraktar TB2 had been spurred by a U.S. ban on exports of armed unmanned aircraft to Turkey due to concerns they would be used against PKK groups inside and outside Turkey. The Bayraktar TB2 first flew in August 2014.Haber7 18 December 2015 On 18 December 2015, a video was published for the missile test of Bayraktar TB2.Youtube May I present to you eventually, 100% Turkish manufactured armed UAV: BAYRAKTAR TB2 Baykar signed a deal with Qatar in March 2018 to manufacture six drones for the Qatari forces. In January 2018, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject on the purchase of 12 Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and 3 ground control stations worth $69 million for the Ukrainian army. Ukraine received the first batch of UAVs in March 2019.  Operational history  Iraq According to Turkey’s defence ministry, Bayraktar TB2 was used to kill PKK militants across the border in Iraq in early November 2019.  Libya  In June 2019, international news media reported that the Libyan Government of National Accord used Bayraktar to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army. Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2 UCAV are being used over Tripoli by the UN recognized government. The LNA general Haftar's forces, on the other hand, claimed to have destroyed one UAV in Mitiga airport. Video evidence shows at-least one Bayraktar TB2 flying over Tripoli about to land at Mitiga's Military section, under control of GNA-allied forces. Turkish TB2s have continued to see wide scale use in western Libya, targeting LNA fighters. The LNA routinely reports downing of Turkish drones, claiming to shoot down six in one week. In December 2019, the LNA claimed to have shot down two Turkish TB2 UAVs in Ain Zarah near Tripoli. On 31 March 2020, Libyan National Army shot down another Turkish Bayraktar TB2 combat drone near the Libyan city of Tripoli. On 5 April 2020 an Antonov An-26 transport plane was destroyed on an airstrip near Tarhuna, Libya. Forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA) reported that it had shot an Antonov cargo plane carrying ammunition for Libyan National Army (LNA) militias. LNA confirmed the attack but stated that the aircraft carried medical supplies. It was reported unconfirmedly that the aircraft was hit by fire from a Bayraktar TB2 drone.https://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=20200405-0 Sunday 5 April 2020 On April 17, 2020, a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 Drone shot down near Bani Walid. In the 3rd week of May 2020, Libyan National Army's Pantsir missile system has reportedly shot down two of Government of National Accord’s Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 combat drones. One near Tarhuna city and the another one near Jebel Sherif. Until 1 July 2020, a total of 17 Bayraktars TB2 drones were reported shot down or lost on Libya during six months of fighting. Other sources place the number of losses at 20 TB2s confirmed as destroyed since 2019.  Syria  The Bayraktar TB2 along with Anka-S UAVs as well as an array of electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following the heavy losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end February 2020. The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer. In one week, Turkish drones took out 73 Syrian armed vehicles. Russian sources alleged that the Russian-backed Syrian air defence had downed seven Bayraktar TB2 UAVs by 5 March 2020. The drones are reportedly armed with MAM-C and MAM-L ‘micro- munitions’ with ranges up to 8.6 miles. On 18 March 2020, a team of the ANNA News news agency reported the finding of the wreck of a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 shot down in Saraqib.  Operations against PKK in Turkey and northern Iraq  On 2 July 2018, A Turkish Air Force Bayraktar TB-2S crashed most likely due to engine failure in Hatay province.  Azerbaijan  In June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had taken the decision to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey. During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Bayraktar TB2s have been used against Armed Forces of Armenia and against military posts of Armenia with great success. According to Azerbaijan Department of Defense, 2 S300 air defense systems were destroyed by TB-2s.  Nagorno Karabakh  During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, it was reported that some of S-300 missile systems owned by Armenian Army were destroyed by Bayraktar TB2s. On 19 October 2020, a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s was shot down by air defense weapons of Armenian Army over the skies of Nagorno Karabakh.Տեսնես՝ ինչքա՞ն «Բայրաքթար» ունեն  Operators  * * * : 6 operational TB2 Drones * : 110 operational TB2 Drones * : 6 operational TB2 Drones  Specifications (Bayraktar TB2)  MAM L Data from official Baykar Defence Website.

Description Females have red markings on both the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the abdomen, unlike any other African Latrodectus species. They have parallel spermathecae and the copulatory ducts have three loops. The embolus of males has four loops and there are white markings on the ventral surface of the abdomen that darken with age. The large smooth egg sacs are bright purple when freshly laid, fading to shiny grey as they dry. Habitat The species is only known to occur in the critically endangered lowland sand forest biome of northern KwaZulu-Natal. These forests are threatened by illegal clearing for farming as well as wood collection. The females build nests in trees and stumps more than 50 centimetres above ground, which is higher than most other members of the genus.

She was appointed by Governor of Guam Lou Leon Guerrero in 2019. She is the first female officer to lead the Guam National Guard in its history. As the Adjutant General, she is responsible for leading and coordinating the use of the Guam National Guard in both territorial and federal matters. Education Esther Aguigui graduated from George Washington High School in Mangilao, Guam in 1980. She earned a B.A. in Education from the University of Guam in 1989. Aguigui also earned a M.A. in Strategic Studies from the United States Army War College in 2017. Military career Esther Aguigui began her military career in 1985, enlisting in the United States Air Force Reserve as an administrative specialist. She served in the Air Force Reserve until 1997 when she transferred to the Guam Air National Guard to become the first female First Sergeant in Guam's history. In 2000 she was direct commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Guam Army National Guard and became an Adjutant General officer. From 2006-2007 Aguigui was deployed to Afghanistan as a counterintelligence officer. She was also deployed to assist with the Hurricane Katrina response in 2006. From there, Aguigui then became the first female officer to command a battalion level unit in the Guam National Guard when she commanded the Recruiting and Retention Battalion from 2014-2016. She then became the first female from the Guam National Guard to attend and graduate the resident course of the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Adjutant General Guam National Guard Adjutant General Major General (GU) Esther Aguigui delivers remarks during a Memorial Day ceremony at the Guam Veterans Cemetery in Piti May 27 (U.S. Navy photo by Alana Chargualaf.) On January 27th, 2019, Guam Governor Lou Leon Guerrero nominated Lieutenant Colonel Esther Aguigui to be the next Adjutant General of Guam, replacing Brigadier General Roderick R. Leon Guerrero who had been serving as Adjutant General since 2015. The appointment was met with controversy as to whether or not Aguigui met the qualifications and rank to take command of the Guam National Guard, and due to a letter of reprimand issued to her by the outgoing Adjutant General. The reprimand was later found to have been inappropriately issued. However her rank caused Brigadier General Diron J. Cruz, the current Assistant Adjutant General to resign to avoid being subordinate to a lower ranking officer. To address this issue, the Guam Government state that Adjutant General is a position and not a rank. While awaiting formal approval by the Guam Legislature, Aguigui was promoted to the state-level rank of Colonel on March 15, 2019 by Governor Guerrero. Her federal recognition as a Colonel is pending, due to undisclosed reasons despite a personal appeal from the Governor of Guam. Aguigui was unanimously approved by the Guam Legislature as the Adjutant General on April 16th, 2019. Governor Guerrero promoted Aguigui to the rank of Major General of the Guam Militia on May 5th, 2019. Her promotion has proven controversial as Guam law states that \\"No person shall be a member of the Guam Militia while a federally recognized member of the National Guard, or any active or reserve military organization.\\" and Major General (GU) Agugui continues to hold a federally recognized rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Aguigui has also received criticism for her staff picks and leadership from members of the Guam National Guard in letters sent to the Governor of Guam. Civilian career  From 1985 until 2001, Aguigui worked as a teacher at George Washington High School in Mangilao and Agueda Johnston Middle School in Chalan Pago-Ordot, Guam for the Guam Department of Education.

Its name derives from a catastrophe in a shore part called Vorstadt, in which the lake shore broke on 5 July 1887 and flooded residential buildings.  Description  The Katastrophenbucht is about 150 meters long and extends about 70 meters into the shore. It covers the area of the bridge Vorstadtbrücke, which is flanked to the west of the landing stage Zug Bahnhofsteg of the Zugersee Schifffahrt, and to the east of the Rigiecke. It is part of the boulevard Vorstadt. In 1998, designed the 112-meter-long bay front with Trompe-l'œil, a color field painting: three warm and two cold color fields (or vice versa) face each other. Twenty-one hues have been contrasted in such a way that the colors of warm yellow-orange on the side of the Vorstadtquai, into violet, green and red, and finally the direction of the Alpenquai run into a cool blue. Cogliatti arranged the colored surfaces together to create illusionist interruptions, niches and windows in the wall, creating an imaginary living and living space, a ″colorful city″. Behind the bay is the Rigiplatz, whose artistic conception by Anton Egloff (1995) is also reminiscent of the 1887 catastrophe.  History  The 1887 disaster: roofs of sunken houses The Vorstadt (an ancient suburb of Zug) was built on geotechnically unstable sea chalk. The East-West Railway Company wanted to realize a quaiproject there from the 1860s. The project contract went to the engineer Franz Karl Stadlin, Karl Pestalozzi prepared a first report for this project, and the construction projects of the Quaianlage were politically discussed for decades. In the 1880s, the works began. Cracks on the shore prompted the city council to instruct the engineers Albert Heim and Robert Moser with a technical analysis, which was completed in July 1884; their report strongly criticized the project. Because of the influence of the municipal minister of construction Clemens Henggeler, the critical report of Heim and Moser were hardly discussed in the city council, and the work was continued. Map of the Katastrophenbucht after the 1887 disaster On the day of the catastrophe, 5 July 1887, the subsoil lost its strength at the site of the Quai. In the afternoon, several buildings collapsed on the shore, several people died. A second flooding followed in the evening: Shortly before seven o'clock the walls of the suburb of Zug Vorstadt faltered, the inhabitants fled in panic as the houses collapsed and sank in the lake. In total, eleven people died, about 650 people were homeless, and 35 buildings were destroyed. A bay about 150 meters long opened up, which reached about 70 meters into the land. In the bay roofs of sunken houses looked out, household goods, beams and furniture swam in the lake. The breakthrough caused a huge wave, which washed a steamship ashore. After a few days, disaster tourism began; onlookers, who came from far away, were driven on ships to the demolition zone for 40 Centimes. In the northern area of the disaster zone, a memorial stone with a poem by Isabelle Kaiser remembers since 1887 to the disaster. Following the disaster, the Rigiplatz was realized by Robert Moser in 1891. In addition, the surrounding houses were demolished at the \\"Neue Quai\\" and created the Rössliwiese for security reasons.

She was the wife of William Jennings Bryan. Life and work Mary Elizabeth Baird was born on June 17, 1861 in Perry, Illinois, the daughter of John and Lovina Baird. Her father owned a general store. Mary Elizabeth began attending Jacksonville Female Academy at the age of 18, called the \\"Jail for Angels\\" by locals. In 1879, a student at Illinois College named William Jennings Bryan met and began courting her.Kazin (2006), pp. 13–14 Bryan and Mary Elizabeth married on October 1, 1884.Colletta (1964), p. 30. Mary Elizabeth would emerge as an important part of Bryan's career, managing his correspondence and helping him prepare speeches and articles. Mary passed the bar exam and learned German in order to help his career. Mary moved to Lincoln, Nebraska in 1888, and her husband was elected to Congress two years later. In 1896, her husband decided to run for president. A female reporter was assigned to Mary to report on her specifically. Author Willa Cather was skeptical of William but praised Mary. Mary Bryan joined her husband in late September; on The Idler, a private railway car procured by the DNC, and the Bryans were able to eat and sleep in relative comfort.Jones (1964) pp. 311–312 William and Mary Bryan returned to Lincoln, Nebraska on November 1, two days before the election, though he continued campaigning.Jones (1964), pp. 316–317 After the election, which her husband lost, Mary wrote a biographical sketch of her husband in \\"The First Battle: A Story of the Campaign of 1896\\", which became a best-seller. He would run for president in 1900 and 1908 and lost those campaigns as well. In January 1901, Bryan published the first issue of his weekly newspaper, The Commoner, and though Bryan served as the editor and publisher of the newspaper, Charles Bryan, Mary Bryan and Richard Metcalfe performed editorial duties when Bryan was traveling. The Commoner became one of the most widely- read newspapers of its era and content from the papers was frequently reprinted by major newspapers in the Northeast. In 1902, Bryan, his wife and his three children moved into Fairview, a mansion located in Lincoln; Bryan referred to the house as the \\"Monticello of the West,\\" and frequently invited politicians and diplomats to visit.Kazin (2006), pp. 111–113 The family embarked on a world tour in 1905, visiting 18 countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. A newspaper wrote that Mary \\"has probably traveled over more countries and met more kinds of people than any other woman in the United States.\\" William Jennings Bryan and wife Mary in New York City, June 19, 1915 To help Mary cope with her worsening health during the harsh winters of Nebraska, the Bryans bought a farm in Mission, Texas in 1909.Kazin (2006), p. 170 Due to Mary's arthritis, in 1912 the Bryans began building a new home in Miami, Florida, known as Villa Serena. The Bryans made Villa Serena their permanent home, while Charles Bryan continued to oversee The Commoner from Lincoln. The Bryans were active citizens in Miami, leading a fundraising drive for the YMCA and frequently hosting the public at their home.Kazin (2006), pp. 245–247 William was named secretary of state by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913 but resigned in 1915 after Wilson's strong response to the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. In 1916, Mary moved the household to Miami full-time and became a leader in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She led a speaking tour of the state on behalf of the suffrage association in 1917. The tour was a hit with reporters, with The Daytona Daily News praising her sweet voice and personality. Mary agreed with the traditional notion that the proper place for a woman was in the home but they should still be allowed to cast a ballot twice a year. In April 1917, she delivered an hour and a half speech to the Florida legislature in favor of a constitutional amendment to enfranchise women.

A previously little known politician, Ciolacu came into national prominence when he was propped up by a former leader of the Social-Democratic Party to become deputy prime minister in 2018 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Mihai Tudose. Initially given this office in order to control Tudose and report of his activities to Liviu Dragnea (who had been unable to become prime minister himself and was wary of Tudose becoming a power player in the party), Ciolacu soon broke with Dragnea and became an ally of Tudose against Dragnea's leadership. When Tudose was forced to resign from office due to Dragnea's scheming, Ciolacu was marginalized. He once more returned to prominence in 2019 after Liviu Dragnea had been convicted on corruption charges and sent to prison to serve a 3 years, 6 months sentence. With the Social Democrats still controlling a weak majority both in the Chamber and in the Senate, Ciolacu was propped up by the new leadership to become the President of the Chamber of Deputies, succeeding Dragnea himself just one day after the latter's incarceration. Ciolacu maintained a low profile until the new leader of the PSD Viorica Dăncilă was overwhelmingly defeated in the 2019 Romanian presidential election. He joined with other PSD territory leaders to stage her downfall. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Ciolacu visited Dăncilă at home in order to convince her to step down as party leader. Seemingly unsuccessful, Ciolacu and other party leaders forced a special party committee, where Dăncilă and the rest of her leadership were convinced to resign, lest they be excluded from the party. In the aftermath, Ciolacu was named leader of the party ad-interim, until a party congress would select a leader in February 2020. Biography Early life and education Marcel Ciolacu was born in Buzău as the son of Ion Ciolacu, a career military pilot. In 1995 he is thought to have graduated the Ecological University of Bucharest, even though that university only received its authorization later that year. In 2008 he attended a programme in Security and National Defence at the National College of Defence in Bucharest, a university regarded in the Romanian press as \\"diploma-factory\\", where many other high and low-profile politicians have also received allegedly fraudulent degrees. In 2012 he completed a master's programme in the Management of the Public Sector at the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration. Political career Ciolacu is a founding member of PSD, back when the party was known as the National Salvation Front, in the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the early nineties, Ciolacu climbed the steps in local politics and by 1996 he became the second-in-command of the Youth Organization of the party. His political mentors were Senator Ion Vasile and Buzău Mayor Constantin Boșcodeală. He remained little known, however, until the mid-2000s. In 2005 he was for several months the interim prefect of Buzau, after which he became, in turn, director of Urbis Serv and deputy mayor of Buzau (2008-2012). As deputy mayor, he was the close associate of Constantin Boșcodeală, mayor of Buzau 1996-2016. Boșcodeală was convicted in 2015 for abuse of office during the period 2002-2008, by diverting public funds to a football team and other private companies of which he was a shareholder. Boșcodeală was condemned to 5 years imprisonment (later suspended) and prohibition from future public office. Ciolacu entered national politics in 2012 when he was first elected for a deputy seat in Parliament. In 2015 he was elected PSD president for Buzau county, replacing his mentor Boscodeala who stepped down while being investigated for corruption. Ciolacu's election was controversial. He ran against his former mentor, Senator Vasile Ion, who eventually withdrew from the race, accusing Ciolacu of rigging the internal elections. Ciolacu was re-elected to Parliament in 2016. In 2017, almost completely unknown on the national political stage, Ciolacu was named deputy prime minister in the cabinet led by Mihai Tudose. Tudose's predecessor, Sorin Grindeanu was ousted from his position by PSD itself, a move instigated by Liviu Dragnea, then-leader of the party and of the Chamber of Deputies. Dragnea, unable to become prime minister himself in the aftermath of the landslide victory of PSD in the 2016 Romanian legislative election because of a suspended conviction for electoral fraud in 2012, was forced to find a suitable candidate for the office of prime minister, but he needed that someone to be loyal to him on a personal level. Grindeanu gradually broke off with Dragnea during his premiership, and by May 2017 the relationship between the two had deteriorated irreparably. As a consequence, Grindeanu was ordered to resign by Dragnea, an order which he refused, citing his responsibility as leader of the Executive, and not merely a party pawn. Unable to find other ways to replace Grindeanu, Dragnea ordered all other ministers in his cabinet to resign, which they did on 15 June, but not even this could make Grindeanu resign. Grindeanu was determined to fight with Dragnea until the end for control of both the party and his premiership. Nevertheless, a motion of no confidence instigated by PSD against its own government was successful. It passed with 241 votes, 8 votes more than the required 233 threshold. Grindeanu's ousting did not leave Dragnea's power unquestioned. Previously, the government had held a 295 majority, now it was reduced to a mere 241. For the first time, Dragnea was facing strong dissent in the party at the prospect that President Klaus Iohannis would not name another PSD member to become prime minister, electing instead to force early elections. Since the procedure of calling early elections laid down in the Constitution of Romania is complicated and difficult to trigger, and seeing PSD still had the necessary majority to form another government, the president decided to name Mihai Tudose, Dragnea's newest proposal as prime minister. Tudose was not, however, Dragnea's first choice and the PSD leader needed to find ways to control him better than Grindeanu, who had shown him that the office of prime minister was strong enough to allow its holder to wrestle his power in the party away from him. For this reason, Ciolacu was named deputy prime minister in the Tudose Cabinet, in order to become Dragnea's ears in the government. Like Tudose himself and Grindeanu before him, however, Ciolacu did not stay loyal to Dragnea for long. By the autumn of 2017, Ciolacu had entered Tudose's grasp and was now fully loyal to the prime minister. The relationship between Tudose and Dragnea started deteriorating rapidly, as had been the case with Grindeanu, but the two maintained publicly that there was no strain between them. By then, Ciolacu was firmly in the Tudose camp. Tudose soon declared publicly that there was only one person whom he would not tolerate being removed from his cabinet: Ciolacu. In January 2018, Tudose attempted to take full control of his government by asking the resignation of his Interior minister, Carmen Dan, a Dragnea mouthpiece and loyal lieutenant. As it became quite apparent that this was another power struggle between the prime minister and the leader of the SDP, Ciolacu publicly positioned himself in the Tudose camp. Dragnea once again convened a special party meeting in order to force Tudose's resignation. Seeing that a majority of the party remained loyal to Dragnea, Tudose decided to resign to evade a motion of no confidence like his predecessor. Ciolacu handed in his own resignation from the government shortly thereafter. After leaving the Executive, Ciolacu returned to his deputy seat in Parliament. Throughout 2018 and the first half 2019 he stayed out of the spotlight while persisting in the opposition. against Dragnea's leadership. In October 2018, the press reported an alleged physical altercation in Parliament between Ciolacu and Dragnea, but both denied the claim. On 27 May 2019, Liviu Dragnea was convicted of abuse of power and sentenced to 3 years and six months in prison. This vacated his position as President of the Chamber of Deputies and his leadership position in the party. Ciolacu emerged once more in the public eye, seeking a path to top party leadership. The party's new leader, Viorica Dăncilă, the third prime minister named by Dragnea, was now looking for ways to cement her leadership of the party. For this, she sought the support of Ciolacu and other former opponents of Dragnea. Ciolacu accepted her offer to sponsor him as president of the Chamber of Deputies, succeeding Dragnea himself. On 29 May 2019, Ciolacu was voted the new head of the Chamber. However, his election was won only narrowly and with the support of the PSD-breakaway party, PRO Romania, and its member, former Prime Minister Mihai Tudose. Controversies = Mecan Construct Investigation = In 2009, the Court of Accounts Buzau found that a construction company in the municipality of Buzau, Urbis Serv, headed by Marcel Ciolacu between 2007 and 2008, caused an approximately €1.3 million overcharge for street and sidewalk construction projects through an illegal contract with a company owned by a party colleague. The company, Mecan Construct, was owned by former PSD County Councilor Dumitru Dobrică. Ciolacu was accused of conflict of interest causing damages to the municipality by inflating the Mecan contract by approximately 1.3 million euros. Marcel Ciolacu stated that the ruling of the Buzău Court of Accounts was challenged in court. He stated that a criminal investigation file at the National Anticorruption Directorate Ploiești, in which the allegations regarding the contract with Mecan Construct were investigated, concluded without starting criminal proceedings against him. =Relationship with Omar Hayssam= Marcel Ciolacu was involved in a media scandal in May 2015 after a 20-year-old photograph of him with Omar Hayssam appeared in the press. In approximately 2005, Ciolacu and Hayssam had been attending a hunting party organized by the Buzau Forestry Directorate. In 2006, Omar Hayssam masterminded the kidnapping and holding for ransom of three Romanian journalists in Iraq, for which Hayssam was convicted in 2007 by the Bucharest Court of Appeal to 24 years, four months imprisonment. In addition, there was evidence that Ciolacu appeared on a list of Hayssam's debtors: In the early 2000s, Hayssam appears to have loaned Ciolacu 200 million old lei (20,000 RON). As a result of the scandal, Prime Minister Victor Ponta removed Ciolacu from the position of honorary adviser to the prime minister. As leader of the Social-Democratic Party As leader of the Lower Chamber, Ciolacu kept a reserved and non-vocal stance. In October 2019, a motion of no confidence was initiated by the PNL- led opposition that successfully removed Dăncilă from power, even though Ciolacu maintained that the Dăncilă Cabinet would not fall. Subsequently, he reluctantly supported Viorica Dăncilă's bid to the presidency of Romania but after her failure and her historically weak result, Ciolacu went on to take control of the party. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Marcel Ciolacu personally visited Dăncilă in her home and asked her to peacefully resign from the party's leadership, offering her an MP seat in the next legislative election. Having initially refused, Dăncilă mulled the offer throughout the day, and on 26 November 2019 she decided to call another special party meeting where she hoped to convince the local party leaders, who were determined to oust her, to let her retain the leadership of the PSD. Ciolacu's plan was to force the dissolution of the entire leadership, so that he could become the party's interim leader. Several local party leaders resigned during the meeting in order to force Dăncilă's resignation. Dăncilă, after changing her mind twice throughout the day, decided to finally resign. Even though by the party's statute, the next in line to assume the interim leadership of the party was Eugen Teodorovici, a Dăncilă loyalist and former Minister of Finance, Ciolacu was able to become the party's leader by securing the dissolution of the entire party leadership. Following his becoming leader of the party, he announced that PSD will be led through collective leadership and that a congress will be organized in February, by which a full leader will be appointed. Ciolacu was expected to run for a full term as leader of PSD at its Congress on February 29, 2020, however the Congress was postponed to March 21 due to the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic in Romania. In early March, they announced plans to move the Congress online in light of the epidemic-related ban of gatherings of more than 1000 people.

As a two-year-old in 2018 she showed promising for as she won two minor races from five starts. In the following year she was beaten in four races in Britain but the showed top class form over sprint distances when she was campaigned in France later in the year. She won the Prix Moonlight Cloud and the Prix du Petit Couvert before recording her biggest victory in the Group 1 Prix de l'Abbaye. Background Glass Slippers is a bay filly with a large, diamond-shaped white star bred and owned by the Shropshire-based Bearstone Stud. She was sent into training with Kevin Ryan at Hambleton in North Yorkshire. The filly has been ridden in most of her races by Tom Eaves. She was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Dream Ahead, an outstanding sprinter from the Godolphin Arabian sire-line whose wins included the Prix Morny, Middle Park Stakes, July Cup, Haydock Sprint Cup and Prix de la Forêt. As a breeding stallion, his other progeny have included Donjuan Triumphant (British Champions Sprint Stakes) and Al Wukair (Prix Jacques Le Marois). Glass Slippers' dam Night Gypsy showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from four attempts. She was descended from the British broodmare Shellshock who was a half-sister to Dibidale and to the dam of Tony Bin Racing career 2018: two-year-old season On 7 June Glass Slippers made her debut in a five furlong maiden race at Haydock Park for which she started a 50/1 outsider and finished third to Angel's Hideaway, beaten four and a quarter lengths by the winner. Franny Norton took the ride when the filly ran sixth in a similar event over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August after being repeatedly denied a clear run. Two weeks later she went off the 5/4 favourite for a minor race at Beverley Racecourse and recorded her first success as she took the lead a furlong from the finish and came home two lengths clear of her rivals. On 1 September Glass Slippers started at 3/1 for a more competitive race over six furlongs at Chester Racecourse and won \\"a shade comfortably\\" by a neck from Light My Fire after going to the front in the last 75 yards. Three weeks later the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Firth of Clyde Stakes on heavy ground at Ayr Racecourse and finished sixth to Queen of Bermuda after tiring in the closing stages. 2019: three-year-old season Glass Slippers made no impact on her first appearance of 2019 as she trailed home fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Dandhu in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury on 13 April after losing both of her front shoes in the race. In the Listed Cecil Frail Stakes at Haydock in May she was matched against older fillies and mares and produced a better effort as she came home fifth behind Forever In Dreams, beaten just over two lengths by the winner. On 22 June she dropped back to five furlongs for the Listed Land O'Burns Fillies' Stakes at Ayr and was beaten a neck by the five-year-old mare Rebecca Rocks in a race which saw the first two finishers racing on opposite sides of the course. At York Racecourse on 12 July she finished fourth to Royal Intervention in the Group 3 Summer Stakes. After four consecutive defeats in Britain, Glass Slippers was sent to France to contest the Listed Prix Moonlight Cloud over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 4 August and started a 10/1 outsider in an eight- runner field. She was in contention from the start, went to the front 300 metres from the finish and held off a challenge from Bravo Sierra to win by a neck, despite being forced to the right by the runner-up in the closing stages. On 15 September the filly returned to France for the Group 3 Prix du Petit Couvert over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and went off at odds of 14.9/1 in a twelve-runner field headed by the Prix de Saint-Georges winner Sestilio Jet. Glass Slippers started slowly and looked outpaced in the early stages before beginning to make headway in the last 300 metres and overtook Shades of Blue (another British-trained three-year-old filly) in the final strides to win by a short neck. Glass Slippers started at odds of 12.8/1 when she was stepped up to Group 1 for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp on 6 October. Battaash was made the odds-on favourite while the other fourteen runners included Fairyland, Mabs Cross, Shades of Blue, Sestilio Jet, Spinning Memories (Prix de Meautry), Soldier's Call (Flying Childers Stakes), Invincible Army (Duke of York Stakes) So Perfect (Lacken Stakes) and Finsbury Square (Prix du Gros Chêne). Glass Slippers took the lead after 300 metres and was never headed, drawing away from her rivals in the closing stages to come home three lengths clear of So Perfect. After the race Tom Eaves said \\"We were a bit concerned about the ground, but she jumped really well, travelled through the race well and I knew she'd stay. The team at home have kept her in tip-top shape all year, which is hard with fillies, and all she's done is improve.\\" 2020: four-year-old season The flat racing season in Britain and Ireland was restructured as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and Glass Slippers made her first appearance of the year in the King's Stand Stakes which was run behind closed doors at Royal Ascot on 16 June. Starting the third choice in the betting she tracked the leaders but was unable to make any significant progress in the last quarter mile and came home fifth of the eleven runners behind Battaash.

This measure was created in 2003 by the Health Action International (HAI) and World Health Organization (WHO) as a standard measure to facilitate national and international comparisons of drug prices. In the WHO/HAI systematic methodology, the same provider of international reference unit price \\"must be used for all medicines surveyed – global, regional and supplementary\\", to ensure a consistent basis for comparison. Some authors criticized the MPR, as it can be skewed by the international reference price. For example, a 10% MPR for a $10 reference price yields an absolute price variation of $1, whereas for a $200 reference price the variation would be $20. To solve this issue, the WHO/HAI recommend to check the international reference price when very high or low MPR variations are observed. The MPR has been used in several studies investigating the availability and variation of medication prices, and the effects of various medication pricing policies.

Retrieved 26 July 2020. In recognition of this legacy, the emerging vision for the project was to create a building \\"paying homage to the slim stylish skyscrapers of New York.\\" Buildings from both cities influenced the form of The Lexington; elevations of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and Liver Building as well as an old, iconic transportation link between the cities, a Cunard Cruise Liner, all contributed towards the architectural approach.PRINCES REACH PUBLIC EXHIBITION. Moda Living. April 2016. Retrieved 26 July 2020. The proportionality and elegance of the Empire State Building was considered particularly appealing. The architects' main observation was the commonality of a protrusion or \\"beacon\\" arising from the top and middle of the main body of each elevation referenced. Thus it was decided such a feature would be the main design element of The Lexington, including a specific \\"lighting strategy\\" to \\"accentuate the presence of the beacon\\". The New York based modernist works of Mies van der Rohe, such as Lever House and the Seagram Building were also studied to determine the attributes needed for The Lexington to successfully echo the city's high-rises. Conclusions included the need for strong vertical lines in order to accentuate the elegance and slenderness of The Lexington, with a much weaker emphasis on horizontal elements. An \\"unfussy form\\" was also seen necessary to stress the building's vertically. Consequently, it was decided to use an aesthetic illusion to emphasise The Lexington's slimness by splitting the building, visually, into three distinct, narrower vertical sections with articulation of the bounding edges. New York influences also contributed to the final Americanised name for the building. Internally, the residential units are a mix of studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apartments. The main building is abutted by a car park which is topped by a roof terrace, forming part of the 15,000 sq ft of amenity space; also included is a gym, cinema room, 17th floor sky lounge, community dining and kitchen, cycle parking, and work space.The Lexington to bring New York style living to Liverpool waterfront.

Formed in June 1976, the group originally consisted of vocalist Dave Vanian, guitarist Brian James, bassist Raymond \\"Captain Sensible\\" Burns and drummer Christopher \\"Rat Scabies\\" Millar. The band's current lineup includes Vanian, Sensible (on guitar; from 1976 to 1984, 1988 to 1992, and since 1996), bassist Paul Gray (from 1980 to 1983, 1989 to 1992, in 1996, and since 2017), and keyboardist Laurence \\"Monty Oxymoron\\" Burrow (since 1996). The group are currently without a drummer, since recent member Andrew \\"Pinch\\" Pinching's departure in October 2019. History 1976–1989 The Damned were formed by Dave Vanian, Brian James, Captain Sensible and Rat Scabies in June 1976. After the release of their debut album Damned Damned Damned, Robert \\"Lu\\" Edmonds was added as a second guitarist in August 1977. This lineup recorded Music for Pleasure, although Scabies had left the band by the time it was released. After a handful of shows with temporary substitute Dave Berk, the band replaced Scabies for a European tour the following month with Jon Moss. Music for Pleasure was a commercial failure, which led to the Damned being dropped by their label Stiff Records and breaking up in early 1978. In the following months, Vanian, Sensible (on guitar) and Scabies performed a handful of shows as the Doomed, with Motörhead frontman Lemmy filling in on bass. In January 1979, the Damned officially reformed with Alasdair \\"Algy\\" Ward (formerly of Australian band the Saints) taking over the vacated bass role. Machine Gun Etiquette was issued later in the year, before Ward was replaced by Paul Gray in early 1980. After the release of The Black Album, the band added Paul Scott as their first live keyboardist. He was replaced in July 1981 by Pete Saunders, who subsequently made way for Roman Jugg in November, after Saunders's initially chosen replacement Tosh was unable to join. As a five- piece lineup for the first time, the group issued Friday 13th in 1981, Strawberries in 1982, and Live at Newcastle in 1983. In March 1983, however, Gray left to join UFO, with Bryn Merrick (a former bandmate of Jugg's in the group Victimize) taking his place. Before a show on 24 August 1984, Captain Sensible left the Damned to focus on his solo career, with Jugg taking over as lead guitarist and Steve McGuire of Doctor and the Medics temporarily filling in on keyboards. The group subsequently continued as a four-piece, with the addition of Paul \\"Shirley\\" Shepley as touring keyboardist. After the release of Phantasmagoria and Anything, the Damned were dropped by MCA Records. The band continued performing live, before the original quartet reformed for part of a special show in June 1988 which was later issued as Final Damnation. Sensible and James continued to tour with the existing lineup (with Gray in place of Bryn), performing select songs at shows during 1989. After a final farewell tour in the UK and US, the group disbanded later in the year. 1991 onwards The Damned's breakup was short-lived, however, as they embarked on a reunion tour just two years later. After a few shows into the September 1991 run, Brian James left the band suddenly following an argument with Captain Sensible and Rat Scabies, and the remaining members continued as a four-piece. The Damned essentially disbanded again after a short run of European shows in 1992, before Dave Vanian and Scabies introduced a new incarnation of the group in December 1993 featuring guitarists Kris Dollimore and Alan Lee Shaw, and bassist Jason \\"Moose\\" Harris. Shortly after the release of Not of This Earth in late 1995, Scabies left the Damned and Vanian reunited with Captain Sensible and his solo band – bassist Paul Gray, drummer Garrie Dreadful and keyboardist Monty Oxymoron. Gray was replaced by Vanian's wife Patricia Morrison in time for a Japanese tour starting in September 1996, after he sustained an injury during a show. After three years of sustained touring, Dreadful was replaced in early 1999 by Spike Smith, who made way just a few months later for former English Dogs drummer Andrew \\"Pinch\\" Pinching. The group released their first studio album in six years, Grave Disorder, in 2001, before Morrison left the Damned after giving birth to daughter Emily on 9 February 2004. She was replaced by Stu West, a former bandmate of Pinch's in English Dogs. The addition of West began a long period of stability for the Damned, who released their tenth studio album So, Who's Paranoid? in 2008 and a series of live albums in subsequent years. In September 2017, it was announced that Paul Gray had returned to the band for the upcoming album Evil Spirits and all future tour dates. Following the album's touring cycle, Pinch left in October 2019.

The Midland Railway had long been dominant in the area, but there was resentment against its monopolistic policies from coalowners, who encouraged the Great Northern Railway to build a line. The Leen Valley Line was opened in 1881; it ran as far as Annesley colliery. A passenger service was run the following year, and very considerable volumes of coal were hauled. Coal owners in areas further north made representations to the Great Northern Railway, which agreed to extend the line, and the Leen Valley Extension Line opened in 1892. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had built a line on a nearby alignment including a long tunnel, and to avoid the cost of duplicating the tunnel, the GNR arranged to use the MS&LR; tunnel to connect its Extension line to the original section. At its northern extremity, the line connected to the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway at Shirebrook. A passenger operation was worked on the Extension line too, but again coal traffic was massively dominant. In fact the passenger service was discontinued in 1931. In the 1960s and 1970s coal production in the area declined steeply, and the duplication of railway routes in the area meant that rationalisation was inevitable: it was the former GNR lines that bore the brunt of this. In the 1980s plans were formulated to reopen a passenger train service from Nottingham to Mansfield; this was to be mainly on the former Midland Railway route, but a short section of the former GNR line was used around Kirkby-in-Ashfield. The new service and route, marketed as the Robin Hood Line, was opened progressively from 1995 onwards. Background The Leen Valley line in 1882The Great Northern Railway had established a terminal in Nottingham in 1857, and used the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway to reach it from its main line at Grantham. It later leased the Ambergate company.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 78 and 79 There was considerable colliery activity in the coalfields to the north and west of Nottingham, and for the time being the Midland Railway was dominant in serving the pits. The Great Northern Railway sought to share in the business of hauling the coal to southern and eastern markets; at the same time the Midland Railway went to considerable lengths to exclude the GNR from the access it sought, and in 1871 prevented the GNR from using Midland Railway lines in the area at all. This exacerbated dissatisfaction on the part of coalowners, who saw that the Midland was exploiting its monopoly of carriage of coal to their disadvantage, and they encouraged the provision of competing railway facilities. The GNR obtained Parliamentary authority for what became its Derbyshire and Staffordshire extension, a new independent railway line from the GNR line at Colwick, on the eastern margin of Nottingham. The new line was to circle round the north of Nottingham and head west, connecting in Kimberley and Ilkeston on the way to Derby and Burton on Trent, with a fork to link in Pinxton. These lines opened between 1875 and 1878.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 55 – 58 Demand for colliery connections There was also a concentration of collieries in the valley of the River Leen, which runs south from near Newstead to join the River Trent west of Nottingham. Railway connection in this area too was dominated by the Midland Railway. During the final stages of the construction of the Derbyshire lines, the GNR was receiving representations from the Leen Valley collieries. A line was surveyed and a Bill submitted for the 1880 session of Parliament. The line would be broadly parallel to the Midland Railway's Nottingham to Mansfield line.Wrottesley, volume II, pages 102 and 103Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 – 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 339 The Midland Railway saw the danger and suggested in June that if the Bill was withdrawn the charges for the use of its line would be substantially reduced. Reductions from 1s 7d down to 1s were mentioned. The GNR had suffered heavily in the past under the Midland Railway's traffic arrangements, and refused. The Leen Valley's Act was passed on 6 August 1880.Paul Anderson and Jack Cupit, An Illustrated History of Mansfield's Railways, Irwell Press, , pages 56 to 61 Leen Valley Line: construction and opening Construction was put in hand immediately: on 5 November 1880 a contractor named Lovatt undertook the work for £89,077 and to complete by 1 January 1882. Saxby and Farmer were to install the signalling. The new line was to make a junction with the Derbyshire extension line near Old Basford and run north, paralleling the Midland Railway's line from Nottingham to Mansfield. In doing so the new line crossed the Midland line twice, and connected with collieries at Bestwood, Hucknall, Linby, Newstead, and Annesley. The GNR called the branch line the Leen Valley Line, and the junction with the Derbyshire & Staffordshire Extension line was named Leen Valley Junction. From Leen Valley junction the line ran for 6 miles 53 chains to Newstead, and was double track throughout when completed. There were colliery branches to Bestwood Park, four to Hucknall Colliery, two to Linby Colliery, two to Bestwood Colliery, and two at the end of the line to Annesley Colliery. Gradients were stiff, with considerable stretches of 1 in 70 and 1 in 75. Leen Valley junction signalbox was commissioned on 9 May 1881 and in July coal traffic from Bestwood Colliery began over a single line. On 18 October the line was opened to Linby Colliery and on 27 October 1881, the line opened throughout for coal. Twelve passenger trains each way on weekdays and two on Sundays, began between Nottingham and Newstead on 2 October 1882.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume IX: The East Midlands, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 157Grinling, page 360 The result was an increase for the half-year to 31 December 1881, of over a quarter of a million tons of coal carried over the GNR system.Grinling, pages 347 and 348 MS&LR; extension to Annesley The MS&LR; Chairman, Sir Edward Watkin, had for some time been known to want to extend the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway to London. In time for the 1889 session of Parliament, the MS&LR; presented a Bill for a line from Beighton, a little east of Sheffield, southwards to Annesley, to make an end-on junction there with the GNR Leen Valley line. On the face of it the scheme looked like a harmless approach to get access to the collieries, but the GNR Board suspected that this was a move towards a London extension. Watkin also controlled the Metropolitan Railway, which reached as far north as Verney in Buckinghamshire, and in the same Session, had deposited a Bill for a line from Quainton Road to Moreton Pinkney; the gap between Annesley and Morton Pinkney was only 60 miles.Wrottesley, volume II, pages 165 to 167Grinling, pages 391 and 392 The MS&LR; denied any intention to build south from Annesley, but declined to make that a formal undertaking. Amid much railway politics, it became evident that Parliament was going to grant the MS&LR; wishes, and the GNR acquiesced, gaining running powers to Sheffield over the MS&LR; as a sweetener. The MS&LR; Annesley branch was passed on 26 July 1889. In fact the MS&LR; promise was soon proven to be false, and it had a London extension bill in the 1891 session, but with London and North Western Railway and Midland Railway as well as GNR opposition it failed. Nevertheless, it was obvious that the MS&LR; would try again the following year, and the GNR board reviewed their strategy: should they continue to oppose the scheme, or go along with it and try to get the best accommodation out of it? They reluctantly chose the latter course of action. As part of that, a Leen Valley Extension scheme was revived.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , pages 30 to 33 The MS&LR; extension southwards from Beighton reached an end-on junction with the GNR Leen Valley line at Annesley, north of Newstead, on 24 October 1892. In accordance with the agreement, MS&LR; goods and coal trains ran to Nottingham, followed by passenger trains on 2 January 1893: there were four each way via the Nottingham Suburban Railway to London Road. From 28 January, there were a few GNR passenger trains over the MS&LR; as far as Staveley, but only for a few months. The GNR obtained access to several collieries, but unfortunately for the GNR, an MS&LR-LNWR; agreement meant that the LNWR did too. Meanwhile, the fresh MS&LR; extension bill passed most stages by June 1892 but, held up when Parliament was dissolved, did not become an Act until 28 March 1893. Leen Valley Extension Line The GNR now decided that it should extend further north from Annesley, and this became the project for the Leen Valley Extension line. It was authorised on 20 June 1892, with an amending act on 29 June 1893. At this time the GNR had so many commitments that construction was delayed. Stanton Ironworks Co., which had collieries at Silverhill, Teversal and Pleasley and Sutton-in-Ashfield, asked the GNR to hurry up.Wrottesley, volume III, pages 45 to 47 As originally planned, the line would have begun at the end of the original line, at Annesley, which would have meant construction of a tunnel under Robin Hood Hills. But as the MS&LR; opened its extension to that spot through a tunnel built for their line, it was arranged that GNR trains would use the MS&LR; line through their Annesley tunnel, and then for 450 yards to South Kirkby junction, where the new line would diverge. W Binns had the contract, and began work in June 1895, but got into difficulties excavating a deep cutting through rock.Grinling, pages 414 and 415 Work continued with financial support from the GNR, through a further deep cutting, and a bridge under the Midland Railway, where there was a difficult operation on a Saturday night to install the bridge before the first Midland train on Sunday morning; the line continued by the Erewash headwaters to Sutton-in- Ashfield, a distance of four miles. Some land came from Lord Carnarvon, then the line went through another limestone cutting into the Meden Valley, through Skegby to Pleasley colliery. From Skegby, there was a 2-mile branch to Teversal and Silver Hill collieries. On 8 February 1897 the single line was opened for coal traffic to Skegby, Teversal and Silverhill. Meanwhile, the board decided to operate a passenger service when the line opened, and in April gave a contract to Pattinsons for stations at Sutton, Skegby and Teversal for £14,742. Owing to Binns' difficulties, his contract was transferred on 7 May to the Halifax Commercial Banking Co. The Skegby to Pleasley section opened for coal and general goods on 1 March 1898. A passenger service of seven trains each way between Nottingham London Road and Skegby, and two each way as far as Sutton, all via the Nottingham Suburban Line, were run on weekdays and two Suttons each way via Gedling on Sundays; these services began on 4 April. Sutton station, with street-level booking office and covered stairways down to the platforms, was on an elaborate scale, the most centrally situated in the town. Skegby, a mile further on, was smaller, on the high level with booking office below. Teversal received a small passenger station too, but never had a regular service, only miners' trains and occasional excursions. The opening was celebrated by special trains from King's Cross, and Nottingham, bringing guests to a lunch at Skegby, at which Mr Capel presided. Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway was an ambitious scheme, with the primary intention of conveying coal. It was unable to secure the investment needed to make its network, and only a greatly reduced part was made. It opened its main section, a west to east line, on 8 March 1897.Leleux, pages 206 and 207 It ran through Shirebrook, and the Leen Valley Extension line made a connection to it, opening in 1898. The junction was named Langwith Junction, facing towards Chesterfield. The GNR Langwith station later became known as Shirebrook South, where passenger services began on 1 November 1901. A connection was made from just south of the station to Shirebrook Colliery, opened on 26 November 1900. Completion of the Extension Line The Leen Valley Lines in 1901The original powers for the Leen Valley Extension Line included a branch to the colliery at Langwith, north of the LD&ECR;, but in October 1895 the GNR arranged to join the LD&ECR; east of Langwith station instead, forming a slightly shorter route, and giving a direct run towards both Chesterfield and the Beighton line; there was a branch to the colliery off that line, with running powers there over the section of the LD&ECR; that company obtained reciprocal running powers to Shirebrook colliery. An act of 29 July 1896 authorised the deviation, and the Shirebrook Colliery branch. A north to west curve was laid to the GCR (former MS&LR;) at Kirkby in 1897, but was rarely used and was removed after a few years. From Pleasley, the line continued above Meden valley, leaving it at Pleasley vale where a rock cutting was required to Shirebrook station, and then a high embankment above the town to Langwith Junction. The line reached Shirebrook Colliery (on the branch south of the station), on 26 November 1900, and on 29 May 1901, Langwith Junction for coal and general goods. Passenger trains to Pleasley and Shirebrook began on 1 November, ten each way, extras on Saturdays.Leleux, pages 161 to 163 The Shirebrook to Langwith section had heavy coal traffic, and caused more use of powers over the LD&ECR.; A south to west curve at Langwith was discussed, but the work was limited to the laying of further sidings. The Shirebrook passenger trains were extended to Langwith, and over the LD&ECR; to Chesterfield from 1 February 1903, but soon withdrawn, and not restored until LNER days. MS&LR; London Extension Contrary to the promise that no southward extension from Annesley was intended by the MS&LR;, the company proceeded with the project. It ran down the Leen Valley, providing a third railway in the confines of the valley. The London Extension line came south from Annesley (no longer an end-on junction) through Bulwell, over the GNR Derbyshire Extension line to New Basford, through Sherwood Rise tunnel to Nottingham. Connections at the intersection were complicated. The MS&LR; (soon to be GCR) line ran broadly north to south and the GNR Derbyshire line ran east to west. The Leen Valley line running southward made a connection from Moorthorpe Junction (or Bestwood Junction) into the GCR southbound at Bulwell North Junction, grade separated on the GCR line. This was known as the Bestwood Branch and was joint GCR and GNR, and it opened in 1898. Also joint and also opened in 1898 was a west to north spur, the Basford Branch, from Basford West Junction to Bulwell South Junction. These connections were authorised by an MS&L; Act on 6 July 1895. A south-to-west spur (the \\"Bagthorpe branch\\") was provided by the GNR, Bagthorpe junction to Basford East Junction, grade separated over the GNR line, opened in 1900. Another connection was authorised by an MS&LR; Act on 6 July 1895, from Moorbridge junction between Bestwood and Bulwell Forest on the Leen Valley line, to Bulwell Common on the MS&LR; London extension. The Act also authorised a north-to-west spur, to Basford and Bulwell.Wrottesley, volume III, page 35 The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its title to the Great Central Railway on 1 August 1897. Mansfield Railway As late as 1909 some coalowners in the Mansfield area approached the GNR, requesting a GNR branch connection, but they were refused. As a result, they formed their own company, the Mansfield Railway. They got Great Central Railway support, and deposited a bill for 1910. The GNR and the Midland Railway opposed. The line was to be from Kirkby south, on the GCR extension, just beyond where the GN Leen Valley extension diverged, cross the GNR curve to Kirkby north, and the Leen Valley extension near Sutton-in-Ashfield, and go via Mansfield, serving several collieries, to the LD&ECR; at Clipstone. The GCR would work it. The GNR suggested use of the Leen Valley extension instead of the southern part, but the promoters said they didn't want another concern between them and the GCR. The Bill was passed in July, giving the GCR a useful line the GNR might have had; moreover the GNR did not get running powers.Wrottesley, volume III, pages 108 and 109 Shirebrook Colliery Shirebrook Colliery became hugely productive. By 1909 the Company was exporting coal to France, Russia, Italy, Spain, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The colliery produced its first million tons of coal in 1970 and over 1.7 million tons by 1986-87, a North Derbyshire Area record. The colliery merged with Pleasley Colliery in 1983, before closing in April 1993.Chris Booth, The-Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway: Chesterfield to Langwith Junction, The Beighton Branch and Sheffield District Railway, Fonthill, 2017, Early retrenchment As the colliery activity in the area served by the line declined so did the use of the line itself. The west to north spur from Kirkby North Junction on the Great Central saw little use, despite its high construction costs. It was virtually moribund by 1905, completely disused by 1918 and dismantled about 1922. Passenger traffic had always been a financial liability and the LNERThe London and North Eastern Railway was formed in 1923 from the Great Northern Railway, the Great Central Railway (which was itself successor to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway and the Mansfield Railway); the Midland Railway joined the new London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. The LNER and the LMS were nationalised under British Railways in 1948. withdrew services between Shirebrook South and Nottingham Victoria on 14 September 1931. Several goods yards on the line closed in the 1950s. Meanwhile, passenger trains serving Sutton in Ashfield Central (on the former Mansfield Railway) had ceased so British Railways reintroduced services from the former Great Northern station at Sutton in Ashfield Town to Nottingham Victoria, on 20 February 1956. The experiment was accompanied by the warning, \\"use it or lose it\\"; the warning was apparently not heeded and the service was discontinued from 17 September 1956. The Leen Valley Extension, in conjunction with the former LD&EC; branch from Beighton to Langwith Junction, remained an important diversionary route when the main line was closed for engineering work. Excursions to the seaside London and other destinations continued to run from the otherwise-closed stations until the mid-1960s. As colliery activity declined steeply—Bestwood during 1967 and Kirkby Summit in July 1968—the Leen Valley Extension and former Great Central line between Langwith Junction and Kirkby South Junction closed completely on 27 May 1968.Booth, page 72 Annesley Tunnel and its approach cuttings were gradually filled with spoil and refuse. The Midland formation then suffered the same fate, following closure of the section of track from Kirkby in Ashfield to Annesley on 11 October 1970. In order to eliminate the level crossing at Kirkby in Ashfield and release land for building, a diversion was brought into operation on 4 April 1972. This involved constructing a short spur between the Pye Bridge line and the former Great Northern route south of Kirkby, reinstating a short length of the Leen Valley Extension through the town, and laying another spur from the site of Summit Colliery to the Mansfield line at Kirkby Hardwick. South of Langwith, an east-north spur between the LD&ECR; and Midland Railway routes opened on 11 November 1974, enabling the remaining part of the Beighton branch from Shirebrook North to Whaley Thorns to be closed. Goods facilities at Mansfield were withdrawn on 2 June 1975, and the remaining railways in the district were now entirely dependent on coal traffic for their survival. Langwith colliery closed in February 1979 and Teversal in July 1980. These were followed by Silverhill April 1985, Whitwell June 1986, Hucknall October 1986, Newstead March 1987, Mansfield Crown Farm March 1988, Linby July 1988. Annesley was merged with Bentinck in March 1988. Babbington, Annesley, Sherwood and Warsop collieries, all with links to the line, have closed since 1981. Newstead Colliery closed in 1987.Kingscott, page 101 Later years Contemporary Leen Valley linesThere was a long-standing grievance that Mansfield was one of the few large towns which was not connected directly to the national rail network. Discussions began in 1982, and in 1988 agreement was reached that a line could be reopened for passengers provided local authorities along the route were willing to provide subsidies. The resulting railway has been named the \\"Robin Hood Line\\". It was reopened in stages from Nottingham northwards. The majority of the route follows the former Midland Railway Leen Valley line as far as Sutton-in-Ashfield, but north from there it uses the Great Northern route through Kirkby before reverting to the Midland formation. As part of reinstating the route it was necessary to excavate the Midland tunnel at Annesley, which had been filled in after closure. The first section from Nottingham to Newstead opened in 1993, extending to Mansfield Woodhouse in 1995, Kirkby in 1996 and finally through to Worksop on the former MS&LR; line from Lincoln to Sheffield in 1998.Neil Burgess, Nottinghamshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2017, anderson, pages 71 to 76 Between Kirkby tunnel and Sutton Parkway station, the train uses trackbeds or track alignments from the Midland Railway dating from 1848; Railtrack dating from 1995; the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway dating from 1892, though now raised by 30 feet; the Great Northern Railway dating from 1896, though now partly above it; British Rail from 1972; and the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway (originally horsedrawn) dating from 1819.Kingscott, , pages 100 to 104 Locations Leen Valley (first line) * Leen Valley Junction; * Bulwell Forest; opened 1 October 1887; closed 23 September 1929; * Moorthorpe Junction; * Bestwood Junction; * Bestwood Colliery; opened 2 October 1882; Colliery not used at first; closed 14 September 1931; * Calveton Branch Junction; * Butlers Hill; opened 2 October 1882; closed 14 September 1931; * Hucknall; opened 2 October 1882; renamed Hucknall Town 1 July 1923; closed to public 14 September 1931; closed to railwaymen 10 September 1962; * Linby Colliery South Junction; * Linby; opened 2 October 1882; closed 1 July 1916; * Newstead Colliery Junction; * Newstead; opened 2 October 1882; renamed Newstead & Annesley 1891; closed to public 14 September 1931 but railwaymen used until 10 September 1962, known as Newstead East; * Annesley GN Junction; end on junction with MS&LR; * Annesley Colliery.Burgess, page 60Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019 Leen Valley Extension Line * Kirkby Bentinck South Junction; * Kirkby Junction; * Summit Colliery; * Sutton in Ashfield; opened 4 April 1898 (RCG); renamed Sutton-in-Ashfield Town 1 July 1923; closed 14 September 1931; seaside excursions ran on summer Saturdays from 1954 to 1962; reopened fully 20 February 1956; closed 17 September 1956; * Skegby; opened 4 April 1898; closed 14 September 1931; seaside excursions ran on summer Saturdays from 1954 to 1962; * Skegby Junction; station facilities may have been provided for railway staff; dates unknown; * Pleasley Colliery; * Pleasley; opened 1 November 1901; closed 14 September 1931; seaside excursions ran on summer Saturdays from 1954 to 1962;,the station was renamed Pleasley East for the purpose; * Shirebrook; opened 1 November 1901; South added 2 June 1924; closed 14 September 1931; seaside excursions ran on summer Saturdays from 1954 to 1962; * Langwith Junction; junction station on LD&ECR; line; opened 8 March 1897; renamed Shirebrook North 2 June 1924; closed 19 September 1955; seaside excursions ran on summer Saturdays from 1954 to 1962.

She was convicted of the crime of mayhem of using a straight razor to slice off her husband's penis. She fled the scene of the crime, but was captured the next day. Boronda was tried, convicted and imprisoned at San Quentin Penitentiary. Crime On Friday, May 30, 1907, Bertha insisted that her husband Frank, a firefighter, had visited a place of prostitution. Shortly after midnight, she cut her husband's penis off with a razor while in bed. He was able to go to the firehouse, which was adjacent to his home, and received treatment in a hospital. Mr. Boronda testified at the trial that he and his wife had visited the San Jose theater, and that the attack was unprovoked. He claimed that she was amorous and had invited him to her bed before the attack.Berha Boronda The Duelling Arena The prosecution's theory was that this was a deliberate planned attack in furtherance of a jealous rage. Mrs. Boronda had several defenses, chief among them being her complete lack of any recollection of the night in question. She claimed she became enraged at her husband, and the two had an argument because she thought he was going to leave her. She admitted that she maimed him, but expressed no regret. As reported in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, \\"Her only excuse is that she wanted to be revenged on Boronda, whom she believed intended deserting her and leaving for Mexico.\\" Another defense was that Mr. Boronda had made \\"a vile request.\\" The newspaper reports were tactfully non-specific. \\"'She drew a razor and cut her husband.' Then she walked to her nephew’s room and simply stated, 'Frank cut himself.'\\" Capture She was apprehended while disguised, wearing a man's clothing and mounting a bicycle to make her escape. She was not found by police until more than 24 hours had passed. After her capture, Bertha Boronda admitted her crime and expressed no regret. On June 1, Frank Boronda made a complaint to Justice Brown from his hospital bed at the Red Cross Hospital. Boronda was accused of mayhem. The felony of mayhem, punishable by up to fourteen years in prison, was defined by Section 204 of the criminal code: \\"Every person who unlawfully and maliciously deprives a human being of a member of his body or renders it useless, or cuts or disables the tongue, nose, ear or lip, is guilty of mayhem.\\" Sentence The jury deliberated two hours before convicting her. Bertha Boronda was sentenced to five years in prison, but served only two and was released from prison on December 20, 1909. Personal Bertha Zettle was born in 1877. Her parents were German immigrants to Minnesota. Frank was born Mario Narcisso Boronda in 1863, he was Mexican and lived in California. Bertha married Frank Boronda, who was a captain with the San Jose Fire Department, in 1901. After the incident Bertha and Frank Boronda broke off their marriage. Frank and Bertha each later married other spouses. Bertha married Alexander Patterson in 1921. Bertha and Alexander eventually divorced. Her remains are interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in San Jose, California.

Background  Alexander van Slobbe attended the Vrije School in Rotterdam and graduated with honors laude in 1984 from the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design. After working for clothing companies, Van Slobbe founded the label called Orson & Bodil in 1989. Bodil is the name of his niece, Orson is a reference to Orson Welles.Nanda van den Berg (2008), Alexander van Slobbe, The label was characterized by experiments in presentation and questioned fashion itself as a phenomenon. This label was followed up in 1992 by the more commercial men's brand So. This brand flipped both casual and formal work clothes. A first show in Paris was held in 1994. So had in Japan two own collection lines and several stores. In the meantime Orson & Bodil was put on hold in 1995. In 2003 So was sold to the Japanese company Joi'X. With the proceeds he started a new atelier on the Westergasfabriek terrain, there Van Slobbe made a new start his Orson + Bodil label. In 2014, Van Slobbe announced to launch a new label together with designer Francisco van Benthum called Van Slobbe Van Benthum. The name of this label was later changed to Hacked By_, they want to change the fashion world by 'hacking' its system.

These pre-produced basic items and overstock fabrics are the basis for their collections, also to prevent depreciated stocks from being destroyed.

H. Asquith was persuaded by Sir Herbert Leon to attend an event organised by him at his home at Bletchley Park in which Asquith would address an audience of 2,000. This opportunity to confront the Prime Minister proved irresistible to the suffragettes who organised a campaign over several days to coincide with his visit. Maud Joachim and Douglas Smith were the speakers at this protest. On the night before Asquith's visit the suffragettes Charlotte Marsh, Laura Ainsworth, Evelyn Wurrie (real name Evelyn Wharrie) and Nellie Hall gained access to the grounds, where they hid in a plantation of trees near to the marquee where Asquith was due to speak. On his arrival the four women rushed forward with megaphones shouting phrases such as \\"When are you going to give justice to women?\\" while Nellie Hall managed to chain herself to a tree.

It is intended to be the 14th film in the Star Trek film series. There have been several different iterations of the film in development since 2015. Development of a sequel to Star Trek Beyond (2016) was revealed before the release of that film, with J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay writing. In December 2017, Quentin Tarantino pitched his own idea for a new Star Trek film to producer J. J. Abrams, and development began separately from the Beyond sequel. S. J. Clarkson was hired to direct the latter in April 2018, but negotiations with stars Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth ended that August with the actors leaving the project. Noah Hawley was hired in November 2019 to write and direct a new version of the franchise. Tarantino revealed in January 2020 that he had decided not to direct his Star Trek film. Hawley's version was placed on hold that August to allow Paramount to decide on the best direction for the franchise, whether it be his version, a new director taking on Tarantino's story, or a new attempt at a sequel to Beyond. Background Shortly before filming for Star Trek Beyond began in June 2015, Paramount Pictures completed last-minute contract re-negotiations with the main cast members of the Star Trek franchise's reboot films. This gave the actors pay rises while signing Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto to return for a fourth film in their respective roles as James T. Kirk and Spock. While promoting the release of Beyond, producer J. J. Abrams revealed on July 15, 2016, that the fourth film would see Chris Hemsworth reprising the role of George Kirk, father of James, from the prologue of Star Trek (2009). Abrams added that the role of Pavel Chekov would not be recast following the death of actor Anton Yelchin a month earlier. On July 18, Paramount Pictures officially announced a fourth film with the temporary title Star Trek 4. The announcement confirmed the return of Hemsworth and Pine as well as \\"most of the cast from Star Trek Beyond\\", with Abrams producing alongside Lindsey Weber under their company Bad Robot Productions. J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay were set to write the screenplay for the sequel after doing uncredited writing work on Beyond. David Ellison and Dana Goldberg of Skydance Media were set as executive producers. While a guest on The Nerdist Podcast in December 2015, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in making a Star Trek film. He stated that he was a fan of the original Star Trek series as well as Abrams' 2009 reboot film, and felt that many classic Star Trek episodes could be \\"easily expanded\\" into a feature film; he gave the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" (1990) as an example. In September 2017, after a clip of this discussion resurfaced on YouTube, Tarantino was asked about directing a Star Trek film and said \\"It would be worth having a meeting about\\". He noted that he planned to retire after directing ten films and had already made eight. Both Pine and Quinto separately stated earlier in 2017 that they had not heard any updates about a new Star Trek film other than it was being written. Karl Urban, who portrays Leonard McCoy in the films, reiterated this in September and expressed interest in having the fourth film introduce McCoy's ex-wife and daughter. That December, Tarantino approached Abrams and Paramount about an idea he had for a new Star Trek film, and development on the project began at the studio. It was unclear what affect this would have on the already planned sequel to Beyond, but at CinemaCon in April 2018, Paramount CEO Jim Gianopulos stated that both Star Trek films were in development separately. Quentin Tarantino Quentin Tarantino began developing a Star Trek film in December 2017, but chose not to direct the film in January 2020 A few days after Tarantino's project was announced, he and Abrams convened a writers room consisting of Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, Drew Pearce and Megan Amram, to hear Tarantino's idea and begin developing it into a film. One of the group would be chosen to write a screenplay for the film while Tarantino focused on his ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019); Smith was considered the frontrunner. As part of the initial discussion for the project, Abrams and Paramount had agreed that the film could be rated R like Tarantino's previous films, which would have made it the first R-rated Star Trek film. Smith was hired to write the screenplay by the end of December. Both Patrick Stewart and William Shatner expressed interest in returning to the franchise to work with Tarantino on his project, after they respectively portrayed Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation and James T. Kirk in Star Trek: The Original Series. In April 2018, Tarantino's film was said to be set in a different timeline from the Beyond sequel, and had the potential to be another reboot of the franchise. In June, Quinto said that he assumed the cast of Abrams' films would be starring in Tarantino's. Simon Pegg, who portrayed Montgomery Scott in the Abrams films, reiterated this in July 2018. In January 2019, Paramount president Wyck Godfrey gave Tarantino's Star Trek film as an example of how Paramount was rejuvenating its existing franchises, believing that \\"people’s eyes light up\\" at the thought of the filmmaker joining the franchise. Tarantino confirmed in May 2019 that his Star Trek film was still in development, explaining that the script had been written and he would return to the project following the release of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that July. A month later he said he would be giving notes on the script once he had the chance to, and confirmed that the film would be rated R. In July, Tarantino said he had read Smith's script and \\"like[d] it a lot\\", but there were elements that he wanted to work on. He described the film as \\"Pulp Fiction in space\\". He also said that he was a fan of the performances of Pine and Quinto in Abrams' films and wanted them to star in his film, but he wanted his story to be a direct prequel to the original Star Trek series rather than being set in an alternate timeline like Abrams' films are; Abrams encouraged Tarantino to ignore the different timelines after Tarantino had said \\"I don’t understand this, I don’t like it\\" when discussing them. Tarantino was also asked how a Star Trek film would fit into his ten film plan. He acknowledged that he could use a loophole by saying \\"Star Trek doesn't count\\" and then make a tenth original film, but suggested that he would rather commit to making ten films whether that tenth film is part of the Star Trek franchise or not. In December 2019, Tarantino said he was \\"steering away\\" from directing the film but had made no official decision yet. A month later he said that he was not going to direct the film, but he thought it was a good idea for a Star Trek film and suggested that it still be made, offering to give notes on the first cut. Tarantino's story was later revealed to be based on the original Star Trek series episode \\"A Piece of the Action\\" (1968), which is set on an alien planet with an \\"Earth-like 1920s gangster culture\\". S. J. Clarkson S. J. Clarkson was hired to be the first female director for a Star Trek film, but her version of the project was canceled by January 2020 S. J. Clarkson entered talks to direct the Beyond sequel in April 2018. This would have made her the first woman to direct a Star Trek film, a development that came after an extensive search for a female director which had been a mandate from Abrams and Paramount. Payne and McKay had completed a screenplay at that time, but Paramount had yet to sign new contracts for the main cast outside of Pine and Quinto, including Urban, Pegg, John Cho (Hikaru Sulu), and Zoe Saldana (Nyota Uhura). After Clarkson joined the film, Quinto said the project was entering the \\"logistical kind of phase\\" and expressed excitement at working with the director again after they both worked on the television series Heroes. In July 2018, Jennifer Morrison expressed interest in reprising her role as George Kirk's wife Winona from Star Trek (2009). Also that month, Danai Gurira neared a role in the film, while Pegg met with Clarkson to discuss the film and expected production to begin in early 2019. Contract negotiations between Pine, Hemsworth, and the studios ended with Pine and Hemsworth leaving the film in August 2018. The pair had existing deals for the film after Pine had signed on in June 2015 and Hemsworth had been attached in July 2016, but Paramount and Skydance wanted to lower the budget for the film following the financial underperformance of Beyond and wanted to decrease the actors' salaries as part of this. Development of the film was expected to continue without Pine and Hemsworth, as it was considered a priority project for the two studios. Negotiations with Saldana, Quinto, Urban, Pegg and Cho had not yet begun by that point, as they had been waiting until talks with Pine and Hemsworth had been completed. At the end of the month, Urban said production for the film was expected to take place in the United Kingdom where Clarkson is based, and that it was just waiting on negotiations with Pine and Hemsworth to continue. Pine said a month later that he still wanted to make the film, adding, \\"we will see what happens\\". Despite this, the film had been cancelled by January 2019 and Clarkson moved on to other projects. That May, Hemsworth said he had turned down the film because he was underwhelmed by the script. Noah Hawley Noah Hawley was hired to write and direct a new Star Trek film in November 2019, but it was placed on hold in August 2020 Noah Hawley was hired to write and direct a new Star Trek film for Paramount in November 2019, which he would produce under his 26 Keys Production company alongside Abrams. The film was set to feature a new plot different from the George Kirk time travel premise and also separate from Tarantino's story idea, though the film was expected to be a sequel to Beyond and see Pine, Quinto, Urban and Saldana all return. Paramount and Skydance were said to be hopeful that negotiations would be more successful without Hemsworth and with a new story. In January 2020, Hawley said he would be beginning work on the film \\"as soon as possible\\" after completing the fourth season of his television series Fargo. He added that calling the film Star Trek 4 was \\"kind of a misnomer\\" and reports of the Beyond cast returning for the film were not necessarily correct, explaining that he had approached Paramount with his own vision for the franchise that was \\"going to be different\\" from previous films, and would likely involve new characters. It was important to Hawley to tell a new story that was respectful of the source material as he did with Fargo and Legion, and specifically he talked about evoking the Star Trek values of \\"exploration and humanity at its best, and diversity and creative problem solving\\". A month later, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish stated that Paramount was only developing one new Star Trek film. Hawley had discussed the film with his frequent composer Jeff Russo by January 2020. Russo was already composing music for the television series Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard at the time. Russo was excited about the possibility, but was not confirmed to be composing for the film yet. In April, Russo elaborated that they had discussed Hawley's story and his intentions for the film's music, and said it was a coincidence that he was both a longtime collaborator of the director and the current composer for several Star Trek series. Hawley was reportedly still working on the film in May, during the COVID-19 pandemic. That July, Robert Sallin—the producer of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)—revealed that he had a concept for a new Star Trek film that he was writing a script for. He said it would be \\"unlike anything that has been done in Star Trek\\" before. Sallin had discussed his concept with Paramount, but had been told that the studio would not consider any other pitches for Star Trek films until it had seen Hawley's script. Re- assessment Hawley's project was placed on hold in August 2020 by new Paramount Pictures president Emma Watts, whose top priority at the studio was to \\"figure out\\" the direction of the Star Trek franchise. She was weighing up several options, including Hawley's film, which he still intended to direct and for which \\"soft prep\\" had already begun. Hawley's script was confirmed to focus on new characters, and was said to potentially feature a deadly virus plot that could be considered \\"awkward\\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The other options that Watts was weighing up included a new attempt at a sequel to Beyond featuring the cast of the previous films, as well as Tarantino's project which was considered to still be a viable option with a new director hired to work from Tarantino's story. Deadline Hollywoods Mike Fleming Jr suggested that a film featuring the previous cast may have \\"the cleanest path\\" forward, with the Hawley and Tarantino films deemed more suitable as spin-offs from the core franchise akin to the X-Men franchise's Logan (2017). Fleming added that the next film would need \\"an emphasis on boosting overseas gross numbers which have never been the franchise’s strong suit\\". In September, Hawley said his film was \\"still alive, just in stasis\\". He reiterated that it featured new characters, describing it as a \\"start from scratch\\". Hawley did clarify that his story had an explicit connection to the existing Star Trek canon in a similar way to how the first season of Fargo has a story connection to the 1996 film of the same name.

This wall has attracted scholarly attention because it contains several, well-preserved inscriptions, that were added after the initial construction of the wall. The fact that these inscriptions survived the test of time relatively well and are mostly still in situ is what makes this wall unique. The documents preserved on the wall originate from the second and third century BCE and range from senatorial decrees to imperial letters. Additionally, all documents attest to a good relation between the city of Aphrodisias and its Roman rulers.  Documents  The following documents are inscribed on the ‘Archival Wall’ * Senatorial decree from 39 BCE, the senatus consultum de Aphrodisiensibus, concerning the legally and fiscally privileged status granted by the Romans. * Eleven Imperial letters, which were sent by Roman emperors. ** Seven Imperial letters addressed to the city of Aphrodisias, including letters from emperors Hadrian, Gordian III, Commodus, Septimius Severus and Caracalla and, lastly, Severus Alexander. ** Three Imperial letters addressed to the cities of Ephesus, Samos and Smyrna, sent by emperors Octavian and Trajan. ** One Imperial letter by Octavian addressed to an individual named Stephanos. * Triumviral decree from the reign of emperor Augustus. * Documents on the sympolity of Plarasa and Aphrodisias. ** List of excerpts recording early awards. ** Letter by an individual named Stephanos to the sympolity. * Letter to Plarasa/Aphrodisias (uncertain author and date).  Significance  Despite the name it is commonly known as and the fact that it contains a varied collection of documents that were already historic at the time they were added to it, this wall is not an archive. An archive is meant for the deposition, retrieval and consultation of documents, either for a general public or for private individuals. The ‘Archival Wall’ of Aphrodisias does not fit these criteria. The different documents were selected with care and presented to the public because they were meant to reflect a certain message. It is unclear who was in charge of this selection process, but it is most likely that the documents were selected and inscribed by members of Aphrodisias' elite, as they were the people who concerned themselves with the promotion of the city's identity. These documents were included because they represented Aphrodisias’ grandeur and history: the past initiatives by private citizens, the favour of the gods that was bestowed upon the city, Aphrodisias’ bravery and loyalty to Rome, and the appreciation and recognition of Rome for Aphrodisias in return. The different documents incorporated in this wall are, therefore, historically significant. They can help us understand how ancient societies, such as the people of Aphrodisias, constructed and transmitted their public memory, how their commemoration practices worked and how they carefully constructed their own civic identity.

Roe (18 December 1895 – 28 May 1988), was an Irish librarian and antiquary, a champion of medieval Irish art and iconography. Early life and education Born in 1895, Helen Maybury Roe was the daughter of William Ernest Roe and Anne Lambert Sheilds of Mountrath, Laois. Her grandfather was Francis Henry Sheilds of Parsonstown, owner of the King's County Chronicle. She was sent first to the local primary school and then to the Preston School in Abbeyleix. Although she attended Trinity College, Dublin, she didn't begin her career due to the outbreak of World War I. She joined the St John's Ambulance Brigade and served at the Cambridge Military Hospital and at Aldershot Barracks. In the immediate aftermath she continued her medical career with the Military Hospital in Bray, County Wicklow. She also spent time touring in Europe visiting museums and beginning her appreciation for medieval art. Roe had been raised Protestant and had done her duty as part of the aristocracy by serving in the war. But the soldiers had treated her as Irish and abused her especially during the Easter rising. The result was that Roe supported nationalism from then on. She went back to TCD and completed her degree in modern languages in 1921. She finally completed her M.A. in 1924 and began a teaching career. She spent time working in The Royal School, Dungannon, and Alexandra College, Dublin. Career In 1926 her parents needed her and she returned home. She became the first 1926 she became the County Librarian in Laois. While working as a librarian Roe was able to study further and, as a rare person with a car, she toured sites and visited schools. One result of her presentations to schools was to inspire Ireland’s first female archaeologists, Ellen Prendergast. In 1940 Roe retired from the library and moved to Dublin where she was able to buy a house and garden. Apart from her antiquarian work she was a regular supporter of charities and was honorary secretary of The Queen's County Protestant Orphan's Society and actively involved in The Dublin University Mission to Chota Nagpur, India. Roe became a regular contributor to various journals and newspapers including Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, An Leabharlann, Béaloideas, Seanchas Ard Mhacha, Carloviana, the Irish Press and the Leinster Express. From 1965 until 1968 Roe served as the president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, first woman to be elected. She was elected to be a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1984. Roe continued touring and lecturing into her nineties. She lived at Oak House, Sussex Road, Dublin and was buried at St. Peter's Churchyard, Mountrath, County Laois, Ireland. The RSAI have an annual lecture in her honour and have named one of their lecture rooms after her.

Description  The band HulyaiHorod was founded in Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine, in 2002 as a continuation of student bands Дикий Карапет (Wild Karapet) and Златопіль (Zlatopil). Kropyvnytskyi functions as the administrative center of the Kirovohrad Oblast, which is a place of birth for significant number of band members. The members of HulyaiHorod actively explore the traditional folklore of the central regions of Ukraine, so called Middle Dnipro Ukraine (Cherkasy, Poltava and Kirovohrad regions). The repertoire of the band includes traditional instrumental music: calendar, ritual, social and everyday life songs as well as dances, collected from village artists in expeditions. The songs are performed in a traditional polyphonic manner of singing, which is a typical style in Central Ukraine. The band treats folklore as a fully developed, independent culture. Therefore, it does not allow any processing, enhancements or “polishing” of authentic original sources for achieving stage effects. While performing the songs, the band pays attention to preserving unique features of local traditions. HulyaiHorod does not mechanically copy traditional songs but imbibes traditions and tries to follow them. The band members also conduct workshops of traditional Ukrainian dances, such as Гопак (Hopak), Орлиця (Orlytsa), Гречаники (Hrechanyky), Баламут (Balumut) and Молодичка (Molodychka), accompanied by triple music, which includes two violins, basolia and buben. Since 2015 the band has worked on GG HulyaiHorod project, which combines traditional polyphonic singing style and instrumental folk tunes with modern electronic music, including the DJ-versions. Musical compositions are created by members of HulyaiHorod in cooperation with the team of recording studio Kofein and electronic music maker Andriy Antonenko. HulyaiHorod takes part in festivals, art events and various folklore projects in Ukraine, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Georgia, Denmark . In 2017 the band performed at Atlas Weekend.

Biography  Born in Fano, almost nothing is known about Gianettini's musical training; in 1662, sources place him in Venice, where he probably studied under the guidance of Sebastian Enno. On 14 January 1674 he was admitted as a bass singer in the choir of the chapel of the Basilica of San Marco. Subsequently, on 5 December 1676 he was appointed as an organist at the Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo with a salary of 40 ducats a year (a position he held until 1679). In this period he studied music with Carlo Grossi and perhaps also with Giovanni Legrenzi. On 25 January 1677 he was also an organist at San Marco (while being a choir singer). From 1676 he started to be active as a composer: in this period he wrote about ten works in Venice and Milan and various sacred music (including some motets for Ippolito Bentivoglio). During years 1685-1686 he was also active as a composer and a capella teacher for the Duke of Hannover Ernesto Augusto of Brunswick-Lüneburg. While there, he stayed in a building overlooking the Grand Canal. On May 1, 1686, Gianettini left his offices at San Marco to take the place of maestro di cappella at the court of Francesco II, Duke of Modena. His salary for his services to the court of Modena was 396 lire a month (a considerable amount for the time). For the Duke's court he wrote 9 oratorios, but also other sacred compositions, cantatas and serenades. With the outbreak of the Spanish succession war, Modena was occupied by the French and in 1702 he had to flee with Duke Rinaldo I (successor of Francesco II) to Bologna. After the war, in 1707 he returned to Modena, where he continued his work as the director of the chapel, but without receiving the high salary like years before. In May 1721 he decided to accompany her daughter Maria Caterina to Munich, a city where she was active as a singer at the Bavarian court and where he died shortly after. Although rarely known now, Gianettini was considered as one of the most talented composers of his era. He was very much appreciated as an opera and composer of sacred music both in Italy and in Germany.

Biography Bartuszová was born on 24 April 1936 in Praha (Prague), Czech Republic. From 1951 through 1955 she studied at the Higher School of Applied Arts in Prague. She went on to study at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague from 1956 through 1961. After her graduation she moved from Prague to Košice, Slovakia with her husband Juraj Bartusz. In 1966 she was included in the Exhibition of the Young at the House of Arts in Brno, Czech Republic, her first recorded exhibit. She was a member of the Concrete art organization, the Concretists' Club (Klub konkrétistů). She exhibited her art throughout her life time and posthumously, mostly in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Bartuszová died on 22 December 1996 in Košice Her work in included in the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava. Her work is also in the collection of the Tate in London and will be shown in a forthcoming solo retrospective there in 2020. Characteristics of her Artworks Mária Bartuszová (1936 – 1996) remains an unknown Slovak sculptor (with Czech descent), her artwork was presented to the general public during Documenta in Kassel in 2007 (curated by Roger M. Buergel, Ruth Noack) – from this position, her works became to appear occasionally in international exhibitions and some of them have become part of prestigious collections of contemporary art. Her artworks have been exhibited individually, without a broader context and with no reference to broader dynamics within her practice. Very first posthumous and important exhibitions are: Path to the Organic Sculpture (2005, Slovak National Gallery), Mária Bartuszová: Provisional Forms (2014-2015, Museum of Modern Art in Warszaw). “A majority of the artist´s sculptures are made of plaster - material by nature preparatory and impermanent.” For this reason alone, despite their perfect shape, her sculptures are as it were by design, tentative, unfinished and transitory. On occasion (mostly financial) when “Bartuszová succumbed to the temptations of using aluminium or bronze, she would immediately undermine their material weight, through either form or subject matter: softening the material, putting it in motion, altering its proportions, and mocking gravity.” “Her artworks between the second half of 60th (20 Century) became more influenced with her individual vision of constructive geometric tendencies connected with new materials such a cutted aluminium. In 1976 and 1983, together with arthistorian G. Kladek, they ran workshops for blind disable and visually impaired children. She created sculptures that enabled those unable to see to get to know various forms and textures, to differentiate between geometric and organic forms”, to recognise their emotional significance, and to develop of art, “alternative” usage, and the emphasis on the haptic characteristics of sculpture, manifest Maria Bartuszová´s strikingly avantgarde approach to her artistic tasks. From the 1980s, her work was dominated by pure, ovoid forms, hollowed eggs and shells, with idealized shapes that had been subjected to deformation – crushing, squeezing, breaking, tying. Visible sign is of oval forms are constrained with string, sometimes weighted additionally with small stones, in which the fragile plaster matter. In the final phase of her creativity (works produced after the mid 1980s), Bartuszová began to employ a singular method of obtaining plaster casts by means of her signature technique, called “pneumatic shaping”.

Alleyne works on the dynamic modeling and simulation of complex systems as well as the development of algorithms for various experimental testbeds. His work relies on control theory; a means to evaluate how systems behave with a series of inputs and desired outputs. This may include nanoscale motion control, vehicle systems dynamics and energy management (including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems). He has studied advances in Iterative Learning Control (ILC). Alleyne has created several high precision algorithms that include design rules for ILC feedforward trajectories. He has developed the platform and process control electro-hydrodynamic jet printing; which allows for the precise printing of materials. He has developed software that can simulate the vapor-compression cycle system as well as Thermosys, a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox that can model the dynamic transients in HVAC systems.

Main characters ; / : :Played by: Tatsuomi Hamada :The protagonist, Mob is an eighth grade Esper with powerful psychic abilities. His bowl-cut hairstyle is his defining physical feature. He is not good at reading the atmosphere, and since childhood, has rarely felt or displayed intense emotion, typically having a dull expression on his face very similar to Saitama from One Punch Man. He thinks his power is unnecessary in his life, so he avoids using it. He suppresses his emotions to keep his power in control, but when the percentage of his accumulated feelings reaches 100, he is overcome by the strongest emotion he currently feeling and unleashes the full extent of his powers. He works at Reigen's spirit counsel for 300 yen an hour. After being begged to join the Telepathy Club to prevent their dissolution, he instead chose to join the Body Improvement Club hoping not only to impress his secret love, Tsubomi, but also to improve himself as a person. He is credited as Salt Middle School's urabanchō (裏番長 is roughly translated as \\"secret school gang leader\\") known as White T Poison, but this remains unknown to many including himself. Mob also possesses an unknown power which far surpasses even the height of his abilities, but is uncontrollable and only awakens when unconscious, and is called ???%. ; : :Played by: Kazuki Namioka :A self-proclaimed psychic and Mob's mentor, Reigen runs a low-cost psychic consultation business called \\"Spirits and Such\\". He lacks actual psychic abilities and is essentially a con artist, using his intelligence and charisma to solve his clients' problems with skills he calls \\"secret techniques\\". Though he tends to put his own self- interest first, Reigen seems to genuinely care for Mob, and has made him promise never to use his powers against other people. After temporarily acquiring Mob's psychic powers during the battle against Claw's 7th Division, which he used to convince most of the surviving higher-ups to turn over a new leaf and return to society, he has retained the ability to see very low-level spirits. His backstory is revealed later in the story, and he remembers his time when he worked at a company, but then quit his job there because he was bored and he decided to rent an office. He only started his psychic business after looking at a magazine, and he was actually going to quit it, until he met Mob for the first time and became his master. ; : :A deceptive upper-class evil spirit with red circles on his cheeks who can unleash the full potential of whatever body he possesses.

He initially possessed a man to establish a cult called LOL to make himself into a god, but was defeated by Mob and lost most of his spiritual capabilities. Left as little more than a wisp of a spirit, he was able to convince Mob to spare him and was deemed reasonably harmless. Though Dimple found he could not exploit Mob, he remained by his side before his essence was further reduced by Teruki. Dimple then played a role in fully awakening Ritsu's psychic powers, serving as a conduct for Ritsu to channel his powers until he could do it himself. ; : :Played by: Ayumu Mochizuki :Mob's younger brother, a seventh grade student with good looks who is an ace student and member of the Student Council. Ritsu has had an inferiority complex towards Mob's powers, though he is able to hide his obsessive longing for psychic power of his own.

Rowell was recruited by the Gold Coast Suns with the 1st pick in the 2019 AFL draft.  Early life  Rowell was born in Sydney, New South Wales to a mother from Victoria and a father from Queensland. The family moved to Melbourne when Rowell was a child and he began playing football when his father took him to Mont Albert to participate in Auskick. He played majority of his junior football with the Canterbury Cobras and was touted as a future AFL player as early as the under 10 level. As Rowell progressed through the junior ranks, he was given an opportunity to debut in the TAC Cup for the Oakleigh Chargers a month after his 16th birthday. Leading into the 2019 season, Rowell was considered the early favourite to be selected with the number 1 pick in the 2019 AFL draft. He showed his worth by dominating for Victoria Metro at the AFL Under 18 National Championships and playing a pivotal role in Oakleigh's NAB League premiership season, including a Grand Final performance against the Eastern Ranges in which he recorded 44 disposals and two goals. He was subsequently voted best on ground in the NAB League Grand Final and awarded U18 All-Australian selection. Rowell attended Carey Grammar with future Gold Coast teammate Noah Anderson throughout his teenage years. The pair were instrumental in delivering Carey's second ever football APS Premiership in 2019 and raising the profile of the school's football program.  AFL career  2020 Rowell made his AFL debut against Port Adelaide at Metricon Stadium in round 1 of the 2020 AFL season. In just his second ever AFL game, Rowell was voted best on ground against one of the then- Premiership favourite teams, the West Coast Eagles, and was awarded the round 2 AFL Rising Star nomination for his 26-disposal, two-goal performance. In June 2020, he signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the Suns until the end of 2023. Rowell’s performance in the early rounds of the year was widely considered extremely impressive, with commenters deeming him among the greatest first-year players. Rowell was considered by Gavin Wanganeen to be a potential contender for the Brownlow Medal. In the Suns' round 5 loss to Geelong, Rowell suffered a dislocated shoulder in the first quarter and took no further part in the game. Rowell opted for surgery in order to repair his shoulder, a choice which will cause him to be sidelined for three months.

Before Maximum Fun, it was on Audioboom. The show follows a team of ambassadors (and their ship, The Bargarean Jade) as they attempt to establish diplomatic relations with planets in the remote and chaotic Zyxx Quadrant of the Tremillion Sector. It frequently parodies common science fiction tropes from franchises such as Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and Star Wars. At the start of Season 1, they work for the Federated Alliance, which recently defeated the evil Galactic Monarchy. As of 2020 there are three completed seasons, and the fourth premiered February 19, 2020. On Apple Podcasts, Mission to Zyxx has a 4.9/5.0 based on 2.6K ratings. The cast of the show are veterans of writing and performing comedy, including CollegeHumor (Jeremy Bent, Winston Noel) ,The Good Cop (Allie Kokesh), Last Week Tonight and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Moujan Zolfaghari). Co-creator Seth Lind is Director of Operations at the highly successful podcasts This American Life, Serial, and S-Town. Shane O'Connel, the show's sound engineer and designer, has worked with Ben Harper, Half Waif, and NAO.  Format   Production  The podcast is improvised by its comedian cast and recorded by Shane O'Connell, who also performs subsequent sound design and mixing. Editing is done by Seth Lind, Alden Ford, and Jeremy Bent. Each week there is a special guest comedian who plays an inhabitant of the Zyxx Quadrant that encounters the crew. The guest pitches two or three episode ideas to the main cast, and one is picked that fits best with the story arc of the show. Filmmaker Magazine interviewed the cast and highlighted the combination of improv comedy and longform narration as a major source of creativity and freedom for the podcast.  Episode structure  Podcast episodes are about 30 minutes, edited down from an initial 60-90 minute recording. Each episode opens with an opening crawl narration by Jeremy Crutchley. As the story progresses, the narration changes to reflect the happenings of the Zyxx Quadrant, the Tremillion Sector, and the entire galaxy. The series introduction for the first season is: > The period of civil war has ended. The rebels have defeated the evil > Galactic Monarchy and established the harmonious Federated Alliance. It’s > totally less evil. Now to restore diplomatic relations between systems, the > Federated Alliance has deployed teams of ambassadors throughout the galaxy. > The Alliance’s newest recruit, a young farm boy named Pleck Decksetter steps > aboard the starship Bargarean Jade to embark on his first diplomatic > mission: a MISSION. TO. ZYXX! The show also occasionally releases live episodes set in previous eras/seasons.  Advertising breaks  Like many podcasts, Mission to Zyxx generates revenue through sponsored advertisements in the form of advertising breaks. This podcasts is unusual, however, as these are done by the voice actors or guests as minor characters from the show, delivered in-character. The ad breaks are canon, consistent with the show's characterizations and events, occasionally delivering minor plot points or foreshadowing for the main storyline. Advertisers in the first season were primarily MeUndies, Audible, HelloFresh, and other podcasts. In the second season, frequent advertisers included ZipRecruiter, SquareSpace, VistaPrint, and other podcasts. In the third season, frequent advertisers included Bombas, Tor Books, Wix.com, and Care/Of.  Cast and characters   Main cast *Ambassador Pleck Decksetter (played by Alden Ford). A young Tellurian farm- boy from the planet Rangus VI. *Security Officer Dar (played by Allie Kokesh). *Protocol and Diplomatic Relations Droid C-53 (played by Jeremy Bent). *Junior Missions Operations Manager Nermut Bundaloy (played by Seth Lind). *The Bargarean Jade, aka Bargie (played by Moujan Zolfaghari). The sentient spaceship the crew calls home.  Other cast * Clone Light Infantry Nomadic Troopers (C.L.I.N.T.s) (played by Winston Noel). Clone soldiers that enforce the laws of the Federated Alliance. They are all business at first, but scratch the surface and they are catty and petty. Each CLINT hates every other CLINT and is always shit-talking the rest of them, never quite grasping that they are all exact clones.  Plot   Season 1 The Alliance's newest recruit is Ambassador Pleck Decksetter, a naive, gung-ho farm boy whose crew includes trusty, know-it-all droid C-53, and hulking, omnisexual security officer DAR. They travel aboard the outdated, sentient starship The Bargerian Jade - aka Bargie - who has as many ex-husbands as stories about her glory days. Their mission is nominally overseen by junior Missions Operation Manager Nermut Bundaloy, a striving, entry-level bureaucrat yearning for respect. {  + !No. overall !No. in season !Title !Title Reference !Guest Comedian !Original air date - 1 1 All Hail the Federated Alliance!

With a little more experience and understanding of the Zyxx Quadrant, the crew make their way through the galaxy with help from Beano and The Space.  Season 3  Mission to Zyxx is back. Thanks to Beano's noble sacrifice, the Crew has survived the Battle of the Planet Crushers only to find themselves stranded on the opulent planet Holowood. Zima Warrior Pleck Decksetter, with the help of his newly found acolyte AJ, brings everyone back together, and they set out to rally forces across the galaxy to face down Emperor Nermut Bundaloy, ensconced in the Zyxx Quadrant.  Cultural references   Star Wars  Like Star Wars, Mission to Zyxx is a space opera. Zyxx makes several references to Star Wars, including the CLINTs (referencing Star Wars' Clone Troopers) and \\"The Space\\" (referencing Star Wars' The Force). Rather than the Force's Light and Dark sides, Zyxx has \\"Fresh\\" and \\"Wack,\\" respectively. Zyxx also has Zima warriors that fight with woodsabers (sticks) - analogous to Star Wars' Jedi warriors and their lightsabers.  Hello from the Magic Tavern  Show co- creator Alden Ford has cited the Chicago-based improv podcast Hello from the Magic Tavern set in a Narnia/Middle-Earth-like fantasy realm as partial inspiration for the format of Mission to Zyxx.  Star Trek  The concept of diplomatic relations missions mirrors that of diplomat crews in the Star Trek universe. An episode of the podcast is named The Worry with Wiffles and has a similar plot in a direct homage to one of the most famous episodes of Star Trek, The Trouble with Tribbles.  Reception  In their Culture section, Newsweek covered the production of the first series. Air & Space Magazine interviewed the cast after the first season. Vulture, an entertainment news website, listed Mission to Zyxx as one of \\"100 Great Podcasts Worth Listening to.\\" The podcast was also number one on a Salon list of unpredictable improv podcasts. Charles Pulliam-Moore of Gizmodo praised the show, calling it \\"the best scifi podcast you're probably not listening to...yet,\\" and \\"proof that [podcasts have] still so much untapped potential, particularly for fictional work.\\" He later reviewed Season 3, which he called \\"bolder\\" and \\"taking the piss out of Star Wars in the freshest way.\\" As of November 2019, the podcast website Podbay shows Mission to Zyxx has an average audience review of 4.8 out of 5 based on 2325 reviews. Nick Douglas of LifeHacker wrote \\"Mission to Zyxx might be the best podcast. This science fiction comedy—a mix of Star Trek, Star Wars, and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy—that leans on original jokes instead of references, is definitely the best of the current wave of fictional podcasts, partly because of its unique process.\\" Douglas featured the podcast's cast on the How I Work series, which \\"asks heroes, experts, and all-around productive people to share their shortcuts, workspaces, routines, and more.\\" The Season 2 opener was ranked 7th in IndieWire's \\"The 50 Best Podcast Episodes of 2018.\\" It was also nominated for the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards 2019 for the category \\"Best Scripted Podcast\\" (won by Wolverine: The Long Night).

It is situated northwest of Pemberton, and south of Face Mountain, which is its nearest higher mountain. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. The mountain's name was proposed in 1978 by mountaineer Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada, in association with Railroad Pass, Railroad Creek, and other railroad-related names of the immediate vicinity. It was officially adopted January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Locomotive Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The mountain and its climate supports Train Glacier on its northern slopes. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Locomotive Mountain.

He took photographs and made paintings of discoveries from the Pepper-Hearst Expedition. The Florida Museum of Natural History has a few of his photographs. He also has works at the National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution and the University Museum at University of Pennsylvania. The Library of Florida History and Smithsonian have collections of his papers. Sawyer was born in Keokuk, Iowa to Moses Calvin Sawyer and Helen Jane Cass Sawyer. He received a law degree in 1882, but pursued a career in art after studying with John Vanderpoel at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was an illustrator for the Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Tribune before becoming a draughtsman for the U.S. Geological Survey office in Washington D.C. for the division of illustration. Sawyer's photographs, sketches, and watercolors from Pepper's expedition are all that remain of many of the finds that deteriorated soon after discovery. Sawyer married Kathleen Bailey after his return from the Florida expedition and they had two children, Helen and Bailey (Bill). Sawyer lived in New York until retiring to Spain in ill health and continuing to paint in Europe as well as Central and South America. He relocated again to Sarasota, Florida in 1944. His memberships included the Art Students League, Salmagundi Club, and American Watercolor Society. Watercolor of a mask from Key Marco By 1931 he was painting landscapes and castles. His daughter Helen Alton Sawyer and her husband Jerry Farnsworth were also artists. The University of Florida library has several photos of him including one of him painting a landscape on Cape Cod, another outside with his wife Kathleen Alton Bailey Sawyer, and one among prominent friends. In 2019 a historical society reenactor read his letter from aboard the Sea Breeze on the 1895-96 expedition.

Context  After the partition of Babylon. Seleucus was appointed as the satrap of Babylon until he was forced to leave, fearing Antigonus increasing power in 315 BC and took refuge at Ptolemy's court, where he remained until he and Ptolemy defeated Antigonus's son Demetrius at Gaza in 312 BC, after which Ptolemy delivered to him 200 cavalry and 800 foot soldiers, and begun his advance towards his old satrapy of Babylon.  Campaign  Seleucus now march towards Harran (also known as Carrhae) where he found around 1000 veteran troops, (probably a portion of the Silver Shields captured at Gabiene) who joined him, then he proceeded towards Babylon, which he reach in may, the people welcomed him, as he was well remembered by them, but a small force loyal to Antigonus entrenched themselves in the citadel of the palace.  The siege  Seleucus decided to lay siege on the citadel, but eager to avoid casualties, he decided to cut the water supply to the city and began to build a dam on the river Euphrates, which passed between the citadel walls, until it created an artificial lake on the hill, but as the citadel continue to resist his attempts, he ordered the dam to be suddenly broken and in the ensuing downstream flood the walls of the citadel were destroyed and the garrison surrendered after token resistance.  Aftermath  Seleucus became ruler of Babylon again, however, Antigonus had enough power to recapture the city at any moment, and one of his generals, Nicanor was already on the way, this episode marks the start of the Babylonian War.

It was first performed at the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice on 24 January 1711. Piovene’s libretto was based on Tamerlan ou La mort de Bajazet by Jacques Pradon (1675). It was Piovene’s second libretto as well as his second collaboration with Gasparini. Tamerlano was Gasparini’s most famous opera, distinguished by the unusual decision to assign the role of Bajazet to a tenor, Giovanni Paita, rather than to a castrato. Roles The opera’s role were Tamerlano (soprano), Bajazet (tenor), Asteria (soprano), Andronico (alto), Irene (soprano), Clearco, Leone and Zaida. The prima donna role was Astoria with nine arias; Bajazet had six, Tamerlano five, while Andronico and Irene had four each. Plot The plot concerns a series of dilemmas facing the Turkish sovereign Bajazet who has been defeated and humiliated by Tamerlano, emperor of the Tartars. Tamerlane cannot destroy Bajazet because he loves his daughter Asteria; Bajazet wishes to end the humiliation of his defeat by committing suicide but fears for his daughter’s safety; Asteria would like to reject Tamerlane in favour of Andronico but cannot because of his complicity with Tamerlane; Andronico cannot openly declare his love for Asteria because of the bonds of duty to her father; Irene wants to end her engagement to Tamerlane but is obliged to wait. Finally Asteria, Andronico and Bajazet defy Tamerlane who condemns them all, bringing about a crisis that is resolved only by Bajazet’s suicide. Only a couple of arias remain from the 1711 version. Later productions and adaptation In 1714 Tamerlano was staged at the in Genoa. In 1719 Gasparini revised the work for a new production in Reggio Emilia. Now entitled Bajazet, this new version starred tenor Francesco Borosini in the title role. George Frideric Handel certainly studied both of Gasparini’s versions of the opera before creating his own Tamerlano in 1724.

He is famous for being the first and best sinsoseol writer. He argued that Joseon has to be enlightened, through a variety of media including editorials and sinsoseol. His insistence on enlightenment naturally led to his pro-Japanese actions. (\\"Lee Injik,\\" Wikipedia Korea, accessed November 26, 2019, https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%B8%EC%A7%81.) in 1908, categorized as sinsoseol, or new novelSinsosoel, literally \\"new novel,\\" refers to the type of novels that were mostly published in the 1900s–1910s. During those years, the word \\"novel\\" did not have a precise definition. A number of texts that cannot be considered a novel by today's standards were published with such a label. The phrase \\"new novel\\" was used to merely emphasize the 'newness,' as a rhetorical expression, in the time when the word \\"novel\\" used to signify different things. Later, in the 1930s when the history of modern Korean literature began to be written, the expression was used to underline the literary value of the series of novels published from the 1900s to the 1910s and to indicate their special characteristics that represent the time period. New novels have three features: first, they deal with the problems that exist in reality unlike the traditional fictions; second, they encourage civilization and emphasize the importance of enlightenment; third, they attempt to eliminate the influence of the Chinese language and write fluent Korean. (Kim Yeongmin, Formation of the Literary System and National Language as to Modern Korean Literature (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2012), 259–299.). By depicting how a wealthy farmer gets killed by a venal official, it denounces the corrupt feudal system of the late Joseon dynasty. The author wrote it with a plan to adapt it into a play from the beginning, and it was performed in WongaksaWongaksa is known as the first privately owned theater built in the Western style. It was located at the spot where Saemoonan Church now stands, in Jongno-gu. (\\"Wongaksa,\\" Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, accessed November 26, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2461051&cid;=46664&categoryId;=46664.) as the first Korean sinyeongeuk, or new play.  Plot   Structure  = Summary = Choi Byeongdo, a rich farmer living in Gangwon-do, has a big dream of saving the country under the influence of the politician Kim Ok-gyun, supporter of an extensive reform. However, the new governor of his hometown, who is greedy for his money, arrests him and forces him to pay a bribe. He refuses the offer to be freed on condition that he hands over his fortune, and dies, giving in to torture. Choi's daughter Ok-sun and son Ok-nam grow up with the help of his friend Kim Jeongsu and go to the United States to study. The siblings have a hard time paying for their education while abroad, but continue to study with the aid of an American missionary. They return to their home country after ten years, after reading the news article entitled \\"Grand Reform in Korea,\\" in 1907. In the country, the military men demobilized by the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907 and militia men have begun to riot. The siblings go to a temple with their mother to pray to the Buddha, and then they run into the militia men. Ok-nam urges them to disband and claims that the country has to be developed first, but eventually he gets taken by the militia. = Discrepancy between the first part and the last part = Many criticisms of Silvery World point out the discrepancy between the first part and the last part. Whereas the first part shows a strong disapproval of the Korean society at the time, in the last part, such criticism fades away.\\"Silvery World,\\" Compendium of Modern Korean Literature: Books, accessed November 26, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=4353862&cid;=60550&categoryId;=63761.) Based on this discrepancy, some claim that it is a reworked version of \\"Choi byeongdu taryeong (최병두 타령, Song of Choi Byeongdu).\\"Choi Won-sik, \\"On Silvery World,\\" Quarterly Changbi (48), 1978. Specifically, they say that its first part is a rework of the traditional song, at the time performed by entertainers and master singers, and only its last part about what happens after the death of Choi is written by the author.  Main themes  = Denunciation of the late Joseon = The first part of Silvery World depicts a heroic life of the rich farmer Choi byeongdo who lives in Gangwon-do. He has accumulated his wealth with a clear purpose to make Joseon a \\"civilized country.\\" But he cannot realize his ideal due to the widespread corruption of the late Joseon. It was common for officials to exploit the people to get a public post and maintain their status in those days when the corrupt feudal system was spread throughout the country. The first part of the novel criticizes and denounces the society that betrays the heroic figure. = Justification of the Japanese colonization = That being said, in the last part, the critical voice drastically loses its power. The 'grand reform in Korea,' presented as the reason for the siblings to return to their home country, refers to the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907, which enabled Japan to dethrone Emperor Gojong and take over the commandership of the Korean military.The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907 is also known as \\"the New Japan-Korea Treaty.\\" It was made under Japanese coercion after Emperor Gojong's failed attempt to inform the world about Korea's situation at the 1907 International Peace Conference held in Hague, Netherland. The Residency-General was established and the commandership of the Korean military was taken over by the Japanese government. In addition, Emperor Gojong was deposed and Sunjong ascended to the throne.

However, the fiction does not have any criticism of the imperialistic invasion of Japan, but rather glamorizes it as 'grand reform,' justifying the Japanese colonization of Korea. The author, Lee Injik, founded a press and claimed the necessity of enlightenment before he gradually turned to rationalize the Japanese colonization. Around the time he published Silvery World, he was already fraternizing with pro-Japanese politicians, such as Lee Wan-yong and Jo Jung-eung. They asserted that the corruption in Joseon was one of the bad practices of the feudal system, and to solve this problem, Japan, a more developed country, had to rule Korea.A number of commentaries relate the author's pro-Japanese actions to the last part of Silvery World. (\\"Silvery World,\\" Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, accessed November 26, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=540590&cid;=46645&categoryId;=46645. \\"Silvery World,\\" Encyclopedia of Korean Language and Literature, accessed November 26, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=693372&cid;=60533&categoryId;=60533.)  Critical reception and literary value  The critic Lim Hwa acclaimed Silvery World for breaking out of the abstract prose of the traditional fictions and realistically depicting the situations of the contemporary period. The traditional fictions written before the 20th century are mostly set in China and advocates Confucian values, the ruling idea of the feudal times. On the contrary, this novel assumes a critical attitude towards the reality of the country and seeks how to solve its problems. Through the frustration and hardship that the protagonist Choi Byeongdo experiences, it successfully embodies the structure of the Korean society at the time. It has also been commended for its modern use of the Korean language. Its first part contains a number of folk songs enjoyed by the people in those days. The farmers who appear in the novel express their lives with their own language and songs. Silvery World has a literary value as it captures the contemporary period with the language of the people, even though the concept of modern national literature was yet to be formed when it was published.Lim Hwa, \\"Introduction to History of New Literature,\\" Complete Collection of Lim Hwa, Vol.2: History of Literature (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2009), 205–260.  Adaptations   New play Silvery World  The author wrote it with a plan to adapt it into a play from the beginning.The book's original cover is included in this news article: \\"The Cover of Lee Injik's New Novel Silvery World,\\" Newsis, March 7, 2018, http://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISI20180307_0000117413. In fact, a record of its performance in Wongaksa has been found. The play ran from November 15, 1908, but the date of its last performance is not known.Kim Yeongmin, History of Modern Korean Fictions (Seoul: Sol Book, 2003). There is a controversy over whether the play was in a modern or traditional style, but the truth is unknown as the original script is lost.  \\"Choi byeongdu taryeong\\" and Silvery World  Another question with regard to Silvery World is the relationship between the work and \\"Choi byeongdu taryeong.\\" Some argue that \\"Choi byeongdu taryeong\\"—it falls under the category of pansori, a Korean genre of musical storytelling—was enjoyed throughout Gangwon-do and the author wrote the first part of the novel based on this song. To support this argument, evidence of other works adapted from the song has to provided. However, other than Silvery World, there is no confirmed reworked version inspired by the song. In addition, even its original text is yet to be found. Therefore, it is difficult to verify this assumption. Still, the novel cannot be said to have been created solely by the author's imagination, as the master pansori singers who actively performed in those days mention the aforementioned song in their memoirs, though its original text is lost. Also, it is highly likely that, given the times, people sang songs about a venal official oppressing and killing a rich farmer. The fact that Silvery World includes long excerpts of folk songs supports the argument that the work of fiction is related to the pansori songs of the day.\\"Silvery World,\\" Encyclopedia of Korean Traditional Entertainment, accessed November 26, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3326174&cid;=56785&categoryId;=56785.

It broadcasts to Coventry, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, south Staffordshire, the Cotswolds and north Oxfordshire. The station launched on 2 December 2019, following the merger of six Quidem-owned stations, including Touch FM, Rugby FM and Banbury Sound. History Under relaxed OFCOM requirements for local content on commercial radio, Capital Mid-Counties is permitted to share all programming between the six licences, all located within the approved area of the Midlands.Statement: Request to change Format – Banbury Sound, Rugby FM and Touch FM, ofcom.org.uk, 14 November 2019 These licences previously broadcast as separate stations: * Radio Harmony began broadcasting to Coventry and Warwickshire in August 1990, later rebranding to 'Kix 96' in 1995. * FM102 The Bear began broadcasting to Warwickshire, Worcestershire and The Cotswolds from studios in Stratford-upon- Avon in May 1996. * Centre FM began broadcasting to south east Staffordshire and South Derbyshire from studios in Tamworth in June 1998. * 107.1 Rugby FM began broadcasting to Rugby and surrounding areas in August 2002. * Banbury Sound began broadcasting to north Oxfordshire in February 2006 as Touch FM. * 107.3 Touch Radio began broadcasting to the Warwick, Leamington Spa and Kenilworth areas of Warwickshire in April 2008. By 2006, The Bear 102, Centre FM and Kix 96 were rebranded by then-owners CN Group as Touch FM - with similar branding adopted by the Warwick and Banbury stations upon their launch. In the same year, the CN Group acquired Rugby FM and transferred its operations to a regional broadcast centre in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. In 2009, the CN Group sold off its radio interests in the Midlands. The Banbury station was sold to a private consortium in a staff buyout in April and subsequently rebranded as a wholly independent operation, Banbury Sound. In June, the four Touch FM stations and Rugby FM were sold for an undisclosed price to Quidem, a newly established company set up by former GCap Media directors Steve Orchard and Wendy Pallot. The new owners introduced a new format identified on-air as Classic Hits and The Best Of Today with live breakfast shows and voicetracked Drivetime shows for each licence area. In October 2010, Quidem reacquired Banbury Sound, which co-located to Quidem's main studios at Honiley in Warwickshire and reintroduced networked output but retained its separate branding. From 2012 until 2016, Touch FM's service for Burton, Lichfield & Tamworth was broadcast from studios in Coalville, Leicestershire, shared with Oak FM (sold off by Quidem in 2015) until shortly after that station's sudden closure, when it moved to the Honiley studios. In September 2019, Quidem announced it had entered a brand licensing agreement with Global, citing financial losses. The agreement allows the group to carry the branding and programming from one of Global's radio networks while retaining ownership of its six licences - effectively being operated as franchises. Two months later, OFCOM granted permission for Quidem to change the licensed Formats of its local stations to \\"a rhythmic-based music-led service for 15-29 year-olds supplemented with news, information and entertainment\\" - a move which brought the stations into line with the formats of Global's Capital network. On 27 November 2019, it was confirmed the six Quidem stations would merge and join the Capital network on Monday 2 December 2019. Touch FM, Rugby FM and Banbury Sound ceased broadcasting at 7pm on Friday 29 November 2019. Regional programming on the station consists of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside localised opt-outs for news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. All other local output was replaced with networked programming from London. Local news output for Capital Mid-Counties is produced by Global. Programming Regional programming is produced and broadcast from Quidem's Honiley studios from 4-7pm on weekdays, presented by Ollie Gallant and Simon Alexander. All networked programming originates from Global's London headquarters. News Global's Newsroom broadcasts hourly localised news updates from 6am-7pm on weekdays and 6am-12 noon at weekends with headlines on the half-hour during Capital Breakfast on weekdays. Separate bulletins are produced for the licence areas previously served by Touch FM, Rugby FM and Banbury Sound.

This motorcycle employed almost the same motor as its predecessor, the XS 11. The motor was a four-stroke, transverse-mounted four- cylinder engine with dual overhead cams. Its 1101cc engine was making 95hp at the crank, paired with a 5-speed gearbox and shaft drive.Yamaha, Yamaha Motors. XJ1100 Service Manual. Yamaha, 1982. History The XJ1100 was produced for only one year after being completely phased out. The bike directly competed with the other three big manufactures from japan in the big- bore engine cruiser market, as well as other cruisers like Harley Davidson indirectly. Unlike the XS11 that was preceded this bike, it employs a system called YICS which increases fuel efficiency as it promotes better combustion.  Specifications  The motorcycle's engine uses 4x34mm Mikuni carburetor for its fuel delivery with a 9.0:1 compression ratio. The bore and stroke are 75.5x68.6 mm respectively. This engine's 95 hp is made at 8,000rpm and 65 ft- lb of torque made at 6500rpm,, which is made possible with the inline-four unlike there more popular competitor Harley Davidson who employed v-twin motors with similar or larger displacement engines.  Sales  Unlike the XS11, there was only one style and trim available for the XJ1100 called the Maxim. Usually European and North American models vary slightly in the size of the gas tank. The XJ1100 is one of the few bikes that maintains its 13-liter gas tank between continents. Possibly because of the lack of options from the factory, this could be one of the key factors that led to low sales of the bike.

(Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 487.) was a Korean writer. He wrote in a variety of genres including novels, plays, reports, and reviews, in two languages, Korean and Japanese. His career as a writer first began in Japan after publishing a short story written in Japanese, and his Korean-written works were later published in Korea. For his short story \\"Bit soge (빛 속에, Into the Light),\\" written in Japanese, he became the first Korean to be nominated for the Akutagawa Prize. He went to China in 1945 to join the army fighting for Korea's liberation. After the country's independence, he mostly lived and wrote in North Korea and died in 1950 during the Korean War.  Life   Before the 1940s  Kim was born into a wealthy family in Pyeongyang, in 1914. While he was studying in Pyeongyang High School, he led a strike again Japan for which he was expelled from school.Gwon Yeongmin, \\"Kim Sa-ryang,\\" Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333236&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737. He moved to Japan in 1932, graduated Saga High School, and got into Tokyo Imperial University in 1936 to study German literature. In university, he published a short story entitled \\"Toseongnang (토성랑, The Shantytown near the Earthen Ramparts)\\" in the second volume of the literary coterie magazine River Bank, adapted it into a play, and performed it with the Joseon Art Group. However, the performance caused trouble and he was in detention with other members of the group for two months. In 1938, he took part in the performance of Chunhyangjeon (춘향전, The Story of Chunhyang) in Joseon, organized by the drama company Sinhyeop. Kim submitted his thesis about Heinrich Heine and graduated university in 1939. After the graduation, he briefly worked as a journalist for the Chosun Ilbo. He published the short story \\"Into the Light,\\" and also translated and introduced into Japanese many Korean literary works, such as \\"Mumyeong (무명, Absence of Light),\\" a short story written by Yi Kwang- su.  The 1940s  In 1940, Kim Sa-ryang became the first Korean author to be nominated for the Akutagawa Prize, for his short story \\"Into the Light.\\" He started publishing serially his novel Nakjo (낙조, Falling) in Korean from 1940 to 1941. Also, his Japanese-written short stories \\"Cheonma (천마, Heavenly Horse)\\" and \\"Pulsup gipsugi (풀숲 깊숙이, Far into the Grassland)\\" came out in 1940, and \\"Hyangsu (향수, Homesick)\\" in 1941. In the same year, his first short story collection Into the Light was published in Japan. He wrote stories in Korean as well, such as \\"Yuchijang-eseo mannan sanai (유치장에서 만난 사나이, The Man I Met in Jail),\\" published in 1941.The story was later translated into Japanese with the title \\"Count Q\\" and included in his second short story collection. During the Pacific War, he was in detention for 50 days, forced to follow the Japanese military on the frontlines of the Southeast Asia and to write about them, but he refused to the end.\\"Kim Sa-ryang,\\" Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=552287&cid;=46645&categoryId;=46645. In 1942, he published \\"Sipjang kkopsae (십장 꼽새, The Chief Worker, Mr. Hunchback)\\" and the short story collection Gohyang (고향, Hometown). In the same year, Kim returned to his hometown and researched the conditions of the slash- and-burn farming villages, and published the novels Taebaek sanmaek (태백산맥, The Taebaek Mountains) and Badaui norae (바다의 노래, Songs of the Sea) in 1943. He was sent to China in 1945 as a member of the group organized to entertain student soldiers, but he escaped to the Taihang mountain in Yan'an, China. Later, he joined the Alliance for Joseon Liberation in North China, and wrote the play Hojeop (호접, Tiger Swallowtail) while fighting against Japan. On hearing the news of Japan's defeat in August 15, 1945, he returned to his home country as the advance party of the Korean Volunteer Army. He participated in a roundtable talk of writers held in Seoul and the inaugural meeting of the Literary Alliance of Joseon.  After the independence of Korea  While publishing serially Yeonan mangmyeonggi (연안망명기, Living in Exile in Yan'an), whose title was later changed to Noma Malli (노마 만리, The Slow Horse Goes Four Thousand Kilometers), Kim moved to North Korea and became a major member of culture and arts organizations. He left a number of works, including his plays Noeseong (뇌성, Thunder), published in 1946, and Daeoneun taeyangeul hyanghayeo (대오는 태양을 향하여, The Ranks Go Towards the Sun), in 1950. Then he took part in the Korean War as one of the war writers and wrote reports like \\"Seoul-eseo suwon- euro (서울에서 수원으로, From Seoul to Suwon)\\" and \\"Urineun ireoke igyeotda (우리는 이렇게 이겼다, This Is How We Won).\\" He reportedly died of a heart attack near Wonju, in October, 1950, after finishing his last work, the report on war Badaga boinda (바다가 보인다, I See the Ocean). His works have been translated and introduced in not only Japan and Korea, but also China and the U.S. In 2005, a monument commemorating Kim's literary legacy was erected at the entrance of the village of Hujiazhuang in China.  Writing   Style  Many of Kim's works vividly depict the reality of Korea and its situation as a Japanese colony.Gwon Yeongmin, \\"Kim Sa-ryang,\\" Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333236&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737. He did write a lot in Japanese, but he focused on the reality of the colonized country, explored the identity of the Korean people,Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 488. and criticized the Japanese colonization.Hwang Ho-duk, \\"On Kim Sa-ryang's Into the Light: Writing in Japanese,\\" History Towards Tomorrow 32 (2008), 140. Also, he prolifically wrote in and translated into both Korean and Japanese, showing a strong commitment to his bilingualism.Kim Hye-yeon, Study on Modern Korean Literature and Bilingualism, Focusing on Kim Sa-ryang (Paju: Kookhak, 2012), 69–70.  Major works  His short story \\"Into the Light,\\" written in Japanese and published in 1939, is one of the major works of Kim's early career. Focusing on the internal conflict of the protagonist Haruo, born to a Japanese father and a Korean mother, the story deals with Korean residents in Japan. The narrator of the story who acts like a Japanese and Haruo who denies his Korean blood reveal their true identities at the end. \\"Into the Light\\" is significant as it posed the question of ethnic identity during the last period of the colonization when the Japanese government tried to assimilate the Koreans, and as it supported 'Korean things' that can never be assimilated.Gong Jong-gu, \\"Politics of Names in Kim Sa-ryang's Works,\\" Journal of Modern Literary Theory 72 (2018), 8–12. Beginning in the time when Japan invaded the country and culminating in the March First Movement of 1919, the Korean-written novel Nakjo, published from 1940 to 1941, recounts the story of the family of Yun Seong-hyo, a descendant of a high ranking, corrupt official. The title Nakjo, or falling, means the fall of corrupt, pro-Japanese influences who originally served as the officials of the Joseon's feudal system. The novel is fascinating because it describes different aspects of a colonized society and it deals with the family of the pro-Japanese official who is apprehensive about the vengeance of independence activists.Lim Heon- yeong, \\"On Kim Sa-ryang's Writing: Reading a Distorted Life in the Dark Times,\\" Nakjo (Incheon: Keungeul, 2010). It also successfully captures the beauty of the Korean language by implementing the dialect of Pyeongyang, traditional pansori songs, onomatopoeic and mimetic words.Kim Hye-yeon, Study on Modern Korean Literature and Bilingualism, Focusing on Kim Sa-ryang (Paju: Kookhak, 2012), 185–186. The travel report Noma malli, which came out in 1946 after the country's independence, documents his personal experience of escaping to Yan'an in China and joining the Korean Volunteer Army; it also serves as a historical material of great import about the activism against Japan carried out in China during the last period of the colonization. \\"Noma\\" in the title means a slow horse and is a humble expression suggesting that the author joined the activism against Japan too late.Kim Jaenam, Research on Kim Sa-ryang's Works, Sejong University Thesis 17 (1991), 92. This report is another example of a cultural resistance against Japanese imperialism,Yu Imha, \\"Re-discussing Kim Sa-ryang's Noma malli: From the Search of a Subaltern to Fighting Against Imperialism,\\" Japanese Studies 40, 2015, 147–152. and its narrator refuses to give up hope for the home country and Asia in such harsh realities.Gwak Hyeongduk, Kim Sa-ryang and the Colonial Literature Around the End of Japanese Imperialism (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2017), 367. Through this work, Kim suggests that his escape was a way to fight against Japan and to ensure his freedom to write,Kim sa-ryang jakpumjip, edited by Lim Heonyeong (Seoul: Zmanz Books, 2013), 179–183. and also one of his attempts to realize utopia.Gwak Hyeongduk, Kim Sa-ryang and the Colonial Literature Around the End of Japanese Imperialism (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2017), 48.  Critical reception  Kim received diverse criticisms in South and North Korea and the literary world of the Korean Japanese. In the latter, he was categorized as a writer of proletarian literature and became well-known after his nomination for the Akutagawa Prize. In North Korea, his name was erased in the literary history because he was from the Yeonan (Yan'an in Chinese) group, which stood against Kim Il-sung, until he was reinstated in 1987 and reevaluated as a conscientious nationalist. In South Korea, he was hardly acknowledged since he moved to North Korea and wrote in Japanese; however, after the 1990s, critics enthusiastically acclaimed him for his bilingual and post colonialist writing.Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 489.

There are also similarities in the predicted temperature and density of the warm-hot intergalactic medium compared to the Sculptor Wall.

In the game, players assume the role of ghosthunters Bruce and McCoy from the Data Ghost agency to evict mischievous ghosts across multiple locations. Its gameplay mainly consists of puzzle mixed with Breakout-style action elements using a main two-button configuration. Headed by Nitro Ball director Koji Jinbo, Ghostlop was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Data East for the Neo Geo platforms and who would later go on to work at Kaneko on Cyvern: The Dragon Weapons before the former company declared bankruptcy in 2003. The game was first given a location test in 1996 and despite being previewed across few video game magazines, in addition of being showcased to attendees at trade shows, it was ultimately shelved by SNK for unknown reasons. Despite Ghostlop never being officially released to the public by SNK, a ROM image of the complete game was leaked online by homebrew developer Neobitz, allowing for it to be played. As of 2009, the rights to the title are currently owned by G-Mode. Its characters and gameplay mechanics would later reappear in Magical Drop V.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the released beta build. Ghostlop is a falling block puzzle game reminiscent of Drop Off and Puzzle Bobble, where players take control of ghost hunters Bruce (P1) and McCoy (P2) with the main objective of evicting as many ghosts as possible from the playfield with a single ball by using the walls and/or their respective character to ricochet the ball back at the ghosts to eliminate them before the timer runs out and the current round ends. Failing in catching the ball from rebound after touching the floor results in a stack of random colored ghosts rapidly descending from the top and once all the ghosts reach the bottom, the game is over as a result unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. The game offers a single-player campaign mode where one player assume the role of either Bruce or McCoy to hunt and evict mischievous ghosts across multiple locations, as well as a versus mode where players compete for the highest score. A unique feature of the game is how ghosts are evicted; Similar to Silhouette Mirage and Ikarugas polarity mechanism, players can switch their ball between red and blue colors in order to evict ghosts of the same respective color by pressing either A or B buttons. There are also three additional types of ghosts: bomb ghosts capable of detaching others caught within their blast radius, skull ghosts that take two hits to evict as well as electric ghosts, which act as dynamite that erases all the ghosts from the playfield. Similar to Puyo Puyo's chain mechanism, players are able to attack the rival playfield by performing a chain reaction with a disappearing ghost that cause a group of ghosts to fall off and spawn in the rival area.  Development  Ghostlop was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Data East for the Neo Geo platforms such as Spinmaster, Windjammers, Karnov's Revenge, Street Slam and the Magical Drop franchise, after which a group of employees would later go on to work at Kaneko on Cyvern: The Dragon Weapons before the former company declared bankruptcy in 2003. Its development was helmed by Nitro Ball director Koji Jinbo as producer, with Yuzuru Tsukahara serving as the project's sole designer. Programmers Kenichi Minegishi, Osapan, Sandy Hirokun and Sho Chang wrote the game's software. Endo Chang and several artists were in charge of creating the pixel art, while Tony Taka acted as character designer. The sound was handled by Gamadelic members Hiroaki Yoshida, Masaaki Iwasaki and Shinichi Yamazaki, while character voice work was done by Lynn Harris and Ward Sexton, the latter of which is credited erroneously as Word E. Sexton.  History  Ghostlop was first showcased by SNK to the public at trade shows such as the Amusement & Music Operators Association Show (AMOA) and Amusement Machine Show, in addition of being playable during location tests in 1996, where it was reportedly met with a less than enthusiastic response from players. The game was also previewed on Electronic Gaming Monthly and Neo Geo Freak. SNK briefly considered re- releasing the title in 2001 but the idea was scrapped and was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons, leading Data East in notifying Japanese audiences about the cancelled launch via email, however several possible factors have been given as to why it was never published. On January 2002, emulated screenshots from a prototype cartridge surfaced online, indicating that the ROM image of the game was preserved but not made widely available to public.  Release  On February 2003, a MVS prototype cartridge of Ghostlop was acquired by video game collector Billy Pitt from an Ohio-based arcade operator, who received it via SNK. Although its production number during development remained unknown and was generally believed to be assigned with the number 128, it was later revealed to be officially assigned with the number 228 instead on April of the same year. Around the same time period, a ROM image of the complete game was leaked online by homebrew developer Neobitz.  Legacy  After Data East declared bankruptcy in 2003, the rights to Ghostlop were acquired and are currently owned by G-Mode as of 2009. Although its release was cancelled, the characters later reappeared in Magical Drop V, using gameplay from the former title instead of traditional Magical Drop mechanics.

Since the release of her first song “Gau Bie 告別”, Lee launched her career as a lyricist, alongside with her career as the renowned writer and poet Hsia Yu.  Early life  Lee graduated from National Taiwan University of Arts with a film studies degree, and had a few part-time jobs in publishing and TV broadcasting companies. She never joined any poetry clubs nor worked with any mainstream publishers. Lee started her contemporary poetry writing at the age of 19 when her work began to receive praise and recognition. Living off the royalties from the lyrics she has written and the sales of her self-funded poetry publications, lyricist Lee and poet Hsia Yu travel around for inspirations. She had lived in the suburbs of Southern France, returned to Taiwan, and then have been living in both Taipei and Paris.  Career   Early career  The first song Lee has written was Tai Hsiang Lee's “Gau Bie 告別”. There's a story behind the creation of this song that started with an IP dispute between different record companies. Then, Chung-tan Tuan from Rock Records advised to rewrite the lyrics, and contacted the poet Hsia Yu. With the pronunciation of her English name plus Tai Hsiang Lee's surname, Hsia Yu gave herself another name for writing lyrics: “Katie Lee”. The new lyrics was soon completed in one afternoon; however, it could not match the melodies from the original song. Despite of that, Tai Hsiang Lee decided to rewrite the melody and create a completely new song. The song “Gau Bie告別” was then completed and it marked the start of Lee's lyricist career. She has then continued to contribute more of her works by various names including “Talung Tung” and “Fei Lee”.  Songwriter  Since her debut as a lyricist in 1984, Lee has accumulated works over 200 songs, including many classic hits like ‎“I'm Not Good Looking But I'm Very Gentle 我很醜，可是我很溫柔” by Chief Chao, “Ni Zai Fan Nao Xie She Me Ne? Qin Ai De 你在煩惱些什麼呢？親愛的” and “Impulsiveness 情不自禁” by Simon Hsueh, “Feng De Tan Xi 風的嘆息” by Mavis Hee, “Ni Shi Wu Wo Shi Jiu Guan 你是霧我是酒館” by Joey Wong, “Ta De Xin Shi Ge Ju Da Ting Che Chang 她的心是個巨大停車場” by Sylvia Chang, “Zhuang Man Wo, Ni De Yan Jing 裝滿我，你的眼睛” by Pauline Lan, “Ai Cing Du Zhu 愛情賭注” by Michelle Pan, “Ni Shi Tian Shang Zui Yuan De Na Ke Xing Xing 你是天上最遠的那顆星星” and “Can Ku De Wen Rou 殘酷的溫柔” by Chyi Chin, “Woman & The Child 女人與小孩” by Yu Chyi, “Mei Ge Ren Dou You Zi Ji De Bang Yao Hun 每個人都有自己的幫要混” by Bobby Chen, etc. Many of the songs Lee has written have helped several singers rise to prominence. For example, Chief Chao instantly received his career success as a new artist with the song ‎“I'm Not Good Looking But I'm Very Gentle 我很醜，可是我很溫柔”, the song chosen by the producer Kay Huang. On the other hand, on top of songs like “Impulsiveness 情不自禁” and “Ni Zai Fan Nao Xie She Me Ne? Qin Ai De 你在煩惱些什麼呢？親愛的” , Simon Hsueh had also collaborated with Lee in his very last album in 1990, “Life 生老病死”. The songs included “Alone or Together 一個人、兩個人”, “A Lonely Island 一座孤獨的島” and “Bloody Mary 血腥瑪麗” , in which Simon's voice expressed his love of life and his audacious attitude. Over the years, Lee has created many unique works with impact, such as Sandee Chan's “Leaving on a Jet Plane乘噴射機離去”, Jolin Tsai's “Play我呸”, Waa Wei's “You Lovely Bastard 還是要相信愛情啊混蛋們”, etc. The lyrics and the singers themselves both have very strong personalities that allow both parties to inspire each other. The unique genre of lyrics also created new possibilities for the singer to elevate her performance and in turn contribute to the well-roundedness of the song. For example, “Play我呸” has served as a significant work in Jolin's music career. In the lyrics, Lee played with a lot of ironies that describe the surreal yet real social phenomena. She wrote and explained the conflicts between two sides of the spectrum, like elite and commoners, cultural and commercial, and literates and celebrities, etc. Through these juxtaposes, she demonstrated the society's behaviors of criticizing (呸) while at the same time indulging (Play) in these scenarios.“Play我呸” has received many awards globally and paved new ways for Jolin Tsai's performing career. The more recent lyrics by Lee include Cheer Chen's “A Box of Rain 雨水一盒”, Hebe Tien's “A Better Rival in Love 請你給我好一點的情敵”, Jam Hsiao “Golden Love 純金打造”, Chris Lee “Cun Zai Gan 存在感”, Shin “煉金術 Alchemy”, and songs she collaborated with Greeny Wu “As a Monster作為怪物” and “Ah! Muo Qi 啊！默契”, etc. Some of the terms in her lyrics have also become new slangs that have been widely used, such as “cool”, “happy while in pain”, “play”, and “everyone has their gang to hang”, etc. She's also written the lyrics for three of Jimmy's musicals.  Voice appearances  In 2002, Lee released an album with the name “Hsia Yu’s Yue Hun Band 夏宇愈混樂隊” (The trashier the better band of Hsia Yu). In the album, she compiled 13 of the lyrics that were not shortlisted by record companies, and invited producer Rou Zheng Chen to write and produce the songs. These songs were performed by many indie artists, including Faye, the former vocal of F.I.R. Lee also personally narrated for the album in the name of Hsia Yu. In 2016, Lee and sound artist Jun Yan together published “7 Poems and Some Tinnitus七首詩和一些耳鳴”, an experimental sound artwork with seven tracks of Lee's narration along with Yan's music arrangement. Other than this album, Lee's has also made a few occasional appearances in other artists’ works; mostly through narration of poems in the name of Hsia Yu. Such albums include Sandee Chan's song “Ni Zai Fan Nao Xie She Me Ne? Qin Ai De 你在煩惱些什麼呢？親愛的”, Hello Nico “Wo Men Ku Nan De Ma Xi Ban我們苦難的馬戲班”, Waa Wei's “Gou Yin勾引”, Sodagreen's “Spring 春．日光” album, and Chiu Pi's “Zheng Ye Da Yu整夜大雨”, etc.  Poet Hsia Yu  When she's a poet, Lee adopts the name of “Hsia Yu”. “Bei Wang Lu 備忘錄”, the poetry collection she published in 1984, was a self-funded publication which Hsia Yu managed to take care of the editing, formatting, and design all by herself. There were only 500 copies in the first edition and another 500 all ran out of stock the next year. The illegal copies of “Bei Wang Lu 備忘錄” are still being reproduced and circulated till this day. Hsia Yu has expressed that she is not satisfied nor feel comfortable about the style of “Bei Wang Lu 備忘錄” anymore now. She thinks it's her “teenage work” and not worthy of further editions. Hsia Yu then self- funded her second publication, “Ventriloquy 腹語術”, which was commented by Chi Cheng Luo 羅智成as “a book that’s against realities”. Her third publication was “Mo Ca · Wu Yi Ming Zhuang 摩擦·無以名狀”, which was actually produced by cutting out words from the original printing book of “Ventriloquy 腹語術”, and compiling the words into a new piece of literary artwork. It's this unconventional way of writing and challenging the boundaries that make Hsia Yu and her poetry extraordinary and interesting. Her fourth publication is “Salsa”, in which she incorporated many details in people's daily lives. The color of the sheep on the cover changes in every different print. The fifth publication “Pink Noise” was published in 2007. It was compiled by translating English words Hsia Yu found from surfing the internet, creating 33 poems. The pages presenting the black English words and pink Chinese words were made from celluloid sheets. She sets the key of the first edition to be C Major, and when the second edition was published in 2008, the pink color was brightened by 15%, and the key became D Major. The second edition also included another 22 sheets for the translation of “Wen Shi 問詩”. Due to expensive costs of printing, this book also went out of stock soon after. Till this day, the edition of E Major has not yet been published. In 2010, the new publications “This Zebra 這隻斑馬” and “That Zebra 那隻斑馬” was first sold in the 3rd Simple Life Festival where Hsia Yu sold her books happily while giving autographs and hugging the readers. “This Zebra 這隻斑馬” has a rigid black and white design, with contents neatly formatted. At the end of the book, the readers can see the interaction between L (Lee) and H (Hsia Yu). On the other hand, “That Zebra 那隻斑馬” has a colorful, fun design and includes only lyrics. The book is cut horizontally to represent the short life span of pop music lyrics. The book also went out of stock and is not likely to have future prints, as Hsia Yu said “The printing process was way too expensive and time consuming. It’s time consuming to the extent that every worker would sigh upon receiving the work, and my name is almost synonymous with notorious.” In 2011, “Poetry Sixty 詩六十首” is published. The entire book from the cover to the back is printed with poems and concealed with texture of scratcher lotteries. The readers could reveal the texts hidden underneath upon numerous touches of the book as time goes by. Hsia Yu compiled another anthology in 2013 named “88 Shou Zi Syuan 88首自選”. It's very simply formatted and designed. She deliberately used the same industrial paper for both the cover and the pages inside. There's only a single font throughout with dozens of pictures randomly scattered. The second and third editions were published in the following two years, with a different selection of poems. In 2017, the fourth edition was published, including a few of her newer poems and several new photographs. She hopes this series can continue to grow to the eighth edition, and revolutionize the concept of “anthology”. In 2016, “First Person 第一人稱”, a work combining 301 lines of poetry and over 400 pictures was published. All of the pictures were taken in 2014, and paired with poetry written by Hsia Yu. The design of the book is like a black cassette, resembling a movie theater. The poem lines in every picture serves like subtitles (both in Chinese and English) in the movies. Hsia Yu organized three sessions of press releases for this new book at Woolloomooloo Café, and an additional autograph event. In 2017, Hsia Yu was invited to six stage performances combining poetry and music by FICEP at the event “Nuit de la literature 文學之夜”, located in Villa Belleville in Paris. In the summer of 2018, Hsia Yu joined the Poetry Night event at National Chengchi University. As soon as a wine bottle is opened, her voice and thoughts flew freely. There were countless people in line for her autograph after the event. In July, Hsia Yu's poetry was presented in the exhibition “Dream Makers｜Riverbed Theatre’s 20 Anniversary 造夢者：潛意識劇場－河床劇團20年” in the section of “Desire for Words 渴望詞語”, where she used ink to cover 19 of her poems. In September the same year, Subjam and Hsia Yu published an anthology in Simplified Chinese, incorporating five of her previous publications: “Ventriloquy 腹語術”, “Mo Ca · Wu Yi Ming Zhuang 摩擦·無以名狀”, “Salsa”, “Pink Noise”, and “Poetry Sixty 詩六十首”. At the end of the year, she participated in the exhibition “Re-Base: When Experiments Become Attitude 再基地”. Published in July 2019, “Luo Man Shi Zuo Wei Dun Wu 羅曼史作為頓悟” is Hsia Yu's newest work, compiling 19 poems written after the publication of “First Person 第一人稱”. Following the printing style of her previous work, Hsia Yu published \\"Ji Zhui Zhi Zhou 脊椎之軸\\" in 2020. Currently, Hsia Yu remains to publish individually for her determination of executing every detail and presenting the artwork in the exact way she wants it.  Artistry   Critique  Being the producer of “I'm Not Good Looking But I'm Very Gentle 我很醜，可是我很溫柔” and “Nan Hai Kan Jian Ye Mei Gui 男孩看見野玫瑰”, Kay Huang once expressed her thoughts of working with Lee: “as Lee’s words are not limited to the framework of pop music, rhyming, and stanzas, her lyrics are very unique. They allow songwriters to explore new possibilities from different perspectives.” Renowned music critic Shi Fang Ma has commented, “I adore Katie Lee. She can’t be copied for she’s too smart and sharp for industry standards. There are two personalities in lyricist Katie Lee and poet Hsia Yu, and they each hold different missions. I think you can feel this warmth that embraces the world mortals in Lee’s works. She can write songs like “告別Gau Bie” and also “Play我呸”. How good can she get?” In the world of literature, the Nobel laureate in Literature, Xingjian Gao has commented on Hsia Yu’s work: “This anthology defeats all misty poems. This girl defeats the whole misty poetry genre.”  Writing style and mindset  Adopting a different work process from Chinese pop music productions, Lee usually writes the lyrics first and then hand it to someone to write the melody. In her earlier career, she also likes to submit the handwritten drafts directly. Lee would also meet with the singer to get more understanding of the person, so she could feel the personality of the singer and be inspired to write lyrics that are suitable for him/her. Occasionally, she'll also fill in the lyrics according to the melody, such songs include the collaboration with Jian Min Jiang “Happy While In Pain痛並快樂著”, many songs in 2019's collaboration with Shin's “Alchemy 煉金術” album, including “Alchemy 煉金術” and “Ran Liao 燃料”, and “醒” (melody by David Tao). Lee is relatively more low-profile as she doesn't want to become a public figure nor does she want to be defined or tagged. Lee wants to feel free, and also wants her readers to read her works freely with absolutely no interference from her personal affairs or behaviors. Sometimes she feels poetry writing is a lonely process, because you never know if anyone will read it. Writing a song, on the other hand, makes her feel a stronger connection with the world, so she also sees writing lyrics as the more mainstream part of herself. Lee thinks writing poems and lyrics are equally important to her and they are mutually dependent on each other. Because of writing poems, Lee can write lyrics that create impressions; and because of writing lyrics, she can write poems with rhythms.

The M-D is the second digital camera in the Leica M mount line-up without the rear LCD screen. The first such camera was the Leica M Edition 60 that founded on 16 September 2014, and was released to mark the sixtieth anniversary of its Leica M rangefinder system. Only 600 of these models were made, and were sold for about $18,000/£12,000. The M-D however was a full production model. The camera went on sale in May 2016 with a price of $5995/£4650. Functionally the Leica M-D is almost exactly the same as the Leica M (Typ 262), but without the rear screen and menu buttons. Leica says the camera is designed for the ‘essentials of photography’, or ‘Das Wescentliche’, and that it should help photographers concentrate on the important elements of image making rather than distracting camera functions. The photographer controls only the aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings. Instead of the rear screen is the ISO settings dial in silver, which harks back to the Leica film rangefinders. The camera only records DNG Raw image format. The M-D features a 24 Megapixels CMOS sensor and an ISO range of 200–6400. The camera's top and bottom plates are made of brass. The viewfinder contains a magnification of 0.68x and offers bright frame markings for 35/135mm, 28/90mm and 50/75mm lenses. The camera does not include the Leica 'red dot' logo, as the company wanted the camera to be as discreet as possible for street photography. The single frame shutter is particularly quiet.

After six days, the battle ended in defeat for the Spanish. The Spanish defeat secured full control of the island for the Dutch. Background Having lost the previous Battle of San Salvador the previous year, the Dutch amassed a bigger force to drive the Spanish out of Formosa. The Spanish meanwhile, having lost the trust of the aboriginals during the previous battle, were low in morale and dispatched a letter to Manila to request reinforcements, but Governor-General Corcuera sent only two small vessels carrying twelve sailors and twenty soldiers, further lowering the morale of Spanish stationed in the fort. The Siege Location of Keelung, Taiwan One evening in early August 1642, a sampan landed in front of the Spanish fort. Its passengers hurried ashore to deliver a letter to a Chinese man sojourning there. The letter said that the Dutch had readied a large expedition against the Spanish fort. It advised the man to \\"go away at all events, since the enemy was coming, not as in the previous year, but with a much greater force; and therefore it seemed . . . that the Dutch would seize Keelung without fail.\\" The Spanish prepared for a siege. Several days later, the Dutch arrived with four large ships, several smaller ones, and 369 Dutch soldiers. Knowing that the Dutch would try to land a force on San Salvador in an effort to capture the hilltop positions, the Spanish attempted an attack on the Dutch landing party. Twelve Spanish soldiers, eight Pampangans, and thirty or forty aboriginal archers inflicted heavy damage on the landing soldiers, as \\"our men fired their guns at a crowd, and some used three balls at one shot; and the Indian bowmen, who were very skillful, also inflicted much damage on the Dutch, all the more as they came boldly on.\\" The Dutch, however, maintained their discipline and forced the small force to retreat. They climbed the hill and captured the Mira. Then they trained their gun on La Retirada. The Spanish soldiers who defended it were few and lacked supplies, but they fought hard because they knew that if the Dutch captured the redoubt the Spanish were lost. But the Dutch were better equipped: \\"For every ten balls we shot,\\" wrote one Spaniard later, \\"they responded with two hundred or more.\\" Another wrote that the Dutch fired their guns \\"so incessantly that it seemed to be the Judgment Day; and they gave no respite to our men, who were few in number and worn out with fatigue.\\" After four days of shooting, the Dutch battered the walls down and stormed the hill. Having captured the redoubt, the Dutch aimed their cannon against the main fortress below and then sent a messenger with a white flag and a letter in Latin demanding surrender. The governor offered his surrender. Aftermath After the surrender, the Dutch confiscated the Spanish arms and flags and ferried the Spanish troops first to Tayouan, then to Batavia, and then finally back to Manila. The Dutch victory cemented their status as a rising power in Southeast Asia and curtailed further Spanish expansion. In the meantime, the Spanish quarreled about who deserved blame for the loss of Formosa. The Spanish governor who had surrendered to the Dutch was afraid he would be held responsible and refused to go back to Manila. Corcuera received the lion's share of the blame and made powerful enemies in Manila. In 1644 Diego Fajardo Chacón, his successor as governor-general, had him locked up to stand trial for the loss of Formosa. The prosecution charged that he had ordered the destruction of Fort San Domingo and the redoubt that protected San Salvador, that he had withdrawn three of the four companies of soldiers that defended the colony, and, finally, that he had installed as its last governor an inferior soldier who could neither read nor write. These actions were, the prosecution alleged, \\"the total cause of the loss of the Isla Hermosa.\\" Corcuera spent five years imprisoned in the Philippines as the trial dragged on. \\"A strange turn of fortune!\\" wrote a contemporary. \\"Don Sebastian [Corcuera] had been the most absolute and the most dreaded lord in the world.\\" Corcuera was freed by royal order. In 1651 he was named governor of Panama for a second time, but he declined. He did accept the post of governor and captain general of the Canary Islands in 1659, serving there until his death the following year.

This species of flowering plant is indigenous to the north-west of South America, particularly from the drainage basins of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers located in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Originally described by Hermann Karsten in 1858, the cacay tree distinguishes itself by its dense and leafy top, as well as its production of fruits, each one containing three edible nuts. Cacay is notable for the oil extracted from its nuts, which is edible and is also used in cosmetics.  Description  Adult trees in a plantation Caryodendron orinocense is a tree which can grow to tall in the forest. In plantations, the tree reaches heights of up to . Its trunk is straight and cylindrical before separating into numerous branches. Its outer bark is smooth, and is periodically shed as laminar plates. It possesses a wide and superficial root system, such that its thick roots are sometimes visible above ground. The longevity of the species exceeds 60 years. Cacay is an evergreen tree and has a dense and leafy crown. Its leaves are simple and are arranged in an alternate pattern on the stem. Their shape is elliptical or oval, between long and wide. It is a dioecious plants, with male and female specimens. Its masculine flowering is a terminal raceme with small greenish flowers between in diameter. Neither male nor female flowers display any petals. Its feminine flowering is a terminal ear, also with greenish flowers ranging between in diameter, containing large and persistent bracts. Its fruit is a brownish/grey oval and woody capsule between in diameter. Each fruit contains three nuts or kernels (rarely two or four), which are slightly convex and have three faces. Each nut contains a single seed covered by a testa and weights approximately .  Taxonomy and etymology  Illustration in Florae Columbiae (1858) The species Caryodendron orinocense was described in 1858 by the German botanist Hermann Karsten, and was published in Florae Columbiae. In its scientific name, the term Caryodendron is derived from the ancient Greek káryon, meaning \\"nut\\", and déndron, meaning \\"tree\\". Its epithet orinocense suggests that the species was first identified near the Orinoco river. Caryodendron orinocense is found under the following phylogenetic tree within the Caryodendreae tribe. The number in parenthesis represents the year in which the species was described.  Common names  The vernacular names of Caryodendron orinocensese include: * Cacay * Inchi * Tacay * Orinoconut or Orinoco nut * Maní de árbol * Nuez or nogal de Barquisimeto * Nuez de Barinas * Meto huayo or Metohuayo * Palo de nuez * Nueza criolla  Distribution, habitat, and ecology  Female flowers Cacay is an indigenous species to the drainage basins of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, and can be found in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In Colombia, cacay is distributed across the Piedemonte llanero in the eastern foothills of the Andes Mountains. It is also found in the watershed of the Magdalena River. The species has been reported in five Colombian departments (Antioquia, Caquetá, Cundinamarca, Meta, Putumayo) with influence over three Colombian natural regions (Andean, Orinoquía or Eastern Plains, and Amazon). In Venezuela, the plant grows in the states of Apure, Lara, y Barinas. Cacay can also be found in Ecuador, Peru and Brazil in the western part of the Amazon river watershed. The tree grows in the transition between tropical moist forest and tropical wet forest, receiving an average annual precipitation of . It develops preferably in terrains with good drainage that do not easily flood. It tolerates a few months of moderate drought, but does not support long dry periods. The species is also able to support short periods of water saturation, but cannot withstand permanent waterlogging. Cacay prospers in fertile soils originating from alluvial deposits, but can adapt to ultisol and oxisol soils which are acidic and poor in nutrient content. Cacay develops best in warm climates and in low-altitude plains, with average temperatures of and relative humidity of 70-90%. However, cacay is found in altitudes ranging from sea level to 2300 m a.s.l.  Propagation  Male flowers Under natural conditions, the reproduction of cacay is sexual; its seeds germinate well on the ground, one to two weeks after falling from the tree. The species' seeds are recalcitrant, as the seeds quickly lose their viability when under storage. A study conducted in 2012 by Judith García and Carmen Basso concluded that cacay seeds tolerate up to eight days of storage before losing viability, preferably in temperatures of . The species can also reproduce through vegetative (asexual) means, especially through grafting, which is commonly used in cacay farming. Conversely, propagation by plant cutting does not yield satisfactory results, as even when the plant shows callus growth, it does not produce any new development of roots or buds.  Farming  juvenile tree in a plantation The cultivated cacay tree initially grows slowly. During this stage, moderate shade favorably contributes to its development. Cacay can be planted in bags in a nursery for approximately one year, until the tree reaches a height of about . When the tree is actively producing fruits, the cacay plant is a heliophyte, although it tolerates some shade. Cacay be planted in parallel with another plant that grows rapidly and that possesses a small crown which may provide shade to the juvenile cacay tree, but which does not compete for sunlight during the cacay's adult stage. Some plantations associate the cacay tree with another crop that may provide a live vegetable groundcover, for example kudzu. Fruit The ripe cacay fruit physiologically separates itself from the plant and falls to the ground. Cacay trees begin to produce fruit at ages 4-7 years. A single 10 year old cacay tree may produce of nuts per year, although some trees have been reported to produce up to of nuts per year.  Properties and uses   Cacay oil  Cacay is renowned for the quality of its plant oil. Each cacay fruit generally produces three nuts, from which a liquid oil with a yellow-greenish color can be extracted. This oil comprises between 40-60% of the seed's weight. Several studies (Pérez 2001, Cisneros Torres 2006) report that the cacay oil is composed of 71-75% of linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid from the omega-6 fatty acid family, which is important for skincare purposes. Other studies have reported linoleic acid content of 58% (Medeiros de Azevedo 2020) and 85% (Radice 2014). This high concentration of polyunsaturated fats (in this case, of linoleic acid) is superior to that of soybean oil (60%), corn/maize oil (55.5%), sesame oil (42%), peanut oil (26%), coconut oil (14%), olive oil (9.5%), and palm oil (8%). Cacay oil is used in the production of cosmetic products such as soaps, sunscreens, and skincare creams. The full value proposition of this oil for cosmetic purposes is still being developed; however, various studies (Pérez 2001, Ortega Álvarez 2014) have already remarked on the future potential of cacay in this field. The cacay oil is also used directly as an edible oil.  Nutrition  Ripe fruit with three seeds {  +Composition of the cacay nut/kernel Properties Quantity - Plant oil 40-60% - Polyunsaturated fat (in the oil) 71-75% - Calories per nut 641-691 - Protein 15-19% - Starch 17% } The cacay nut is rich in phosphorus, calcium, and iron. About 15-19% of the nut is composed of protein, while the press cake (the dry organic matter after the oil is extracted) is composed 43-46% of protein. The nuts from ripe cacay fruits are edible and have a pleasant taste, similar to that of peanuts. Nuts can be eaten uncooked, toasted, fried, or boiled with salt. The nuts can also be used to prepare foods such as cakes, turrón, beverages, and cookies. After grinding down the nut, its flour can be used to produce vitamin supplements, as well as to elaborate functional foods.  Other uses  Its lumber can be used for woodworking structures, and may be utilized as firewood and in the production of charcoal. Cacay trees may also be used to provide shade to other crops that need it (as possibly coffee plantations) and for other animals. Within the domain of agroforestry, cacay trees may be introduced into areas that are not adequate for intense agricultural and cattle raining activities. Furthermore, the tree also attracts bees through the nectar excreted from its leaves, aiding in the tree's pollination. Lastly, the nut's press cake can also serve as food for cattle due to their high content of proteins and minerals.  Ecological value  Cacay has been identified as one of the several trees indigenous to the Eastern Plains region of Colombia that may serve in the ecological restoration of areas of the savanna containing invasive species of grasses such as brachiaria humidicola. Crops of Caryodendron orinocense, as well as those of other native trees, may help in the conservation and reforestation of their area's ecosystem.

Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Gardiner is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Since joining The World Bank, Jamaica has received in excess of $3 billion US Dollars in loans and grants. Jamaican Minister of Finance, Donald Sangster, led the Jamaican delegations to World Bank and International monetary Fund meetings between 1963 and 1966, while also serving as Governor of the World Bank and IMF.

This island would later be transformed into a Spanish colony, run using black slave labor. In 1655 the island was seized by the English, under the command of Oliver Cromwell. The English would set up a plantation economy that produced sugar, cocoa, and coffee. During this period, little economic development occurred as \\"surpluses available for investment were all transferred abroad (to Europe).\\" In 1834, Jamaica's slaves were freed, and many would become farmers. The Great Depression affected Jamaica severely, causing instability and revolts. The English responded by increasing access land and other resources, and by attracting foreign investment. Between 1950 and 1960 Jamaica experienced high rates of economic growth, due in large part to the growth of the Bauxite mining sector, which went from nonexistent to accounting for over 8% of GDP during the 10-year period.  Post Independence Economy  Jamaican Ten Dollar Bill printed in 1987. In March 1999, $10 coins replaced notes. Jamaica declared independence August 6th, 1962, withdrawing from The Federation of the West Indies, and established a parliamentary democracy centered in the capital of Kingston. After independence, the Jamaican economy was heavily regulated, with many price ceilings. additionally, the Jamaican currency, the Jamaican Dollar, had an artificial exchange rate that was overvalued. The process of structural adjustment reforms (SAPs) began in the mid 1980s, and included financial liberalization, freeing of the foreign exchange market, general marketization. These changes induced price volatility which was later stabilized in the 1990s alongside a policy of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. A proportional representation of Jamaica's exports. It is believed that approximately 40% of the total GDP output of Jamaica today is within the informal markets. Several economist have voiced concern over this, arguing that an increase in the size of the informal economy can lead to a decline in economic growth. Today Jamaica has a population of 2.8 million individuals (2018), a GNI per capita of $4,990 (2018), and a lower inequality rate than most nations in Latin America. The current GDP is 15.71 billion US Dollars, making Jamaica one the largest economies in the Caribbean. The economy of Jamaica consists mostly of a service sector, contributing over 70% of the GDP. Tourism accounts for 20% of GDP, and remittances accounts for 14%. The Jamaican economy has suffered from poor overall growth in the past several decades, averaging less than 1% growth annually over the past 30 years. Some of the causes of slow growth in Jamaica are a disproportionately large public sector, high crime levels, endemic corruption, strict regulation, poor judicial effectiveness, a high debt-to-GDP ratio, and high levels of unemployment. The economy of Jamaica is highly susceptible to fluctuations in weather condition, especially hurricanes (See list of Hurricanes in Jamaica). However, after implementing economic reforms as part of program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development bank (IADB), economic stability was established, and Jamaica has achieved 16 consecutive quarters of growth. = 2018 Economic Assessment = The economic reforms that began in 2013 have been a turning point in the Jamaican economy. Broadly supported, these reforms have demonstrated over the course of two administrations fiscal discipline, and support for both monetary and financial reforms. The wide- ranging structural reforms have broken decades of high debt and low growth in Jamaica. Furthermore, progress has been made on macroeconomic policy. Jamaica has passed the Fiscal Responsibility Law, placing a floor on the overall fiscal balance. The report notes, \\"Employment is at historic highs, inflation and the current account deficit are modest, international reserves are at a comfortable level, and external borrowing costs are at historical lows.\\" However, the economy of Jamaica still exhibits worrying signs. Both growth and social outcomes have failed to respond strongly to reforms. The IMF noted, \\"structural obstacles, including crime, bureaucratic processes, insufficient labor force skills, and poor access to finance, continue to hinder productivity and growth. Moreover, the agricultural sector’s vulnerability to weather shocks exacerbated rural poverty in 2015.\\"  Years of cooperation  In the 1960s Jamaica experienced several years of growth. During this time The World Bank provided Jamaica with loan agreements which supported a number of development projects. In 1965 The World Bank provided Jamaica with loans that supported the construction that expanded a road from Kingston to Spanish Town. The Road, when finished, was a four lane highway which improved transportation on the island. In 1966 loans were provided that allowed for the construction of secondary schools, teacher training programs, the Jamaica School of Agriculture, and the expansion of the University of Technology. In 1967 Jamaica was able to expand and improve the Jamaica Telephone Company's network services thanks to loans provided by the World Bank. During the 1970s Jamaica and the World Bank continued to work together. In 1971 the two worked together to improve education by increasing the total number of secondary school and vocational training centers. Additional transportation improvement project occurred in 1973 and 1974. 1974 saw improvements to both of Jamaica's international airports, in part, because of support provided to Jamaica by the World Bank. During the 1980s Jamaica and The World Bank cooperated in their joint effort to integrate Jamaica into international economy. During this period, cooperation focused, \\"on trade liberalization, increased foreign investment and structural adjustment of the economy.\\" Projects during this era included the development of the Human Employment and Resource Training (HEART) program, an effort, \\"to expand vocational training opportunities to Jamaican youth.\\" In 1982 the Kingston Free Zone facility was constructed, promoting exports, international trade, and employment. Finally, in 1988 Jamaica received funds for emergency reconstruction efforts after the Hurricane Gilbert.  Partnership framework  In 2009, The Jamaica National Develop Agency published Vision 2030 Jamaica, an ambitious new framework that seeks to serve as a near to long-term guide to Jamaica's development. The plan was produced in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which effected Jamaica severely. Within the document, the development goals are as follows: 1: Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest potential. 2:The Jamaican society is secure, cohesive and just. 3: Jamaica's economy is prosperous. 4: Jamaica has a healthy natural environment. In order to support this effort, the World Bank has provided over $500 million US dollars towards development effort in Jamaica since 2013. World Bank project during this period have included initiatives to foster private sector modernization, with the goal being \\"to enhance the government's capacity and effectiveness.\\". Other initiates include, but are not limited to, improvements to the private sector, fostering of investment into high potential sectors, climate resilience projects, and increased capacity to gather climate data for risk management purposes.  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  Provides Jamaica with project loans.  The International Finance Corporation (IFC)  The IFC provides Jamaica with investments and advisory services to support the nation's private sector. The IFC work in Jamaica in a variety of different sectors, such as the expansion and privatization of the Sangster International Airport.  IDA  Not a member  Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)  Jamaica joined MIGA on April 12th, 1988 as one of its 29 founding members. MIGA promotes foreign direct investment into Jamaica. In Jamaica, MIGA works in a number of different sectors, but has a special focus on the development of tourism, financial service, and the energy sector. MIGA has participated in 10 project in Jamaica by providing protection for investments against non-commercial risk. One such project is Port Authority of Jamaica project, where MIGA issued, \\"a $41.8 million guarantee to the Bank of Nova Scotia of Canada covering its $44 million shareholder loan to its subsidiary, the Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica Limited.

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)  The ICSID is the World Bank's arbitration branch. Jamaica excludes investment disputes regarding natural resources. One case involving Jamaica and the ICSID is Jamaica, INC. v. Government of Jamaica.  Results of World Bank Projects in Jamaica  In 2018, public debt fell below 100% of GPD for the first time in decades, and is expected to continue to decline below 60% by 2025/26. Furthermore, unemployment is at historic lows (7.8%), international's reserve coverage is high as well as stable, inflation has stabilized is reduced. Fitch, recently upgraded Jamaica's credit rating from B to B+. A sign of improving economic conditions. According to World Bank data, nearly 390,000 individuals have been impacted by the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH). Research has indicated that PATH has been successful both in terms of its ability to target the poorest 20% of households, and an overall high level of satisfaction reported by those who engage with the program. Additionally, The Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI) continues to improve market access for small-scale farmers and their service providers \\"by supporting revenue-generating activities in agriculture and tourism, while also providing critical infrastructure, marketing, and management support. More than 1,400 farmers have benefited from improved technology, training, and access to markets.\\" REDI has been so successful that a second REDI project will impact an estimated 20,000 additional individuals, many of are at-risk women and youth. Another project, The Jamaica Integrated Community Development Project, has improved safety and development conditions in 18 inner city and rural communities by improving infrastructure using sustainable solutions, such as solar lighting, or purchasing of safety equipment, such as fire hydrants or extinguishers. Other programs include building water supply systems, the implementation of school based violence prevention programs, training of youth in business, justice, and medical procedures, and much more. Under a World Bank development program, The Jamaica Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project, Jamaica has begun the transition to renewable energy. Since the program began, Jamaica has increased it generation capacity from 9% to 12% with a final goal of 20% by 2030, inline with Jamaica Vision 2030, lowering its dependence on expensive foreign oil. The Youth Employment in Digital and Animation Industries Project has created more than 4,000 jobs for young Jamaicans in the digital sector, making way for the growth of a new Jamaican animation industry. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has funded a green energy project that has built 11 wind turbines (2016). When the project is completed, it is expected to produces about 120,000 megawatts of electricity per year, or just over 3% of the Jamaica's energy demands. When finished, the project is expected to produce energy that is among the cheapest available on the Jamaican energy grid, all while offsetting the equivalent emissions of approximately 13,000 cars.  Selected Project  The Road Infrastructure Planning and Maintenance Project was approved in December 1990. The project directed $35 million, all committed by the IRBD, strengthening the institutional capabilities of the ministry of construction, develop road infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and improving road safety. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Construction, and completed in December 1996.  Criticism of The World Bank in Jamaica  Some argue that the Jamaican financial crisis of the 1990s, which caused the failure of numerous organizations and eventually required large scale government intervention, can trace its origins to the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) that World Bank organized. These SAPs included the removal of credit controls, privatization of the financial sector, the adoption of market determined deposit rates, and removal of price ceilings, among other changes. It is argued by some that the ensuing financial crisis was induced by these changes. Professor of Development Finance at The University of The West Indies, David Tennant, argues, \\"This dramatic increase in the rate at which loans were being issued to the private sector was unsustainable, as the risks associated with such loans were not properly assessed, collateral was neither adequate nor properly verified, and the loans were mainly for consumer-oriented activities.\\"  Alternative lending institutions  China Development Bank (CDB) logo Highway 2000, completed in 2003, was a large scale development project that has connected the norther and southern end of the Island via a new highway, stretching over 67 km (41.6 miles). Nicknamed the \\"Beijing Highway\\", Highway 2000 was funded, in part, by the China Development Bank (CDB). The project also received financing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), The European Investment Bank (EIB), The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and Proparco (AFD). In a study of the project, it was noted that Multilateral Development banks (MDBs) \\"have higher social and environmental safeguards than commercial banks or the China Development Bank; and this benefitted all phases of the project\\"  References  Category:World Bank Group relations Category:Jamaica ","title":"Jamaica and the World Bank"},{"id":"62450161","text":"Teiko Tomita (December 1, 1896 March 13, 1990) was a Japanese tanka poet who lived in the Pacific Northwest. Her penname was Yukari.  Early life  Tomita was born Teiko Matsui on December 1, 1896 in Osaka, Japan. She was the second of nine children. She began writing tanka when she was in high school. She took on the penname Yukari. After high school, Tomita earned a teaching certificate, and taught in elementary schools until 1920, when she married a farmer named Masakazu Tomita. They had been exchanging letters for two years, but had never met in person. He lived in Wapato, Washington, so Tomita moved to the United States to be with him. They had five children, but one died as a child.  Career  Tomita and her new husband farmed on the Yakima Indian Reservation. However, they lost the lease on the farm soon after Tomita's arrival. Masakazu worked as a foreman at a nursery in Satus. They moved to Sunnydale in 1929. In 1939, Tomita joined a tanka club in Seattle. Some of her poetry was published in Japan. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Tomita burned all of her poetry so that the FBI would not assume that she had any loyalty to Japan. Regardless, she and her family were incarcerated at Tule Lake in California and Heart Mountain in Wyoming. After she was released in 1945, Tomita briefly lived in Minnesota, but returned to Seattle after the war and became a seamstress. In 1967, Tomita was forced to relocate a second time when it was found that her home was in the buffer zone around the Seattle Tacoma Airport. She moved to Seattle. Despite burning all of her poetry at the beginning of the war, she resumed writing while incarcerated at Tule Lake. She wrote poetry as a way to deal with the situations around her. Some frequent symbols that appeared in her poems include the cherry tree and sagebrush. She wrote poetry for the rest of her life. Tomita died on March 13, 1990.

The visit of Erich Honecker to West Germany took place between 7–11 September 1987 in his official capacity as General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic. It was the first and only visit of this kind undertaken during the partition of Germany. The five-day event was rated as an important step in the development of cross-German relations as well as Ostpolitik, which was implemented beginning with Willy Brandt, Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974.Erich Honeckers Besuch in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1987https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/07/world/honecker-s-west-german-visit- divided-meaning.html Preparations Until 1986, Moscow blocked a possible visit by Honecker to the FRG. In 1984, Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko and Honecker announced at a summit meeting that \\"the goal is not cooperation but demarcation\\". Soviet objections to Honecker's travel to the west were related both to Soviet interests in the block confrontation and to the policies of the Schmidt and Kohl governments in the NATO Double-Track Decision. It was also related to efforts to expand East Germany's limited independence in the realm of foreign policy. In March 1985, Chancellor Kohl renewed his invitation for Honecker to visit Bonn during Chernenko's state funeral. In autumn 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev sent a message to Honecker giving him consent to visit Bonn, which was a result of his own efforts to establish closer contacts with Western countries as part of the reorientation of Soviet politics through the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika. Discussions began in May 1987 on the organization of the visit to the FRG. To solidify this, Federal President Richard von Weizsäcker was received by Gorbachev in the Moscow Kremlin on 7 July 1987 to discuss the visit. The announcement of the abolition of capital punishment in the GDR on 17 July 1987 by the State Council was also related to Honecker's planned visit. Meetings and ceremonies 7 September The dinner on 7 September. Honecker and Weizsäcker are seen in the center while other officials such as Günter Mittag and Vogel are also seen. Honecker arrived at Cologne Bonn Airport in a Transportfliegergeschwader 44 Ilyushin Il-62. He was officially met by Wolfgang Schäuble, Chief of the Chancellery.

After an initial exchange of pleasantries between the two leaders, Honecker was invited into the neighboring Hammerschmidt Villa for a meeting with Federal President Weizsäcker for a working lunch. In his speech to the table Weizsäcker welcomed the guest as a \\"German among Germans\\" and called for further \\"system-opening cooperation\\". The afternoon of the first day of visit was mainly devoted to discussions in the Federal Chancellery, where it mainly went to topics such as travel and visitor traffic, border determination in the Elbe section, minimum exchange, town twinning and the shooting order. In the evening, the federal government gave hosted a dinner for the delegations in the Redoute, where in the table speeches the basic political positions of the heads of state were exchanged. Chancellor Kohl had insisted in advance that the table speeches of the two heads of government are broadcast live on state television both in the FRG and in the GDR.

The Palais Schaumburg was also used during the visit for political discussions, receptions and contract signings. It was followed by Honecker meeting with Bundestag President Philipp Jenninger, and former President Karl Carstens as well as the chairmen of the parties represented in the Bundestag, including the Leader of the Social Democratic Party Hans-Jochen Vogel. In the evening, Honecker gave a counter invitation to dinner at the Hotel Bristol, where he delivered a speech with Kohl.

Protocol Honecker and Kohl inspecting the guard of honour at the Federal Chancellory. As the visit was already controversial as it deemed to confirm West Germany's acceptance of East Germany's existence, the former government went to great lengths to lower its status. The differing views on the significance of Honecker's visit gave diplomatic protocol services particular challenges. While the political leadership of the GDR expected that Honecker would receive customary diplomatic practices in accordance with the internationally recognized institutions, the West Germans tried to avoid such a protocol which would be considered a recognition of the GDR as an independent state and an endorsement of the communist system.25 Jahre Honecker-Besuch: Als Bonn die „Spalterflagge“ setzte.

As a concession to West German concerns, the red carpet was a few feet shorter than usual on official state visits, the motorcycle escort had 17 policemen instead of 21 and the two aforementioned pieces of music played at the military reception were mentioned in the official program merely as \\"hymns\\" instead of \\"national anthems\\". In accordance with the protocol of the Federal Chancellery, Weizsäcker referred to Honecker as \\"Mr. General Secretary\\" instead of \\"Mr. Chairman\\" as the latter implies Honecker's head of state status. Media reception and West German reactions The visit of Honecker in the Federal Republic enjoyed worldwide attention, with approximately 2,400 journalists were accredited. The \\"symbolism of the recognition of German dual nationality\\" dominated the media coverage. Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), a West German television network said his comments in Saarland were \\"the most important made by Honecker during his visit\\".

Pinkston is an American computer engineer, researcher, educator and administrator whose work is focused in the area of computer architecture. He holds the George Pfleger Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering and is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Southern California (USC). He also serves in an administrative role as Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. Pinkston's computer architecture research focuses on the design of interconnection networks for many-core and multiprocessor computer systems. His research contributions span formal theory, methods, and techniques for abating interconnection network routing inefficiencies and preventing deadlock. He has contributed to development of solutions to network deadlocking phenomena, including routing- induced, protocol (message)-induced, and reconfiguration-induced deadlocks. He has also developed energy-, resource-, and performance-efficient network-on- chip (NoC) designs. In 2009, Pinkston became an IEEE Fellow (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) \\"for contributions to design and analysis of interconnection networks and routing algorithms.\\" In 2019, Pinkston became an ACM Fellow (Association for Computing Machinery) \\"for contributions to interconnection network routing algorithms and architectures, and leadership in expanding computing research. Pinkston is the first African American to become a tenured faculty member with primary appointment in engineering and the first African American to hold a decanal administrative faculty position in engineering in USC's history.  Education  Pinkston earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1985 from The Ohio State University. He then went on to earn an M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1986 and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1993, both from Stanford University. The title of his Ph.D. thesis is The GLORI Strategy for Multiprocessors: Integrating Optics into the Interconnect Architecture.  Career  Prior to embarking on a professorial career in academia, Pinkston was a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, a Research Intern at IBM T. J. Watson Research Laboratories, and a Hughes Doctoral Fellow and Research Staff at Hughes Research Laboratories (HRL). In 1993, Pinkston joined the University of Southern California as an Assistant Professor and promoted to the ranks of Associate Professor in 1999 and full Professor in 2003. From 2003 to 2005, he served as the Director of the Computer Engineering Division of Electrical Engineering-Systems at USC. In 2009, Pinkston was appointed as the Senior Associate Dean of Engineering of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and, in 2011, became the Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs in the Viterbi School. In 2017, Pinkston was named holder of the Louise L. Dunn Endowed Professorship in Engineering, and in 2019, he was named holder of the George Pfleger Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering. At USC, Pinkston founded the Superior Multiprocessor Architecture (SMART) Interconnects Group which investigates high-performance communication architectures for parallel computer systems—interconnection networks, adaptive and reconﬁgurable routing algorithms, router design and implementation, and energy- and resource- efficient NoCs. Pinkston was the lead co-author of \\"Interconnection Networks\\", a chapter appearing as Appendix E in the 4th edition and as Appendix F in the 5th and 6th editions of the textbook Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. He served as the founding Lead Program Director of the National Science Foundation’s Expeditions in Computing program in 2007–2008. Before that, he served two years as NSF's CISE CCF Program Director for the Computer Systems Architecture area and co-established the Multicore Chip Design and Architecture (MCDA) program, co-funded by SRC. Pinkston served as an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS) from 1999 to 2002, a member of the Executive Committee of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA) from 2010–2015, and a founding member of the SIGARCH/SIGMICRO Committee to Aid Reporting on Discrimination and Harassment Policy Violations (CARES) since 2018.  Research  In collaboration with his SMART group members, Pinkston conducted deadlock characterization studies that revealed how infrequently, and under what conditions, deadlocks can form and be resolved in interconnection networks, giving credence to deadlock recovery-based routing as a viable alternative to deadlock avoidance-based routing. He and his collaborators investigated deadlock-free routing techniques that improve understanding of various approaches to resolve potential deadlocks, including regressive-based, deflective-based, and progressive-based recovery routing algorithms and architectures. Pinkston, with his collaborators, developed general theory for designing routing algorithms applicable to recovery-based as well as avoidance-based (preventative) approaches and developed a theoretical framework and design methodology for deadlock-free dynamic reconfiguration of routing algorithms—to tolerate network faults, hot-swapping, and other changes in interconnectivity that can cause reconfiguration-induced deadlocks—with minimal packet loss, high throughput, and improved resiliency. Pinkston also led the development of design methodologies and router architectures for energy-, resource-, and performance-efficient on-chip networks (NoCs). With SMART group members, he was among the first to explore architectural support for effectively applying power-saving techniques, such as power gating, to NoCs for reducing static power consumption in computer systems.  Philanthropy  With an endowment gift from Pinkston, The Ohio State University has established the Pinkston Family Achievement Award Fund, which annually awards scholarships to students in the Lambda Psi minority engineering honorary who are performing at the highest academic levels, as well as to a Minority Engineering Program (MEP) student with the most-improved performance.

Description The stable matching polytope is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the stable matchings of the given problem. It has a dimension for each pair of elements that can be matched, and a vertex for each stable matchings. For each vertex, the Cartesian coordinates are one for pairs that are matched in the corresponding matching, and zero for pairs that are not matched. The stable matching polytope has a polynomial number of facets. These include the conventional inequalities describing matchings without the requirement of stability (each coordinate must be between 0 and 1, and for each element to be matched the sum of coordinates for the pairs involving that element must be exactly one), together with inequalities constraining the resulting matching to be stable (for each potential matched pair elements, the sum of coordinates for matches that are at least as good for one of the two elements must be at least one). The points satisfying all of these constraints can be thought of as the fractional solutions of a linear programming relaxation of the stable matching problem. Integrality It is a theorem of that the polytope described by the facet constraints listed above has only the vertices described above. In particular it is an integral polytope. This can be seen as an analogue of the theorem of Garrett Birkhoff that an analogous polytope, the Birkhoff polytope describing the set of all fractional matchings between two sets, is integral. An equivalent way of stating the same theorem is that every fractional matching can be expressed as a convex combination of integral matchings. prove this by constructing a probability distribution on integral matchings whose expected value can be set equal to any given fractional matching. To do so, they perform the following steps: *Consider for each element on one side of the stable matching problem (the doctors, say, in a problem matching doctors to hospitals) the fractional values assigned to pairings with the elements on the other side (the hospitals), and sort these values in decreasing order by that doctor's preferences. *Partition the unit interval into subintervals, of lengths equal to these fractional values, in the sorted order. Choosing a random number in the unit interval will give a random match for the selected doctor, with probability equal to the fractional weight of that match. *Symmetrically, consider for each element on the other side of the stable matching (the hospitals), sort the fractional values for pairings involving that element in increasing order by preference, and construct a partition of the unit interval whose subintervals have these fractional values in the sorted order. *It can be proven that, for each matched pair, the subintervals associated with that pair are the same in both the partition for the doctor and the partition for the hospital in that pair. Therefore, choosing a single random number in the unit interval, and using that choice to simultaneously select a hospital for each doctor and a doctor for each hospital, gives a matching. Moreover, this matching can be shown to be stable. The resulting randomly chosen stable matching chooses any particular matched pair with probability equal to the fractional coordinate value of that pair. Therefore, the probability distribution over stable matchings constructed in this way provides a representation of the given fractional matching as a convex combination of integral stable matchings. Lattice of fractional matchings The family of all stable matchings forms a distributive lattice, the lattice of stable matchings, in which the join of two matchings gives all doctors their preference among their assigned hospitals in the two matchings, and the meet gives all hospitals their preference. The same is true of the family of all fractional stable matchings, the points of the stable matching polytope. In the stable matching polytope, one can define one matching to dominate another if, for every doctor and hospital, the total fractional value assigned to matches for that doctor that are at least as good (for the doctor) as that hospital are at least as large in the first matching as in the second. This defines a partial order on the fractional matchings. This partial order has a unique largest element, the integer stable matching found by a version of the Gale–Shapley algorithm in which the doctors propose matches and the hospitals respond to the proposals. It also has a unique smallest element, the integer stable matching found by a version of the Gale–Shapley algorithm in which the hospitals make the proposals. Consistently with this partial order, one can define the meet of two fractional matchings to be a fractional matching that is as low as possible in the partial order while dominating the two matchings. For each doctor and hospital, it assigns to that potential matched pair a weight that makes the total weight of that pair and all better pairs for the same doctor equal to the larger of the corresponding totals from the two given matchings. The join is defined symmetrically. Applications By applying linear programming to the stable matching polytope, one can find the minimum or maximum weight stable matching. Alternative methods for the same problem include applying the closure problem to a partially ordered set derived from the lattice of stable matchings, or applying linear programming to the order polytope of this partial order. Relation to order polytope The property of the stable matching polytope, of defining a continuous distributive lattice is analogous to the defining property of a distributive polytope, a polytope in which coordinatewise maximization and minimization form the meet and join operations of a lattice. However, the meet and join operations for the stable matching polytope are defined in a different way than coordinatewise maximization and minimization. Instead, the order polytope of the underlying partial order of the lattice of stable matchings provides a distributive polytope associated with the set of stable matchings, but one for which it is more difficult to read off the fractional value associated with each matched pair. In fact, the stable matching polytope and the order polytope of the underlying partial order are very closely related to each other: each is an affine transformation of the other.

This species was discovered by Drew and Hancock in 1994. Bactrocera carambolae are specifically native to Malaysia, southern Thailand and western Indonesia. In past years, this species has invaded South America via the trade of fruits from Indonesia. This species is known as a major exotic pest, labelled as high priority in the Tropical Fruit Industry Biosecurity Plan and a quarantine pest in Brazil.  Identification   Phylogeny  Bactrocera carambolae is a member of the Oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis species complex and are genetically similar except for slight differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. From DNA analyses it was determined that B. carambolae forms a reciprocally monophyletic sister group to a larger clade containing the B. dorsalis species complex.  Morphology  Bactrocera carambolae can be difficult to distinguish from other B. dorsalis complex species. This species is generally characterized by a predominantly black thorax, while featuring abdominal segments with brown lateral posterior markings and a medial longitudinal black band over all three tergum. This species also features a yellow scutellum; triangle shaped portion of exoskeleton located between the base of the wings. In addition to other Diptera, this species has one pair of membranous wings, with hind wings reduced to knob-like structures. The head of this species is reddish brown with one pair of oval, black compound eyes, and sucking/piercing mouthparts. This species can reach a length of 6 to 8 mm (0.6 cm to 0.8 cm). Female B. carambolae can be differentiated from male B. carambolae by observation of longer abdomens, and an ovipositor on the posterior end of the abdominal segments, where as males have shorter abdomens and a more rounded tip of their abdominal segments. Compared to other members of the B. dorsalis complex, B. carambolae have shorter male reproductive organs, known as aedeagi, and broader costal bands on their wings.  Lifecycle  File:Fruit fly larva 01.jpgLarva File:Fruit Fly Pupa.jpgPupae File:Bactrocera dorsalis (complex) (06410589) (6776801024).jpgAdult Bactrocera carambolae are a polyphagous species which infects over 100 different host plants, including avocado, guava, mango, papaya and orange, among several others. The adult female B. carambolae lays her eggs under the skin of host fruits, which take a maximum of two days to hatch. Once the larvae hatch, they immediately begin feeding on the fruit. Following seven to ten days, the fruit matures and falls to the ground below, where the larvae pupates into the soil; emerging approximately one week later. The adult flies take approximately three weeks to fully mature, making the full life cycle last roughly 35 days. The development rate of immature stages of B. carambolae increases with increased temperature.  Symbiotic relationships  Different bacterial communities are associated with different developmental stages of B. carambolae, and includes four major phyla; Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Proteobacteria are dominantly present in every life stage, and Bacteroidetes are at largest in the larval and pupal stages. The large abundance of Proteobacteria are essential in the act of courtship and reproduction of not only B. carambolae, but Bactrocera fruit flies in general.  Behaviour   Feeding  Carambola fruit without infestation Fruit following infestation at larval stage Bactrocera carambolae often feed prior to depositing eggs under the skin of a fruit, therefore you can characterize a fruit that has been fed on by the likelihood of dark spots, or imperfections. Dark spots on the skin of fruits are induced by the female carambola fruit fly laying her eggs. Sometimes there may be no symptoms of infestation on the outside of the fruit following feeding, however dark spots are seen especially on carambola, cherry and guava fruits. Carambola fruit flies prefer to feed on tropical fruits, such as mangos, papayas, and oranges, using their proboscis to pierce the skin and suck liquids from the underlying flesh.  Mating and pheromones  Only adult B. carambolae are capable of mating through sexual reproduction, although the larval stage is capable of producing pheromones to a certain degree. Male B. carambolae are strongly attracted to methyl eugenol (ME), which is a secondary plant compound found worldwide. As they feed on this compound, they convert it into a phenylpropanoid known as (E)-coniferyl alcohol (ECF). This new compound is stored in the rectal gland of the male, ready to be released as a sex pheromone during courtship. Endogenous production of major compound 6-oxo-1-nonanol, and minor compound N-3-methylbutyl acetamide, also contribute to courtship and reproduction. They are stored in the male rectal gland, and when released into the air they create upwind flight via zigzag movement, attracting a significant number of female B. carambolae for courtship. The production of all three endogenous compounds increase with age, reaching its maximum at sexual maturity. The mating period of this species correlates with the time of dusk.  Predators  The endogenous volatile, 6-oxo-1-nonanol, produced by male B. carambolae is also used a deterrent for predators, such as several species of gecko. The production of this endogenous compound is age-related. The gecko is an avid consumer of immature carambola larvae, however their consumption greatly decreases when it comes to sexually mature male B. carambolae. This effect is also seen on female B. carambolae, who do not naturally create 6-oxo-1-nonanol, when extracted male volatiles are topically applied to the thorax.  Impact  Bactrocera carambolae threaten the economy, diversity, food security, and human health. Total crop failure is common in regions that have been hit with intense fruit fly invasions. The economic losses through invasions by the carambola fruit fly, and those alike, raise a major concern for farmers and government agencies. The plant hosts that are most commonly affected, such as papaya, mango, avocado, are of economic importance. Along with carambola fruit fly invasion comes the risk of increased pesticide and how those chemicals have negative consequences for the environment. In Brazil B. carambolae has been found in 21 host fruits, and is at great risk for dispersal of these pests due to the year-round high temperatures and being a major sector for fruit farming.  Prevention and control  Amazonian isolates of Metarhizium, entomopathogenic fungi, are an effective tool in the control of B. carambolae. In both non-sterile and sterile soil treated with Metarhizium, B. carambolae larvae and pupae perish, and those that do not perish, but grow into adults, decease within five days of emergence from the soil. It is important to consider that carambola fruit flies are highly fertile and long-lived when considering prevention and control techniques. Wrapping fruit in newspaper, brown paper bag, or a sleeve, is one of the most effective control methods. Wrapping provides a physical barrier to the skin of the fruit, inhibiting the deposition of eggs. This method becomes even more effective when the fruit is wrapped before ripening, as most B. carambolae attack following ripening. Bait sprays are more environmentally acceptable variants of chemical control compared to cover sprays, and consist of an insecticide and a protein bait. B. carambolae are attracted to the scent of ammonia present in the insecticide, therefore it can be applied to only a small amount of spots in a crop and remain effective.

The team moved through the British national sports car championships before becoming a competitor in the World Sportscar Championship, eventually winning world titles in 1989 and 1992. Chamberlain went on to develop sports cars for Jaguar and Lotus in the 1990s before becoming a customer of the Chrysler Viper GTS-R program in the FIA GT Championship; the team later led MG's return to Le Mans in 2001. Chamberlain later merged with Gareth Evans to form Chamberlain-Synergy Motorsport to campaign TVRs in 2004 before moving to the European Le Mans Series where they won another championship in 2005. Chamberlain-Synergy left active motorsports in 2008, although Hugh Chamberlain continues to work as a manager and consultant with other teams in sports car racing. History Chamberlain-Synergy's championship-winning Lola-AER in 2005 Chamberlain raced on the amateur level in the 1960s before entering the Clubman series in 1968. Developing engines for his own Mallock U2 sports cars led to the formation of Chamberlain Engineering to build and sell engines for road and race cars as well as fund his own entries in Clubmans; the company later moved into their permanent race shop in Buntingford in 1978. After teaming with Will Hoy in 1982 the pair led the Clubmans series for three years before signing Creighton Brown, purchasing a Tiga sports car and Hart turbocharged engine to move into the Thundersports series, although the engine suffered reliability issues throughout the season. Once sorting the Hart's issues for 1986 Chamberlain gathered the funding to move to an international series, entering the C2 category of the World Sports-Prototype Championship with the best result of seventh in class at Spa. The team purchased a new chassis from the defending C2 world champions Spice Engineering for 1987 and Nick Adams became the team's lead driver after the departure of Hoy. Although not a successful championship bid, Adams and Graham Duxbury won their class at the non-championship Kyalami event. Owner-driver Jean-Louis Ricci also added his own Spice to Chamberlain's team in the latter half of 1987 and continued the partnership into 1988. Although winless, the two Spices were consistent finishers and the team was runners-up in the C2 teams' championship behind Spice Engineering, while Ricci and co-driver Claude Ballot-Léna were sixth in the drivers' standings. In 1989, Spice moved to the upper class of the championship and Chamberlain switched from their turbocharged Hart motor to the more dominant Ford Cosworth V8. Nick Adams, partnered with Fermín Vélez and sponsored by Repsol, won the first four races of the season. Their control of the category was enough that the team skipped the final race of the season, entering their Spice-Ford in the upper class of the championship instead, yet still winning the teams and drivers' championships in the C2 category. The lower class became defunct in 1990, moving Chamberlain into a class now lead by manufacturer teams from Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Toyota, Nissan, and Porsche, as well as returning to competing against the factory Spice team. A variety of drivers rotated through the team's two cars, although Vélez later moved to the Spice team and the season ended with Chamberlain not scoring any championship points. New regulations coming into effect for the series left Chamberlain to enter only select races in 1991 before a return to a full-season effort in 1992, once more in the newly-established FIA Cup category. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the only driver in the FIA Cup category to compete in all six races that season, handily won the drivers' championship. The World Championship folded after the 1992 season and Chamberlain began a slew of GT programs in the 1990s. A partnership with Lotus Sport came in 1993, codeveloping Lotus Esprits for competition. Although intended for Le Mans, Chamberlain returned to their British racing roots by competing in the newly-founded BRDC National Sports GT Challenge in 1994, winning their class title with Thorkild Thyrring, as well as entering some other international events on the BPR Global GT Series. As Lotus took full control of the project in 1995, Chamberlain began various projects with British teams, developing a Jaguar XJ220 and running a Porsche 911 GT2. The team eventually became involved in Chrysler's new GT program as the first customers of the Viper GTS-Rs, entering a two-car team in the FIA GT Championship. By 1999 Chamberlain had moved up to second in the championship behind the factory-backed Oreca team. Chamberlain Engineering returned to prototype racing in 2001 at the behest of MG for a two-year campaign of their new cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Although ultimately unsuccessful, the team later purchased a Dome-Judd chassis for use in the American Le Mans Series at the end of 2002. Chamberlain once again became sporting partners with another British entry, Gareth Evan's TVR Tuscans from the British GT Championship. The new Chamberlain-Synergy team campaigned the cars internationally in 2004 at select events including the American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Series, FIA GT Championship, and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Gareth Evans then made the transition to prototypes with a new Lola-AER chassis and won the LMP2 championship for the Le Mans Series. The partnership between Chamberlain and Evans continued through to 2008 when the team made their last start at Le Mans. Hugh Chamberlain would later continue to serve as a consultant and sporting director for British teams.

It was discovered on May 7, 1787 by William Herschel. The designation comes from the New General Catalogue of J. L. E. Dreyer, published in 1888. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 13.40 and spans an angle of . The galaxy shows a red shift of 0.00935 and has a heliocentric radial velocity of 2,803 km/s. It has an estimated mass of 72 billion times the mass of the Sun and stretches around across. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(r)a?, which indicates a weakly barred spiral galaxy (SAB) with a ring-like structure (r) and possible tightly-wound arms (a?). The Spitzer galactic survey lists a morphology code of (R1)SB(r′l,bl,nr,nb)0/a, meaning a barred spiral having a closer outer ring and an inner pseudo-ring/lens, plus a nuclear ring and bar/bar-lens. Vera Rubin described it has having a \\"distinct elliptical structure intermediate between a spheroid and a disk\\". Asymmetrical gas distribution in the galaxy suggests it has undergone a minor merger event that did not produce tidal tails. In addition to the main bar, there is what appears to be a counter- rotating nuclear bar in the inner , which is at an angle of 60° from the main bar. There is evidence of star formation, but that has nearly ceased in the nuclear region due to the molecular gas being all but exhausted. The nuclear bar, if it exists, now consists of stars with little surrounding gas. This is a Seyfert galaxy of type 1.9, indicating it has an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole at the center. The estimated mass of this object is and it is accreting mass at the rate of . Energy released by the AGN is visible in the form of ionized cones that extend outward from the nucleus to a distance of more than , and lie across the line of sight from the Earth. X-ray and radio jets have been detected. The nucleus is being fed by spiraling filaments and dust lanes from the surrounding galaxy. The AGN itself is hidden behind a bar of dust approximately 64 pc in length. The outflow from the core is encountering the galactic ring at a distance of and is significantly enhancing star formation in that region compared to other parts of the ring. The type Ia supernova SN 2009Y was reported in February 2009, before it reached maximum. It was magnitude 16.0 at discovery and located north and east of the center of NGC 5728.

It is situated east of Pemberton, and southwest of Duffy Lake. The highest peak in the Joffre Group, Mount Matier, rises to the west. The mountain's name was submitted by Reverend Damasus Payne, a Benedictine monk and mountaineer, to honor Archbishop William Mark Duke. It was officially adopted on April 21, 1966, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Caspar Creek and Twin One Creek. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Duke is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

The group operates the only arthouse cinema in Liberia. Since its founding in 2011, it has screened over 40 films including locally produced art films.  Background  After suffering from two civil wars where much historical and cultural knowledge were lost, Liberia struggled to develop a vibrant film culture. After 14 years of conflict, in 2003 the country began the slow process of rebuilding and recovering. Amid this process though, the Ebola virus epidemic violently erupted within the region and severely hit Liberia. The war-torn country totalled around 4,300 deaths due to the outbreak. During this time, members of the Liberian film community stopped movie screenings and went door-to-door to help raise awareness for the virus.  History  Inspired by the models of Kriterion Amsterdam and Kriterion Sarajevo, Kriterion Monrovia was started by Pandora Hodge while she was a student at University of Liberia in 2011. Together with other students, she went to different communities in Liberia using a projector to screen about 40 different movies for the general public. The group was awarded their first seed money from BSC-Spark with later support from Monrovia Breweries, the Accountability Lab, and the Liberian Ministry of Health, among others. In 2018, Kriterion Monrovia hosted the second Europe Liberian film festival.

Life After Gazi Gümüshtigin's death, the country was divided into two. Emir Gazi ruled Sivas and surrounding, while his brother Sungur took Malatya. Sungur, later joined Sultanate of Rum which was under control of Kilij Arslan I. Emir Gazi was the father-in-law of Mesud I, son of Kilij Arslan I. After Kilij's death, in 1107, he supported Mesud, which resulted with him taking the throne in 1116. After this Emir Gazi expanded his powers. He supported Mesud against Mesud's brother Melik Arab. In 1127, Melik Arab ambushed Emir Gazi's son Melik Mehmed Gazi and took him as prisoner. Later Melik Arab marched on Emir Gazi which was resulted in heavy losses. Later he took refugee to Byzantines. In 1130, he allied with Leo I, Prince of Armenia against the crusader Bohemond II of Antioch, who was killed in the subsequent battle; Bohemond's head was embalmed and sent to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. Emir Gazi may have been able to conquer more territory in the Principality of Antioch if not for the intervention of Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus, who wished to exert his own influence in Antioch. In 1131, he besieged the castle of Kaysun (today near the village of Çakırhüyük) in the County of Edessa, but retreated upon the arrival of Count Joscelin, whom Melikgazi believed had already died. As of 1134, Emir Gazi, Melik (the King) bestowed in recognition of their military successes by the Abbasid caliph Al- Mustarshid.Claude Cahen cited in Emir Gazi died at Pazarören, Sivas in 1134, and the Danishmend state began to collapse under pressure from the Byzantines and the Sultanate of Rum.

He was one of the leaders of Haskalah and the Misnagdim, and was greatly influenced by the Vilna Gaon. He was the Av Beit Din of Slonim and Königsberg and is thought to have been descended from Shimshon Loew ben Bezalel, the Maharal of Prague's brother through his grandson, Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli.  Early life and early adulthood (c. 1734-1765)  Not much is known about Shimshon's early life. We do know that he was born in Lithuania, sometime between 1734 and 1736. We also know that sometime at an early age he left for Hamburg to study German, Latin, and Greek, as well as the sciences. After returning from Hamburg around 17 or 18 years of age (1751-1753), and presumably being ordained as a rabbi, he took the job of rabbi in the towns of Kolyshki and Krāslava. He would make many more trips back to Hamburg later in his life, so he could buy books for his collection.  Marriage and life in Slonim (1765-1788)  In around 1765, Ichile Ginshpriker, son of Aryeh Leib Epstein, arranged for his first cousin, Basha bat Ze'ev Wolf and Shimshon to be married. They married on 26 October 1765. In 1769, Shimshon got a seat in Slonim as an Av Beit Din (Chief Rabbinical Judge). He kept this position until around 1791. Shimshon was part of the movement of Haskalah (the Jewish Age of Enlightenment). When he became Av Beit Din in Slonim, he began to spread Haskalah to the whole city. He is regarded as the first to do so in Slonim.  Shimshon's library  He had a library of around 250 to 300 books that he had collected on his journeys to Hamburg and other cities. People such as the Vilna Gaon and Solomon Maimon came to Slonim to borrow books from his library. Among Shimshon's prized possessions was the unpublished work by the rabbi, Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, Bosmat Bat Shelomoh.  Solomon Maimon's visit  In the 1770s, a young Solomon Maimon came from Nyasvizh to visit the library in search of books on science and medicine. According to Maimon, \\"As soon as I arrived at the place, I went to the chief rabbi, told him my desire, and begged him earnestly for assistance... He promised to lend me some old German books. The most important among these were an old work on Optics, and Sturm's Physics.\\" (likely Johann Christoph Sturm). These books inspired Maimon to find \\"a key to all secrets of nature\\" and look down upon others who did not know what he knew.Solomon Maimon  Meeting with Baruch Schick of Shklov  In 1778, upon the recommendation of the Vilna Gaon, Baruch Schick of Shklov (1744-1808) journeyed to Slonim to ask Shimshon to write an approbation to his Hebrew translation of Euclid's Elements, Sefer Oklidus. Shimshon agreed and wrote part of the introduction to the book. Several other rabbis such as Saul Loewenstamm and Solomon Shalem from The Hague and Amsterdam contributed to the introduction as well. Firstly, he talked about the proper place Euclid had in history. Shimshon assumed that he lived in Greece right around when Mordecai and Esther were living in Persia. Next, he gave a lengthy summary of the contents of the book using his great intelligence and vocabulary. To conclude his writing, Shimshon related it all back to Schick's wish to educate Jews on the sciences. His words followed the same theme that Schick wrote, “Blessed is your logic, and it will bear forth more blessing, for in your book you have refuted the claims our enemies level against us, saying ‘where is your wisdom and your learning in the eyes of the nations?’ Jacob will not be ashamed, for the land will be filled with knowledge, as the waters cover the sea.” Shimshon referred to the Jews being thought of as uneducated and ignorant. Shimshon's intentions were to bring science and mathematics into Jewish people's everyday lives, so they could be recognized as more intelligent. Approbation by Shimshon ben Mordechai of Slonim in Sefer Oklidus (Euclid's Elements Hebrew Translation).  Jeremy Bentham's visit  In 1787, the English philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was going to visit his brother, Samuel in Krichev, when he spent the night in Slonim. As he writes in his journal, all of the inns were full, so he was forced to spend the night with a rabbi who also kept a hardware store. He goes on to describe the rabbi's home and that he had two bookcases with \\"not fewer than 250 or 300 Vols.\\". Bentham also talked about how the rabbi possessed a copy of Euclid's Elements as well as a manuscript on astronomy which contained a diagram, that was the rabbi's own work. By piecing together clues, we have been able to figure out that this was the same rabbi who lent Solomon Maimon some books.  The fire, leaving for Königsberg, and death (1788-1794)  Sometime in the late 1780s, after Bentham's visit, a fire started in the thatch roof of Shimshon's house. It eventually consumed everything in his house including all of his books and his own manuscripts. He became stricken with grief. It is said that after the fire, \\"Shimshon eulogized his loss in the synagogue and cried bitter tears.\\" In 1791, after the fire, he left town for a spot as an Av Beit Din in the town of Königsberg. By that point, Shimshon was sick and very tired. He only served there for a couple years until his passing in 1794.  Descendants  Shimshon's descendants mostly settled in Kosava. They adopted the surname, Karelitz after the town of Karelichy. Some of his most famous rabbinical descendants were the Rabbis Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (author of the Chazon Ish), Nissim Karelitz, and Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky. Other descendants include the mathematician Leonard Carlitz, Louis Karelitz, one of the first Jewish settlers in Peabody, Dr. Samuel Karelitz, pediatrician and founding chairman of Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJ), Clarence Karelitz, a Massachusetts State Representative, and Jacob Reingold, the vice chairman of the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale who laid groundwork for the observance of National Grandparents Day in the United States.

This unfortunately limits our ability to hear the voice of Shimshon as a scholar. In his family's tradition he was known as \\"a scholar and Kabbalist, an astronomer and philosopher, accomplished in all seven sciences, the author of many books, on the exoteric and the esoteric, and the chokhmot.\\" Shimshon was also remembered for bringing Haskalah to Slonim as well as being a very ardent Mitnagdim. He also encouraged bringing education into every Jew's everyday lives. He is regarded as being one of the most influential rabbis of Slonim, alongside Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima.

The meaning of autograph as a document penned entirely by the author of its content, as opposed to a typeset document or one written by a copyist or scribe other than the author, overlaps with that of holograph. Autograph manuscripts are studied by scholars, and can become collectable objects. Holographic documents have, in some jurisdictions, a specific legal standing. Terminology According to The Oxford English Minidictionary, an autograph is, apart from its meaning as signature, a \\"manuscript in the author's handwriting,\\" while a holograph is a \\"(document) written wholly in the handwriting of the person in whose name it appears.\\"Hawkins, Joyce M. (ed.), 1994. The Oxford English Minidictionary, Revised Third Edition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, pp. 29 and 243.

According to Thompson's article on autographs, when the entire document is written by the hand of the person from whom it emanates, it can technically also be called a holograph.

This distinguishes it from the more commonly used word, Autograph, for the latter, strictly, means merely that the document is written by someone who can be named. The author of the Grove article clarifies with an example, stating that Johann Sebastian Bach's autographs include as well the manuscripts he wrote of his own compositions as the copies he made of compositions by other composers, and that the same can be said about his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, whose autographs include his holographs, and, for instance, the manuscript copies he made of compositions by his father.

According to , writing in The Routledge Research Companion to Johann Sebastian Bach, \\"autograph\\" and \\"holograph\\" can be considered synonyms (i.e., a manuscript for which the writer is the author of the work), the former term being generally preferred in studies of manuscripts. Further, he writes that Bach's copies of compositions by other composers \\"should never be referred to as Bach's autographs, even if they are entirely in Bach's handwriting.\\" He distinguishes two types of partial autographs: the first being written by a set of scribes, among whom the composer, the second being a copy made by a scribe other than the composer, to which the composer, in a later stage, applied editorial corrections and/or other modifications. According to this author, manuscripts of straightforward transcriptions should be referred to as \\"copy\\" or \\"transcription manuscript\\", while more convoluted arrangements should rather be referred to as \\"autograph\\" than \\"copy\\". In Bach-scholarship \\"original manuscript\\" refers to a score or performance parts written (by himself or his scribes) for the composer's own use. In what follows the terms \\"autograph\\" and \\"holograph\\" are used as quoted in the sources indicated by the footnoted references. When these sources only use a description, such as \\"in the author's handwriting\\" or \\"written in the hand of the author\\", then, following Webster's, \\"autograph\\" is used for a \\"manuscript (as of an author's or composer's work)\\" and \\"holograph\\" for a \\"document (as a letter, deed, or will)\\", and either of these terms only when the explicitly named scribe of the manuscript or document is also the creator of its content. For instance: * If the RISM page used as reference for the (D-B) Mus.ms.

Musical autographs exist in various stages of completion: * Sketch, indicating musical ideas written down in the early stages of a composition process, often not more than a few bars of music (e.g. Schubert's and survived as autograph sketches). * Draft, which can contain corrections, and is not necessarily a complete composition (e.g. the autograph of Schubert's is an incomplete draft of a four-movement piano sonata). * Composing score (e.g. autograph composing scores survive for several of Bach's cantatas). * Fair copy, written out clear enough to be used for performance or publication of the music. Fair copies are not necessarily written by the composer, but if the composer has some control over the process of copying, and possibly adds some corrections or completions in his own hand, the fair copy may still be considered an original source (e.g. Bach's partial autograph of the BWV 210 cantata is a fair copy which is considered an original source).Bach Digital Work , Bach Digital Source 2401 For pieces with multiple performers, apart from the score itself, also performance parts (i.e. sheet music for individual performers), may exist as autographs, as partial autographs or as copies by others, and would usually be fair copies although earlier stages of such parts may exist (e.g. D-Dl Mus. 2405-D-21 is a set of partial autograph performance parts of Bach's 1733 Mass for the Dresden court).Bach Digital Source 2721; . Intermediate stages are possible, for instance Wagner's method of composition entailed several sketch and draft stages, and a first stage of the complete score () before the fair copy. Other composers used fewer steps: for his cantatas, Bach apparently often started directly with the composing score (with some sketches and drafts written in that score while composing), without, in the end, always transferring such score to a fair copy. Sometimes, however, he started with the transcription of an earlier work, which developed in a revision score, before being transferred to a fair copy. Or otherwise, a revision manuscript could be turned into performance material for a rewritten work: D-B Mus.ms. Bach St 112 VI, Fascicle 1, a partially autograph bundle of performance parts for the last cantata of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, contains four parts which are revision versions originally written for an otherwise undocumented cantata (BWV 248 VI a).D-B Mus.ms. Bach St 112 VI, Fascicle 1 at Bach Digital website Sometimes a composer's autograph starts as a fair copy, continuing as a draft. For example, the Fantasia in the late 1730s autograph of Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 906, is a fair copy, but halfway through the (likely incomplete) Fugue the manuscript gradually shifts to a draft with several corrections. Scholarship Scholarly studies of autographs can help in establishing authenticity or date of origin of a composition. Autographs, and fair copies produced with the assistance of scribes, can also be studied to detect a composer's true intentions. For instance, John Tyrrell argued that Janáček's autograph score of his last opera was less authoritative as the final state of that opera than the fair copy by the composer's scribes, produced under his direction and with his corrections. As collectable object Bach's autograph compositions are rarely available for private collectors: the bulk of his hundreds of extant autographs resides at the Berlin State Library, while only a fourth of 40 complete autograph manuscripts outside that collection are privately owned. One of such exceptional autographs, that came up for auction in 2016, fetched over £2.5m. Ludwig van Beethoven's autographs have, since a few months after the composer's death in 1727, been sold for considerable prices at auctions. Beethoven's autograph of the piano duet version of his Große Fuge sold for £1.1m at Sotheby's in 2005. In November 2016 the autograph score of a Mahler symphony sold for £4,546,250: no autograph symphony had ever sold for a higher price. Holographic documents A holograph is a document written entirely in the handwriting of the person whose signature it bears. Some countries (e.g., France) or local jurisdictions within certain countries (e.g., some U.S. states) give legal standing to specific types of holographic documents, generally waiving requirements that they be witnessed. One of the most important types of such documents are holographic last wills.

The advent of large-scale genomic sequencing has shown that hybridization is common, and that it may represent an important source of novel variation. Although most interspecific hybrids are sterile or less fit than their parents, some may survive and reproduce, enabling the transfer of adaptive variants across the species boundary, and even result in the formation of novel evolutionary lineages. There are two main variants of hybrid species genomes: allopolyploid, which have one full chromosome set from each parent species, and homoploid, which are a mosaic of the parent species genomes with no increase in chromosome number. The establishment of hybrid species requires the development of reproductive isolation against parental species. Allopolyploid species often have strong intrinsic reproductive barriers due to differences in chromosome number, and homoploid hybrids can become reproductively isolated from the parent species through assortment of genetic incompatibilities. However, both types of hybrids can become further reproductively isolated, gaining extrinsic isolation barriers, by exploiting novel ecological niches, relative to their parents. Hybrids represent the merging of divergent genomes and thus face problems arising from incompatible combinations of genes. Thus hybrid genomes are highly dynamic and may undergo rapid evolutionary change, including genome stabilization in which selection against incompatible combinations results in fixation of compatible ancestry block combinations within the hybrid species. The potential for rapid adaptation or speciation makes hybrid genomes a particularly exciting subject of in evolutionary biology. The article summarizes how introgressed alleles or hybrid species can establish and how the resulting hybrid genomes evolve.  Background  Genetic exchange between species can impede the evolution of biodiversity because gene flow between diverging species counteracts their differentiation and hybridization between recently diverged species can lead to loss of genetic adaptations or species fusion. Traditionally, zoologists have viewed interspecific hybridization as maladaptive behaviour which can result in breaking up co-adapted gene complexes. In contrast, plant biologists recognized early on that hybridization can sometimes be an important evolutionary force, contributing to increasing biodiversity. Recently, evidence has been accumulating showing that hybridization is also an important evolutionary process in animals. Interspecific hybridization can enrich the genetic diversity of introgressed taxon, lead to introgression of beneficial genetic variation or even generate new hybrid species. Hybridization is now also known to contribute to the evolutionary potential in several textbook examples of adaptive radiation, including the Geospiza Galapagos finches, African cichlid fishes, Heliconius butterflies and Hawaiian Madiinae tarweeds and silverswords. This article reviews the evolutionary outcomes of interspecific hybridization and the properties of genomes of hybrid genomes. Many of the discussed topics also apply to hybridization between different subspecies or populations of the same species, but this article focuses on interspecific hybridization (referred to as hybridization in this review).  Evolutionary outcomes  Potential evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. While most hybridization events are evolutionary dead ends, hybridization may also lead to speciation reversal where two taxa merge into one or form a hybrid zone between parapatric taxa. Alternatively, only one species may disappear through genetic swamping if introgression is highly asymmetrical. When one or few heterospecific alleles are advantageous these can also introgress into one of the parent species’ genomes through repeated backcrossing. Hybrids may also form novel lineages that are reproductively isolated from both parent taxa. The coloured fractions of the bars in the bar plots below show the relative proportion of the genome belonging to the blue and green parental lineages respectively. The grey bars represent a speciation reversal where differences are selected against. Finally, if hybridization leads to unfit offspring, it may reduce the fitness of the involved parental taxa due to wasted reproductive effort and may increase extinction risks for these. There are several potential evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. If early generation hybrids are not viable or sterile, hybridization may reduce the reproductive success of the parent species. This could potentially lead to reinforcement, selection to strengthen premating isolation or if the species fail to evolve premating isolation, it could increase their extinction risk due to wasted reproductive effort. If the fitness of early generation hybrids is non-zero and that of some later generation hybrids is as high or even higher than the fitness of one or both parent taxa, hybrids may displace the parent taxa and the hybridizing taxa may fuse (speciation reversal). If the fitness of early generation hybrids is reduced but non-zero, hybrid zones may emerge in the contact zone of the taxa. If hybrids are fertile, hybridization may contribute novel variation through rare hybrids backcrosssing with parental species. Such introgressive hybridization may enable neutral or selectively beneficial alleles to be transferred across species boundaries even in species pairs that remain distinct despite occasional gene flow. Hybrid fitness may vary with divergence time between the hybridizing taxa. This pattern has been shown for a variety of taxa including Drosophila, birds and fish. Hybrid fitness may also differ with cross direction, between first generation and later generation hybrids, and among individuals within generations of the same cross-type. In some cases hybrids may evolve into new hybrid species with reproductive isolation to both parent taxa. Below is described the evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation that result in persistent hybrid genomes.  Adaptive introgression  When rare hybrids backcross with parent species alleles coding for traits that are beneficial for both parental species can be transferred across species boundaries, even if parent species remain distinct taxa. This process is referred to as adaptive introgression (a somewhat misleading term because backcrossing itself may not be adaptive, but some of the introgressed variants may be beneficial). Simulations suggest that adaptive introgression is possible unless hybrid fitness is substantially reduced, or the adaptive loci are tightly linked to deleterious ones. Examples of adaptive traits that have been transferred via introgression include an insecticide resistance gene that was transferred from Anopheles gambiae to A. coluzzii and the red warning wing colouration trait in Heliconius butterflies that is under natural selection from predators which has been introgressed from e.g. H. melpomene to H. timareta and other Heliconius species. In the plant Arabidopsis arenosa some of the alleles conferring adaptation to drought and phytotoxic levels of metal have been introgressed from A. lyrata. Even in humans there is evidence for adaptive introgression of e.g. immunity alleles, skin pigmentation alleles and alleles conferring adaptation to high altitude environments from Neanderthal and Denisovans. If traits important for species recognition or reproductive isolation introgress into a population of another species, the introgressed population may become reproductively isolated against other populations of the same species. Examples of this include Heliconius butterflies, where selective introgression of wing pattern genes between diverged lineages occurs, and wing patterns contribute to reproductive isolation in some species pairs with low (e.g. between H. t. florencia and H. t. linaresi) and intermediate levels (e.g. H. c. galanthus/H. pachinus) of divergence. Detection and study with genomic tools Many empirical case studies start with exploratory detection of putative hybrid taxa or individuals with genomic clustering approaches, such as those used in the software STRUCTURE, ADMIXTURE or fineSTRUCTURE. These methods infer a user- specified number of genetic groups from the data and assign each individual to one or a mix of these groups. They can be applied to closely related taxa without having to preassign individuals to taxa and may thus be particularly useful in the study of closely related taxa or species complexes. However, uneven sampling of the parental taxa or different amounts of drift in the included taxa may lead to erroneous conclusions about evidence for hybridization. If genomic data of multiple species is available, phylogenetic methods may be better suited to identify introgression. Introgressive hybridization leads to gene trees that are discordant from the species tree, whereby introgressed individuals are phylogenetically closer to the source of introgression than to their non-introgressed conspecifics. Such discordant gene trees can also arise by chance through incomplete lineage sorting, particularly if the species compared are still young. Therefore, discordant gene trees are only evidence of introgression if a gene tree produced by excess allele sharing between the hybridizing taxa is strongly overrepresented compared to alternative discordant gene trees. An entire suite of methods have been developed to detect such excess allele sharing between hybridizing taxa, including Patterson’s D statistics or ABBA-BABA tests or f-statistics. Modified versions of these tests can be used to infer introgressed genomic regions, the direction of gene flow or the amount of gene flow. For datasets with a large number of taxa it may be difficult to compute all possible test of hybridization. In such cases, graph construction methods may be better suited. These methods reconstruct complex phylogenetic models with hybridization that best fit the genetic relationships among the sampled taxa and provide estimates for drift and introgression. Other phylogenetic network methods that account for incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization may also help. Methods based on linkage disequilibrium decay or methods inferring ancestry tracts can be used to date recent admixture or introgression events as over time ancestry tracts are continuously broken down by recombination. With increasing genome stabilization, individuals should vary less in local ancestry. Levels of genome stabilization can thus be assessed by computing the ancestry proportions (e.g. with fd) in genomic windows and testing if these correlate across individuals. Additionally, if hybridization is still ongoing, ancestry proportions should vary across individuals and in space. A different approach is to use demographic modelling to find the simplification of the evolutionary history of the studied taxa. Demographic modelling should only be applied to small sets of taxa because with increasing number of taxa model complexity increases and the number of model parameters such as timing, amounts and direction of gene flow, and population sizes and split times can quickly become too high. The fit of the demographic models to the data can be assessed with the site frequency spectrum or with summary statistics in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. It is also possible to gain more power by combining information from linkage disequilibrium decay patterns and the allele frequency spectrum.  Hybrid species definition  One of the potential evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation is the establishment of a novel, reproductively isolated lineage, i.e., hybrid speciation. A hybrid species has an admixed genome and forms stable genetically distinct populations. Some researchers argue that evidence of a hybridization-derived basis for reproductive isolation should be an additional defining criterion for hybrid speciation, but see. This stricter definition includes polyploid hybrid taxa but only encompasses a handful of well studied cases of homoploid hybrid speciation, e.g. Heliconius heurippa, Passer italiae, and three Helianthus sunflower species because for most suggested examples of homoploid hybrid speciation, the genetic basis of reproductive isolation is still unknown. Hybrid species can occupy an ecological niche different to those of the parents and may be isolated from the parent species primarily through pre- mating barriers (hybrid speciation with external barriers). Hybrid species may also be reproductively isolated from the parent species through sorting of incompatibilities leading to new combinations of parental alleles that are incompatible with both parent species but compatible within the hybrid taxon (recombinational hybrid speciation). A recombinational hybrid taxon typically also has a substantial proportion of the genome derived from the donor of introgressed material, although variation exists both between taxa and within lineages of hybrid taxa.  Homoploid and polyploid hybrid speciation  Schematic representation of homoploid and allopolyploid hybrid speciation. An example of a homoploid hybrid genome is a schematic of the mosaic genome of the Italian sparrow which is a hybrid resulting from the anthropogenic house sparrow P. domesticus which spread across the Mediterranean with agriculture and encountered and hybridized with local populations of Spanish sparrow P. hispaniolensis [48,49,85]. An allopolyploid example is the monkeyflower Mimulus peregrinus, an allohexaploid species that has evolved independently at least twice and which involves an intermediate, sexually-sterile but clonally vigorous F1 hybrid [115]. Sterile F1 hybrids have given rise to allopolyploids in other taxa (e.g. Spartina and Senecio), but allopolyploids can also form via fertile intermediate hybrids (e.g. Tragopogon). In general, hybrid species can arise from two major types of hybrid speciation, defined by whether the speciation event is associated with genome duplication (polyploidy) or not. Homoploid hybrid speciation Homoploid hybrid speciation is defined as the evolution of a new hybrid species with reproductive isolation to both parent taxa without change of ploidy, i.e. number of chromosome sets. The genomes of homoploid hybrid species are mosaics of the parent genomes as ancestry tracts from the parent species are broken up by recombination. In the case of polyploid hybrid speciation, hybridisation is associated with genome duplication, resulting in an allopolyploid with increased ploidy compared to their parental taxa. In contrast to allopolyploids, autopolyploids are characterised by genome duplication within the same species and are thus not discussed further in the context of this review. Allopolyploid speciation is more common in plants than in animals. Polyploid hybrids can be instantly isolated from their parental species through chromosome number differences.  Reproductive isolation against parent species  Sufficient reproductive isolation from both parental species is required for the successful establishment of a hybrid species. Reproductive isolation against parent species is harder to achieve for homoploid hybrids where karyotype differences do not contribute to intrinsic isolation. Reproductive isolation between a hybrid species and its parental species can arise from a variety of reproductive barriers either before or after fertilization (prezygotic or postzygotic, respectively), which may themselves be dependent or independent of environmental conditions (extrinsic or intrinsic barriers, respectively). For example, intrinsic postzygotic barriers cause hybrid inviability or sterility regardless of the environment in which they occur, while extrinsic postzygotic barriers result in hybrids of low fitness due to maladaptation to specific environments. Prezygotic intrinsic and extrinsic differences have also been shown to be important in isolating hybrids from their parent species. In plants, pollinator mediated isolation resulting from changes in floral characteristics may be an important extrinsic prezygotic ecological barrier. Strong extrinsic pre-zygotic has been shown to isolate the hybrid species Senecio eboracensis from its parent species, where hybrids are virtually absent in the wild, although a fraction of hybrid offspring are fertile in lab experiments. Lowe & Abbott conclude that selfing, timing of flowering and characters involved in pollinator attraction likely contribute to this external isolation. Prezygotic mate preference driven isolation generated from intrinsic assortative mating between hybrids has also been reported in several taxa. In African cichlid fish, experimental hybrids displayed combinations of parental traits and preferences which resulted in hybrids predominantly mating with other hybrids. A similar pattern was found in Geospiza Galapagos finches where a specific hybrid song resulted from the transgressive beak morphology, and hybrid Heliconius butterflies preferred the hybrid wing patterning over that of both parent species. Intrinsic differences in habitat use or in phenology may result in some degree of reproductive isolation against parent species if mating is time and habitat-specific. For example the apple host race in Rhagoletis pomonella maggot flies evolved after introgression of diapause related genes from Mexican altiplano flies that allowed a switch from the ancestral host hawthorne to the later flowering apple and isolated the two host races via allochronic intrinsic pre-zygotic isolation. In Xiphophorus swordtail fish strong ancestry assortative mating maintained a hybrid genetic cluster separate for 25 generations, but disappeared under manipulated conditions. Hence, prezygotic reproductive barriers to gene flow may be environment dependent. Postzygotic isolating barriers have also been shown to be important in a variety of hybrid lineages. Work on Helianthus sunflowers has revealed that intrinsic postzygotic can cause reproductive isolation against the parent species. The postzygotic barriers consist in pre-existing structural differences, in combination with hybridization induced structural differences. Sorting of incompatibilities between parent species, where one subset of these isolates the hybrid taxon against one parent and a different subset isolates it against the other parent, has resulted in intrinsic postzygotic isolation between the Italian sparrow Passer italiae and its parent species. Simulation studies show that the likelihood of hybrid speciation through this mechanism depends on the divergence time between parent species, the population size of the hybrid species, the nature of selection acting on hybrids, and linkage among incompatibilities to each other and to adaptive variants. Extrinsic ecological barriers against parent species may arise as by-products of ecological differentiation if mating is time and/or habitat specific. Hybrid species have been shown to adapt to novel ecological niches through transgressive phenotypes, or through novel combinations of ecological traits from the parent species, and ecological selection against parent-hybrid cross phenotypes would result in extrinsic postzygotic isolation.  Stabilization  The process of genome stabilization during hybrid speciation and introgression. Both ecological selection pressures and selection to avoid intrinsic incompatibilities mould hybrid genomes. Depending on the balance between beneficial alleles and incompatibilities hybridisation can result either in an admixed taxon that is reproductively isolated from both parent taxa, or local introgression into a taxon that remains distinct in spite of occasional gene flow. RI abbreviates reproductive isolation. Fd is estimated between a hybrid population and the red parent species, and the haplotypes illustrate example individuals in these populations. Hybridization can have many different outcomes. Hybrid speciation results in reproductive isolation against both parent species and genomes that evolve independently from those of the parent species. Introgressive hybridization can transfer important novel variants into genomes of a species that remains distinct from the other taxa in spite of occasional gene flow. In this article both types of hybridization-derived genomes are referred to as persistent hybrid genomes. Following initial hybridization, introgression tracts, the genetic blocks inherited from each parent species, are broken down with successive generations and recombination events. Recombination is more frequent in homoploid hybrid genomes than in allopolyploid hybrid genomes. In allopolyploids, recombination can destabilize the karyotype and lead to aberrant meiotic behaviour and reduced fertility, but may also generate novel gene combinations and advantageous phenotypic traits as in homoploid hybrids. Once hybridization between the hybrid taxon and its parent taxa ceases, different ancestry blocks or introgression tracts may become fixed, a process referred to as \\"genome stabilization\\". Some introgression tracts are removed by selection against incompatibilities and others are fixed. Theoretical models on hybrid zones suggest that the breakdown of ancestry blocks through recombination is suppressed near genes conferring reproductive isolation due to lower fitness of recombinant hybrids. The strength of the suppression is affected by the form of selection, dominance, and whether the locus was situated on an autosome or sex chromosome. The time to genome stabilization is variable. Fixation of ancestry blocks was found to be rapid in experimental hybrid Helianthus sunflower species genomes, and the genome stabilization of hybrid sunflower species is estimated to take hundreds of generations. In Zymoseptoria fungi genomes were stabilized within ca. 400 generations, whereas in hybrid Xiphophorus swordtail genomes genome stabilization was not achieved until after ca. 2000 and 2500 generations. Few Neanderthal regions have fixed in human genomes during the ca. 2000 generations after hybridization, and segregating incompatibilities are present in the hybrid Italian sparrow approximately 5000 generations after the initial hybridization event. Given time, genetic drift will eventually stochastically fix blocks derived from the two parent species in finite isolated hybrid populations. Selection against incompatibility loci may accelerate the process of fixation of parental alleles as hybrids that possess alleles that are less likely to cause incompatibility will have higher fitness and favourable alleles will spread in the population. Fixation of recessive weakly deleterious alleles in the parent taxa may, however, also result in hybrids retaining both parental alleles: because hybrids with haplotypes from both parents are not homozygous for any weakly deleterious alleles, they have higher fitness than hybrids with only one parental haplotype. This associative overdominance, may slow down the process of fixation of parental alleles through favouring retention of both parental haplotypes. The effect of associative overdominance is strongest in low recombination regions, including inversions. The balance between alleles and allelic combinations providing favourable phenotypic characters and the strength of selection against incompatibilities determine what introgression tracts will be inherited from which parent species upon hybridization. An insecticide resistance region was retained following a hybridization event in Anopheles coluzzi, suggesting a role for selection in maintaining favourable introgressed regions. The local recombination rate is important for the likelihood of introgression because in the case of widespread incompatibilities, introgressed alleles are more likely to recombine away from incompatibilities in high recombination regions. This pattern has been detected in monkeyflowers Mimulus, in Mus domesticus house mice, in Heliconius butterflies and in Xiphophorus swordtail fish. Genome-wide incompatibilities have been identified in Xipophorous fish, chimeric genes and mutations of orthologous genes cause incompatibilities in early generation experimental Cyprinidae goldfish - carp hybrids and mito-nuclear incompatibilies are found to have a key role e.g. in Italian sparrows, fungus and cyto-nuclear incompatibilities in Mimulus plants. Evidence from altered expression patterns in synthetic hybrids and missing gene combinations in a hybrid species also suggest that DNA-repair and genes involved in mutagenesis and cancer related pathways may cause incompatibilities in hybrids. Genome formation in hybrid species is shaped by selection against incompatible combinations.  Altered genome properties  The hybrid origin may affect genome structure and properties. It has been shown to increase mutation rates, to activate transposable elements, and to induce chromosomal rearrangements. Increased transposon activation, as proposed in McClintock's ‘genomic shock’ theory, could result in alterations to gene expression. Transposable elements may, in addition to altering gene products if inserted into a gene, also alter promoter activity for genes if inserted upstream of the coding regions, or may induce gene silencing as a result of gene disruption. For allopolyploid genomes chromosomal rearrangements may result from the ”genomic shock” induced by hybridisation, with more distantly related species being more prone to genome reorganisations e.g. in Nicotiana. Chromosomal rearrangements resulting from either genomic shock or recombination events between non-homologous subgenomes may cause genome sizes to either increase or decrease. Both increases and decreases were found in the Nicotiana genus, and were not related to the age since hybridization. Following genome duplication in allopolyploids, the genome goes through diploidization, which is a process in which the genome is rearranged to act as a meiotic diploid. After such diploidization, much of the genome is lost due to genome fractionation, the loss-of-function of one or the other of the newly duplicated genes. In a meta analysis, Sankoff and collaborators found evidence consistent with reduction- resistant pairs and a concentration of functional genes on a single chromosome and suggest that the reduction process partly is constrained. A related allopolyploid specific phenomenon is subgenome dominance. For example, in the octoploid Fragaria strawberry, one of the four subgenomes is dominant and has significantly greater gene content, more frequently has its genes expressed, and exchanges between homologous chromosomes are biased in favour of this subgenome, as compared with the other subgenomes. This study also showed that certain traits, e.g. disease-resistance, are controlled by the dominant subgenome to a high extent. A proposed mechanism of how subgenome dominance arises, suggests that relative dominance is related to the density of transposable elements in each subgenome. Subgenomes with higher transposable element density tend to behave submissively relative to the other subgenomes when brought together in the allopolyploid genome. Interestingly, subgenome dominance can arise immediately in allopolyploids, as shown in synthetic and recently evolved monkeyflowers. In addition to these changes to genome structure and properties, studies of allopolyploid rice and whitefish suggest that patterns of gene expression may be disrupted in hybrid species. Studies of synthetic and natural allopolyploids of Tragopogon miscellus show that gene expression is less strictly regulated directly after hybridization, and that novel patterns of expression emerge and are stabilized during 40 generations. While expression variation in miRNAs alters gene expression and affects growth in the natural allopolyploid Arabidopsis suecica and experimental lineages, inheritance of siRNAs is stable and maintains chromatin and genome stability, potentially buffering against a transcriptomic shock.  Factors influencing formation and persistence  Whereas hybridization is required for the generation of persistent hybrid genomes, it is not sufficient. For the persistence of hybrid genomes in hybrid species they need to be sufficiently reproductively isolated from their parent species to avoid species fusion. Selection on introgressed variants allows the persistence of hybrid genomes in introgressed lineages. Frequency of hybridization, viability of hybrids, and the ease at which reproductive isolation against the parent species arises or strength of selection to maintain introgressed regions are hence factors influencing the rate of formation of stable hybrid lineages. Few general conclusions about the relative prevalence of hybridization can be drawn, as sampling is not evenly distributed, even if there is evidence for hybridization in an increasing number of taxa. One pattern that emerges is that hybridization is more frequent in plants where it occurs in 25% of the species, whereas it only occurs in 10% of animal species. Most plants, as well as many groups of animals, lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes. The absence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes results in slower accumulation of reproductive isolation, and may hence enable hybridization between phylogenetically more distant taxa. Haldane's rule states that ”when F1 offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterozygous sex”. Empirical evidence supports a role for heteromorphic sex chromosomes in hybrid sterility and inviability. A closely related observation is the large X effect stating that there is a disproportionate contribution of the X/Z-chromosome in fitness reduction of heterogametic hybrids. These patterns likely arise as recessive alleles with deleterious effects in hybrids have a stronger impacts on the heterogametic than the homogametic sex, due to hemizygous expression. In taxa with well-differentiated sex chromosomes, Haldane’s rule has shown to be close to universal, and heteromorphic sex chromosomes show reduced introgression on the X in XY. In line with a role for heteromorphic sex chromosomes in constraining hybrid genome formation, elevated differentiation on sex chromosomes has been observed in both ZW and XY systems. This pattern may reflect the lower effective population sizes and higher susceptibility to drift on the sex chromosomes, the elevated frequency of loci involved in reproductive isolation and/or the heightened conflict on sex chromosomes. Findings of selection for uniparental inheritance of e.g. mitonuclear loci residing on the Z chromosome in hybrid Italian sparrows is consistent with compatible sex chromosomes being important for the formation of a viable hybrid genomes. There are also several ecological factors that affect the probability of hybridization. Generally, hybridization is more frequently observed in species with external fertilization including plants but also fishes, than in internally fertilized clades. In plants, high rates of selfing in some species may prevent hybridization, and breeding system may also affect the frequency of heterospecific pollen transfer. In fungi, hybrids can be generated by ameiotic fusion of cells or hyphae in addition to mechanisms available to plants and animals. Such fusion of vegetative cells and subsequent parasexual mating with mitotic crossover may generate recombined hybrid cells. For hybrid species to evolve, reproductive isolation against the parent species is required. The ease by which such reproductive isolation arises is thus also important for the rate at which stable hybrid species arise. Polyploidisation and asexuality are both mechanisms that result in instantaneous isolation and may increase the rate of hybrid lineage formation. The ability to self-pollinate may also act in favour of stabilising allopolyploid taxa by providing a compatible mate (itself) in the early stages of allopolyploid speciation when rare cytotypes are at a reproductive disadvantage due to inter-cytotype mating. Selfing is also expected to increase the likelihood of establishment for homoploid hybrids according to a modelling study, and the higher probability of selfing may contribute to the higher frequency of hybrid species in plants. Fungal hybridization may result in asexual hybrid species, as Epichloe fungi where hybrids species are asexual while nonhybrids include both asexual and sexual species. Hybridization between strongly divergent animal taxa may also generate asexual hybrid species, as shown e.g. in the European spined loaches, Cobitis, and most if not all asexual vertebrate species are of hybrid origin. Interestingly, Arctic floras harbour an unusually high proportion of allopolyploid plants, suggesting that these hybrid taxa could have an advantage in extreme environments, potentially through reducing the negative effects of inbreeding. Hence both genomic architecture and ecological properties may affect the probability of hybrid species formation. For introgressed taxa, the strength of selection on introgressed variants decides whether introgressed sections will spread in the population and stable introgressed genomes will be formed. Strong selection for insecticide resistance has been shown to increase introgression of an Anopheles gambiae resistance allele into A. coluzzi malaria mosquitoes. In Heliconius butterflies, strong selection on having the locally abundant wing colour patterns repeatedly led to fixation of alleles that introgressed from locally adapted butterflies into newly colonizing species or subspecies. Chances of fixation of beneficial introgressed variants depend on the type and strength of selection on the introgressed variant and linkage with other introgressed variants that are selected against.  Factors influencing affected genes and genomic regions  Genetic exchange can occur between populations or incipient species diverging in geographical proximity or between divergent taxa that come into secondary contact. Hybridization between more diverged lineages is expected to have a greater potential to contribute beneficial alleles or generate novelty than hybridization between less diverged populations because more divergent alleles are combined, and are thus more likely to have a large fitness effect, to generate transgressive phenotypes. Hybridization between more diverged lineages is also more likely to generate incompatible allele combinations, reducing initial hybrid fitness but potentially also contributing to hybrid speciation if they are sorted reciprocally as described above. An intermediate genetic distance may thus be most conducive to hybrid speciation. Experimental lab crosses support this hypothesis. The proportion of the genome that is inherited from the recipient of introgressed material varies strongly among and within species. After the initial hybridization event the representation is 50% in many polyploid taxa, although parental gene copies are successively lost and might bias the contribution to one majority parent genome. Relatively equal parental contributions are also found in some homoploid hybrid species but in other cases they are highly unequal such as in some Heliconius species. The majority ancestry may even be that from the donor of introgressed material, as was shown for Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. Interestingly there may also be variation in parental contribution within a hybrid species. In both swordtail fish and Italian sparrows there are populations which differ strongly in what proportions of the parent genomes they have inherited. Patterns of introgression can vary strongly across the genome, even over short chromosomal distances. Examples of adaptive introgression of well defined regions, include an inversed region containing genes involved in insecticide resistance and introgression of a divergent, inverted chromosomal segment has resulted in a ”super gene” that encodes mimicry polymorphism in the butterfly Heliconius numata. These findings are consistent with models suggesting that genomic rearrangements are important for the coupling of locally adaptive loci. Genes and genomic regions that are adaptive may be readily introgressed between species e.g. in hybrid zones if they are not linked to incompatibility loci. This often referred to semi-permeable species boundaries, and examples include e.g. genes involved in olfaction that are introgressed across a Mus musculus and M. domesticus hybrid zone. In hybrid zones with mainly permeable species boundaries, patterns of introgressed regions enable deducing what genomic regions involved in incompatibilities and reproductive isolation.

It is a prime tourist attraction. Annadale is an army area with an Army Heritage Museum. It has a helipad. Etymology The region in which Annandale is located was first documented in 1834, in the East Indian United Service Journal. When British officers saw the area for the first time, they found it similar to the Annandale valley in Dumfriesshire or County of Dumfries in Scotland, and decided to name it after the Scottish location because most of the officers hailed from the original Annandale. According to another story, Charles Pratt Kennedy, the political agent of the British government who was assigned to find a suitable place in India for selecting the Summer Capital, came to Shimla hills in 1822. He was so impressed by the beauty of the dale that he named it after \\"Anna\\" his lady love back in England. It is perhaps for this reason, that it has been spelt as both 'Annandale' and 'Annadale' in documents pertaining to Shimla. History British Raj Annadale was first used by East India Company and then the British Raj, which is why natives originally called it \\"Company Ka Baag\\". It was a place of enjoyment and entertainment for the British, offering fancy dress shows, picnics, and birthday celebrations. Every year a National Championship of Polo was organised there. Cultural and social festivals were organised there including Gymkhana, fete champetre and sports such as polo and cricket. Under the British Army, the grounds were also used for training and parades. A funfair was organised in September 1833 to raise funds for setting up a school at Sabathu for native girls. In 1839, the first Fancy fair was organised there. The Durand Football Tournament was started in 1888 in Annadale by Mortimer Durand. It was interrupted during World War 1 and World War 2. The venue was shifted to Delhi in 1940. British officers appreciated the nature and scenic charm of the site and protected it from disturbance by grotesque structures. During the 1924 gymkhana, a shed was built without proper permission of the municipal committee, who later questioned it. The Annadale Gymkhana committee, in its explanation, replied, \\"The genesis of this shed was the desire of one of the Indian members of the club (Maharaja of Bharatpur) for the purdah ladies who then can view the sports from the shed.\\" After independence Gymkhana, polo, football, hockey, cricket matches, and other cultural and social festivals were organised in Annadale after independence. Dussehra was the main event organised, attracting people from the city, but in 1972 a clash between army and police created enmity between the military and civil administration. After this incidence, the event was shifted to Jakhoo Temple. Another major event was the 1971 plenary session of the All India Congress Committee. In addition, a national women's field hockey championship was also organised there. A Yajna was organised by Gayatri Parivar in 1994. In 2005, the Army established a war museum on the periphery of the ground. Hamid Ansari being welcomed by CM P.K. Dhumal in Annadale Ground  Geography  Annadale is located 2 km away from Shimla Railway Station,  Controversy  Annadale got in controversy during 2005 to 2012, when Himachal Pradesh Government wanted to make an International Cricket Stadium here, but Indian Army refused this by saying that it would damage the scenic charm and nature of the valley and because of all this the situation became a bit controversial. In 2011 government made an idea to ask the people of Shimla about this decision, in which the board was placed on The Ridge, on which the people who support this concept had to sign on the board. Most people supported this by signing on the board, but still government had to accept the Army's demand by cancelling the plan, then the plan was shifted to Dharamshala.

Drawing inspiration from Noh plays, specifically the 14th-century Motomezuka, the novel centers on a tragic love triangle depraved by adultery and violence. It is a short novel in length and has a nonlinear narrative structure. The novel was first serialised thirteen times in the weekly magazine Shukan Shincho between 12 June 1961 and 4 September 1961. It was published in hardcover format by Shinchosha on 30 September 1961. It was published in paperback by Shincho Bunko on 10 July 1966. The novel was translated into Italian by Lydia Origlia and published by Feltrinelli in September 1983. The novel was translated into English by Andrew Clare and published in paperback format in the United States and Canada by Vintage International on 27 November 2018. Clare's translation was later published in paperback in the United Kingdom by Penguin Modern Classics on 4 April 2019. The novel was adapted into film by Sōkichi Tomimoto in 1964, starring Ayako Wakao. Background Nō mask, mirroring the \\"interminable smile\\" of Ippei. The Frolic of the Beasts is considered a parody of the classical Noh play Motomezuka, written in the fourteenth century by the father of modern Noh theatre, Kiyotsugu Kan'ami.Persuasively argued by former Emeritus Professor of Japanese literature, Jin'ichi Konishi. 小西甚一; 三島文学への垂跡 －「獣の戯れ」と「求塚」; 日本文学研究資料新集ー 三島由紀夫 美とエロスの論理; 有精堂 (May 1991). In the play, a priest from the western provinces, travelling to Kyoto, stops with his companions in the isolated village of Ikuta (\\"Field of Life\\") in Settsu Province. They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the Burning House (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the Eight Great Hells, through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Yūko's relationship with Ippei and Kōji. The love triangle among Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of The Frolic of the Beasts with Yūko, Ippei, and Kōji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love. It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in Motomezuka and Yūko's anguish in prison). The name Motomezuka is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \\"Maiden's Grave\\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Manyōshū, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period. Noh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. Noh masks are referenced throughout The Frolic of the Beasts. At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, Kōji humours himself with the thought that his own face \\"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\\" In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \\"interminable smile\\", which recalls the fixed expression of Noh masks. Also, the \\"dark grape luster\\" of Yūko's \\"characteristic thick lipstick\\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \\"young woman\\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions. In his review for The Japan Times, Damian Flanagan also compared the \\"jumbled\\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \\"transcendent unearthliness\\" similar to that of a Noh play. Miyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \\"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \\"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\\" Mishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and wrote several Noh plays himself. Mishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through Fumiko Enchi's novel, Masks. It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \\"esoteric masterpiece.\\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before The Frolic of the Beasts. The story is considered to be a variation on the theme of Mishima's stream of consciousness novel, Thirst for Love (1950), in that it portrays a dysfunctional family unit, whose members have been thrown together with ultimately tragic consequences. The novel has also been compared to Mishima's novel Forbidden Colors (1951, 1953), which portrays the messy relationship between the much-older Shunsuke and the youthful Yuichi. The Frolic of the Beasts has also been compared to the intense existential crises of the characters in Mishima's 1959 novel . Plot Prologue In a photograph, three smiling individuals–Ippei Kusakado, his wife Yūko, and the youthful Kōji–are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \\"the final wretched incident\\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, Kōji's on the left, and Yūko's in the center. Yūko's, however, is only a \\"living monument\\", reserved for her eventual death. Chapter 1 Kōji is released from prison. He travels by boat from Numazu to Iro Village, where Yūko is waiting for him. Kōji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Yūko that he hasn't changed. Yūko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in Kōji coming to Iro. Yūko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which Kōji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, Kōji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Yūko tells him to keep his head up. Kōji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house. Chapter 2 Two years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, Kōji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells Kōji about his unhappiness with his wife Yūko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. Kōji, jealous of Ippei's \\"corrupt heart\\", falls in love with Yūko that night, despite not having met her before. Kōji begins a secret affair with Yūko. One night, Yūko told Kōji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told Kōji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Yūko, Kōji is waiting for Yūko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, Kōji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \\"will\\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \\"upset the very foundations\\" of the order of his world. That evening, Yūko and Kōji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Yūko simply asks Ippei to \\"return home quietly\\". Kōji expected a grand confrontation, where \\"the truth of perverse human nature begins to shine\\". He instead sees it as \\"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\\" Yūko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. Kōji immediately reacts without \\"emotion, objective, or motive\\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket. Chapter 3 Izu coastline in Nishiizu. In Iro, Kōji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. Kōji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with aphasia and paralysis on his right side, and is left with an \\"interminable smile\\". Kōji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \\"world bereft of logic\\", and chose to impart the \\"cold, hard, black logic of iron\\" of the wrench. Kōji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, Kōji, Yūko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Yūko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Yūko's sacrilege scares Kōji. Yūko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \\"sacrifice\\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and Kōji tries to defend him but Yūko cuts Kōji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Yūko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \\"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \\"kiss\\", then passionately kisses Kōji in front of him. Kōji scolds Yūko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used Kōji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. Kōji strikes Yūko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, Kōji embraces Yūko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \\"had lost completely its exquisite taste\\". Chapter 4 One evening, Kōji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijirō's young daughter, Kimi. Kōji has never heard Teijirō speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijirō since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and Kōji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. Kōji envies Kiyoshi's \\"simple lyrical spirit\\", but considers Matsukichi \\"a dull-witted young animal\\". Looking at the three characters, Kōji thinks of Yūko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Yūko and repeats \\"I have repented\\" to himself. Together in the bar, Kōji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. Kōji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with Kōji. Kimi says she respects Kōji's love for Yūko, but is \\"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\\". Kōji and Kimi have sex, but Kōji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \\"nothing but a poor imitation\\" of the \\"perfect flesh\\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, Kōji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to Kōji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. Kōji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together. Chapter 5 While working in the greenhouse, Teijirō suddenly confesses to Kōji that he raped Kimi. Teijirō then shows Kōji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. Kōji is disturbed by Teijirō's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, Kōji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \\"germ-like secret of her father's crime\\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \\"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes Kōji's hands, gazing in his eyes. Kōji stares only at Yūko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Yūko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, Kōji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Yūko enters Kōji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \\"conceited\\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Yūko compares her action to that of Kōji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \\"not having a crime to her name\\" that would allow her to at least \\"stand beside him\\". Kōji and Yūko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Yūko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. Kōji realises Yūko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \\"long-continued suffering\\". He is infuriated by Yūko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Yūko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Yūko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, Kōji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Yūko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Yūko asks Kōji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. Kōji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Yūko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \\"hollow cavern\\" and \\"empty hole\\" which the household revolves around. Kōji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. Kōji is angered by this \\"childlike supplication\\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \\"Death. I want to die.\\" They meet back up with Yūko, and Kōji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Yūko says, \\"There's no going back now after all of this.\\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Yūko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijirō take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \\"lots of pictures\\". Epilogue On a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Yūko, and Kōji. Kakujin tells of the time Yūko and Kōji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. Kōji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but Kōji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of premeditated murder. Kōji was given the death penalty, and Yūko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Yūko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Yūko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Yūko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Yūko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \\"Now I can serve my time in peace.\\" Yūko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves. Setting The harbor in Tago, Nishiizu, just south of present-day Arari. \\"Iro Village\\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of Arari, which was merged into the current town of Nishiizu. Similarly, a reference to Mt Taiya is also fictional. However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \\"Ono-san\\" or \\"Ono- yama.\\" The Japanese characters \\"Ono\\" can also be read \\"Taiya.\\" Mishima stayed at a ryokan in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing The Frolic of the Beasts (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research). A monument to Mishima is located in the area of Cape Kogane, with a passage from The Frolic of the Beasts engraved on it. Title and covers Before its official English translation, the novel's title was variously translated as Beastly Entanglements and The Amusement of Beasts. The novel's first edition cover illustration was done by Kaii Higashiyama. ;US Edition (Vintage International) The cover was created by award winning cover designer John Gall. He selected it as being appropriate because the story largely takes place in a rural shore town and involves a love triangle, which invokes a rock garden and a burning element that is beginning to affect the larger whole. The cover was included on Literary Hub's list \\"The 75 Best Book Covers of 2018\\". ;UK Edition (Penguin Modern Classics) The cover design uses a photograph taken in the mid 1960s by Eikoh Hosoe, one of a series of photographs from a collection called Kamaitachi (a mythical weasel with sickle-like claws). The photo shoot took place in a remote farming village in the Tōhoku region of Japan and was a collaboration between Eikoh and Tatsumi Hijikata, the creator of the ankoku butō style of dance.

She carries around a ukulele, which she partly manufactured, wherever she goes. * Matsukichi – a fisherman. He is \\"a dull-witted young animal\\". He is Kimi's childhood friend, and quarreled with Kiyoshi over her.

He represents the lyrical itinerant priest in a Noh play, who goes on a journey (here appearing in the Epilogue, in contrast to the traveler priest who would typically make an appearance at the beginning of a Noh play) and Kakujin plays the role of the Noh reciter and provides an outline of the story for the benefit of the main supporting character (i.e. the researcher) and the audience. Publication The Frolic of the Beasts was first serialised thirteen times in the weekly magazine Shukan Shincho between 12 June 1961 and 4 September 1961. It was published in hardcover format by Shinchosha on 30 September 1961. It was published in paperback by Shincho Bunko on 12 July 1966.

Clare's translation was later published in paperback in the United Kingdom by Penguin Modern Classics on 4 April 2019. Reception Contemporary The novel received a positive reception from contemporary literary critics. Its publication in 1961 coincided the public debate over the \\"pure literature controversy\\" (), which was started by literary critic Hirano Ken with a September 1961 article he wrote in The Asahi Shimbun. The Frolic of the Beasts was positively evaluated as a legitimate work of \\"pure literature\\" at the time. In the 16 October 1961 issue of The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, eminent writer and scholar Shōichi Saeki called the novel an authentic literary depiction of love. In the 8 November 1961 issue of the Tokyo Shimbuns evening edition, critic Takeshi Muramatsu praised the novel and contrasted it to the detective crime fiction of writer Seichō Matsumoto, whose work Muramatsu said in contrast to that of Mishima could not be considered \\"pure literature\\". In the 10 August 1962 issue of , Hidehiko Miwa characterized it a neo-romantic novel. In the 30 October 1961 issue of the weekly book review paper Shūkan Dokushojin, Sumie Tanaka described the novel as a work of fierce research. In the 2 November 1961 issue of the Yomiuri Shimbuns evening edition, critic Okuno Takeo felt, however, that the second part of the novel was written in such a dense and beautiful style that it prevented the overall work from leaving a deep impression. Translation Publishers Weekly in its starred review called it a \\"luridly propulsive novel\\" and praised Mishima's \\"baroque, beautiful prose\\". Writing for The New York Times Book Review, John Williams criticised the plot for not sustaining the novel's length, but praised the unconventional relationships of the central characters for making the \\"most riveting scenes\\" of the novel \\"truly riveting; unforgettable, even.\\". John Nathan, a well-known translator and biographer of Mishima, who knew Mishima personally, praised Andrew Clare's \\"decent\\" translation in his review of the novel for The New York Review of Books. In her review for Spectrum Culture, Ashley Pabilonia felt the first half of the novel suffered from its nonlinear timeline but praised Mishima for building the characters' \\"romantic tension, suspense and guilt between them thickly enough that readers will be enticed to see the trio's story to the end.\\" The English-language translation was included as an honorable mention on Literary Hub's list \\"The 10 Best Translated Novels of the Decade\\" for the 2010s. Film adaptation In 1964, the novel was adapted into a black-and- white film by director Sōkichi Tomimoto through Daiei Studios. The film stars Ayako Wakao, the leading actress of her day, as Yūko. Ayako Wakao previously starred alongside Mishima in the yakuza film Afraid to Die (1960). ;Cast * Ayako Wakao as Yūko Kusakado * Seizaburō Kawazu as Ippei Kusakado * Takao Ito as Kōji Umemiya * Masao Mishima as Kakujin * Hikaru Hoshi as Teijirō * Yoshi Katō as Kibe, a chaplain * Yuka Konno as Kimi * Midori Towada as Machiko * Kentarō Kudō as Matsukichi * Daigo Inoue as Kiyoshi * Shin Minatsu as Saburō * Shizuo Chūjō as hospital doctor * Yūzō Hayakawa as prison officer * Sachiko Meguro as Hideko ;Crew * Hiroaki Fujii – planning * Shigeo Mano – art direction * Shigeru Yasuda – lighting technician See also * Motomezuka References External links * Category:1961 Japanese novels Category:Novels by Yukio Mishima Category:Novels set in Japan Category:Novels set in Tokyo Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Shukan Shincho (magazine) Category:Japanese novels adapted into films Category:Shinchosha books Category:Adultery in novels Category:Novels about death Category:Novels about murder Category:Nonlinear narrative novels Category:Novels based on plays Category:1964 films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese black-and-white films Category:Daiei Film films Category:Films based on Japanese novels Category:Films based on works by Yukio Mishima ","title":"The Frolic of the Beasts"},{"id":"62451412","text":"Fox 40 is a Canadian whistle manufacturer.

It is situated north of the Canada–United States border, northwest of Chilliwack Lake, and southeast of Foley Peak, which is its nearest higher peak. Williams Peak is the highest point of the South Hope Mountains, which is a subset of the Skagit Range. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Chilliwack River. The mountain's name was officially adopted April 7, 1955, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Williams Peak was first climbed July 1908 by James J. McArthur and E.T. de Coeli via the southwest ridge. Geology Williams Peak is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaMiocene peralkaline volcanism in west-central British Columbia - Its temporal and plate-tectonics settingCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Williams Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Williams Peak.

The book is a fictional first-personal account of a Catholic woman's struggle after marrying the wrong man. It was one of Caine's most contentious books, causing outrage on its release for its handling of adultery, illegitimacy and divorce. It was the seventh-best-selling novel of 1913 and was made into a film in 1919. Plot First Part: My Girlhood Mary O'Neill is brought up in Ellan, loved and cared for by her invalid mother within a house dominated by hostile and cruel relations. Mary is sent to a convent school in Rome at the age of seven and over the subsequent ten years her mother passes away and she grows in religious devotion until she decides to enter a convent. However, her father instead decrees that she should be married. Before returning to Ellan, Mary again meets her childhood friend, Martin Conrad, who is aghast to hear that she is to marry Lord Raa, a known 'profligate and reprobate.' But they are both powerless to oppose Mary's father's wishes. Second Part: My Marriage The 1919 film depiction of Lord Raa trying to force himself on Mary Back in Ellan, Mary is troubled to meet the foppish Lord Raa, who is clear in his opinion that their marriage is an open arrangement for kudos and money. Her feeling about the marriage is confirmed by letters from Martin Conrad which reveal that Lord Raa has a mistress in London. However, Mary's family have invested too much in the arrangement, both in money and arrangements, to change their minds. Against her better judgement, Mary satisfies her family's and the community's expectations and goes ahead with the marriage. Third Part: My Honeymoon Lord Raa soon proves himself to be a repugnant and terrible person on their honeymoon. Having attempted to rape Mary on their wedding night, Lord Raa then begins an affair with a former school colleague of Mary's, Alma Lier. Mary eventually confronts Lord Raa about the affair, but instead of denying anything, Lord Raa blames Mary, claiming that he was forced to another woman since she was \\"no company for anybody but the saints and angels.\\"Caine, Hall (1913), The Woman Thou Gavest Me, London: Heinemann, Part III, Chapter 49 Mary then happens to meet Martin Conrad, fresh back from his successful journey to the South Pole. She is instantly awash with happiness, which Lord Raa and Alma notice darkly. Fourth Part: I Fall in Love Port Soderick, arguably the model for the location of Castle Raa Mary and Martin soon fall in love. This frightens the highly moral and religious Mary and so she flees back to Ellan. However, Alma and Lord Raa's entourage accompany Mary and her husband and their home is given over to the debauch of the drinking, gambling and immoral living. Mary makes unsuccessful enquiries about getting a divorce and returns to find the house vacated of guests, as they have ominously gone off on a cruise when it was discovered that Martin was coming to visit. Despite her best intentions and determined attempts at self-denial, she and Martin admit their love and, on the eve of his departure on another mission to the South Pole, she goes to him in his room. Fifth Part: I Become a Mother After Martin leaves for Antarctica, Mary finds that she is pregnant. She flees Castle Raa secretly and travels to London. After evading discovery with the help of a schoolhood friend, Mary hears of the (ultimately false) newspaper reports that Martin had died at sea. After failing to find any better accommodation, it is in the poor area of Bayswater that she gives birth to a baby girl. Sixth Part: I am Lost In order to earn money, Mary gives the child to be cared for by a woman in Ilford and gets a job as a seamstress in Whitechapel. However, poverty drives up the demands of her working day and lessens her ability to act against the poor care that her child is receiving. Upon learning that she has an illegitimate child, Mary's landlord and employer casts her out and she is faced with a desperate need to earn a large sum of money in order to pay for her sick child's care. Without other options, she determines to become a prostitute, but is saved from acting on this when Conrad arrives back from the Antarctic and saves her from the street. Seventh Part: I Am Found Conrad takes Mary home to his parents' house in Ellan to recover. Lord Raa divorces her in the courts, apparently leaving the way open for her and Martin to marry. However, Mary is recalled to her Catholic vows and sees that she cannot marry again, but she is put off telling Martin this when she discovers that she is terminally ill and without long to live. Mary doesn't wish to spoil her remaining time with Martin and so pretends not to be ill until the very last. She dies peacefully at home and Martin takes back up his scientific task in the Antarctic. Publication and reception Hall Caine Hall Caine first conceived of the idea for The Woman Thou Gavest Me in 1890 when his two sons visited in him in Rome during his time working on The Eternal City., p. 272 The idea for the novel gestated during his work on two further novels before The Woman Thou Gavest Me began its serial release in Hearst's Magazine in October 1912 (running for a period alongside the serial of Winston Churchill's The Inside of the Cup).Review featured as Item #462548 in the NYPL Digital Gallery The novel was complete and released in book form in July 1913., pp. 351-352 Even considering the great outcry that his previous novels received for their \\"coarseness\\" and \\"immorality\\", The Woman Thou Gavest Me brought about 'the biggest furore of any of his novels [...] a storm of criticism and abuse broke out over Caine's head when the book came out.' Many circulating libraries refused to stock the book. Understandably most virulent in their derision of the book were Catholics, who found the book to be offensive in many ways, not least in being an apparent attempt to condone adultery and illegitimacy. Archibald Knox on Hall Caine's gravestone The novel was received poorly by the critics. The Nation called it an 'absurd book'; 'the sort of sensational mediocrity which is bound to appeal to the vulgar.''Current Fiction' in The Nation, September 4, 1913, p. 210 The Outlook spoke of how in the novel 'melodramatic situations and turgid rhetoric are the rule'; 'the mixture of sentiment, high-flown language, and unnecessarily bold discussion of the marriage relation makes reading disagreeable and tedious.''The New Books: The Woman Thou Gavest Me ' in The Outlook, September 6, 1913, p. 46 However, some positive reviews were received, such as in The Literary Digest, whose review began:'Hall Caine's New Novel' in The Literary Digest, November 22, 1913, pp. 1016-1017 > For intensity of emotion, detailed analysis of psychological conditions, and > passionate human experiences, the reader will find all that can be desired > from the pen of Hall Caine. Each page is throbbing with emotion, usually in > the superlative degree. However, despite the predominantly negative critical reception, and in part thanks to the furore surrounding the book, The Woman Thou Gavest Me became the seventh best-selling novel of 1913, selling over half a million copies before the end of the year.'1913 Publisher’s Weekly Bestsellers' on A Hunred Years Ago (accessed 4 March 2015) This was a reflection of the popular success that Caine continued to receive in defiance of his critical reception at this time. Most marked were the positive personal reactions he received from female readers of the novel, apparently leading to the fact that even 'years later he was still getting letters from women asking how he knew so exactly how they felt.'. One such woman wrote to Caine telling him that:, pp.353-4 > \\"I cannot express my thoughts but you - how beautiful to be so gifted, with > such a mind and the power to express. I cannot tell you what the book was to > me.\\" The novel was to remain in print until Caine's death in 1931, when it was in its 29th English edition and had been translated nine times. The book was considered of such importance to Hall Caine's life work that the character of Mary O’Neill was one of the characters from his novels chosen to be carved onto his gravestone by Archibald Knox. For this character, Knox apparently modelled Mary's likeness on a photograph of Hall Caine's own wife, Mary Hall Caine.Norris, Samuel (1947), Two Men of Manxland: Hall Caine, Novelist; T.E.Brown, Poet, Douglas: Norris Modern Press, p.74 Locations Having caused upset with the real locations of his previous novels, Caine was keen to try and avoid much of this in The Woman Thou Gavest Me. However, his attempt to obscure the identity of the island 'Ellan' is very weak, as his modern biographer notes: \\"['Ellan' is] the thinnest of disguises for the Isle of Man.\\" Some of the relatively obvious Manx locations and identifiers include the following: St. Mary's Church, Ballaugh * 'Blackwater,' the main town of Ellan, is identifiable as Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man. The name is popularly thought to be derived from the Manx names for the rivers that meet in the town; the Dhoo, meaning 'black,' and the Glass, meaning 'green.' * 'Holmtown,' the town where Mary's father's lawyer lives (Pt. II, Chap. 24), is the original name of Peel. * Castle Raa is almost certainly conceived of as located at Port Soderick, being apparently a half-hour drive south of Blackwater/Douglas (Pt. IV, Chap. 56), a walk away from a headland overlooking the town (Pt. IV, Chap. 64), and connected to a glen of the same name that leads to the shore (Pt. IV, Chap. 66). * The name Raa is believed to be inspired by Rhaa Mooar, \\"an ancient earthworks and pile of fallen stones on Maughold Head.\\" * The hotel in which Mary and Lord Raa spend their honeymoon is identifiable as the Fort Anne Hotel, which used to stand on the southern side of the river overlooking Douglas (Pt. III, Chap. 35). * Mary's childhood home is located close to Ballaugh, where the local church is St. Mary's. However, the novel's St. Mary's church is described as having the distinctive leaning gate posts of the old Ballaugh Church (Pt. VII, Mary O'Neill's Last Note). * The school attended by Martin Conrad is King George's School (Pt. I, Chap 10), which is a reflection of King William's College near Castletown. * When Mary is driven home by her father after her time in Rome, they pass through 'Folksdale,' which is obviously related to Foxdale (Pt.

Orlando, Van Dyck e i suoi amici. Fiamminghi a Genova 1600-1640, Genova, Palazzo della Meridiana, Sagep, Genoa 2018 was a Flemish painter who after training in Antwerp spent his known active career in Italy. He was initially a collaborator in the studio of the de Wael brothers in Genoa and later developed an independent practice. While he appears to have enjoyed the patronage of the nobility of Genoa, the scope of his oeuvre is not very well understood. A few portraits and a history painting have been attributed to him. Life Details about the life of the artist are scarce. The artist biographer Raffaello Soprani discusses Hovaert in his 1768 Vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti genovesi, in which he refers to the artist as 'Giovanni Hovart'.Raffaello Soprani, Vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti genovesi, Nella stamperia Casamara, dalle cinque Lampadi, con licenza de' Superiori, 1768, pp. 465-466 His birthplace was likely Brussels but may also have been Antwerp. He is believed to be the person registered under the name Hans de Houwer as a pupil of the otherwise obscure painter Jan Blanckaert in the records of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1633–33. He left Flanders soon after commencing his training in Antwerp. He is recorded in Genoa around 1635. Genoa was at the time an attractive destination for artists since the competition between artists there was less intense than in the leading Italian cultural centres Rome, Florence and Venice. Genoa was also a thriving port city where a large number of potential customers and collectors lived.Anversa & Genova: een hoogtepunt in de barokschilderkunst St. Jerome together with his disciples St. Paula and St. Eustochium In Genoa Hovaert seems to have quickly been taken under the wing of Cornelis. Cornelis de Wael was a painter as well as a merchant who had moved to Genoa with his brother Lucas from their native Antwerp around 1619.Alison Stoesser, Lucas and Cornelis de Wael: Flemish artists in Antwerp, Genoa and Rome in the seventeenth century, vol. 1: Text, unpublished doctoral dissertation [2008] The workshop of the brothers de Wael in Genoa was the centre of the colony of Flemish artists who resided in or passed through the city. These itinerant Flemish artists could take advantage of the work and artistic activity that their workshop attracted. The brothers provided a home, materials and tools, they assisted their compatriots with their local integration, passed on recommendations to clients and formulated competition rules.Wael, Cornelis in: the Enciclopedia online of the Prado Museum When Anthony van Dyck visited Genoa, he also stayed with the de Wael brothers. Several Flemish artists visiting Genoa became collaborators in the de Wael workshop. This was also the case of Jan Hovaert who is described as a pupil as well as a collaborator of Cornelis de Wael. It seems that later on Hovaert was able to establish himself as an independent painter of historical and religious subjects as well as portraits. These works were highly appreciated by the Genoese nobility but only a few of these have been located.Francesco Rossi, HOVAERT, Jan, dit Di Lamberto Giovanni, in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges The contemporary fame of Hovaert is attested by his inclusion in his contemporary Luca Assarino's Giuochi di Fortuna, o sia gli avvenimenti di Astiage e di Mandane, of 1669. Assarino includes Hovaert, whom he refers to as 'Giovanni Havvorth', among the leading painters in Genoa of that time such as Salvatore Castiglione, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari and Giovanni Battista Carlone.Giacomo Montanari. Jan Hovart (o Howart), San Gerolamo con le sante PaolaRomana, Blesilla ed Eustochio, c. 1635. Genova, chiesa di Santa Maria Maddalena in: \\"Van Dyck e i suoi amici. Fiamminghi a Genova 1600-1640\\", a cura di A. Orlando, 2018, pp. 282-287 Hovaert married Giovanna Anna Teodora Smit, daughter of Lambert Smit, the Consul of the Flemish-German nation in Livorno in 1631. They had a number of children. One of their sons became a painter and studied in Rome. He died in Genoa in 1665. Work De Wael was a painter of religious subjects as well as of portraits. His currently known oeuvre is limited to two works. Head of St. Jerome (detail of the St. Jerome altarpiece) Hovaert was active as a portrait painter. Among the 111 works recorded to be in his workshop upon his death were many portraits of prominent personalities in Genoa. Luca Assarino mentions that Hovaert's reputation relied on his portraits of female and male sitters and that he painted a portrait of Luca Giustiniani, the Doge of the Republic of Genoa between 1644 and 1646. Two portraits representing Luca Giustiniani, one, a preparatory study on board (private collection) and the other, a final work on canvas (Musée de Bastia) were formerly attributed to his master Cornelis de Wael but are now given to Hovaert.Portrait of Luca Giustiniani, Doge of the Republic of Genoa, Formerly attributed to Cornelis de Wael, now attributed to Jan Hovaert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A painting representing St. Jerome together with his disciples St. Paula and St. Eustochium (Church of Saint Magdalene, Genoa) is the sole surviving religious work of the artist. The altarpiece was most likely commissioned to celebrate the second dedicatee of the church of the Magdalene, Saint Jerome. Saint Jerome was dear to the Somaschi Fathers who owned the church since 5 October 1576 as their founder Gerolamo Emiliani was named after the saint. The Somaschi Fathers initiated a total renovation of the church interior in 1635. It is therefore plausible to take the year 1635 as the earliest date for the execution of Hovaert's altarpiece. The canvas has a pyramidal composition. Saint Jerome is sitting at the center of the group of three saints Paula, Blaesilla and Eustochium. He is shown reading out from a big book that is on his lap. He is reading the genesis of the Vulgate, an educational theme that was dear to the Somaschi Fathers. Hovaert has depicted Saint Jerome as the austere wise model portrayed by Antonello da Messina rather than the disheveled and gaunt figure devoured by penitence preferred by 16th and 17th century painters. The work shows the stylistic characteristics of the artist: the use of rapid touches and a free brush in the physiognomies and palette of the painting. The face of Gerolamo is marked by study and age, and weighed down by dark and voluminous circles. His eyes are vivid and very mobile and their liquidity and brightness is highlighted through carefully placed highlights and dots of color. The hands follow less the diaphanous and elongated form of the Vandyckian model. The fingers have an earthy and fleshy consistency. The style and palette are close to the works of Cornelis De Wael. Hovaert may also have been active as the copyist who created many of the copies after van Dyck that are found in Genoa.

Life  Born in Vienna, Thomé was the son of an official of the Russian Ambassador in Vienna, Prince Andrey Razumovsky. After his father's death his mother moved with him to Dresden, where he completed high school. When his mother remarried, the family moved back to Vienna, where he began his theater career at the age of 17. He had his first engagements in Vienna, Mainz and Paris, where the company he belonged to failed financially. From 1837 Thomé played first in Pest and then in Nürnberg. Shortly thereafter he took over the direction of the theatre in Ljubljana, which at that time was connected with that of Trieste.Der Spiegel, für Kunst, Eleganz und Mode.. 18, 1845, . (online) In 1847 he was engaged by Count Skarbek after Lemberg in his newly built theatre as artistic director, but returned to Ljubljana, Trieste and Klagenfurt as early as 1848. In 1850 he took over the direction of the Landständisches Theater in Graz. A saying of this time - based on the excellent stage design he supported - was: One must hear the prophetmeant is the opera Le prophète by Giacomo Meyerbeer in Vienna and see it in Gratz.\\" From 22 March 1853 until 1858 he was director of the theatre in Riga. From 1859 he led - first together with - the Prague Estates Theatre. When he threw himself with it in 1860 because of financial discrepancies, he continued to run the theater alone until 1864. Some well-known actors, like the later Viennese Burgschauspieler Konrad Adolf Hallenstein and the singers Franz Innozenz Nachbaur and Eduard Bachmann, he brought into his ensemble. After a short interruption he led this theatre again from 1865 to 1866, until it was closed by the Austro-Prussian War. A foundation of Thomé was the New Town, Prague theatre he built at his own expense, from 1868 he also directed the stage of Linz. In 1870 Thomé suffered a stroke, terminated his contract in Linz and returned to Prague, where he died in 1872 at age 68 after a second stroke.

Research and theory  Li Zhaoping is known as the creater of the V1 Saliency Hypothesis, V1SH (pronounced 'vish'), that the primary visual cortex (V1) in primates creates a saliency map of the visual field to guide visual attention or gaze shifts exogenously. Proposed in the late-1990s, V1SH was unpopular initially, since it was contrary to the main and popular idea that the frontal and parietal areas of the brain are responsible for the saliency map. As V1SH gathered more experimental support, Zhaoping became more sought after for keynote or invited speeches in international conferences ,and V1SH rises from being unpopular to being controversial. Some report experimental data for the theory, while others report evidence against it. . It is argued that if V1SH holds, then the framework to understand how our brain solves the vision problem should be substantially changed.

She then decided to see if her dog, Sookie, would hold a raw egg in its mouth. Her 17 year old niece Haley Bowers posted a video of the dog doing this on Twitter, resulting in millions of views. Since then others have tried this with their dogs with various degrees of success. Challenge Whether a dog will do it or not depends on their breed and their temperament.

Pre-colonial examples The Iroquois Confederacy and the Blackfoot Confederacy are two prominent pre- colonial examples of collective organization prior to or during the process of colonization. Other groups formed to enter into treaties with colonial governments. Early pan-indigenous examples The Grand Indian Council of Ontario and Quebec was established in 1870 composed primarily of Ojibway and Iroquois. In 1915, the Allied Tribes of B.C. was formed by Peter Kelly and Andrew Paull to seek treaties and adequate-size reserves. After the First World War, the League of Indians in Canada was founded by a Mohawk veteran, Fred Ogilvie Loft (1862-1934). It became the antecedent of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and Indian Association of Alberta. In 1926, the Indian Defense League of America was formed by Chief Clinton Rickard of the Tuscarora Nation, with heavy involvement in US-Canada border crossing problems faced by \\"Indians\\" in both countries. Rickard organized an annual celebration to assert border crossing rights, Indian rights generally, and respect for the value and dignity of Indigenous culture. The Native Brotherhood of British Columbia was founded in 1931 as a province-wide First Nations rights organization. A split took place in the League of Indians in 1938, and in 1939 the Indian Association of Alberta was formed. After the Second World War, the other faction formed \\"The Protective Association for Indians and Their Treaties\\" to advocate for native title and recognition of rights over traditional territories and resources. Post-war developments In 1946, after the Second World War, the Union of Saskatchewan Indians emerged from the Protective Association and a newly founded \\"Association of Saskatchewan Indians.\\" In 1945, the North American Indian Brotherhood was founded by Andy Paull as a national lobby group which urged extension of voting rights without loss of Indian rights, removal of liquor offences as a way of ending most of the criminal charges faced by Indian people, and advocating pensions and welfare for Indians on the same level as the Canadian population. In 1956, the Union of Saskatchewan Indians transformed itself into the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians. In 1965, the federation was incorporated by Walter Deiter, Henry Langan, Max Goodwill, Hilliard McNabb and Lucien Bruce. Its objective was to protect Indian treaties and treaty rights; to promote the welfare of the Indians of Saskatchewan, to foster progress in the economic development, education and social life of Indians; and to cooperate with civil and religious authorities in matters pertaining to Indian interests. With the 1969 White Paper, George Manuel participated in the formation of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs to oppose the new proposed policy. The first Chiefs meeting in 1969 was organized by Rose Charlie of the Indian Homemakers Association of BC, Philip Paul of the Southern Vancouver Island Tribal Federation and Don Moses of the North American Indian Brotherhood.The White Paper, 1969 at The Canadian Encyclopedia National organizations The National Indian Council was created in 1961 to represent Indigenous people of Canada, including treaty/status Indians, non-status Indians, the Métis people, though not the Inuit.Assembly of First Nations – The Story This organization, however, collapsed in 1967 as the three groups failed to act as one, so the non-status and Métis groups formed the Native Council of Canada and the treaty/status groups formed the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB), an umbrella group for provincial and territorial organizations like the Indian Association of Alberta. The NIB was a national political body made up of the leadership of the various provincial and territorial organizations (PTOs) which lobbied for changes to federal and provincial policies. In 1970, George Manuel, Noel Doucette, Andrew Delisle, Omer Peters, Jack Sark, Dave Courchene, Roy Sam, Harold Sappier, Dave Ahenakew, Harold Cardinal and Roy Daniels incorporated the National Indian Brotherhood. A report of the federal Interdepartmental Committee on Indian and Eskimo Policy in July 1971 formed the basis for the Secretary of State Core Funding program for native organizations approved by Cabinet. The government envisaged a neat package of three national aboriginal associations and one regional association per province or territory for each. An adjustment was made in the case of Ontario where Indians had already organized four associations on tribal and treaty lines. The objective was to assist groups \\"to communicate their needs and views effectively to all levels of government, to participate in the political, social and economic institutions of Canadian society, and to contribute to the development of aboriginal leadership.\\" In July 1971, the \\"First National Native Women's Conference\\" took place. The Chiefs held their first assembly as \\"the Assembly of First Nations\\" (AFN) in Penticton, British Columbia, in April 1982. The new structure, which gave membership and voting rights to individual First Nations chiefs rather than provincial/territorial organizations, was adopted in July 1985, as part of the Charter of the Assembly of First Nations. Conflicts The evolution of organizations of aboriginal peoples soon rendered these criteria increasingly inapplicable. In British Columbia (BC), the Native Brotherhood had always represented both status and non-status Indians and the United Native Nations (established following the demise of the BC Association of Non-Status Indians) had aggressively asserted the same principle. Similarly, some of the BC tribal councils, the Council of Yukon Indians (CYI) and the Dene Nation rejected in principle the distinction between status and non-status Indians. This has led to a situation in which the then vice- president of the Native Council of Canada (for non-status people) was a status Indian, while the president of the CYI and the vice-president of the Dene Nation were non-status Indians at this time.

Although it is administered by Russia and had been previously by the Soviet Union, it has been claimed by Japan since 1945.  History  Zelyony was first mapped in 1739 by the Danish-Russian explorer Martin Spangberg. The island was known to the Japanese as Shibotsu-tō, but never settled, and Russia claimed jurisdiction over it. In 1855, jurisdiction was transferred to Japan, and the island was settled. In 1945, its population was 2,149. At the end of World War II, the Japanese military garrison surrendered to Soviet troops, the island was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and the Japanese population was repatriated to Japan. Although it has been officially uninhabited since, it was garrisoned from 1945 onward by the Soviet military. Zelyony was the site of an incident between the United States and the Soviet Union in April 1983. As part of the US-South Korean joint military exercise Team Spirit, six U.S. navy Corsair II attack aircraft flew over the island. The Soviet Union protested the incursion and a Soviet retaliatory flight over the Aleutian Islands was considered. Due to the Kuril Islands' disputed status, an American apology would have tacitly approved of the Soviet Union's presence and hurt Japan's claim to the island. As a result, the incident raised tensions between the USA and the USSR.

Biography  Roth grew up in Czechoslovakia with four younger sisters in a city of 15,000 inhabitants. When the Nazis arrived in the city, the city's 3,000 Jews were first forced to move to a makeshift ghetto, before the order came to move to \\"work for a shorter time in another country\\". After a several-day long train transport in overcrowded livestock carts without water and food, the train arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Roth's mother and two of his little sisters Magdalena, 12, and Judit, 10, were immediately brought to the gas chambers, while his father, his sisters Edit, 17, and Elisabeth, 15, and Emerich himself were taken to labor camps. His father was murdered during one of the death marches at the end of the war, and his sister Edit died in another camp. Roth was an inmate in five different concentration camps, and only he and his sister Elisabeth survived. After the war, Emerich was in bad shape and was 175 centimeters long and weighed only 34 kilos. He was in hospital and received a letter from someone with the same last name, which was his cousin. The letter stated that his sister had survived and was in Sweden. He came to Sweden in December 1950 and trained and worked for 30 years as a social worker. During these years he chose not to tell about his experiences, but was greatly influenced by a Nazi demonstration in Stockholm in 1992. He has since 1993 visited at least 1,600 schools around Sweden with the aim of countering racism. He is one of the founders of the Holocaust Survivor Association. He founded the nonprofit Emerich Foundation in 1994, which aims to encourage young people to \\"activities that counter violence and xenophobia and pave the way for a pleasant and humane school environment\\". Emerich Roth has published several books on the theme of violence and racism, including Emerich är mitt namn: Hatet, förnedringen, kärleken (Emerich's My Name: Hate, Humiliation, Love). He has also starred in many video-recorded documentaries and educational films.  Awards  He has received several rewards for his work on informing about racism and abuse. * H. M.

Following years in storage, the museum thoroughly cleaned the urn and returned it to public exhibition in 2012. History Anton Seidl, the 47-year-old Hungarian-born musical director of the New York Philharmonic and conductor of the Metropolitan Opera, died unexpectedly in 1898. A group of Seidl's friends and colleagues commissioned Barnard to create a burial urn to hold Seidl's ashes. Barnard had made a spectacular debut at the 1894 Paris Salon, and his Struggle of the Two Natures in Man had entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1896.Donna J.

Plot The structure of Khatemeh’s family, who originally came from Afghanistan and have lived in the Shiraz, Iran for more than thirty years, is rigid. A fourteen-year-old girl was married to a man double her age. He was in a relationship with her older sister, who took her own life. He says: “When she died, I wanted to marry her sister because they look alike.” According to the men in the house, mental problems are common to all the women in the family. Khatemeh has run away, to a women’s refuge, because she couldn’t stand it any longer. She asks for divorce. Some male relatives go to the refuge to take Khatemeh with them. Her brother says: “Death is better than being a whore.” At first glance, the situation seems clear. In the course of the film, however, more and more discrepancies emerge. Khatemeh especially shifts, unpredictably, between mental states. Sometimes she curses her family and fights for her freedom, then she implores the women who runs the refuge on her knees to let her go home no matter what. Other girls, who also took refuge in the home, are sometimes attacked violently by her. “Khatemeh” is like a desert storm which again and again obscures the viewer to reveal a new vista when it’s died down.

Biography Remo Calapso was Italian national chess master (1924), Italian national correspondence chess master (1925–26; 1929–30), problematic and solver of chess problems. He collaborated with chess magazine L'Italia Scacchistica (1926). Remo Calapso took part in numerous chess tournaments: Palermo (26 May-3 June 1924), Foligno (14-25 September 1924), Bologna (13-27 September 1925), Livorno (1-15 August 1926), Florence (4-17 October 1936; 1948), Chioggia-Sottomarina Lido (May 24-June 2, 1970), Imperia (September 19–27, 1970), Rovigo (October 3–11, 1970), Catanzaro (April 17–25, 1971). Remo Calapso played for Italy in the Chess Olympiad: * In 1928, at fourth board in the 2nd Chess Olympiad in The Hague (+0, =0, -5). Remo Calapso was in Messina for a good part of his life, not by chance he is often considered a native of Messina. He came from a family of mathematicians and chess players, and he excelled in both disciplines. His grandfather, Catello Calapso, had also been a good player and a problem player. Remo Calapso faced top level players, achieving commendable results. Among these he should mention a draw with the world champion Tigran Petrosian, obtained in the 6th round of the 1967 Venice chess tournament. Petrosian himself recalled - in the Russian chess magazine Shachmatnaja Moskva - a curious event that took place in the tournament, following that draw, when Grandmaster (GM) Dragoljub Janošević approached him with a vengeance. He thus turned to the world champion: \\"How did you manage to come with him?\\" - said Janosević. - \\"I will show you how to play!\\" Two days later, in the 9th round, Calapso led the white pieces against Janosević, playing in a very precise manner, so much so that already at the twentieth move the great Yugoslav master found himself with Queen's side completely devoid of pieces, only to be forced to leave after a few moves. Vincenzo Nestler, the strongest Sicilian player of the modern era, learned to play in Messina, right at the home of his friend Calapso. Calapso used to get shaved by a barber at his home, and during the beard he didn't disdain to play various games blindly against some opponents. On one of those occasions, when Calapso was playing four games blindly, Nestler was also present who was impressed and fascinated by this ability, and after that event he devoted himself to chess, becoming the strong chess player.

Most commonly, food grade syringes hold the printing material, which is then deposited through a food grade nozzle layer by layer. The most advanced 3D food printers have pre-loaded recipes on board and also allow the user to remotely design their food on their computers, phones or some IoT device. The food can be customized in shape, color, texture, flavor or nutrition, which makes it very useful in various fields such as space exploration and healthcare.

(2017). 3D printing: Printing precision and application in food sector. Trends in Food Science & Technology, 69, 83-94.  Materials and ingredients  3D Printed Chocolate The type of food available to print is limited by the printing technique.Sun, J., Peng, Z., Zhou, W., Fuh, J. Y., Hong, G. S., & Chiu, A. (2015). A review on 3D printing for customized food fabrication. Procedia Manufacturing, 1, 308-319. For an overview of these printing techniques, please see the section Printing Techniques below: =Extrusion- based printing ingredients= Common ingredients used in extrusion based printing are inherently soft enough to extrude from a syringe/printhead and possess a high enough viscosity to retain a shape.Cohen, D. L., Lipton, J. I., Cutler, M., Coulter, D., Vesco, A., & Lipson, H. (2009, August). Hydrocolloid printing: a novel platform for customized food production. In Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium (pp. 807-818). Austin, TX. In certain cases, powdered ingredients (protein, sugar, etc.) are added to increase viscosity, e.g. adding flour to water creates a paste that can be printed. Inherently soft materials include:Liu, Z., Zhang, M., Bhandari, B., & Yang, C. (2018). Impact of rheological properties of mashed potatoes on 3D printing. Journal of Food Engineering, 220, 76-82. * purée * jelly * frosting * cheese * mashed potatoes Certain ingredients that are solid can be used by melting and then extruding the ingredient, e.g. chocolate. =Selective laser sintering and binder jetting ingredients= Powdered ingredients: *sugar *chocolate powder *protein powder =Inkjet printing ingredients= Ingredients with low viscosity are used for surface filling: * sauces (pizza, hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, etc.) * colored food ink  Printing techniques  =Extrusion- based printing= Computer Render of Extrusion Based Printing with Multi- Material printing Although there are different approaches to extrusion based printing, these approaches follow the same basic procedures. The platform on which food is printed consists of a standard 3-axis stage with a computer controlled extrusion head. This extrusion head pushes food materials through a nozzle typically by way of compressed air or squeezing. The nozzles can vary with respect to what type of food is being extruded or the desired printing speedMantihal, S., Prakash, S., Godoi, F. C., & Bhandari, B. (2017). Optimization of chocolate 3D printing by correlating thermal and flow properties with 3D structure modeling. Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies, 44, 21–29. doi: 10.1016/j.ifset.2017.09.012 (typically the smaller the nozzle the longer the food printing will take). As the food is printed, the extrusion head moves along the 3-axis stage printing the desired food. Some printed food requires additional processing such as baking or frying before consumption. Extrusion based food printers can be purchased for household use, are typically compact in size, and have a low maintenance cost. Comparatively, extrusion based printing provides the user with more material choices. However, these food materials are usually soft, and as a result, makes printing complex food structures difficult. In addition, long fabrication times and deformations due to temperature fluctuations with additional baking or frying require further research and development to overcome. =Hot-melt and room temperature= In Hot-melt extrusion, the extrusion head heats the food material slightly above the material's melting point. The melted material is then extruded from the head and then solidifies soon thereafter. This allows the material to be easily manipulated into the desired form or model. Foods such as chocolate are used in this technique because of its ability to melt and solidify quickly.Hao, L., Mellor, S., Seaman, O., Henderson, J., Sewell, N., & Sloan, M. (2010). Material characterization and process development for chocolate additive layer manufacturing. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 5(2), 57-64. Other food materials do not inherently require a heating element in order to be printed. Food materials such as jelly, frosting, puree, and similar food materials with appropriate viscosity can be printed at room temperature without prior melting. =Selective laser sintering= Selective Laser Sintering Process In selective laser sintering, powdered food materials are heated by and bonded together forming a solid structure. This process is completed by bonding the powdered material layer by layer with a laser as the heat source. After a layer is completed with the desired areas bonded, it is then covered by a new unbonded layer of powder. Certain parts of this new unbonded layer are heated by the laser in order to bond it with the structure. This process continues in a vertical upwards manner until the desired food model is constructed. After construction, unbonded material can then be recycled and used to print another food model. Selective laser sintering enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures. It is limited by the range of suitable food materials, namely powdered ingredients.CandyFab (2007). The CandyFab project. Available at http://wiki. candyfab.org/Main_Page. Accessed Dec 2019 Due to this limitation, selective laser sintering has been used primarily for creating sweets/candies. =Binder jetting= Binder Jetting Process Similarly to selective laser sintering, binder jetting uses powdered food materials to create a model layer by layer. Instead of using heat to bond the materials together, a liquid binder is used. After bonding the desired areas of a layer, a new layer of powder is then spread over the bonded layer covering it. Certain parts of this new layer are then bonded to the previous layer. The process is repeated until the desired food model is constructed. As with selective laser sintering, binder jetting enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures.Southerland, D., Walters, P., & Huson, D. (2011, January). Edible 3D printing. In NIP & Digital Fabrication Conference (Vol. 2011, No. 2, pp. 819-822). Society for Imaging Science and Technology. Likewise, it is also limited by the range of suitable food materials, namely powdered ingredients. =Inkjet printing= Inkjet printing is used for surface filling or image decoration.Foodjet (2012). Foodjet. Available at: http://foodjet.nl/. Accessed Dec 2019 By utilizing gravity, edible food ink is dropped onto the surface of the food, typically a cookie, cake, or other candy. This is a non-contact method, hence the printhead does not touch the food protecting the food from contamination during image filling. The ink droplets may consist of a broad range of colors allowing users to create unique and individualized food images.Pallottino, F., Hakola, L., Costa, C., Antonucci, F., Figorilli, S., Seisto, A., & Menesatti, P. (2016). Printing on food or food printing: a review. Food and Bioprocess Technology, 9(5), 725-733. An issue with inkjet printing is the food materials being incompatible with the ink resulting in no image or high image distortion.Vancauwenberghe, V., Katalagarianakis, L., Wang, Z., Meerts, M., Hertog, M., Verboven, P., ... & Nicolaï, B. (2017). Pectin based food-ink formulations for 3-D printing of customizable porous food simulants. Innovative food science & emerging technologies, 42, 138-150. Inkjet printers can be purchased for household or commercial use, and industrial printers are suitable for mass production. = Multi-printhead and multi-material = In multi-printhead and multi-material printing, multiple ingredients are printed at the same time or in succession.Lipton, J., Arnold, D., Nigl, F., Lopez, N., Cohen, D. L., Norén, N., & Lipson, H. (2010, August). Multi-material food printing with complex internal structure suitable for conventional post- processing. In Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium (pp. 809-815). There are different ways to support multi-material printing. In one instance, multiple printheads are used to print multiple materials/ingredients, as this can speed up production, efficiency, and lead to interesting design patterns. In another instance, there is one printhead, and when a different ingredient is required, the printer exchanges the material being printed.Foodini (2014). Foodini. Available at https://www.naturalmachines.com/foodini Accessed Dec 2019 Multiple materials/ingredients equates to a more diverse range of meals available to print, a broader nutritional range, and is quite common for food printers.  Post-processing  In the post-processing phase, printed food may require additional steps before consumption. This includes processing activities such as baking, frying, cleaning, etc. This phase can be one of the most critical to 3D printed food, as the printed food needs to be safe for consumption. An additional concern in post processing is the deformation of the printed food due to the strain of these additional processes. Current methods involve trial and error. That is, combining food additives with the materials/ingredients to improve the integrity of complex structures and to ensure the printed structure retains its shape. Additives such as transglutaminase and hydrocolloids have been added to ingredients in order to help retain the printed shape while printing and after cooking. Additionally, recent research has produced a visual simulation for baking breads, cookies, pancakes and similar materials that consist of dough or batter (mixtures of water, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and leavening agents).Ding, M., Han, X., Wang, S., Gast, T. F., & Teran, J. M. (2019). A thermomechanical material point method for baking and cooking. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(6), 192. By adjusting certain parameters in the simulation, it shows the realistic effect that baking will have on the food. With further research and development, a visual simulation of 3D printed foods being cooked could predict what is vulnerable to deformation.  Applications   Personal nutrition  Personalized dietary requirements for an individual's nutritional needs has been linked to the prevention of diseases.Sarwar, M. H., Sarwar, M. F., Khalid, M. T., & Sarwar, M. (2015). Effects of eating the balance food and diet to protect human health and prevent diseases. American Journal of Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing, 1(3), 99-104. Chicago As such, eating nutritious food is paramount to living a healthy life. 3D printed food can provide the control necessary to put a custom amount of protein, sugar, vitamins, and minerals into the foods we consume.Severini, C., & Derossi, A. (2016). Could the 3D printing technology be a useful strategy to obtain customized nutrition?. Journal of clinical gastroenterology, 50(2), 175-178. Another area in customized food, is elderly nutrition. The elderly sometimes cannot swallow foods, and as such require a softer pallet.Kimura, Y., Ogawa, H., Yoshihara, A., Yamaga, T., Takiguchi, T., Wada, T., ... & Fujisawa, M. (2013). Evaluation of chewing ability and its relationship with activities of daily living, depression, cognitive status and food intake in the community‐dwelling elderly. Geriatrics & gerontology international, 13(3), 718-725. However, these foods are often unappealing causing some individuals not to eat what their bodies' nutritional needs require.Miura, H., Miura, K., Mizugai, H., Arai, Y., Umenai, T., & Isogai, E. (2000). Chewing ability and quality of life among the elderly residing in a rural community in Japan. Journal of oral rehabilitation, 27(8), 731-734. 3D printed food can provide a soft and aesthetically pleasing food in which the elderly can consume their bodies' dietary requirements.Serizawa, R., Shitara, M., Gong, J., Makino, M., Kabir, M. H., & Furukawa, H. (2014, March). 3D jet printer of edible gels for food creation. In Behavior and Mechanics of Multifunctional Materials and Composites 2014 (Vol. 9058, p. 90580A). International Society for Optics and Photonics. In October 2019, startup company Nourished 3D prints personalized nutritional gummies from 28 different vitamins. Individuals take a survey, then based on their answers, a personalized nutritional gummy is printed for that individual.  Sustainability and solution for hunger  The cost of raising 1kg of cricket meat compared to 1kg of cow meat As the world's population continues to grow, experts believe that current food supplies will not be able to supply the population.Alexandratos, N. (2005). Countries with rapid population growth and resource constraints: issues of food, agriculture, and development. Population and development Review, 31(2), 237-258. Thus, a sustainable food source is critical. Studies have shown that entomophagy, the consumption of insects, has the potential to sustain a growing population.Van Huis, A. (2013). Potential of insects as food and feed in assuring food security. Annual review of entomology, 58, 563-583. Insects such as crickets require less feed, less water, and provide around the same amount of protein that chickens, cows, and pigs do. Crickets can be ground into a protein flour. In one study,Soares, S., & Forkes, A. (2014). Insects Au gratin-an investigation into the experiences of developing a 3D printer that uses insect protein based flour as a building medium for the production of sustainable food. In DS 78: Proceedings of the 16th International conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (E&PDE14;), Design Education and Human Technology Relations, University of Twente, The Netherlands, 04-05.09. 2014 (pp. 426-431). researchers provide an overview of the process of 3D printing insect flour into foods that do not resemble insects; thus, keeping the nutritional value of the insect intact.  Space exploration  As humans begin venturing into space for a longer time, the nutritional requirements for maintaining crew health is critical.Smith, S. M., Zwart, S. R., Block, G., Rice, B. L., & Davis-Street, J. E. (2005). The nutritional status of astronauts is altered after long-term space flight aboard the International Space Station. The Journal of nutrition, 135(3), 437-443. Currently NASA is exploring ways of integrating 3D printing food into space in order to sustain the crew's dietary requirements.Leach, N. (2014). 3D printing in space. Architectural Design, 84(6), 108-113.Chicago The vision is to 3D print powdered food layers that have a shelf life of 30 years instead of using traditional freeze dried food that have a shelf life of 5 years. In addition to dietary requirements, 3D printing food in space could provide a morale boost, as the astronauts would be able to design custom meals that are aesthetically pleasing.Sun, J., Peng, Z., Yan, L., Fuh, J. Y., & Hong, G. S. (2015). 3D food printing—An innovative way of mass customization in food fabrication. International Journal of Bioprinting, 1(1), 27-38. In September 2019, Russian cosmonauts, along with Israeli startup Aleph Farms, grew meat from cow cells, then 3D printed the cells into steaks.  Meat bioprinting  Livestock farming is one of the top contributors to deforestation, land degradation, water pollution and desertification. Among other reasons, this has led to the new promising technology of meat bioprinting. One alternative to livestock farming is cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat. Cultured meat is produced by taking a small biopsy from animals, extracting the myosatellite cells and adding growth serum to multiply the cells. The resulting product is then used as a material for bioprinting meat. The post- processing phase, among other steps, includes adding flavour, vitamins and iron to the product. Yet another alternative is printing a meat analogue. Novameat, a Spanish startup has been able to print a plant-based steak and mimic the texture and appearance of real meat.  Creative food design  Chef storytelling: Alvar Aalto Vase Food presentation and food appearance customization for individuals is a big trend in the food industry. So far food customization and creative designs have required hand-made skills, which results in low production rate and high cost. 3D food printing can overcome this problem by providing the necessary tools for creative food design even for home users. 3D food printing has enabled some intricate designs which cannot be accomplished with traditional food manufacturing. Brand logos, text, signatures, pictures can now be printed on some food products like pastries and coffee. Complex geometric shapes have also been printed, mainly using sugar. With 3D printing, chefs can now turn their visual inspirations into signature culinary creations. Another benefit is being able to print nutritious meals in shapes that appeal to children.  Reduced food waste  Worldwide, one third of the total food produced for consumption, around 1.6 billion tons per year, goes to waste. Food waste happens during processing, distribution and consumption. 3D food printing is a very promising way of reducing food waste during the phase of consumption, by utilizing food products like meat off-cuts, distorted fruits and vegetables, sea food by- products and perishables. These products can be processed in a suitable form for printing. Upprinting Food, a Dutch startup, has been blending and combining different ingredients from food waste to create purees which are then used as materials for 3D printing. Chefs are also creating different dishes from leftover food using 3D food printers.  Challenges   Structure  Unlike traditionally prepared food, the variety of food that can be manufactured using 3D printing is limited by the physical characteristics of the materials. Food materials are generally much softer than the weakest plastic used in 3D printing, making the printed structures very fragile. So far, most studies use trial and error as an approach to overcoming this challenge, but scientists are working on developing new methods that are able to predict the behavior of different materials during the printing process. These methods are developed by analyzing the rheological properties of the materials and their relation to the printing stability.  Design  When designing a 3D model for a food product, the physical and geometrical limitations of the printing materials should be taken into account. This makes the designing process a very complex task and so far there is no available software that accounts for that. Building such software is also a complex task due to the vast variety of food materials. Considering that personal users who incorporate 3D food printing in their kitchens represent a significant part of the overall users, the design of the software interface adds to the complexity. The interface of such software should be simple and have high usability while still providing enough features and customization options for the user without causing cognitive overload.  Speed  The current speed of 3D printing food could be sufficient for home use, but the process is very slow for mass production. Simple designs take 1 to 2 minutes, detailed designs take 3 to 7 minutes, and more intricate designs take even longer. The speed of printing food is tightly correlated to the rheological properties of the materials. Research shows that high printing speed results in low fidelity samples due to the dragging effect, while very low speed causes instability in material deposition. In order for 3D food printing to find its way to the food industry, the printing speed needs improvement or the cost of such technology should be affordable enough for companies to operate several printers.  Multi-material printing  The color, flavor and texture of food are of crucial importance when fabricating an edible product, thus in most cases it is required that a food printer supports multi-material printing. The current available 3D food printers are limited to using a few different materials due to the challenge of developing multiple extruder capabilities. This limits the variety of food products that can be 3D printed, leaving out complex dishes that require a lot of different materials.  Safety  When 3D printing food, the safety is very crucial. A food printer must ensure safety along the entire path taken by the food material. Due to the possibility of food getting stuck somewhere along the path, bacteria accumulation is a major concern. Microbial stability is a crucial parameter of the quality of the printed food, thus it needs to be addressed both during the design of the printer and during the printing process. On the other hand, the materials that come into contact with the food may not be as significant of a concern since high quality printers use stainless steel and BPA-free materials.  Copyright  Existing food products in the market such as chocolates in various shapes could easily be scanned and the obtained 3D models could be used to replicate those products. These 3D models could then be disseminated via Internet leading to copyright infringement. There are laws regulating copyright issues but it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to cover all aspects of a field like 3D food printing.

He was a former aid for Lee Hoi-chang in 2007 presidential election, as well as an MP candidate of the Party for Freedom and Advancement in 2008 election. He is now a member of the right-wing Future Korea Party.  Education and early career  Born in Seoul, Kim was educated from Seoul Science High School and has a degree of industrial engineering from KAIST. He suffered a fibromyalgia, making him to get treatment for 10 years and be suspended from the national service. Following his graduation, Kim worked as a mathematics teacher in Daechi-dong, as well as writing some books and offering online lectures on YouTube. He has been operating an online tuition community on Naver.  Political career  Kim was an online aid for Lee Hoi-chang, a sole independent candidate supported by the minor Party for National Centre received 15.1% and came to 3rd in 2007 presidential election. He subsequently joined Party for Freedom and Advancement (PFA) formed by Lee and ran as the party's candidate for Gwangjin District 1st constituency in 2008 election but lost to Kwon Taek-ki of the ruling Grand National Party (then Liberty Korea Party). During this time, he promised to send all children of the district to Seoul National University. In 2012 election, he switched to Yuseong District but defeated by Song Seok-chan during the PFA preselection. The party faced a huge defeat in the election, causing it to be merged into the ruling Saenuri Party (now Liberty Korea Party; LKP). He automatically became a member of the Saenuri, but did not active in politics till returned as an aid for Kim Moon- soo, the LKP candidate for Seoul mayorship in 2018 local elections. Following the LKP's serious defeat in the local elections, its President Hong Joon-pyo stood his position down, led them to hold a snap leadership election in February 2019. Kim ran as a candidate for the Youth Chief but defeated by Shin Bo-ra. On 2 May, he shaved his hair along with the other LKP MPs as a part of protest boycotting the electoral reform of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea.  Ideology  Kim mentioned that Koreans are the \\"greatest race in the earth\\", as well as urging the deportation of all illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees. While some newspapers describe his political views as far-right, he himself rejected the far-right label, adding that \\"the facts are now called as far-right hate speeches\\". He also holds a sceptical view towards centrism, citing that centrism is \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"impossible\\". He compared the centrist President Moon Jae-in to the far-left Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.  Controversy  On 18 February 2019, Kim provoked a controversy while saying \\"What the hell is wrong with the President? I can't recognise the moron as our leader.\\" during the LKP leadership election speech, which he targeted the President Moon Jae-in.

She is best known for short stories exploring the effects of economic and social changes, particularly on women, young people, and migrant workers. Works Her fiction has focused on the social effects of rapid political and economic changes, particularly as they affect women and young people. Her short story “My Sister” (first published in Khmer in 1995, and in English translation in 2002), describes a young woman who moves from a rural village to the city and finds work as a “bar girl”, sending her earnings home to help support the education of her younger siblings. The narrator of the story, the woman's younger brother, chastises her for engaging in sex work, but he is scolded by his aunt for ingratitude. The story explores the experience of migrant workers and the practice of remittance, by which rural migrants to urban centres send their wages back to their home village, improving the financial situation of their family but sometimes creating tensions or resentment. Her story “Why?” describes a boy’s decision to turn to robbery to support his family and its consequences. In translation, her short stories have appeared in anthologies of Southeast Asian and Cambodian fiction, and have been assigned as university set texts. Her nonfiction work includes the book Tumroam Klay Chea Neak Nipunth (“Before becoming a writer\\"), a guide for aspiring Khmer authors. Career Mey began publishing as a teenager in 1993, when her short fiction appeared in Rasmei Kampuchia Daily, Cambodia’s most widely circulated daily newspaper, and in the popular magazine Procheaprai. She was one of the first published Khmer writers to come from the \\"new generation\\", i.e. those who did not personally remember the regime of Pol Pot. She has also worked in television broadcasting, and for the Women’s Media Centre of Cambodia, an NGO that works to improve the participation and representation of women in mainstream Khmer media.

It aired as a live television special episode of MLW's television program Fusion on beIN Sports. Fifteen matches were contested on the card, with three matches airing live while the other matches being taped for future episodes of Fusion. On the live broadcast of Fury Road, Teddy Hart successfully defended the World Middleweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc in the main event. On the undercard, Alexander Hammerstone defeated Brian Pillman Jr. in the finals of a four-man tournament to become the inaugural National Openweight Champion and Gringo Loco defeated Myron Reed in a middleweight match. Production Background On February 25, 2019, MLW.com announced that Major League Wrestling would be holding its first-ever event in Wisconsin on June 1. It was announced that Fury Road would take place at the Waukesha County Expo Center in Waukesha, Wisconsin. MLW previously held an event Fury Road as a television taping for Fusion in 2018. However, on May 14, MLW announced that the 2019 edition of Fury Road would be a live television special to be aired on beIN Sports. Storylines Teddy Hart defended the MLW World Middleweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc in the main event of Fury Road. The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. On April 18, 2019, MLW.com announced that MLW was introducing a new title called the National Openweight Championship. It was announced that a four-man tournament would take place to determine the inaugural champion and the tournament final would take place at Fury Road. Alexander Hammerstone defeated Gringo Loco in the first semi-final on the May 11 episode of Fusion and Brian Pillman Jr. defeated Rich Swann in the second semi-final on the May 18 episode of Fusion, thus setting up the tournament final between Pillman and Hammerstone to crown the inaugural champion at Fury Road, which would also continue the ongoing feud between The Hart Foundation and The Dynasty, Pillman and Hammerstone's respective stables. On May 13, it was announced that Teddy Hart would defend the World Middleweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc at Fury Road. On May 20, it was announced that Rey Horus would take on Myron Reed in a middleweight match at Fury Road. Event Alexander Hammerstone won a four-man tournament to become the inaugural National Openweight Champion at Fury Road. Preliminary matches The event opened with a middleweight match between Gringo Loco and Myron Reed. Reed grabbed the ropes for leverage to pin Loco but the referee stopped the pinfall count due to illegal activity which led to Reed arguing with the referee. The distraction allowed Loco to hit a kneeling reverse piledriver to Reed for the win. Reed then hit Loco with brass knuckles after the match. Next, the tournament final to crown the inaugural National Openweight Champion took place between Brian Pillman Jr. and Alexander Hammerstone. Hammerstone moved out of the way of a diving splash by Pillman and nailed a Nightmare Pendulum for the win thus becoming the first-ever National Openweight Champion. After the match, Contra Unit attacked the World Heavyweight Champion Tom Lawlor in the parking lot and kidnapped him and then cut off his hair. Main event match In the main event, Teddy Hart defended the World Middleweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc. Hart avoided an Acid Rainmaker by Havoc and nailed a Canadian Destroyer to Havoc which was followed by a hammerlock DDT for the win to retain the title. After the match, The Dynasty attacked Hart but Hart Foundation made the save.

Early life   Exodus of the Bajuta  In a decisive battle that took place between 1836-1851 located in the vicinity of Ngorongoro crater, the Datooga were defeated and expelled from the area by the Maasai.Mulder, M.B., Sieff, D. & Merus, M. (1989). \\"Disturbed ancestors: Datoga history in the Ngorongoro Crater.\\" Swara, 12(2), 32–35 This led the father of Saigilo, named Magena, and his tribal group, termed Bajuta, to withdraw to Sukumaland.Wada, S. (1975). Political history of Mbulu district: Power struggles and territorial grouping of medicine men. Kyoto University African Studies, 9, p. 59. However, they were once again attacked by Maasai raiders, and resettled in Mashonghoda, near Tabora in Nyamwezi land.Tomikawa, M. (1979).

Following the death of Magena, the Bajuta chose Saigilo to succeed him as the leader of the tribe.Wada, S. (1975). Political history of Mbulu district: Power struggles and territorial grouping of medicine men. Kyoto University African Studies, 9, p.59.  Leader of the Bajuta   Migrations  Fearing continued attacks from the Masai, Saigilo migrated with the rest of the Bajuta northwards to Raho, in the Gummenti basin. It is believed that Saigilo and his followers stayed there for some time before migrating southeast, finally settling in Maiba near Mbulu, around 1890 or later.Tomikawa, M. (1979). The migrations and inter-tribal relations of the pastoral Datoga. Senri Ethnological Studies, 3, p. 23.Thornton, R. J. (1980). Space, time, and culture among the Iraqw of Tanzania. New York, NY: Academic Press, Inc., p. 78 The area surrounding Mbulu was already populated with members of the Iraqw tribe.  Datooga-Iraqw interactions  Relations between the Iraqw and the Datooga were amicable and marked by cooperation, due to the pastoral nature of both tribes. The Iraqw would participate in the cattle-breeding ceremonies of the Datooga, and Saigilo, as chief medicine man of the Bajuta, was thought to have the ability to produce medications that would increase the fertility of the cattle, which were traded extensively among the Iraqw.Wada, S. (1975). Political history of Mbulu district: Power struggles and territorial grouping of medicine men. Kyoto University African Studies, 9, p. 60. In addition, intermarriage between the Datoga and Iraqw was commonplace, as a result of similar cultural and economic orders and Iraqw exogamic traditions.Mous, M.P.G.M. (1992). \\"A grammar of Iraqw.\\" (Doctoral Dissertation), p. 2. The close relations of the Iraqw and the Datoga are demonstrated by the Iraqw concept of homoo, a negative term used to generally describe members of another ethnic group; however, the Datooga were never referred to by this term, indicating the significant bond between the two groups.Rekdal, O. B. & Blystad, A. (1999). ‘We are as sheep & goats: Iraqw & Datooga discourses on fortune, failure, & the future. In D.M. Anderson & V. Broch-Due (Eds.), The poor are not us: Poverty & pastoralism in Eastern Africa. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, p. 129.  Prophecies  Saigilo was renowned for his abilities in divination, with his skills manifesting themselves well before his ascension to tribal chief.Jellicoe, M., Sima, V., & Sombi, J. (1967). \\"The shrine in the desert.\\" Transition, (34), p. 43. It is said that prior to the exodus from Ngorongoro crater to Nyamwezi land, Saigilo had warned the tribe thrice to flee until the encroachment of the Maasai, famine, and disease finally forced them to withdraw and begin their aforementioned exodus.Shetler, J.B. (2007). Imagining Serengeti: A history of landscape memory in Tanzania from earliest time to the Present. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, p. 146. The Arimi, a neighboring tribe, frequently consulted Saigilo. In a dream, Saigilo allegedly destroyed a barrier he had erected between the people of his tribe and the coast, hoping that assistance in repelling the Maasai would come from the east in the form of the ‘red men.’ The ‘red men’ were said to be among the first settlers of Tanganyika, appeared to be of European descent, and whose disappearance would bring about famine and destruction. The disappearance of the ‘red men’ are said to be compelled by Murungu, a Bantu creator deity, whenever the universe becomes unbalanced. Saigilo said that ‘red men without toes’ should be welcomed as they would bring great prosperity. The arrival of German colonial forces was heralded as the return of the ‘red men,’ due to their European features and their boots, which made it appear as if they lacked toes.Jellicoe, M., Sima, V., & Sombi, J. (1967). \\"The shrine in the desert.\\" Transition, (34), p. 44. However, the Germans would eventually defile Tita, the shrine to Murungu, and persecute the tribes in the surrounding area. Saigilo's prophecies still remain relevant, with his predictions both seemingly manifesting and defining Tanzanian society today. At the end of the 19th century, Saigilo predicted extensive ecological change in Iraqw land, claiming that bushland and trees of non-local origin would dominate the landscape and that one would no longer have to travel far for firewood.Manger, L. (2000). \\"East African pastoralism and underdevelopment: An introduction.\\" In L. Manger, J. Helland, B. Tache, A. Tolera, A. Ghaffar, M. Ahmed, and S. Shalazi (Eds.), Pastoralists and Environment: Experiences from the Greater Horn of Africa (pp. 2-10). Curiously, this is exactly the case today, with Iraqw land being populated with eucalyptus and black wattle, flora typically native to Australia. This was the result of reforestation campaigns undertaken by the British colonial regime in the mid-20th century. Recent efforts to introduce sex education and safe sex practices to the Datooga have been meet with disapproval, partly due to one of Saigilo's prophecies.Blystad, A. (2004). \\"On HIV, sex and respect: Local-global discourse encounters among the Datoga of Tanzania.\\" African Sociological Review, 8(1), p. 47. Attempts to promote monogamy and the use of condoms are seen as violations of traditional Datooga sexual and marriage practices, with the violation of the latter believed to lead to sexual degeneracy. Saigilo claimed that once the Datooga start to ignore “respectful coupling,” or in other words, traditional sexual behavior, this would thereby lead to sexual promiscuity and would be “the end [of the Datooga people].”Blystad, A. (2004). \\"On HIV, sex and respect: Local- global discourse encounters among the Datoga of Tanzania.\\" African Sociological Review, 8(1), p. 48. The credence the Datoga give to this apocalyptic prophecy continues to shape current sexual practice and perceptions.Blystad, A. (2004). \\"On HIV, sex and respect: Local-global discourse encounters among the Datoga of Tanzania.\\" African Sociological Review, 8(1), p. 54.  Later life and death  At some point during his establishment near Mbulu, Saigilo's homestead was subject to a raid by the Maasai, and Saigilo was injured as a result.Thornton, R. J. (1980). Space, time, and culture among the Iraqw of Tanzania. New York, NY: Academic Press, Inc., p. 123. This attack was believed to have been perpetrated by Be’a, a Manda medicine man who allegedly used magic to compel the raid.Thornton, R. J. (1980).

Succession of leadership and future of the Datoga  Saigilo's son by his senior wife, Gidamowsa, succeeded Saigilo as leader of the Bajuta and migrated with the members of his tribe to Dongobesh, the ancestral home of the Gisamijanga.Wada, S.

In 1910, Gidamowsa, along with eleven medicine men, including elders of the Daremngajega clan and an elder of the Mbulu Iraqw , were accused of vandalizing weapons belonging to German colonial forces.Wada, S.

Space, time, and culture among the Iraqw of Tanzania.

(1979). The migrations and inter-tribal relations of the pastoral Datoga. Senri Ethnological Studies, 3, p. 24 The executions led to waning Datooga influence in the region as a result of the reluctance of Datooga medicine men to continue to perform magical acts and religious ceremonies, which thereby led to an increase in Iraqw influence. Later interactions between the Datoga and colonists were punctuated by similar instances of persecution, including execution, arbitrary imprisonment, and property confiscation and taxation.Rekdal, O.

He is best known for his graphic work for Editoriale Corno and for Sergio Bonelli Editore, for which he created the graphics of famous magazines such as Kriminal and Dylan Dog. The most famous art director in the world of Italian comics is considered by specialized critics.  Biography  Graduated at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera, after having managed his own advertising studio for some years, he moved to publishing, collaborating first with Editrice Universo and then, from 1965, with Editoriale Corno, to take care of the graphics of the publications creating the logos of Kriminal, Satanik, Maschera Nera, Gesebel, Eureka, Alan Ford and many others as well as illustrating some of their covers and also making some drawings and inks for the boards; it also takes care of the graphics of the titles of the super-heroes Marvel Comics. After having made some stories of Maschera Nera, he goes to Kriminal and Satanik, two characters from the italian black genre created by Max Bunker, for whom he creates the logos of the titles and also designs some episodes, as well as making hundreds of covers; he later worked as a draftsman and inker also for other Bunker characters like Gesebel and Alan Ford - and he will also make the first ten covers. As a curator he also deals with the layout of the many publications of the publisher and also produces his own comic book series, Thomas, a series of humorous postcards, some graphic works for magazines, encyclopedias and scientific publications. The relationship with Corno was interrupted in 1975 when he entered as artistic director at Sergio Bonelli Editore where he was asked to deal with both the technical and the more creative part concerning general graphics, lettering, covers and related titles and brands as well as the managing contacts with first-time designers. In the seventies he also collaborated with Il Giornalino. In the eighties he made an episode of the comic book series Collana Rodeo, The Lost Spaceship, the only science fiction story in the story of the series. As a graphic designer, he realizes the titles of all the Bonelli publications that began after his arrival, such as Ken Parker, Mister No, Martin Mystère, Dylan Dog, Nick Raider, Nathan Never and many others that stand out for their never before seen graphic elegance for an italian comic series.

In order to carry out Luise Goldmann's task, King Alfonso XIII constituted the Fastenrath Prize Foundation, on May 12, 1909, dependent on the Royal House, with a founding capital of 70,000 pts., assigning to the Spanish Royal Academy the administration of the foundation, and therefore, the faculty to submit to the monarch the proposals for the awarding of said prizes, after discussion and voting, being the monarch the one who would ultimately grant them. In June 1935, the Fundación Premio Fastenrath became dependent on the Ministry of Public Education and Fine Arts and in September 1935 it was declared \\"a private charity\\", under the protectorate of the Government of the Republic, and administrated by the then Spanish Academy. In a similar way to the Fastenrath Prize Foundation, the Royal Spanish Academy has been administering, on the basis of legacies instituted by individuals or private funds, a series of foundations with similar prize objectives. In mid-November 2003, it merged eleven of its dependent foundations, one of which is the \\"Fundación Premio Fastenrath\\", to form the Fundación Premios Real Academia Española. Organization The prize was awarded annually. It was always awarded to a work, in the Spanish language and carried out by writers of Spanish nationality, of literary or scientific creation, with the requirement that it had been published previously. Initially, the work submitted should have been published in the same year as the competition, but when it was split up and awarded in successive rounds in various forms, up to five, the number of years preceding publication also changed, so that all published works had the same opportunity to be submitted and awarded, regardless of the form of the award. In the case of the plays, in the first specific calls for entries, they had to have been premiered beforehand, a requirement that was later changed. Therefore, for the \\"Fastenrath Prize\\", the last call was for the \\"Fastenrath Prize 2002\\", awarded in 2003. The economic amount of the prize came from the income of the instituted legacy, and varied over time, from 2,000 pts. (1909-1946), 4,000 pts (1947-?), 8,000 pts. (1955, 1958), 5,000 pts. (1963), 6,000 pts (1956-1957, 1959-1962, 1964-1991), 500,000 pts (1992-1998), to 2,000,000 pts or the equivalent of 12,020 € (1999-2002). It can be seen that the maintenance of the same economic endowment without any increase, twice over extremely long periods of up to thirty-five years, gave the prize during those years a value more symbolic and testimonial than real, and contributed only because it was considered the dean of the prizes for writers in the Spanish language.

La idea de España en el siglo XIX  Essay }  Premi Fastenrath (1909-1983)  History and organization The Fastenrath couple's connection with the Barcelona Floral Games (\\"Jocs Florals de Barcelona\\") was close and long-lasting. Fastenrath's passion for the Hispanic world and its literature led him to move some of the literary traditions of Hispanic culture, and particularly Catalan culture, to Cologne, the German city where he lived. Thus, in 1898, he established in Cologne some floral games (1898-1914), in imitation of the Barcelona Floral Games (1859- ), which he personally directed until his death and his widow continued, until her subsequent death in 1914. Luise Goldmann, who always maintained her husband's interests and memory, had already been appointed Queen of the Barcelona Floral Games in 1889. So, in order to carry out Luisa Goldmann's task, Barcelona City Council arranged for the creation of the Premi Fastenrath, with the income from municipal debt securities acquired with the founding capital provided, and assigned the administration and organisation of the prizes to the Consistori dels Jocs Florals de Barcelona, in accordance with regulations approved by the plenary session of the municipal corporation in November 1908. The annual calls were always made by awarding a single prize, which rotated in triennial cycles between three modalities, novel, poetry and dramatic work. The first call for entries for the \\"Premi Fastenrath\\" was in 1909, and it remained in force until 1936, during the entire period in which the Barcelona Floral Games were held, before they were interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. During the period 1941-1977, in which the celebrations of the Catalan language were suspended by the municipal institutions, and the floral games were held in Barcelona in a private way, the \\"Premi Fastenrath\\" was called by the organization of the \\"Jocs Florals de la Llengua Catalana\\", which kept the annual celebrations in an itinerant way in different cities of the world. In this period the prize money will be given away in various currencies depending on the edition, such as Mexican pesos or dollars. Once the \\"Jocs Florals de Barcelona\\" were officially reinstated by the Barcelona City Council, during a first stage (1978-1983) the inherited prize system was maintained. Later, in a second stage (1984-2005), the system will be reduced and only the three awards with which the Barcelona Floral Games began in 1859 will be maintained, only the exclusively poetic awards (\\"Englantina\\", \\"Viola\\" and \\"Flor natural\\"), so the \\"Premi Fastenrath\\" will disappear; and from 2006, only one poetry award will be granted, the \\"Premi de Poesia Jocs Florals de Barcelona\\".

Overview The Hida ruins in the city of Myōkō are located in a flat area on a hillside ridge with an elevation of approximately 40 meters, on the southwestern edge of the Kubiki Plain, and are divided into three areas. The foundations of 47 pit dwellings were discovered, with each dwelling having a diameter of between eight and ten meters for the larger, or 2 meters for the smaller on the north slopes of Mount Momoko, clustered into three groups. They attracted scholarly attention as they appear to have been abandoned at the end of the Yayoi period or start of the Kofun period, were excavated by the University of Tokyo from 1955–1958. In 2005, the Fukiage ruins in the city of Jōetsu was added to the National Historic site designation. This was a village ruin from the middle Yayoi period, with a large scale workshop for making jadeite balls, which were used as pestles for grinding. The number of jadeite balls excavated is one of the largest in Japan. In addition, numerous stone knives and copper products that are rare in this area have also been discovered. Kamabuta ruins was also a large village from the end of the Yayoi period to the beginning of the Kofun period. Many earthenware shards from distant areas, such as Omi to the west and the Kanto region to the east have been found. By its proximity to a river, it is thought that the Kamabuta settlement was a trading settlement. It is about a 10-minute drive from Arai Station on the JR Shinetsu Main Line to the Hida Ruins.

They were the first elections in the territory held under universal suffrage. Voter turnout among enrolled voters was 65%.NG Elections Pacific Islands Monthly, April 1964, p129 Background In March 1962 the Papua New Guinea Select Committee on Political Development was set up to identify future amendments to political arrangements in the territory. Following the visit of a United Nations mission that proposed a 100-member legislature, the committee toured the territory in September and October, taking evidence from over 450 residents. An interim report was presented to the Legislative Council in October, and subsequently approved by the Australian government. The 37-member Legislative Council (which had only twelve elected members) was replaced with a 64-member House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea. The new legislature had 10 official members (civil servants) and 54 elected members, of which 10 were elected from reserved constituencies in which only Europeans (who numbered around 25,000 of the total population of around two million) could be candidates; Europeans could also run in the non-reserved constituencies.Big Increase In P-NG Council Planned As Next Step Towards Self-Government Pacific Islands Monthly, November 1962, p5 Voters cast two votes; one for a general constituency candidate and one for a reserved constituency candidate.Desks Cleared for NG Common Roll and 64-Man Assembly Pacific Islands Monthly, June 1963, p15 The voting age was set at 21.P-NG Elections, 1964: They're Preparing For The Territory's Greatest Extravaganza Pacific Islands Monthly, October 1963, pp19–23 The electoral roll was created over several months in 1963, with field staff of the Native Affairs Department visiting over 12,000 villages and recording the names of all adults in the territory, except in an area of 6,000 square miles that were classed as \\"restricted\\" due to the likelihood of being attacked by the inhabitants.P-NG Set For Biggest Pacific Election Pacific Islands Monthly, January 1964, p12 A total of 1,029,192 voters were registered.Full Details Of The Big New Guinea Elections Pacific Islands Monthly, May 1964, p113 Candidates were required to have lived in their constituency for at least 12 months, and to have a home there.P-NG LegCo Makes Way For New House Of Assembly Pacific Islands Monthly, October 1963, p15 A preferential voting system was used, with candidates required to gain a majority to be elected.New Polls Could Be Forced In 35 Electorates Pacific Islands Monthly, April 1964, p11 Campaign A total of 299 candidates contested the 54 seats, of which 238 were indigenous and 61 Europeans; 31 of the Europeans contested the 10 reserved seats and 30 ran in the general constituencies.300 Candidates for P-NG's First All-In Election Pacific Islands Monthly, February 1964, pp9–10 One seat – North Markham Reserved – had only one candidate (Horrie Niall), who was elected unopposed. Ten of the twelve MLCs elected in 1961 ran for re- election, with only John Chipper and Paul Mason not standing. Three of the candidates for the general constituencies were former or present cargo cult leaders, Francis Hagai, Paliau Maloat and Yali. Although Yali ran in the Rai Coast constituency, numerous voters in the neighbouring Madang constituency attempted to vote for him, submitting blank votes after being told he was not on their ballot.A Month Of Variety In New Guinea's Big Election Extravaganza Pacific Islands Monthly, March 1964, pp9–10 Results Of the 44 open constituencies, 38 were won by indigenous candidates and six by Europeans.Surprise To The Last In P-NG Election Pacific Islands Monthly, May 1964, p9 35 of the 38 indigenous members were new to the legislature, with only Nicholas Brokam, John Guise and Pita Simogun having previously been members of the Legislative Council.

It is a remarkably well preserved two-month-old male puppy with fur and whiskers remaining. The animal has been determined to be 18,000 years old. DNA sequencing has been unable to identify the animal as either a dog or a wolf. The specimen was named Dogor by scientists. The word (Cyrillic: Догор) means \\"friend\\" in the local Yakut language and also hints at the question of whether the animal is a \\"dog or wolf\\".  Description  Dogor was found in the permafrost in Belaya Gora (Sakha Republic) in eastern Siberia in summer 2018. It is the body of a two-month-old male canine puppy. The body is remarkably well preserved, and its fur, whiskers, nose and teeth remain intact. A part of its rib bone was analysed by radiocarbon dating, which placed it at 18,000 years old.  Identification  Due to the animal's age, it is possible that it represents an evolutionary link between dogs and wolves. Scientists continue to debate the exact point at which dogs were first domesticated, but if Dogor is determined to be a dog, it would be the oldest ever discovered. Dogor has, therefore, been described as coming from \\"a very interesting time in terms of wolf and dog evolution\\", possibly from around the time of the first domestication of dogs. DNA sequencing is usually sufficient to distinguish between dogs and wolves; however, even after a large amount of analysis, it has not been possible to determine to which species Dogor belongs. It is possible that Dogor represents a common ancestor of both species. Further DNA sequencing is planned, and this may provide more insight.

Based on the most commonly deployed topology of systems within a data center, East-West traffic indicates flow of data among devices within a specific data center. The other direction of traffic flow is North-south traffic, which typically indicates data flow that either enters/leaves the data center from/to a system physically residing outside the data center. As a result of virtualization, private cloud, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure adoption, east-west traffic volumes have increased. Today many virtual functions including virtual firewalls, load balancers and other software defined networking (SDN) perform various functions and services that previously ran on physical hardware. As these components relay data to each other, they increase traffic on the network, which can increase latency and cause network congestion. As disaggregated compute and storage becomes popular, east-west traffic volumes will increase. Traditionally, many data centers today deploy their systems using a fat-tree or CLOS topology. In this topology, servers and appliances that host applications are deployed within the racks. There is a top of the rack (ToR) switch (also called as leaf) that connects the systems within the rack as well as to other switches called Spine switches. The Spine switches connect ToRs as well as provide connectivity to other Spine switches through another layer of Switch. Applications communicate with other applications running on other systems for typical services, such as accessing an asset stored in another device, gathering results from a micro- service task(s) executed on other systems, or simply getting a status update from management software.

Life  Born in 1917 in the town of Třebechovice, in present day Czech Republic, she grew up with her parents and two brothers and sisters. They were raised Jewish but not religious. After attending a boarding grammar school, she studied law at Prague University. As the Nazis took control in 1939, they closed universities and Bergman got a job as a hatmaker. She married Bernd Nathan who was an architect who earned an Iron Cross during the first world war. He previously came to Prague from Germany in an attempt to escape Nazi control. As restrictions grew they were forced to wear a yellow badge. In November 1941, they were ordered to a warehouse near Holesovice station in Prague. Anka and Bernd were separated, and Anka was sent to Theresienstadt, which at the time was an old barracks transformed into a Nazi Ghetto. She had a job in a provisions store to help feed the fifteen members of her extended family transported to the same ghetto. After some time Anka was able to find her husband, and have a baby. The Gestapo forced her to sign a document that if her son was born it would be killed, but he died at two months old to pneumonia. In September 1944 Bernd was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Anka was pregnant again, and not knowing the camp, volunteered to join him. Upon arriving in October, she was again separated from Bernd, who would later be shot in a death march by the Nazis. Anka, malnourished and keeping her pregnancy secret, was selected for slave labor in an armaments factory near Dresden, Germany. She was so malnourished upon being evacuated to the country side for the Mauthausen concentration camp, she credits a farmer who offered her a glass of milk for her survival. She would have been sent to the gas chambers if they were not blown up the day before. Here she gave birth to her daughter Eva Clarke. Three days later the camp was liberated by American forces. During her time in these ghettos and camps, music from performers who were also captured, helped motivate people to go on. Anka's favorite was The Bartered Bride by the Czech opera Smetana. She returned to Prague to stay with her remaining family members. Her husband, parents, and two sisters were murdered at Auschwitz. In 1948 she started a new life with Czech translator in RAF Karel Bergman in Cardiff, Wales and would often give talks on her experiences. Anka Bergman died in July 2013, and Eva currently regularly speaks for the Holocaust Educational Trust.

He was also the head of Klaus Fleming's military unit in Hämeenkyrö, Finland.  Biography  Hans Larsson's background is not entirely certain. Certain sources claim he was the son of a vicar of Lammi parish, but some claim he was descended from the Roth Family, possibly the son of Lars Hansson Roth. In 1588, he had served as cavalryman with the rank of Lieutenant Valentin Göding.KA 2395:34 In 1594, two years before the Cudgel War, Sigismund III Vasa granted Hans Larsson because of his loyalty to the King, a Osara house and five wilderness houses in Pakula, which later became Osara Manor. Three years after the defeat of the peasant rebellion, Sigismund also gave the whole of the nineteen farmhouse village of Inkula, Viljakkala. As the lord of the manor, Hans Larsson was the most powerful and wealthiest man in Osara village and in the whole of Hämeenkyrö. When Duke Charles became king of Sweden in 1600, he started trials of the other party involved, against Sigismund, and Fleming's supporters. Hans Larsson was also soon imprisoned and brought to justice. He sought to influence the verdict by appealing to his nobility, but he did not have the necessary evidence because the Russians had burned the documents during the war of 1575–1595. Larsson was sentenced to death in 1601. The exact date of his execution is uncertain, but he was declared dead on October 14, 1601 at the Hämeenkyrö district and his wife Kirstin is mentioned as a widow.”Lista över klagomål från allmogen i Finland” (SDRH vol. 3) After receiving his verdict, he lost his ranch in Osara and Inkula.

Today it is a biotope with rare plant species.  History  In the years between 1936 and 1940, in addition to other buildings, seven warehouses designed as bunkers with a total of about 133,000 m³ of enclosed space were erected. They belonged to the Army Catering Main Office in Munich. In 1945 the area was taken over by the United States Army. They set up the Virginia Area Storage Facility there, named after the US state of Virginia. In 1957 the US- American facility dissipated and the name Virginia-Depot was retained. During the subsequent use by the Bundeswehr, the Military District Clothing Office VI and the Munich branch of the Military District Catering Office VI were located there. Heavy equipment from neighbouring barracks were also loaded over the tracks of the Bundeswehr tank loading station at the powder tower. The Bundeswehr abandoned the site around the mid-1990s. The buildings were demolished around 2011. Today, only the loading ramp of the former railway connection to Munich North Ring is visible on the site. The former Virginia depot is located at the bus stop \\"Pulverturm\\" of bus line 178. In the northeastern corner of the area is the local association München-Mitte of the Technische Hilfswerk. To the east is the site of the former Kronprinz- Rupprecht-Kaserne, which is connected to the former Virginia depot by a bridge across Schleißheimer Straße.

Family  Crescere con più lingue (Growing up with more languages) – A project implemented in collaboration with the healthcare authorities of the Friulian-speaking territory that is primarily aimed at promoting among new parents the several cognitive and metacognitive advantages resulting from a multilingual upbringing. The project also aims to overcome the prejudice that may influence the choice of families with respect to multilingual educational paths. Finally, Crescere con più lingue promotes the cultural and linguistic characteristics that are typical of the regional territory, including its “natural multilingualism.”  New technologies  The Agency has implemented several software tools that facilitate the written usage of the Friulian language according to the norms of the official spelling (set out by Regional Law 15/96 art. 13). On the ARLeF website, users will find the following applications: * the Grande Dizionario Bilingue Italiano – Friulano (Great Italian – Friulian Bilingual Dictionary), the most complete dictionary in terms of entries and detailed descriptions presently available for the Friulian language, also available as an app on tablets and smartphones; * the Correttore Ortografico Friulano (Friulian Spell-checker - also COF) enables users to analyse a written document and highlight any spelling mistakes, with suggested corrections; * the Tastiera Friulana Semplice (Simple Friulian keyboard), a programme that enables users to quickly type in Friulian by simplifying the typing of accented letters and other special characters, thanks to easy combinations of keys.  Children  Maman! – The first children’s TV show in Friulian. Additionally, the Agency has produced Friulian versions of various cartoons, including Omenuts, Tui e Tuie and Rite e Cjossul.

The festival commemorates the 3rd of April 1077, a day that marked the foundation of the patriarchal state of Friuli, an institution that reunited the land of Friuli and other territories in a single state organisation and existed until the 15th century, reaching a very advanced level of civil organisation forms at the time. Teatri Stabil Furlan (Friulian Permanent Theatre) – This project is aimed at establishing a theatrical production organisation in the Friulian language by creating the first network comprising the most qualified entities in the Friulian theatrical and cultural sector. The project stems from the cooperation among ARLeF and various entities including the Municipality of Udine, CSS Teatro stabile di innovazione del Friuli-Venezia Giulia (CSS Permanent Innovation Theatre of Friuli-Venezia Giulia), Fondazione Teatro Nuovo Giovanni da Udine (Giovanni da Udine Theatre Foundation), Accademia di arte drammatica “Nico Pepe” (“Nico Pepe” Academy of Dramatic Art), Società Filologica Friulana (Friulian Philological Society) and Istitût Ladin Furlan Pre Checo Placerean (“Pre Checo Placerean” Ladin-Friulian Cultural Association).

It was first published in 1783 as Das Bauernlied (The peasants' song). It became a hymn, with melodies by Johann André and Johann Abraham Peter Schulz. It appears in the current German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 508 with the latter melody, and is used mostly for the German Erntedankfest. Jane Montgomery Campbell translated it to English in 1861 as \\"We plough the fields and scatter\\".  History  First edition The poem appeared first in 1783 as part of an article by Claudius in the fourth volume of '. Titled Paul Erdmanns Fest, it describes a fictional rural harvest festival. As its highlight, a song is performed, alternating a cantor and the choir of the other peasants who sing a refrain. The early version began with a line \\"Im Anfang war’s auf Erden\\", describing the beginning according to the Book of Genesis 1:2. It had 16 stanzas, and a refrain that was slightly different from today's version. Claudius added his own melody to the poem.  Melodies  Claudius added his own melody to the poem. In the 19th century, Johann André composed a new melody and chose eight of the stanzas for a version which appeared in both Protestant and Catholic hymnals, often sung in schools. Other melodies were also created for a song which became popular. The melody still used in current songbooks is attributed to Johann Abraham Peter Schulz, and was published first in 1800 in Hanover in the second edition of a collection Melodien für Volksschulen (Melodies for elementary schools). His text has stanzas three to ten of Claudius, pairing two of them to one new stanza, with a slightly modified refrain. At the same time, the song entered official Protestant hymnals, such as an Oldenburg hymnal in 1791, and hymnals in Königsberg and Bremen in 1812. The Evangelisches Kirchengesangbuch of 1950 contained the hymn in several regional editions. The sequel, Evangelisches Gesangbuch of 1995 has the song as EG 708 in the section Natur und Jahreszeiten (Nature and seasons). It is also part of the Swiss Reformed hymnal, and the hymnal of the Methodist Church of 2002.  Translation  In 1861, Jane Montgomery Campbell created a free translation to English in three stanzas, \\"We plough the fields and scatter\\". It was included, with a musical setting of the melody by Schulz by John Bacchus Dykes, in various hymnals of different denominations. It became a popular song for Thanksgiving.

Both nations are members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries and the United Nations. History Nossa Senhora do Rosário church in Cidade Velha - the oldest surviving building in Cape Verde The islands of Cape Verde were discovered between 1460 and 1462 by Portuguese and Genoese sailors in the service of the Portuguese Crown. There is no evidence of human settlement on Cape Verde prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. Due to Cape Verde's proximity to the African coast, Portuguese sailors began to settle on the islands and given their strategic position, the islands served as a trading and supply warehouse, with particular emphasis on the Atlantic slave trade, particularly to Brazil. By the 19th century, the slave traded ended for Cape Verde, and many people of African origin settled on the islands and mixed with many of the Portuguese settlers creating the predominantly mestiça society of the islands today. In 1956, Amílcar Cabral created the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), fighting against colonialism and starting a march for independence. In 1972, during the Portuguese Colonial War, autonomy was granted to the islands and Portuguese Cape Verde held its only parliamentary elections in 1973, however, unlike other Portuguese colonies, there was no armed conflict in Cape Verde, and ultimately independence for Cape Verde resulted from negotiation with Portugal after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution. Cape Verde was granted independence on 5 July 1975. Since independence, relations between Cape Verde and Portugal have remained strong. There are many cultural similarities between both nations and many of Cape Verde's inhabitants have Portuguese ancestry. There have also been several high-level visits between leaders of both nations and both countries work closely together within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Transportation There are direct flights between both nations with the following airlines: Cabo Verde Airlines and TAP Air Portugal. Trade In 1998, Cape Verde and Portugal signed a Trade agreement. In 2017, trade between both nations totaled €284 million Euros. Portugal is Cape Verde's second largest trading partner (after Spain).

Artistic Career   Music, painting and medical drawing  Music occupies an important place in the career of Laurent Coderre. He learned the trumpet in Ottawa, then started playing in Toronto bars attending local events. Despite some talent, he refused to pursue a professional career in music and traveled to New York. Here he oscillates between trumpet and painting to pay for his studies and his rent. He returned to Quebec afterwards, where his parents are from, to study at the Montreal School of Fine Arts where he received the first prize in anatomy and sculpture. From there, Laurent Coderre switched to the medical drawing field studying at the University of Montreal. He was the first student in medical design, and spent two years dissecting bodies and working in hospitals.  Animation and Cinema  In 1960, Laurent Coderre joined the English animation team of the National Film Board of Canada, where he directed educational films until 1969. His first animations were on scientific films about the Second World War, mental illnesses, psychology, and mathematics. More and more sponsored films were entrusted to him, which allows him to experiment with new animation techniques, especially paper cut. Close to Norman McLaren, he directed Métamorphoses in1968 following a course on English animation given by McLaren. Created in paper cut within three days, Metamorphoses earned him the silver medal at the Venice International Film Festival. Following this first experience as a director, Laurent Coderre continued to exploit the animated paper cut under camera method to createVisual search to accompany a musical frame, a short film on the visualization of the sounds through the color. This film was never produced by the NFB but incited Laurent Coderre to compose music for films - in particular Bill Mason's documentary short film, Blake (1969). Laurent Coderre was asked in 1969 to work on the series Contemporary Songs, a series of seven films produced by the NFB based on Quebec music tracks. The song tarmac Flowers by Jean-Pierre Ferland was assigned to Coderre and was created into a short film of the same title. For this film, he uses watercolor on celluloid, a fragile technique but allowing for interesting textures. This four-week short film was awarded the best film prize at the Yortkton International Film Festival and a diploma of honor at the London International Film Festival. In 1971, he made a third film as a director, this time from thousands of linoleum fragments. Zikkaron, a short film which had the artistic intention of \\"concretizing the man within the universe\\", multiplying the allegorical images symbolizing the cosmos and the first organisms on Earth and the human body. This poetic and philosophical movie stands out from the traditional production of the time, where the cartoon is dominant. Laurent Coderre was following the lead of McLaren who considers Coderre his protege to the National Film Board. Zikkaron received the Grand Prize of the French Film Commission at the Cannes Film Festival of 1972. Between 1973 and 1977, Coderre left aside the production of films to give international conferences and workshops on animated film, while continuing to collaborate on various animation projects. Taking up the subject that was at the origin of Zikkaron (the human condition in the universe), he made two last animated films: Rencontre and Déclin, respectively in 1978 and 1980. He retired from the Office National Film Festival in 1984 to focus solely on painting.

History The Beginning After 1945 the company, Avianca had a complete monopoly over the airline industry. A couple of mechanics and pilots decided to form their own company on May 7, 1945 in the city of Barranquila. Captain Ernesto Recaman Saravia was the first company leader of Lansa. His first actions of being the company leader were the purchase of four Canadian-made Avro Anson 625A aircraft. Each Avro had a capacity of a maximum of eight passengers. Lansa built their first airfield, only 2 kilometers away from Paseo Colón. The airfield was named \\"Las Nieves\\" which translates to \\"the snows\\". It was equipped with a 1400 meter long track next to a wooden shed that served as an air terminal. The first planes were delivered to \\"Las Nieves\\" on September 3, 1945. Outcome Lansa as a result of its success from its Atlantic coast routes and in Medellin and Bogota, the company then acquired four Douglas DC-3 aircraft after having a successful year in 1946. In that same year, Lansa became a publicly traded company and changing its name to Línea Aéreas Nacionales S.A. After having been 2 years in the airline industry, Lansa accumulated 18 DC-3 aircraft. Its services were extended to the Caribbean Region, Neiva, Garzón, Popayán and Ipiales in the south of the country of Colombia. In 1948 there were negotiations of acquiring three Martin 202 aircraft, which had a maximum capacity of up to 40 passengers. However those negotiations were never finalized and the deal was off. Internationalization Lansa's first international flight was on February 8, 1947 from Barranquilla to Maracaibo. In order to expand its international operations, Lansa decided to request routes from Cartagena and Barranquilla to Havana and Miami, with the aim of competing directly with Avianca. This was the first major move by Lansa to compete internationally with Avianca. Also that year in 1947, two DC-4s were bought from the Argentine Merchant Air Fleet. Under the direction of Humberto Zimmermann, former Avianca worker, Lansa airmail services were inaugurated on June 22, 1950, then that the National Government awarded him a contract for the transport of mail and parcels. Decline The gradual decline of the company after having such great success in its early days was due to several fatal accidents that happened in 1951, the accidents seriously damaged the companies reputation and financial losses. At that point many stockholders came with the choice that to be smart with their money, they would sell their stake to Avianca. Lansa having now majority of its stock being owned by Avianca. lost its fight against Avianca making the entirety of the purpose for the companies formation now defunct. At that point the company became a subsidiary to Avianca. Although Lansa maintained its identity independently for the next three years, in 1954 it completed its integration process in Avianca, which resulted in a definitive cessation of operations and in the transfer of its fleet from DC-3 to Avianca, while the other planes were sold to third parties. The entire companies assets and fleet were liquidated by the end of 1954.

Literary career In 2001, the Russian publishing house Ad Marginem issued a collection of short novels Fingernails, which immediately captured the attention of the media and critics. The collection includes 24 short stories and a novel of the same title, the main characters of which are two pupils who possess paranormal abilities studying in a boarding school for demented children. The story was shortlisted for the Andrei Bely literary prize.Andrei Bely Prize 2001 Russian literary critic Lev Danilkin of the Afisha magazine hailed the collection as the best debut of the year. The next Elizarov's novel Pasternak (2003) prompted controversial polemic among Russian critics.Alexandra Guzeva 112 Russian writers ranging from great, to absolutely freaking great // Russia Beyond, August 25, 2015. In this anti-liberal and anti-sectarian lampoon, the poet Boris Pasternak is depicted in the form of a demon who \\"poisons\\" the intelligentsia's minds with his works. Some critics categorized the book as \\"trash\\", \\"a sickening novel\\". Literary critic Alla Latynina wrote in Novy Mir, that the novel has \\"an unpretentious, rather pop culture plot\\".Alla Latynina Случай Елизарова Novy Mir, No. 4, 2019 The Continent magazine, in a review of literary criticism, wrote that \\"when brown comes into fashion, its fans appear in literary circles\\", calling the author of NG-Ex libris Lev Pirogov, who spoke favourably of the novel,Pirogov Lev Архипелаг Pasternak // Nezavisimaya Gazeta, October 2, 2003 \\"a Nazi-minded ideologist\\". Moreover, the magazine noted that the leitmotif of the criticism was \\"the crisis of liberal values, the entry into the arena of the enemies of freedom\\".Ermolin E and others Художественная литература и критика. IVQ2003 / The Continent, 2004, № 119 On the other hand, the critic Vladimir Bondarenko in Zavtra newspaper praised highly the novel: \\"This is where the unbridled Russian revenge showed itself in full splendor, as a response to all the humiliations and insults of the Russian nation, the Russian character, the Russian faith and the Russian dream ... Through all a set of avant-garde literary techniques, through the philology of the text and dense erudition of the young writer, not inferior to either Umberto Eco, or Milorad Pavić, the unshakable centuries-old spiritual values of the Russian people are vehemently defended\\".Bondarenko V. Реакционный авангард // Zavtra, № 7 (83), July 10, 2003 Lev Danilkin labeled the novel as an \\"Orthodox philosophical action movie\\". In 2007, Elizarov's novel The Librarian was published, which in December 2008 won him the Russian Booker Prize.Russian Booker Prize 2008 The protagonist of the novel learns that some books of a forgotten Soviet writer possess mystical properties, and various groups of readers are waging a fierce battle to get them. As was noted by Anna Kuznetsova in the Znamya magazine, \\"Mikhail Elizarov's prose seems to be evolving like Vladimir Sorokin's: from scandalous shockingness to fiction rich in intellectual content\\".Anna Kuznetsova Mikhail Elizarov, The Librarian // Znamya, 2007, № 10Anna Aslanyan / Revolutions and resurrections: How has Russia's literature changed? // The Independent, April 8, 2011 In 2015 the novel was translated to English by Andrew Bromfield and issued in Pushkin Press, London.

Mikhail Elizarov says, that \\"if we assume that the writer has two ink tanks on his desk with different kind of inks, then this book, unlike all my previous ones, is written entirely with the contents of the second ink tank. It has never happened to me before. A distinctive feature of this \\"second ink\\" is fiction. There is not a word of truth in this book\\". Nevertheless, the short stories in this collection are written in rather autobiographical, true-to-life style, uncharacteristic of all his previous books. After almost six years of \\"silence\\", Mikhail Elizarov published a new book in October 2019. Titled Ground, the new novel is the first large-scale reflection on the \\"Russian Thanatos\\".AST Mikhail Elizarov, Ground As the Russian writer and critic Andrey Astvatsaturov notes in his review, \\"Elizarov seems to have written his best novel so far.

His name is associated with the spread of Islam into Netrokona, part of a long history of travel between the Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia. Biography The Shah Sultan Jame Mosque in Madanpur, adjacent to his shrine. Earlier documents reveal that Rumi arrived in Bengal in 1053 CE (445 Hijri) with his teacher Syed Shah Surkhul Antia and ten disciples. This was a century before the arrival of Muslim general Bakhtiyar Khalji and 250 years before Shah Jalal's Conquest of Sylhet in 1303 CE. Thus, Rumi arrived in Bengal even before the conquests. Rumi and his comrades settled in modern-day Netrokona, an area with no Muslim population and ruled by a Koch king called Ganesh. The message of Islam reached the local residents, many of whom accepted Islam. When news of conversions reached the king, Rumi was summoned to the royal court. It is said that Rumi claimed that God granted him the spiritual power, and so he was faced with an ordeal. Poison was offered to him and, as is believed, he was safe and sound even after drinking the poison. All present at the scene accepted Islam and the king granted him the village of Madanpur as well as some neighbouring villages, and made it a rent-free area. Death and legacy It is assumed that Shah Sultan Rumi died in 1075 CE (475 Hijri). A shrine was built in the village of Madanpur which continues to be visited. A mosque was built adjacent to the shrine complex. During the colonial period of Bengal, the British East India Company tried to takeover the shrine estate in 1829. This was contested by the guardians of the shrine who provided an old Persian document from 1082 CE. In response, the government abandoned the plan and granted the estate to the document holder; Syed Jalaluddin. There are number of things named after Rumi: * Shah Sultan Jame Mosque, Madanpur * Shah Sultan Degree College * Shah Sultan High School, Madanpur * Shah Sultan Digital Institute * Shah Sultan Diagnostic Center References Category:1075 deaths Category:Muslim missionaries Category:11th-century Muslims Category:Bangladeshi Sufi saints Category:People from Netrokona District ","title":"Shah Sultan Rumi"},{"id":"62454284","text":"Minwuntaung Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in Myanmar, covering .

Plot In 2003, United Nations' Special Representative in Iraq, Sérgio Vieira de Mello, is a victim of a bombing and becomes trapped in the basement of the hotel where he was working in Baghdad. Three months earlier, Sergio is married but there is no feeling of love in the marriage. And so, he commits to being with Carolina. Against the advice of his girlfriend and co-worker Carolina (Ana de Armas), Sergio decides to go to Baghdad after the 2003 invasion of Iraq in order to help Iraqis achieve independence and negotiate the withdrawal of American troops. He comes to a disagreement with American diplomat Paul Bremer who opposes his methods despite the pressure from the United States, and fights against the U.S. occupation of Iraq. He even insists on not having U.S. guards at the UN's base camp in order to separate themselves from the U.S. occupiers. Sergio is killed by a terrorist attack that takes place on the UN base camp. Later, the U.S. pulls out of Iraq leading to a long Civil War, but Sergio's gravely injured colleague Gil (Brian F. O'Byrne) survives despite having both legs amputated, and Carolina returns to her justice work in Rio.

Synopsis This film starts off with a brief introduction of the Karamajong people in Northern Uganda, Africa. They are one of the most feared tribes in all of Africa and are well known for their cattle herding and raiding. Traditions remain, but guns entered the fold and have become intertwined not only in Karamajong culture, but also the culture of neighboring tribes as well. The arms trade is responsible for this rise in guns from traditional sticks, spears, and bow & arrows; which has led to overwhelming brutality and violence all throughout Africa. The film introduces Lokwarionga, a skilled warrior, commander, guardian, and feared raider who is part of the Karamajong ethnic people and has his fair share of violence. He has ten confirmed kills and holds much renown among his people. However, an aged Lokwarionga is introduced not a youthful one and his many wives and children have brought out a peaceful nature to him. He has seen the blood that spills with combat and has transitioned to a peaceful protector role. Violence plagues Uganda and the Ugandan government developed an initiative to recruit Karamajong warriors, including Lokwarionga, as vigilantes to bring peace to surrounding areas. These peace keepers essentially settle disputes and report back to the government. An important conflict that opens this story up is a cattle raid on the Karamajong by a neighboring enemy, which causes Lokwarionga and other warriors to investigate and than contact the government. He meets with a Ugandan government official, but the official really just receives the report and tells them there is nothing that can really be done at that point. Simultaneously, Longora, younger brother of Lokwarionga, is presented in the film. Longora is not a warrior yet and does not own a firearm at this point. He is still learning the ropes and even raiding is fairly new to him. Juxtaposed to Lokwarionga, who is transitioning from that lifestyle, Longora is actively pursuing it. So, as a response to the cattle raid the Karamajong along with Lokwarionga plan to do a counter raid. First, they commence a raiding ceremony that has incorporated modern elements. The ceremony begins with the sacrifice of a cow. The cow is cut open and warriors must eat bits of the raw meat. Next, the warriors and their guns are smeared with the insides of the cow's intestines. Finally, the raid comes to fruition and is ultimately successful. Longora, who was part of the raiding party, at this point shows his first real demonstration of manhood. Lokwarionga contradicts his new lifestyle when he presents his younger brother with a weapon. Although it seems necessary to have on in the type of environment these men were brought up in. The story comes to a close with violence and guns shown as pivotal to manhood. Cast * Lokwarionga- a veteran commander, warrior, guardian, and raider in Karamajong * Longora- younger brother of Lokwarionga, rookie raider, and warrior-in-training * Naru- a female Karamajong, senior of Lokwarionga's wives * Unnamed Karamajong man 1- describes violence and death that guns have brought * Unnamed Karamajong wife of Lokwarionga 1- brief description of situation in Karamajong * Unnamed Karamajong wife of Lokwarionga 2- talks about her husband Lokwarionga * Unnamed Ugandan government official- reported to by Karamajong warriors, speaks English Production This film was shot in Northern Uganda where the Karamajong ethnic group resides as well neighboring areas. Writer, Director, and Ethnographer Richard Alwyn and Writer, Ethnographer, and Producer Sarah Errington follow the real life events of Lokwarionga. The production centers around him and the geographic location where production took place was fairly focused. Most dialogue is translated, but Andrew Sachs, the narrator of this film, gives historical context and description of events to tie the film together. Release information The film was released in 1998 with a plethora of documentaries that can be seen in Under the Sun, a doc-series, based out of London, England through BBC Worldwide. Reception This film has yet to receive any reception through any mainstream media, but there were some scholarly articles by Ben Knighton. Knighton is a Co-ordinator of Africa Research Interest Group, Research Tutor, Oxford Centre for Mission Studies. In his three separate articles using this film as a reference he discussed the raider state and the threat of guns. Knighton even discusses how intertwined the gun has become with Karamajong culture.

It has the variable star designation LW Com, short for LW Comae Berenices; HD 111395 is the Henry Draper Catalogue designation. The star has a yellow hue and is just bright enough to be barely visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude that fluctuates around 6.29. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of 55.8 light years from the Sun. The star is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −8.9 km/s. It is a member of the Eta Chamaeleontis stellar kinematic group. This object is a G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G7V. It is a BY Draconis variable that varies in brightness by about 0.10 magnitude over a period of 15.8 days, which is interpreted as the rotation period of the star. (Messina et al. (2003) suspect the actual rotation period may be half that: 7.9 days.) It has an active chromosphere and is a source for X-ray emission. The star is around a billion years old with a projected rotational velocity of 3.8 km/s. It has slightly above solar metallicity − the term astronomers use for the relative abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The mass of the star is 8% greater than the Sun, but it has 93% of the Sun's radius. It is radiating 80% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5649 K.

Typically, councils are staffed by economists and statisticians who do not have the ability to set policy, but provide advice to governments and the public on the economic effects of government budgets and policy proposals. Some fiscal councils also provide economic forecasting. Fiscal councils evaluate government's fiscal policies, plans and performance publicly and independently, against macroeconomic objectives related to the long-term sustainability of public finances, short-to-medium-term macroeconomic stability, and other official objectives.  History  Several fiscal councils arose following the financial crisis of 2007–08 with the intention of avoiding debt crises and alleviating the problem of deficit bias, which is a tendency of governments to allow increasing long-term deficits.Weldon, Duncan (2016-07-26). Whatever happened to deficit bias?. Bull Market. Retrieved 2020-03-14. Analysis from the International Monetary Fund proposes that deficit bias results from both voters and policy-makers – the former through imperfect information on budgets and neglect for future generations, and the latter through imperfect information, information asymmetries, electoral pressures, a common-pool problem among government agencies, and a combination over optimistic spending and growth projections. Fiscal councils alleviate deficit bias by providing independent non-partisan estimates of government income, and by reminding the public of the government's intertemporal budget constraint. The public will then, in theory, react to this information by supporting governments that deliver sustainable fiscal policies and electorally punishing governments that are fiscally irresponsible. Fiscal councils, such as the United Kingdom's Office for Budget Responsibility, have been criticised for mostly advising from the perspective of neoclassical economics and advocating for balanced-budgets and small government, to the detriment of heterodox economic approaches based on the real economy and more interventionist New Keynesian approaches to the business cycle.Labour and the politics of budget responsibility. SPERI (2013-10-15). Retrieved 2020-03-14.Skidelsky, Robert (2018). Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics. Yale University Press. pp. 230–233. .Mostacci, Edmondo (2016).

Deficit bias  Government debt as % of GDP, OECD countries 2018 More countries in the world run budget deficits than not. In the long term, a high budget deficit is unsustainable. High budget deficits have aggravated crises like the European debt crisis. Governments that are unsure of being re-elected may ignore the long-term consequences of fiscal deficits and use generous fiscal policy to increase their chances of re-election. Voters may favour fiscal deficits because they benefit from tax cuts and public spending increases, and only bear part of the cost, the rest being borne by future generations. Alternatively, electorates vote for deficits because they are not fully aware of the problem.

Zimmer was chief of neuroradiology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) from 1983 until his death. __TOC__  Life, Education and Career  Born in New York City, Zimmer received his M.D. degree in 1956 from the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, Switzerland, where he was valedictorian of his class, and served an internship at Garfield Memorial Hospital, Washington, D.C. After a residency in radiology at Bronx Municipal Hospital in New York City, Zimmer accepted a fellowship in neuroradiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, serving as instructor, then assistant professor. While at Albert Einstein, Zimmer was one of the early lecturers in the United States invited to share his expertise in the \\"Stockholm School\\" of neuroradiology; rapidly leading the earliest advancements in the field, Stockholm's Serafimer Hospital had become a \\"mecca\\" of neuroradiology throughout the 1940s and '50s. Zimmer and colleagues from Albert Einstein visited Serafimer to became trained in the technique and subsequently spread the methodology to radiologists across the United States. Zimmer joined the staff of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, teaching there until 1981. Zimmer was selected as a special fellow for the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness, New York, and later as a visiting fellow at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. He was associate professor of radiology at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia until 1983, when he joined UMDNJ. In 1961, Zimmer married Harriet Hochhauser; the couple had three sons: Michael Zimmer, M.D., David Zimmer, M.D., and Stuart Zimmer, CEO and founder of Zimmer Partners LP and chairman of the insurance company Ategrity.  Research and Publications  Early in his career, Zimmer focused his research on investigating treatments for serious conditions in the brain and central nervous system. In 1971, at a course during his fellowship at Albert Einstein, Zimmer was first introduced to a new \\"computed tomographic\\" (CT) system by its developer, the British engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, who was making his first visit to the United States. This was the first demonstration of the CT technique to American radiologists, who were commonly using angiography for diagnostic imaging. Testing showed that the diagnostic error rate of CT was half that of angiography, but an even greater potential value was seen in CT's ability to detect unsuspected conditions. For the first time, physicians could visualize not just bone, but organs, tissue, and other soft material in the body. Hounsfield would later receive the Nobel Prize for his technique. After his introduction to CT, Zimmer began a career specializing in emerging neuroradiological advances. As hospitals began to adopt CT scanning, Zimmer was one of the early physicians conducting research on its applications. Similarly, when magnetic resonance imaging was introduced in the 1980s, Zimmer was an early practitioner and contributor to MRI research. Throughout the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, Zimmer published numerous articles around the cerebral venous system and other aspects of neuroradiology. His article, “The Septal Vein,\\" co-authored with George P. Annes, was published in the journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in 1966. Their work describes the significance of the septal vein in identifying the nature and presence of tumors, or abscesses, in the frontal lobe (or anterior cranial fossa). Zimmer also contributed “Radiologic Imaging of the Cervical Spine” as a chapter to a core clinical resource book on the diagnosis and nonsurgical treatment of neck injuries, such as whiplash: Painful Cervical Trauma: Diagnosis and Rehabilitative Treatment of Neuromusculoskeletal Injuries, edited by C. David Tollison and John R. Satterthwaite and published in 1992.  References  Category:American radiologists Category:1929 births Category:1993 deaths ","title":"Alan E.

She was also the mother of Chaim Herzog, 6th President of Israel, and Yaakov Herzog, Israeli diplomat. Sarah Herzog holding her year-old son Chaim Herzog (Belfast, around 1919).  Early life  Born in Latvia, Herzog grew up in London. She was the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Isaac Hillman, who invited Belfast Rabbi Isaac Herzog (Yitzchak HaLevi Herzog) to his home for a conference regarding kosher dietary laws during World War I rationing in 1917. According to family history, Sarah dropped a tea tray when she saw Isaac, who was also immediately smitten (in some versions, Sarah spilled tea all over Isaac). In August 1917, Sarah married Isaac and assumed the title and responsibilities of a rebbetzin, or rabbi's wife. A year later, their son Chaim was born, in Belfast. The Herzogs moved to Dublin in 1919, where their son Yaakov was born in December, 1921. The family moved to Israel in 1936, where Isaac Herzog became the Chief Rabbi of Eretz Israel. Later in his life, Chaim remembered his mother as clearly the dominant individual at home. She was very pretty and gracious and, although petite, almost regal in her demeanour. Wherever her home was, it was a centre of grace and culture and, later, in Israel, a magnet for the Jewish community from around the world. In his inaugural address as president of Israel in 1983, Chaim spoke at length of the influence of both his parents and of his mother, a personality in her own right. Her grandson remembered her as welcoming and hospitable, especially towards the impoverished. Chaim Herzog in a British Army uniform with his mother Sarah Herzog.  Life in Israel  In May 1939, Herzog was active in protests against the \\"MacDonald White Paper,\\" a British policy proposal for a single state in Palestine. With Rachel Ben-Zvi and Ita Yellin, she organized specific women's protests against the policy of saving Jewish children from Nazi-controlled territory (Kindertransport) but not allowing these children to be relocated to Palestine. She was religiously observant and initially had reservations about Chaim's fiancée Aura Ambache, though she later welcomed her into the family. She proposed the creation of Mother's Day in pre-state Israel in 1947, though nothing came of her proposal. After her husband's death, Herzog continued to be active in Israeli politics as an unofficial ambassador and in international Jewish women's organizations. In 1954, she travelled to Montreal in her role as President of the World's Mizrachi Women's Organization. She often hosted the wives of rabbis and other dignitaries, including during the first World Conference of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Congregations in 1968. In 1977, Herzog was the founding president of Jewish women's Zionist organization World Emunah.  Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions  An educational center in Bnei Brak for religious Jewish women is named Neve Sarah Herzog in her honour. The Sarah Herzog Children's Home in Afula is a residential centre built in 1943 for children orphaned by the Holocaust is also named after her. In the 1980s, the Jerusalem hospital Ezrath Nashim was renamed Herzog Hospital after her, who was its volunteer president for forty years.

Early life  Collins was born and raised in Bermondsey, London to Irish parents and attended the BRIT School for performing arts and technology. Her grandmother, Angelina Collins, renamed Angela, is buried in a mass grave in St. Finbarr's Cemetery in County Cork with 72 other women, after working for 27 years in a Magdalene laundry. Collins has campaigned for her grandmother's exhumation and for apologies from the Irish government and Catholic Church. Collins' mother, Mary Teresa Collins, is a survivor of the industrial school system in Ireland, and was a child resident of St. Vincent's Magdalene Laundry in Cork.  Career  Collins chairs an Irish Traveller led survivor support group, she has published research regarding the Irish Traveller community, and the Tuam Mother and Baby Home, where 800 babies are in a mass grave in Tuam, County Galway. She has also undertaken research on Irish institutions such as industrial schools, mother and baby homes, county homes and the Magdalene Laundries and has been a critic of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation and past investigations into child abuse such as the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the McAleese Report (formally known as the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries). In July 2015 Collins arranged a protest in Dublin she flew over from London with her family to peacefully stand outside the Dáil Éireann. On the day Laura’s mother Mary stated she believes the mass grave her mother is within is filled with Traveller women subjected to the same inhumane treatment that she received while in the Industrial Schools. In September 2015 Laura Collins had called on the Irish government to fast track the redress scheme for aging survivors, and to grant free legal aid to people taking a case to the Mother & Baby Homes Commission and for the government and the church to support and fund families to remove their loved ones from mass graves and give them their own burial. She wrote to the Minister for Justice calling for justice for the forgotten families of the victims of institutional abuse. Although it was arranged for a meeting with the Justice Department to deliver the letter about her family’s plight, as they marched through Dublin streets on their arrival the doors were locked. On the 27th January 2017, Collins and her mother held a service at her grandmother's, Angela Collins, mass grave in St. Finbarr's Cemetery for all the women and children who had died within Irish institutions. Collins said to the TheJournal.ie her grandmother was “a good mum and all the children were healthy, Angelina did not go out and rob a shop and got herself arrested – she was a mother caring for her children. All it is based on is she didn’t have a ring on her finger and was a Traveller,” Collins said she believes her grandmother was taken into a county home due to being an unmarried Traveller mother. On the 1st March 2017 Irish Travellers gained ethic recognition within Ireland, , fours days after it was issued, on the 5th of March 2017 Collins reported to the Irish mirror and the Irish sun that “There are many, many Traveller community names that appear on that list of 796 babies and children. My mum was treated differently because of who she was. I hate to imagine how many more Traveller children are in unmarked graves in Ireland. It just makes me so angry. This is just the beginning.” On the 18 March 2017, The Sunday Mirror and Irish Sunday Mirror quoted her, saying she \\"had identified 335 known traveller's surnames in the 796 remains buried at the Catholic-run mother and baby home in County Galway\\". On the 7 June 2017 Collins organised another protest, In which her mother Mary stood outside the dáil to call for the Treatment of Traveller children to be investigated and acknowledged. Collins said on the day of the protest that the government should look at the Magdalene laundries, mother-and-baby homes and industrial schools together, as it’s believed they were all connected In June 2017 Collins sent out press releases to media outlets calling for a official apology to the Traveller community by the government on behalf of the effects around the 1963 commission of itinerancy report. Collins has campaigned against the National Maternity Hospital being run by the Religious Sisters of Charity. Collins chairs the organisations Justice 4 All Women & Children, Mincéir Model’s, and Travelling People Worldwide. She has been interviewed on RTÉ Radio 1, Cork's 96FM, and the Niall Boylan Show. Collins petitioned to ensure the government do not lock away the records of survivors from Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan report) for 75 years, she said to journalist Anne Sheridan “I started the petition to show the Government that this is not what survivors and the public want, the effects the laundry had on my mum has never gone away. The large Irish community of survivors in England feel very cut off and distanced from this and, again, their voices are not being heard. The abuse for them has never stopped, this is another cover-up,” she told Extra.ie. Collins issued a Retention of Records Bill 2019 submission to the Minister of Education and Skills. Collins and her mother continues to publicly push for a apology to be issued to her community. In which in October 2020 the NGO the Irish Traveller Movement supported Irish Traveller survivors and 2nd generation survivors calls over the years for a official state apology to be provided to the Irish Traveller community.  Awards  In 2019, Collins won the first ever Traveller Pride award (which is arranged by the Irish Traveller Movement), in the intersectionality category, in which was awarded to her by Catherine Corless.

United Kingdom  In the UK, use of wireless microphone systems requires a Wireless Telegraphy Act license, except for the license free bands of 173.8–175.0 MHz and 863–865 MHz, sometimes referred to as \\"Channel 70\\" (not to be confused with TV Channel 69, which was 854–862 MHz and always required a license from JFMG Ltd although licences are no longer available for that band). Arqiva purchased PMSE band manager JFMG from ITV in February 2009. JFMG were contracted by communications regulator OFCOM to provide spectrum management and licensing services for programme making and special events (PMSE). In May 2015 Ofcom made the decision to end the contract with Arqiva and to insource the existing services. Channel 69 was replaced as the UK mobile radio microphone band by channel 38 (606 MHz to 614 MHz). Licences to use this band are issued on a Shared basis which means that any frequency coordination between multiple users in or around a particular location must be done by those users themselves. All Shared Licence holders have the same rights as each other. In 2013 the UK communications regulator, Ofcom, held an auction in which the UHF band from 790 MHz to 862 MHz was sold to be used for mobile broadband services. Objections had been raised by Andrew Lloyd Webber and many others. The Interleaved (also known as White Space) UHF spectrum between 470 MHz to 606 MHz (Channels 21 - 37) and 614 MHz to 790 MHz (Channels 39 to 60) may be licensed on a Site Specific Coordinated basis. Coordinated licences grant the holder exclusive use of particular frequencies or blocks of spectrum at a particular location for a specified period of time. Coordination between users is carried out by Arqiva PMSE as part of the licensing process. {  - ! Frequency ! Description ! Licensing -  173.7 to 175.1 MHz  VHF  Deregulated (Free usage) -  175.25 to 209.8 Mhz  VHF  Regulated (VHF licensed) -  606.5 to 613.5 Mhz  UHF 'Channel 38'  Regulated (UHF licensed) -  823 to 832 Mhz  UHF 'Duplex Gap'  Regulated (UHF licensed) -  863.1 to 864.9 Mhz  UHF 'Channel 70'  Deregulated (Free usage) -  1785 to 1805 Mhz  1.8Ghz band  Regulated (UHF licensed) -  1880 to 1900 Mhz  'DECT' band  Deregulated (Free usage) -  2400 to 2483.5 Mhz  'WiFi' band  Deregulated (Free usage) }  United States  Licenses are required to use wireless microphones on vacant TV channels in the United States as they are a part of the Broadcast Auxiliary Service (BAS). However, this requirement is often overlooked and rarely enforced by the FCC. Licenses are available only to broadcasters, cable networks, television and film producers. However, the FCC has issued a Report and Order stating that they now no longer allow Broadcast Auxiliary Service (BAS) devices to operate in the 698–806 MHz portion of the spectrum due to their auction of the 700 MHz band. This change is unrelated to, but commonly confused with, the White Space device debate that is currently taking place in the U.S. The same Report and Order, issued January 15, 2010, also permits most wireless microphones and other 'low power auxiliary stations' in the \\"core TV band\\" (TV channels 2 through 51, except 37) to operate with transmit power up to 50 mW without a license, under a special waiver of Part 15 rules. A rule change to make this permanent is proposed. There are currently some wireless microphone manufacturers that are marketing wireless microphones for use in the United States that operate within the 944–952 MHz band reserved for studio-transmitter link communications. These microphones have the potential to interfere with studio-transmitter links, and their use must be coordinated by the Society of Broadcast Engineers. Licenses in this band are only available to licensees of radio and TV stations, and broadcasters are likely to report unauthorized use in this band due to the high potential for interference. Changes beginning in 2017 concerning operation on 600 MHz frequencies. Beginning in 2017, the amount of TV band spectrum available for wireless microphone use is decreasing as a result of the incentive auction, which was completed on April 13, 2017. A significant portion of the TV band spectrum in the 600 MHz band, including most (but not all) of the spectrum on TV channels 38-51 (614-698 MHz), has been repurposed for the new 600 MHz service band for use by wireless services, and will not continue to be available for wireless microphone use. Specifically, wireless microphones that operate in the new 600 MHz service band (the 617-652 MHz and 663-698 MHz frequencies) will be required to cease operation no later than July 13, 2020, and may be required to cease operation sooner if they could cause interference to new wireless licensees that commence operations on their licensed spectrum in the 600 MHz service band. FCC 14-50, FCC 15-140, DA 17-314 Spectrum will continue to be available for wireless microphone use on the other TV channels 2-36 (TV band frequencies that fall below 608 MHz), on portions of the 600 MHz guard band (the 614-616 MHz frequencies) and the 600 MHz duplex gap (the 653-663 MHz frequencies), and in various other spectrum bands outside of the TV bands. FCC 15-100, FCC 15-99  Australia  In Australia, operation of wireless microphones of up to 100 mW EIRP between 520 MHz and 694 MHz is on unused television channels and is covered by a class license, allowing any user to operate the devices without obtaining an individual license. The onus, however, is on the user of the wireless microphone to resolve any interference that the use of the microphone may cause to licensed radio communications services. After 31 December 2014 operation will not be allowed in the frequency range 694-820 MHz. See item 22A in the schedule in the class licence  Other countries  In many other countries wireless microphone use does require a license. Some governments regard all radio frequencies as military assets and the use of unlicensed radio transmitters, even wireless microphones, may be severely punished. For further information regarding licensing in European countries try the European Radio Office (ERO) based in Denmark.

Its goal is “to develop, validate, and promote laboratory methods and techniques that don’t use animal test subjects”. It is the first centre in Canada dedicated to non-animal testing and the promotion of human- relevant alternatives. Mission and projects The CCAAM's mission is based on three pillars: * scientific research relying exclusively on human-based biomaterials and human biology-based methodologies, including human cells, stem cells, tissues from cadavers, biopsies, and explanted organs from surgeries; * academic training for scientists, ethicists, regulators, and policy makers, including development of a one-year masters programme; * regulatory initiatives for changing chemical safety methods in Canada, with academic, industry, government, and public partnerships. One of its main focuses of research is diabetes, using “human stem cells to create diabetes in a dish”.The CCAAM is opposed to animal testing based on ethical and scientific reasons. The director, biochemist Dr. Charu Chandrasekera who specializes in heart disease and diabetes, states that “Ninety-five per cent of drugs tested to be safe and effective in animal models fail in human clinical trials”. Funding In 2018, it received a $1 million donation from the Eric S. Margolis Family Foundation, considered “the largest research donation in University of Windsor history”, part of which will be used to create a research and training facility.

It features actors Mani, Remya Valsala, Anumol, Indrans, Sajitha Madathil, Joy Mathew and Nilambur Ayisha in the lead roles. Produced by Dr. Manoj K.T, Dr. Rajesh Kumar M.P and Dr. Sajish M under the banner of Doctors' Dilemma, it is Avala's debut feature. The film premiered at 20th Mumbai Film Festival in October 2018 before doing rounds at the festival circuit including the International Film Festival of Kerala and Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. The film presented by Aashiq Abu is scheduled to release theatrically on 6 December 2019. Plot Gulikan, a tribal transgender from the deep jungle settlement in Kerala was married in childhood to Maathi. Born and brought up as a boy, he has the soul of a girl. He is constantly being abused whenever he steps out of the forest looking for work. Two unfortunate love affairs culminates into destruction. Hounded by the society that wants to capture and kill, he is on the run.

The album consists of 4 tracks featuring lyrics by Manu Manjith and Unnikrishnan Avala. The background score is given by Bijibal. Production  Development  Avala, when he began working as a teacher in Nilambur, travelled mostly in buses. He would observe a lot of tribal people during his journeys and began to study them. Their lives and stories which he found interesting led him to make a documentary called Last Page and Womenses. During that time Avala met Raju whom he says was \\"a woman inside and a man outside.\\" His experiences inspired Avala to write the story of Gulikan, a tribal transgender person whose life was a constant battle against humiliation and abuse by a parochial racist story. Raju was part of the initial discussions of the film and wished to be part of the project. However, he passed away due to chronic ailments before the film making began.  Filming  For the lead role of Gulikan, Mani P.R was selected. Mani who had earlier won the 2006 Kerala State Film Award as a Child Actor in his debut feature Photographer, was initially reluctant to take up the role having been disillusioned after facing rejections from the film industry and personal tragedies. It was only after his wife's intervention, he finally accepted the role. Grooming the actor for the role took six months. Mani also helped to translate the script to Paniya language as required by the story. Three doctors viz, Dr. Manoj K.T, Dr. Rajesh Kumar M.P and Dr. Sajish M because of their passion for cinema, came together and formed the banner Doctors' Dilemma to produce the film. Remya Valsala, Anumol, Indrans, Joy Mathew and Sajitha Madathil were casted in key roles and principal photography began in 2017.

It is situated northeast of Pemberton, west-northwest of Cayoosh Mountain, east-southeast of Mount Gardiner, and immediately east of the Place Glacier. The mountain's cirque name, which describes the shape of the peak, was submitted by mountaineer Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada. The name was officially adopted on January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Cirque Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Several commentators believes that the tomato throwing incident was the event that launched the second wave of the German women's movement. Life University admission and politicisation Sigrid Rüger was born in Berlin. By 1961 she was working for her Abitur in Frankfurt. Often seen as a school final exam, the Abitur opens the way in Germany to university-level education. Rüger was working for the exam not as a secondary school pupil, but at the newly opened \\"Hessenkolleg\\", using the recently introduced alternative education route \\"Zweiter Bildungsweg\\", which was designed to open up a route to university admission for older candidates. In or around 1962, after passing her Abitur, Rüger enrolled at the US-backed Free University (FU) in Berlin as a student of Theatre studies. She quickly switched to Politics and Sociology even though, as at least one commentator has pointed out, student radicals identified as the \\"generation of '68\\" were scathingly scornful of conventional views of Sociology at this time. She became a member of the German Socialist Student Union (\\"Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund\\" / SDS) within which she belonged to the \\"Universities' Political Working Group\\" (\\"Hochschulpolitische Arbeitskreis\\").Wie weit flog die Tomate? Eine 68erinnen- Gala der Reflexion. Hrsg. von der Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung und dem Feministischen Institut, 1st edition, Berlin 1999, , pp. 29, 31, 33-34 The focus of her student life became university politics at the Free University of Berlin. Here she was elected, in 1964, as a student spokeswoman for the Philosophy Faculty. In 1965 she became a student spokeswoman in the university senate. Student protest movement in the mid-1960s Rüger quickly engaged in the arguments of those times about the nature and extent of the political mandate of the \\"student body (\\"Studierendenschaft\\"), and the \\"democratization\\" of the university. During the most \\"heated\\" phase of the 1960s student protests at the Free University she became a key figure, confidently relaying student demands against the positions taken by the professor members of the senate. Within the university she thereby quickly became identified as one of the most high-profile student activists in her cohort. During the sit-in of 22 June 1966 it was Rüger who several times was sent by the gathering of several thousand protesting students to deliver their demands to the university senate. The way in which she reported back to the massed ranks of protestors on the progress of negotiations within the senate were widely seen to have violated hitherto customary principals of confidentiality. One contemporary witness of those times was the academic Tilman Fichter. Thirty years later Fichter would recall the initial emergence of the student protests movement in 1965. He described the Philosophy Faculty spokeswoman as \\"one of the best known of the SDS activists\\" at the FU, back then \\"almost better known than Rudi Dutschke\\". Volkmar Braunbehrens (who subsequently achieved notability as a musicologist and leading Mozart specialist) was selected by Rüger to take over her role as Philosophy Faculty spokesperson in 1966: Braunbehrens recalled much later that [among the students] in 1960s Berlin, Sigrid Rüger became \\"someone of absolute authority\\". The amount of time and energy Rüger devoted to her multiple roles in student politics during this period led to her officially taking time out from her elected post as student representative. Sources are silent over whether she ever completed her degree course. However, she continued to engage prominently in the political debates at the FU. The tomato throwing incident and the \\"new\\" women's movement In January 1968 the women's group Action Council on Women's Liberation (\\"Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frauen\\") was founded by a group of women SDS members. Action Council members remained, at least initially, closely involved as members of the SDS, but they also called for a \\"feminist debate\\" to focus on the exploitative aspects of women's relationships. Although the debate was seen as important in its own terms, backers were also hoping for an opportunity to find practical solutions to the childcare challenges facing new mothers keen to be able to continue their university studies. A report in Der Spiegel the previous year had stated that in West Germany at this time there was only one nursery place for every 23 children of working mothers: the same ratio also applied to students with children. Rüger herself was not among the leading activists involved with the Action Council at this stage, but her leadership role within the SDS meant that she was well aware that among the SDS leaders there was a singular absence of empathy with feminist viewpoints.Vorwort zur Neuauflage von Ute Kätzel. In: Ute Kätzel (Hrsg.): Die 68erinnen. Porträt einer rebellischen Frauengeneration. Ulrike Helmer Verlag, Königstein/Taunus 2008, . p. I. As part of their promotional activities a small group of women from the Action Council met up on one side of the room at the twenty-third delegates' conference of the SDS at Frankfurt on 13 September 1968. One of them, young and beautiful, with striking red hair, wearing a green skirt, and by this time very heavily pregnant was Sigrid Rüger. At this point Rüger was affected by a powerful dietary craving: she had a large box filled with tomatoes on the table in front of her. That was the context for the widely publicised tomato throwing incident whereby Sigrid Rüger expressed displeasure over the lack of consideration given to women's issues in the discussions and activities of her fellow SDS leaders when airing their ambitions to change West German society. Rüger threw several (according to one source, three) tomatoes in the direction of the row of male SDS, uttering an exclamation as she did it. One of them hit Hans-Jürgen Krahl, a rising star of the SDS leadership who was deep in gossip/conversation. It later turned out that she had been aiming not at Krahl, who was gay and the complete opposite of a misogynist, but at the face of Helmut Schauer the SDS president at the time. \\"That evening Krahl sat in the bath and cried\\", recalled a mutual friend, Tilman Fichter; \\"Then Sigrid came round to comfort him. That's how she was\\". Thrown vegetables or eggs were a much loved protest device for protesting students during this periods. Preferred targets in West Germany were politicians and other establishment figures perceived by the throwers as more than averagely reactionary. The attention grabbing difference on this occasion was that the thrown tomatoes came from a group of SDS women: their target was the (male) leadership circle of their own student socialist organisation. An immediate practical result of the tomato throwing was that it prevented the men who were running the conference from letting a powerful speech from Helke Sander, in which Sander appealed for the SDS to support the women's political agenda, to be followed by the next agenda item without any discussion. Rüger later recalled that even before the conference opened, Helke Sander's acceptance as an Action Council delegate to it had been pushed through only in the face of stiff opposition from a group of Berlin SDS men. In her speech Sander addressed the problems encountered both within the SDS, and in West German society more generally. She proposed a strategy involving an alliance between the SDS and the Action Council. That never happened. Instead, the twenty-third Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund SDS] conference with its tomato throwing incident was followed by a slow drifting apart of the Action Council from the SDS. Many women in the Action Council pressed for an organisation structure that became increasingly autonomous, un encumbered by links to any organisation where power and influence were shared between both women and men. Two of West Germany's most powerful weekly news magazines, Der Spiegel and Stern reported Sander's speech and Rüger's tomato throwing in some detail. Of the two publications Stern during the 1960s was frequently more ready to publish criticism of the conservative elements in the West German political establishment than Spiegel: it was Stern that now devoted its own lengthy article to the \\"Protest of the SDS Women\\". Rüger's own assessment was quoted by Manfred Bissinger in the Stern article: \\"I threw the tomatoes to make the girls articulate their problems with emotional courage and aggressions\\".Stern: SDS-Mädchen proben den Aufstand/Tomaten für das Lustgefühl. Heft Nr. 39, 29 September 1968, p. 32ff. The incident acted as a highly effective rallying call for West Germany's \\"new\\" women's movement. Its impact on feminist consciousness was unmatched for nearly three years, until the \\"We've had abortions!\\" headline appeared on the cover of Stern in June 1971. West German society had remained strikingly risk-averse since the 1945, however: several commentators contend that it was only the 1971 Stern headline that finally dragged the country's \\"new\\" feminism beyond the confines of the university campuses. Within the student movement and across the universities sector, the tomato throwing incident galvanised awareness of the demands of the Action Council among both backers and opponents. In several university cities so-called \\"Women's Soviets\\" (\\"Weiberräte\\") were established. These took steps to draw public attention to the social disadvantages that women faced, employing sometimes spectacular tactics. After '68 As her tomato throwing quickly became a lasting symbol for the confident and autonomous feminist movement which emerged rapidly in West Germany during the ensuing ten years, Sigrid Rüger herself withdrew into the political background. She took a job with the West Berlin-based Federal (i.e. 'national') Institute for Professional Education and Training (\\"Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung\\"), where she worked for many years, and for which, during her final years, the focus of her work was on \\"social qualifications\\" and \\"social competences\\". She became the author and / or producer of a succession of articles and monographs on vocational education and professional development, with a particular emphasis on these topics as they relate to women. While employed at the Federal Institute she also established herself as a personal counsellor and worked as an honorary (i.e. unpaid) official of the Public Services and Transport Trades Union (\\"Gewerkschaft Öffentliche Dienste, Transport und Verkehr\\" / ÖTV). Personal Sigrid Damm-Rüger was married to Uwe Damm. They had met at university as members of the SDS political working group. Dorothee, the elder of her two daughters was born two weeks after the famous tomato throwing incident. Sigrid Damm-Rüger died from cancer in Berlin just five years after reunification. She was 57. Dorothee Damm, her daughter, subsequently admitted that it was \\"only on the day of her [mother's] burial\\" that the daughter understood just how important her mother's action had been in launching the \\"new\\" women's movement. Friends and political comrades from 1968 crowned the ceremony by laying a wreath on the grave that principally featured tomatoes.

It was first proven by Klaus Roth in 1953. Roth's Theorem is a special case of Szemerédi's Theorem for the case k = 3. Statement A subset A of the natural numbers is said to have positive upper density if :\\\\limsup_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{A\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{1, 2, 3, \\\\dotsc, n\\\\\\\\}}{n} > 0. > Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions (infinite version): A subset of > the natural numbers with positive upper density contains a 3-term arithmetic > progression. An alternate, more qualitative, formulation of the theorem is concerned with the maximum size of a Salem–Spencer set which is a subset of [N] = \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, N\\\\\\\\}. Let r_3([N]) be the size of the largest subset of [N] which contains no 3-term arithmetic progression. > Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions (finitary version): r_3([N]) = > o(N). Improving upper and lower bounds on r_3([N]) is still an open research problem. History The first result in this direction was Van der Waerden's theorem in 1927, which states that for sufficiently large N, coloring the integers 1, \\\\dots, n with r colors will result in a k term arithmetic progression. Later on in 1936 Erdős and Turán conjectured a much stronger result that any subset of the integers with positive density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In 1942, Raphaël Salem and Donald C. Spencer provided a construction of a 3-AP-free set (i.e. a set with no 3-term arithmetic progressions) of size \\\\frac{N}{e^{O(\\\\log N/\\\\log \\\\log N)}}, disproving an additional conjecture of Erdős and Turán that r_3([N]) = N^{1 - \\\\delta} for some \\\\delta > 0. In 1953, Roth partially resolved the initial conjecture by proving they must contain an arithmetic progression of length 3 using Fourier analytic methods. Eventually, in 1975, Szemerédi proved Szemerédi's theorem using combinatorial techniques, resolving the original conjecture in full. Proof techniques The original proof given by Roth used Fourier analytic methods. Later on another proof was given using Szemerédi's regularity lemma. Proof sketch via Fourier analysis In 1953, Roth used Fourier analysis to prove an upper bound of r_3([N]) = O\\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{\\\\log \\\\log N}\\\\right). Below is a sketch of this proof. Define the Fourier transform of a function f : \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} to be the function \\\\widehat{f} satisfying :\\\\widehat{f}(\\\\theta) = \\\\sum_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}}f(x)e(-x\\\\theta), where e(t) = e^{2\\\\pi i t}. Let A be a 3-AP-free subset of \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, N\\\\\\\\}. The proof proceeds in 3 steps. # Show that a A admits a large Fourier coefficient. # Deduce that there exists a sub- progression of \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, N\\\\\\\\} such that A has a density increment when restricted to this subprogression. # Iterate Step 2 to obtain an upper bound on A. =Step 1= For functions, f, g, h : \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}, define :\\\\Lambda(f, g, h) = \\\\sum_{x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} f(x)g(x + y)h(x + 2y) > Counting Lemma Let f, g : \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} satisfy \\\\sum_{n > \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}}f(n)^2, \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}}g(n)^2 \\\\le M. Define > \\\\Lambda_3(f) = \\\\Lambda(f, f, f). Then \\\\Lambda_3(f) - \\\\Lambda_3(g) \\\\le > 3M\\\\\\\\widehat{f - g}\\\\_\\\\infty. The counting lemma tells us that if the Fourier Transforms of f and g are \\"close\\", then the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions between the two should also be \\"close.\\" Let \\\\alpha = A/N be the density of A. Define the functions f = \\\\mathbf{1}_{A} (i.e the indicator function of A), and g = \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{1}_{[N]}. Step 1 can then be deduced by applying the Counting Lemma to f and g, which tells us that there exists some \\\\theta such that :\\\\left\\\\sum_{n=1}^N (1_A - \\\\alpha)(n)e(\\\\theta n) \\\\right \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{10}N. =Step 2= Given the \\\\theta from step 1, we first show that it's possible to split up [N] into relatively large subprogressions such that the character x \\\\mapsto e(x\\\\theta) is roughly constant on each subprogression. > Lemma 1: Let 0 < \\\\eta < 1, \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Assume that N > C\\\\eta^{-6} > for a universal constant C. Then it is possible to partition [N] into > arithmetic progressions P_i with length N^{1/3} \\\\le P_i \\\\le 2N^{1/3} such > that \\\\sup_{x, y \\\\in P_i}e(x\\\\theta) - e(y\\\\theta) < \\\\eta for all i. Next, we apply Lemma 1 to obtain a partition into subprogressions. We then use the fact that \\\\theta produced a large coefficient in step 1 to show that one of these subprogressions must have a density increment: > Lemma 2: Let A be a 3-AP-free subset of [N], with A = \\\\alpha N and N > > C\\\\alpha^{-12}. Then, there exists a sub progression P \\\\subset [N] such that > P \\\\ge N^{1/3} and A \\\\cap P \\\\ge (\\\\alpha + \\\\alpha^2/40)P. =Step 3= We now iterate step 2. Let a_t be the density of A after the tth iteration. We have that \\\\alpha_0 = \\\\alpha, and \\\\alpha_{t + 1} \\\\ge \\\\alpha + \\\\alpha^2/40. First, see that \\\\alpha doubles (i.e. reach T such that \\\\alpha_T \\\\ge 2\\\\alpha_0) after at most 40/\\\\alpha + 1 steps. We double \\\\alpha again (i.e reach \\\\alpha_T \\\\ge 4\\\\alpha_0) after at most 20/\\\\alpha + 1 steps. Since \\\\alpha \\\\le 1, this process must terminate after at most O(1/\\\\alpha) steps. Let N_t be the size of our current progression after t iterations. By Lemma 2, we can always continue the process whenever N_t \\\\ge C\\\\alpha_t^{-12}, and thus when the process terminates we have that N_t \\\\le C\\\\alpha_t^{-12} \\\\le C\\\\alpha^{-12}. Also, note that when we pass to a subprogression, the size of our set decreases by a cube root. Therefore :N \\\\le N_t^{3^t} \\\\le (C\\\\alpha^{-12})^{3^{O(1/\\\\alpha)}} = e^{e^{O(1/\\\\alpha)}}. Therefore \\\\alpha = O(1/\\\\log \\\\log N), so A = O(\\\\frac{N}{\\\\log \\\\log N}), as desired. \\\\blacksquare Unfortunately, this technique does not generalize directly to larger arithmetic progressions to prove Szemerédi's theorem. An extension of this proof eluded mathematicians for decades until 1998, when Timothy Gowers developed the field of higher-order Fourier Analysis specifically to generalize the above proof to prove Szemerédi's theorem. Proof sketch via graph regularity Below is an outline of a proof using the Szemerédi regularity lemma. Let G be a graph and X,Y\\\\subseteq V(G). We call (X,Y) an \\\\epsilon-regular pair if for all A\\\\subset X,B\\\\subset Y with A\\\\geq\\\\epsilonX,B\\\\geq\\\\epsilonY, one has d(A,B)-d(X,Y)\\\\leq\\\\epsilon. A partition \\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\\\\\{V_1,\\\\ldots,V_k\\\\\\\\} of V(G) is an \\\\epsilon-regular partition if :\\\\sum_{(i,j)\\\\in[k]^2, (V_i,V_j)\\\\text{ not }\\\\epsilon\\\\text{-regular}} V_iV_j\\\\leq\\\\epsilonV(G)^2. Then the Szemerédi regularity lemma says that for every \\\\epsilon>0, there exists a constant M such that every graph has an \\\\epsilon-regular partition into at most M parts. We can also prove that triangles between \\\\epsilon-regular sets of vertices must come along with many other triangles. This is known as the triangle counting lemma. > Triangle Counting Lemma: Let G be a graph and X, Y, Z be subsets of the > vertices of G such that (X,Y), (Y,Z), (Z,X) are all \\\\epsilon-regular pairs > for some \\\\epsilon > 0. Let d_{XY}, d_{XZ}, d_{YZ} denote the edge densities > d(X,Y), d(X,Z), d(Y,Z) respectively. If d_{XY}, d_{XZ}, d_{YZ} \\\\ge > 2\\\\epsilon, then the number of triples (x,y,z)\\\\in X\\\\times Y\\\\times Z such that > x,y,z form a triangle in G is at least :(1-2\\\\epsilon)(d_{XY} - > \\\\epsilon)(d_{XZ} - \\\\epsilon)(d_{YZ} - \\\\epsilon)\\\\cdot XYZ. Using the triangle counting lemma and the Szemerédi regularity lemma, we can prove the triangle removal lemma, a special case of the graph removal lemma. > Triangle Removal Lemma: For all \\\\epsilon > 0, there exists \\\\delta > 0 such > that any graph on n vertices with less than or equal to \\\\delta n^3 triangles > can be made triangle-free by removing at most \\\\epsilon n^2 edges. This has an interesting corollary pertaining to graphs G on N vertices where every edge of G lies in a unique triangle. In specific, all of these graphs must have o(N^2) edges. Take a set A with no 3-term arithmetic progressions. Now, construct a tripartite graph G whose parts X, Y, Z are all copies of \\\\mathbb{Z}/(2N+1)\\\\mathbb{Z}. Connect a vertex x\\\\in X to a vertex y\\\\in Y if y-x\\\\in A. Similarly, connect z\\\\in Z with y\\\\in Y if z-y\\\\in A. Finally, connect x\\\\in X with z\\\\in Z if (z-x)/2\\\\in A. This construction is set up so that if x,y,z form a triangle, then we get elements y-x, \\\\frac{z-x}{2}, z-y that all belong to A. These numbers form an arithmetic progression in the listed order. The assumption on A then tells us this progression must be trivial: the elements listed above are all equal. But this condition is equivalent to the assertion that x,y,z is an arithmetic progression in \\\\mathbb{Z}/(2N+1)\\\\mathbb{Z}. Consequently, every edge of G lies in exactly one triangle. The desired conclusion follows. \\\\blacksquare Extensions and Generalizations Szemerédi's theorem resolved the original conjecture and generalized Roth's theorem to arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length. Since then it has been extended in multiple fashions to create new and interesting results. Furstenberg and Katznelson used ergodic theory to prove a multidimensional version and Leibman and Bergelson extended it to polynomial progressions as well. Most recently Green and Tao proved the Green-Tao Theorem which says that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Since the prime numbers are a subset of density 0, they introduced a \\"relative\\" Szemerédi theorem which applies to subsets with density 0 that satisfy certain pseudorandomness conditions. Later on Conlon, Fox, and Zhao strengthened this theorem by weakening the necessary pseudorandomness condition. In 2020, Bloom and SisaskThomas F. Bloom, Olof Sisask, Breaking the logarithmic barrier in Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions, arXiv:2007.03528, 2020 proved that any set A such that \\\\sum_{n \\\\in A} \\\\frac{1}{n} diverges must contain arithmetic progressions of length 3; this is the first non-trivial case of another conjecture of Erdős postulating that any such set must in fact contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Improving Bounds There has also been work done on improving the bound in Roth's theorem. The bound from the original proof of Roth's theorem showed that :r_3([N]) \\\\leq c\\\\cdot\\\\frac{N}{\\\\log\\\\log N} for some constant c. Over the years this bound has been continually lowered by Szemerédi, Heath-Brown, Bourgain, and Sanders. The current (July 2020) best bound is due to Bloom and Sisask who have showed the existence of an absolute constant c>0 such that :r_3([N]) \\\\leq \\\\frac{N}{(\\\\log N)^{1+c}}. There has also been work done on the other end, constructing the largest set with no three-term arithmetic progressions. The best construction has not been improved since 1946 when Behrend improved on the initial construction by Salem and Spencer and proved :r_3([N]) \\\\geq N\\\\exp(-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\log N}) so the gap between the two bounds is still quite large. Roth's Theorem in Finite Fields As a variation, we can consider the analogous problem over finite fields. Consider the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_3^n , and let r_3(\\\\mathbb{F}_3^n) be the size of the largest subset of \\\\mathbb{F}_3^n which contains no 3-term arithmetic progression. This problem is actually equivalent to the cap set problem, which asks for the largest subset of \\\\mathbb{F}_3^n such that no 3 points lie on a line. The cap set problem can be seen as a generalization of the card game Set. In 1982, Brown and Buhler were the first to show that r_3(\\\\mathbb{F}_3^n) = o(3^n). In 1995, Roy Mesuhlam used a similar technique to the Fourier-analytic proof of Roth's theorem to show that r_3(\\\\mathbb{F}_3^n) = O\\\\left(\\\\frac{3^n}{n}\\\\right). This bound was improved to O(3^n/n^{1 + \\\\epsilon}) in 2012 by Bateman and Katz. In 2016, Ernie Croot, Vsevolod Lev, Péter Pál Pach, Jordan Ellenberg and Dion Gijswijt developed a new technique based on the polynomial method to prove that r_3(\\\\mathbb{F}_3^n) = O(2.756^n). {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {F} _{q}^{n}} with no three-term arithmetic progression journal=Annals of Mathematics, Second Series volume=185 issue=1 pages=339–343 doi=10.4007/annals.2017.185.1.8 arxiv=1605.09223 year=2016 }} {\\\\displaystyle Z_{4}^{n}} are exponentially small arxiv=1605.01506 year=2016 }} The best known lower bound is approximately O(2.2^n), given in 2004 by Eden. Roth's Theorem with popular differences Another generalization of Roth's Theorem shows that for positive density subsets, there not only exists a 3-term arithmetic progression, but that there exist many 3-APs all with the same common difference. > Roth's theorem with popular differences: For all \\\\epsilon > 0, there exists > some n_0 = n_0(\\\\epsilon) such that for every n > n_0 and A \\\\subset > \\\\mathbb{F}_3^n with A = \\\\alpha3^n, there exists some y eq 0 such that > \\\\\\\\{x : x, x + y, x + 2y \\\\in A\\\\\\\\} \\\\ge (\\\\alpha^3 - \\\\epsilon)3^n. If A is chosen randomly from \\\\mathbb{F}_3^n, then we would expect there to be \\\\alpha^33^n progressions for each value of y. The popular differences theorem thus states that for each A with positive density, there is some y such that the number of 3-APs with common difference y is close to what we would expect. This theorem was first proven by Green in 2005, who gave a bound of n_0 = \\\\text{tow}((1/\\\\epsilon)^{O(1)}), where \\\\text{tow} is the tower function. In 2019, Fox and Pham recently improved the bound to n_0 = \\\\text{tow}(O(\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon})). A corresponding statement is also true in \\\\mathbb{Z} for both 3-APs and 4-APs. However, the claim has been shown to be false for 5-APs.

Over the course of a weekend they must attempt to sell as much food as possible to make profit. Along with selling food teams must also participate in a variety of challenges which can either help or harm them by having positive or negative responses based on the challenge results.

Operated by Brad and Eddie, along with friend/\\"marketing genius\\" Mike, these three chefs usually work in galley kitchens, so they're used to working in small stations; making a food truck operation a breeze. Creole Queens, New Orleans, Louisiana – An all female team of married couple Tryshell and Raven, with extra support from their friend Ariana. This is the first team in the race's history to be operated by a same- sex couple, these girls bring both the party and the culture of The Big Easy with food, love, and the overall experience found in New Orleans. Lia's LUMPIA, San Diego, California – This team consists of head chef Spencer, Tania, and Spencer's sous chef/mother Benelia. Spencer comes from a long line of restaurateurs, with his maternal grandmother being the one to bring Filipino cuisine to San Diego county; and he wants to continue that legacy with his catering company and occasional pop-up restaurants. They specialize in Filipino cuisine, especially Filipino egg rolls or lumpia. Magical Mystery Heroes, Butler County, Ohio – Self-said eclectic cook Matt, his sous chef Hannah, and his cousin/Hannah's husband/frontman Chris are the employees behind this food truck. Their menu, as Matt calls it, is a \\"little bit of a mystery\\", as they change the theme of their menu every day. Matt himself even says, \\"We may serve sandwiches one day, the next day tacos. We like to keep it fresh.\\" Slap Shot, Bemidji, Minnesota – Another all female team, sisters Annika and Michaela, with their mother Sheila, come from a region with cold temperatures that rival that of New England. With a name as an ode to hockey, they serve up gourmet hockey-rink concessions faire, as the girls aim to give the everyone on the US a taste of the Midwest.

History  The exterior of the indoor ski slope in 2009 Partial view of the ski slope’s exterior in 2020 The American Dream shopping mall was first proposed as Meadowlands Mills in 1994.Hendry, Cheryl Ann. \\"Finding Nature in an Industrial Swamp: A Case Study of New Jersey's Hackensack Meadowlands\\", p. 196, Montana State University, 2017. The mall, later renamed Meadowlands Xanadu, was nearly complete in 2009 when construction stopped due to a lack of funding. The original plans for the mall had included an indoor ski slope, which was advertised as the United States' first indoor Alpine ski resort. On February 1, 2011, following a month of heavy snowfall, observers found that of the slope's eastern wall had been damaged, and a horizontal crease had formed on the wall. Two days later, as workers tried to melt the snow on the ski slope's roof, about of the eastern wall had collapsed under the weight of the snowfall accumulation. In May 2011, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority formalized an agreement with Triple Five Group, which assumed ownership of the mall and renamed it \\"American Dream\\". The ski slope would continue to be built as part of the agreement. The ski slope was rebranded \\"Big Snow\\" in 2015. In 2018, Triple Five announced that the ski slope would open the following December as part of the mall's phased opening, which would take place between 2019 and 2020. In advance of the opening, Big Snow hired 300 workers.

At that time, Waraich Jatt was a addana malik (tenant). The village was deserted when Mughal authority ended in the area in the mid-18th century. The village remained under the Bhangi Misl until the end of eighteen century. During this time, Sardar Chuhar Singh and Rai Singh Bhangi of the village took part in Battle of Sirhind (1764) against Mughal Governor Zain Khan Sirhindi. During the reign of Maharaja Nau Nihal Singh (1839-40), more Waraich Jatt migrated there. They changed the name of the village to Chung, as Chung is another name of the Waraich clan. Since then the village has never been deserted. The village was electrified in 1975.  Guru Nanak Dev University College, Chung On a sprawling campus, the college occupies lush green surroundings. It was established in 2011 as a constituent college of Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar. The college offers degree classes in commerce and science. It operates under the new scheme of the Punjab Government with special purposes of raising the standard of higher education especially in the rural areas. Mela Pir Rodey Shah At a distance of 2 km from the village, there is a tykya of Pir Rodey Shah, where a mela is held on every 4-5 July. A major attraction is the dangal show among the local Pehwans. Invited Punjabi folk singers perform.  Transport Two highways provide access to Chung. These roads intersect at Bhikhiwind. Notables * Sardar Chuhar Singh.

The Act regulates matters regarding freedom of press and principle of public access to official records. The Freedom of the Press Act as well as the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (Swedish: Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) is one of the two \\"basic media acts\\" in Sweden. The Freedom of the Press Act is derived from the Freedom of the Press Act of 1766; the legislation is regarded as the world's first law supporting the freedom of the press and freedom of information. In its first version, it brought freedom of the press in Sweden - then under the Holstein-Gottorp monarchy - to a level then only rivaled by the liberal Dutch republic and the United Kingdom of the Bill of Rights of 1689.  History   Freedom of the Press Act of 1766 and the Age of Liberty  Following the death of King Charles XII in 1718, the Swedish throne was passed to a series of weak kings. During Adolf Frederick's weakened rule in the age of liberty of the Swedish 18th century with its absence of a single governor, greater decision-making space for the parliament, and decline of the monarchy led to an increase in the importance of the Riksdag. Though the Riksdag retained its four chambers—for nobility, clergy, townsmen, and farmers—it developed two strong parties known as the “Hats” and the “Caps.” In 1765 the Swedish government initiated a comprehensive revision of the constitution. The Ostrobothnian priest Anders Chydenius was a driving force and author behind one of the three pleas for freedom of the press submitted to parliament. In his writing, he concludes: > No evidence should be needed that a certain freedom of writing and printing > is one of the strongest bulwarks of a free organization of the state, as, > without it, the estates would not have sufficient information for the > drafting of good laws, and those dispensing justice would not be monitored, > nor would the subjects know the requirements of the law, the limits of the > rights of government, and their responsibilities. Education and ethical > conduct would be crushed; coarseness in thought, speech, and manners would > prevail, and dimness would darken the entire sky of our freedom in a few > years. Under the leadership of the Anders Chydenius, the Caps at the Swedish Riksdag in Gävle on December 2, 1766, passed the adoption of a freedom of the press regulation that stopped censorship and introduced the principle of public access to official records in the Swedish authority. Excluded were defamatory of the king's majesty and the Swedish Church.  King Gustav III revisions  At the time of King Gustav III accession, the Swedish Riksdag held more power than the monarchy; however, the Swedish Riksdag was divided between the two rival parties: the Hats and Caps. The subsequent attempts of the dominant Caps to reduce him to a roi fainéant (a powerless king) encouraged him to consider a coup d'état. In 1772, King Gustav III seized power through a coup d’état. Two years later, the Act was largely rolled back when he presented an alternative Freedom of the Press Act, leaving it effectively to the king's discretion to decide what could be legally printed by inversing the basic premise; rather than promoting the liberty of anything not explicitly deemed illegal, the Act only protected that which was not prescribed verbatim as legal, in effect undercutting its protections. Penalties were made more severe and violations could, in many cases, lead to execution. The new act also introduced strong limitations on the principle of access to public information. The Act was continually revised to strengthen the grip of the government, the last made in 1790, in the wake of the very recent French Revolution. Freedom of speech, not explicitly protected by the act (and not by the Constitution until 1992) was also severely curtailed.The Free Speech Act was passed in 1991 and came into force on January 1, 1992. In spite of its name, it only affects some forms of free speech, being a digital age complement (rather than replacement) to the Freedom of the Press Act, the first of its kind. Free speech for individual citizens and individuals is governed by the Instrument of Government of 1974, although litigation would see no limitations on its restriction through judicial review until the 2000s. The most effective free speech guarantee in Swedish law hitherto would be the European Convention on Human Rights, ratified in 1952 and in force since 1953.  Restoration and the House of Bernadotte  The Act was replaced by a 1792 version, following Gustav's death, which arguably eased some restrictions and entered the principles of publicity of information, a crucial concept in Swedish constitutional law. It was finally replaced by the 1809 Freedom of the Press Act (alongside the lines of the liberal 1809 Constitution which was itself replaced by a more reactionary 1812 version under the then-Crown Prince Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who ascended to the throne as Charles XIV John in 1818. It most notably allowed the right of the state, under certain circumstances, to rescind (indragningsmakten) the rights of any individual paper. This power was frequently exercised under Charles' rule, and circumvented, most notably by the newspaper Aftonbladet, which between 1835 and 1844 was banned numerous times. The newspaper's editor, Lars Johan Hierta, avoided the ban by founding a new newspaper after every conviction, eventually succeeding by avoiding prosecution for the \\"Twenty-Seventh Aftonbladet\\", technically a separate publication than the manifold preceding it (initially using monikers such as \\"The New Aftonbladet\\" and \\"The Newer Aftonbladet\\". After Charles' death in 1844, this practice ceased, and free press prevailed. The power to rescind, with increasing legal limitations and technicalities, long survived Charles XIV John and was ended only with the current 1949 version of the Act. A major revision was made in 1937, containing most of the provisions associated with the current law and, most notably, enshrining the principle of publicity of information.  Freedom of the Press Act of 1949  In 1949 the law was revised, but its main principles are still the same as in 1766.

He has toured the United States with his one-man show, Spiritrials, since 2015, first gaining prominence when appearing twice on HBO's Russell Simmons presents Def Poetry Jam. As a CalArts artist-in-residence he has further developed Spiritrials with director Roberta Uno and choreographer Toran Moore to create the project Try/Step/Trip which he has performed at venues such as Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, San Francisco's CalArts Center for New Performance, and the American Conservatory Theater. Since 2004, Brathwaite has toured over 200 colleges throughout the United States and Europe with the ill-Literacy artists collective and been a featured performer at the Los Angeles Get Down Festival. He has toured nationally and internationally with the hip-hop theater production of Word Becomes Flesh and Scourge, both under the direction of Marc Bamuthi Joseph. Additional collaborations include a track with acclaimed Bay Area rapper George Watsky and performances with Princess Cut. Brathwaite is a presenter through the CalArts initiative ArtChangeUS: Arts in a Changing America and a U.S. State Department International Exchange Fellowship's OneBeat Fellow, through which he has performed for the State Department's hip-hop diplomacy program, Next Level. The role, which placed him on Team Uzbekistan, has taken him to Guatemala, Israel, Nigeria, the Philippines, Turkey, and the Dominican Republic. Early life Brathwaite is a Sacramento native and currently resides in Long Beach, California. Religion Brathwaite was raised Catholic which segued into what he describes as \\"a traditional Black church where folks, you know, catch the Holy Ghost and run up to the altar and speak in tongues.\\" This experience caused him to \\"contextualize Christianity in the historical sense,\\" testing, and ultimately losing, his belief in the faith. It was with his encounter with the law, having been racially profiled and brought to court, that solidified his agnosticism, and that he was no longer Christian; the experience reignited his troubled sensibility over rituals that are never explained. Brathwaite has cited Judaism as a religion that he believes does a better job at linking historical and biblical events to religious practice. In an April 2019 Medium article, Brathwaite describes his current spiritual practice: \\"On every good day, on every day that I'm not rushed, I get on my floor and I meditate for 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes longer. Then get on my knees and stretch, and then pray. And sometimes when I do it so much, that that's when the ritual has to be made new again. \\"I started those rituals when I started this play and that was my way of sampling. Because meditation was an Eastern practice, and the way that I stretch probably looks like Islamic prayer to some people, and then I pray sometimes just in that Catholic form. Lately, even though my prayers are structured and I have a thing that I usually say all the time, I’ve been trying to invoke kind of that Pastor spirit, that spirit that I’ve learned from the black church, in terms of a crazy desperate plea for more faith.\\" \\"Art is a type of spirituality for me. As I'm trying to discover what art does again, that is that prayer that I'm asking for: more faith, to believe in more, to believe in what I don't see and what I can't plan out.\\" Education Dahlak attended the University of California, Davis, earning his Bachelor's degrees in English and Dramatic Art in 2008. While a student, he and Adriel Luis, Nico Cary, Ruby Veridiano-Ching, and others formed the spoken word group ill-Literacy. As of 2019, Brathwaite and the group still tour. Also while a UCD student, Brathwaite appeared twice on HBO's Russell Simmons presents Def Poetry Jam, on which he shared a bill with Talib Kweli, Lauryn Hill, Lyfe Jennings, Dave Chappelle, and others. During this time, Brathwaite performed in UC Davis Department of Theatre & Dance productions such as The Island, directed by Professor Peter Lichtenfels, and participated in projects like a Youth Radio series helmed by reporter Anyi Howell. Career Brathwaite's works reflect the modern age's struggle with the intersection of race, religion, law enforcement, and mass incarceration. Fresh out of college in 2008, Brathwaite was pulled over by a police officer while driving in a case of racial profiling. The officer found four stems of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Brathwaite's vehicle and arrested him; Brathwaite was subsequently made out to be an addict in court, even though he was not, and was placed in a court- mandated drug rehabilitation program, with the threat of a felony hanging over him if he did not comply. This provided the impetus for his 70-minute one-man show and LP by the same name, Spiritrials, which he developed in 2010 and proceeded to tour across the United States. As of May 2019, he had performed the show in 35 U.S. states. Venues have included Los Angeles's REDCAT Theatre; Sonoma State University's Persons Theater; Arizona's Mesa Arts Center; the Price Center at the University of California, San Diego; Georgia Tech; Florida's Asolo Repertory Theatre; the Greenway Court Theatre; Connecticut's University of Saint Joseph; and Montana's Myrna Loy Theatre. Also by May 2019, Brathwaite had brought the show to Brazil and South Africa. Since 2013, he has been touring nationally and internationally with a production of Word Becomes Flesh, playing venues including the University of Massachusetts, Amherst's Bowker Auditorium; Northeastern University; the Theater Alliance of Washington, D.C.'s Anacostia Playhouse, the University of Chicago; Virginia's Middlebury University; Philadelphia's Painted Bride Art Center; Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis, and other venues.

The shrine was built on the grounds of the Shaheed Ganj Mosque, leading to a legal dispute over ownership that began in 1850. British, and later Pakistani, courts upheld the right of Sikhs to maintain a place of worship at the site. While a settlement was being negotiated by British authorities, a group of Sikhs demolished the mosque on 7–8 July 1935, triggering communal riots. Location The gurdwara is located at Naulakha Bazaar of Lahore near Shaheed Gunj Gurdwara.  History  The gurdwara was built on the grounds of the Shaheed Ganj Mosque, which was dedicated in 1722 by Falak Beg Khan. The mosque was built on the premises of the shrine to the Sufi saint Pir Shah Kaku. After Sikh rule began in Lahore in 1762 under the Bhangi Misl, Muslims were forbidden from entering the site, and a small new gurdwara to commemorate the execution site of Bhai Taru Singh was built next to the mosque building and shrine of Pir Shah Kaku. Sikhs did not demolish the mosque immediately, but instead used it as the residence of the granthi priest of the gurdwara. Muslims began to petition British courts for ownership of the site, after the Sikh Empire was defeated in 1849. Significance A diorama of Bhai Taru Singh being executed at the site The shrine (\\"shaheedi asthan\\") is believed to be situated at the place where Bhai Taru Singh was executred in 1745 by Zakariya Khan when he had his head scalped rather than cutting his hair or converting to Islam. According to Sikh sources, after cutting Bhai Taru Singh's scalp Zakaria Khan was stricken with unbearable pain and the inability to urinate. As a last resort, Khan sent an apology to the Khalsa Panth for his persecution of Sikhs and begged for forgiveness. It was suggested that if Khan hit himself with Bhai Taru Singh's shoes his condition might be lifted. Although hitting himself with Bhai Taru Singh's shoe did cure the Khan's condition, he died 22 days later from having hit himself with the shoes, which is what Bhai Taru Singh had predicted. Upon hearing the death of Khan and that he had outlived the Khan, Taru Singh also died on 1 July 1745.  Disputes  Shortly after the commencement of British rule in 1849, the first petitions for retrieval of the mosque were made by Nur Ahmad in 1849. British authorities cited the existence of the Bhai Taru Singh shrine as reason for maintaining the status quo, and Sikhs were allowed to continue worshipping at the site. The entire site was handed to the Sikh community on 22 December 1927 by British authorities. Another appeal against Sikh ownership by the secretary of Anjuman-e-Islam, Syed Mohsin Shah, was rejected in 1934, and the mosque demolished on 8 July 1935, while negotiations with Muslims were ongoing. The act triggered communal riots in Lahore. In 1938, another appeal against Sikh occupation of the site was rejected. Fazl-i-Hussain, Prime Minister of Punjab under British rule, advised Muslims to give up claims to the site, and believed communal agitation would harm the cause of the pro- British Unionists. After independence, the Sikh temple was abandoned and came under the control of the Pakistani government. Another appeal in 1950 to reclaim the land for Muslims was rejected, and Muslims were barred from converting the site into a mosque. Another appeal in the 1980s was also rejected. The site was handed back to the Sikh community by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. A new and larger gurdwara building was built on the grounds of Gurdwara Bhai Taru Singh in 2004. Since 2012, the Market committee of Naulakha Bazaar led by Sohail Butt group has allegedly encroached upon more than 90% land of Gurdwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh by constructing a Mazar ishrine nside the Gurdwara complex, and separated the Gurdwara by cloth partition leaving 18 to 20 square yard of land out of original 600 square yard land. On 16 July 2011, Sikhs were not allowed to pray at Gurdwara by Muslims because to holy day Shab e-Barat and the martyrdom anniversary of Bhai Taru Singh fell on the same day.  July 2020  In July 2020, a cleric and shopkeep named Sohail Butt claimed in a video the land belonged to the shrine of the Shah Kaku and to the previous mosque. He also alleged that Gopal Chawla, the former chief of Pakistan Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, had threatened to occupy the shrine of Pir Shah Kaku without proof of ownership of the site. Butt in 2012 had been accused of leading efforts to encroach upon land allocated to the gurdwara. After Butt's threats, some Indian newspapers reported that Pakistan planned to convert the gurdwara into a mosque. The Chief Minister of the Indian state of Punjab, Amarinder Singh, condemned what he called an \\"attempt\\" to convert the shrine into a mosque. The Government of India's Ministry of External Affairs on 27 July 2020 lodged a protest with the Pakistani High Commission \\"over reports of attempts being made to convert\\" the shrine into a mosque. Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee demanded strict action against Suhail Butt.

It is equally distant from Métro stations Bourse (Line 3) and Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Lines 1 and 7). History The street was named after Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais, the son of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The street was established in 1784 on a part of the former Palais-Royal Garden when the Duke of Orléans had the stone galleries built. At this time, the street was named Passage de Beaujolais. Between 1797 and 1814, the street took the name Rue d'Arcole to commemorate the Battle of Arcole. In 1849, it was briefly named Rue Hoche after General of the Revolutionary Lazare Hoche. Until the mid-19th century, the street was called Rue de Beaujolais-Palais-Royal several times to distinguish it from the other streets with similar names, like Rue de Beaujolais-Saint-Honoré (disestablished 1852) and Rue de Beaujolais-au-Marais.

It is notable for including several previously unseen or newly restored films, including excerpts from the recently discovered version of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin with the original 1925 score by Edmund Meisel. Description Dreams Rewired is an assemblage of nearly 200 films, ranging from the 'pre-cinematic' experiments of Étienne-Jules Marey and the political cinema of Dziga Vertov, through to newsreels and early dramatic works by Alice Guy-Blaché. A voiceover text articulates the footage for contemporary contexts, drawing on the language of digital culture and social media. Eschewing a traditional; chronology of technological development, the film traces several trajectories through the electric information age, including that of the changing economic and cultural status of women. In her essay accompanying the DVD release, film theoretician Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen describes it as an 'extended meditation on media, desire, and futurity [... that] transparently uses a double exposure of past (archive footage) and present (contemporary voiceover) to bring historical context to current dilemmas.'

The species was named by the German biologist Theodor Hartig, in 1843 and is found in Europe. Description of the gall The asexual generation is a 10–20 mm spherical gall, found from late-May through to October when it matures. Found on the terminal bud of a branch, it is initially green and as it matures darkens to dark brown; falling to the ground in the winter. The gall is found on Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), downy oak (Quercus pubescens) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Oak gall wasps often have two generations per cycle, with one sexual and one asexual; each creating different galls. According to Milan Zúbrik et al (2013), the sexual generation of the gall is unknown, but likely to be on Turkey oak (Quercus cerris). A very small, ovoid gall on the catkins of Turkey oak may be the sexual generation. Distribution This species has been found in some western and central European countries but is absent from Belgium, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. It has recently been found in Great Britain. A 2013 gall found on Trengwainton Carn, near Penzance, Cornwall was initially identified as Andricus inflator. According to Dr C Leach of the British Plant Gall Society, it is more likely to be A. infectorius.

These investigations are considered offshoots of the original phased investigations.  Background  Operation Car Wash () is an ongoing investigation into money laundering and political corruption in Brazil, which has been led by investigative judges, and carried out by the Federal Police. Since its initiation in March 2014, many supplemental investigations that were offshoots of the original one have been conducted by the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Police from documents collected from search warrants, depositions from condução coercitiva warrants, and documents and testimony obtained through plea bargaining (). It has resulted in more than a thousand judicial warrants being served for three investigative judges. Politicians from Brazil's largest parties, including former presidents of Brazil, presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate, and state governors are involved, as well as businessmen from large Brazilian companies. Originally a money laundering investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. At the time Petrobras had more debt and a higher market valuation that any other corporation. It accounted for more than an eighth of all investment in Brazil. The investigation is called \\"Operation Car Wash\\" because it was first uncovered at a car wash in Brasília. The Federal Police have called it the largest corruption investigation in the country's history. The investigation later spread well beyond its origins in the state of Rio de Janeiro to include systemic kickbacks in many sectors and levels of the Brazilian business world. More than £1.4 billion was siphoned from the economy, but Global Witness says that the cost to the country is as much as 800% more. The goal of the investigation is to ascertain the extent of a money laundering scheme, estimated to be (US$– billion), largely through embezzlement of Petrobras funds. At least eleven other countries, mostly in Latin America, were involved, and the Brazilian companies JBS S.A. and Odebrecht were also deeply implicated.Kurtenbach, S., & Nolte, D. (2017). Latin America's Fight against Corruption: The End of Impunity. GIGA Focus Lateinamerika, (03).  In Brazil   2015  = Operation Politeia = Fernando Collor (2017) Casa da Dinda On 14 July 2015, the Federal Police started Operation Politeia, issuing 53 search and seizure warrants at the homes of politicians involved in the Petrobras corruption scheme. After searches at 40 addresses in seven different states (including the Federal District), the Federal Police seized three luxury cars at the ' mansion owned by Fernando Collor de Mello and R$ 3.67 million ($) in cash. In addition to Collor search and arrest warrants were served on Senators Fernando Bezerra Coelho (PSB-PE) and (PP-PI), Federal Deputy (PP-PE), former Minister of Cities Mário Negromonte (PP-BA) and former Federal Deputy (PP-SC). = Arrest of Delcídio do Amaral = Senador Delcídio Amaral, from Agência Brasil (2008).

Police said in 2015 that they had found evidence of $15 million in bribes related to the purchase of the refinery Petrobras first held a 50% share of the refinery, then later bought the other half as well, as a result of a dispute with its partner, Astra Oil, which had purchased the entire refinery in 2005 for US$42.5 million. A year later Petrobras bought a half interest in the refinery for US$360 million. They wound up paying $820.6 in 2012 when a US court enforced a provision of the sales contract. In January 2019 Petrobras signed a sale agreement for their interest in Pasadena Refinery, as well as three refineries he in Brazil, Abreu e Lima (RNEST), (RLAM), Presidente Getúlio Vargas (REPAR) and Alberto Pasqualini (REFAP). Cervero was sentenced 17 August 2015 to 12 years in prison for money laundering and corruption for a bribe paid to the speaker of the lower house by Samsung Heavy Industries for two drillship contracts. Cervero had previously been sentenced to five years for using a shell company to launder money stolen from Petrobras and buy a luxury apartment in Rio de Janeiro. Petrobras fired him in 2014. According to investigators, Delcídio offered Cerveró an opportunity to escape, so that he wouldn't testify against him in return for a reduced sentence. The authorities saw this as an attempt to obstruct justice. A recording made by Cerveró's son showed the Senator's intention to interfere in the investigations and offer the former executive escape so that he would not talk. In addition to Delcídio do Amaral and his chief of staff, two others were also arrested in the affair; banker André Esteves, then CEO of BTG Pactual, and Nestor Cerveró's defense lawyer Edson Ribeiro.

The Portuguese name of the operation, , is a reference to a puppeteer that controls marionettes, only moving the strings, without ever appearing in view. According to the prosecutors, this was Astério's function in the criminal organization. = Operation Favorite = On 14 May 2020, the Federal Police launched a new phase of Car Wash, baptized Operation Favorite, in Rio de Janeiro, with the arrest of former state representative Paulo Melo, businessman Mário Peixoto and three other people, with indications that the businessman's group was interested in doing business in field hospitals, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. 1.5 million reals were seized at the home of one of the targets of the investigation. The targets were allegedly the units set up by the state (with public money) in Maracanã, São Gonçalo, Duque de Caxias, Nova Iguaçu, Campos, and Casimiro de Abreu. The criminal organization allegedly embezzled health care funds, in collusion with state audit court advisors, state deputies, and other public officials. = Operation Let There Be Light = On 25 June 2020, the Federal Police launched Operation Let There Be Light (), which investigated bribery at Eletrobras. Among those under investigation was Silas Rondeau, former Minister of Mines and Energy in Lula's] government. Twelve arrest warrants were issued in the operation, and eighteen search and seizure warrants were served in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Brasília.  Abroad  Car Wash operations outside Brazil began after Odebrecht S.A. and Braskem admitted in a leniency agreement filed with the US Department of Justice that they paid bribes abroad totaling more than one billion dollars. During the investigations of Operation Car Wash, whistle blowers reported crimes in several other countries in Europe, Africa and the Americas. According to experts, four principles allowed corruption schemes to spread in Latin America and around the world: the privileges granted to companies in Brazil; presidential diplomacy of the Lula administration which facilitated the operations of these companies abroad; allocation of funds from the Brazilian Development Bank for projects involving Brazilian contractors abroad; and the actions of marketers as intermediaries. * Angola – The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) said it would internally investigate allegations made by Odebrecht whistleblowers regarding favoring the company in Angola and hiring a consultancy for R$12 million ($) at the request of Luiz Eduardo Melin de Carvalho, then chief of staff of the then Minister of Finance, Guido Mantega. Melin had previously been the international and foreign trade director at BNDES. Another inquiry was to investigate the testimony of Emilio Odebrecht, who said he had asked former President Lula to use his influence to get Odebrecht favorable treatment in the country. * Antigua and Barbuda – Brazilian businessmen said they used third parties to acquire a subsidiary of Viennese Meinl Bank in Antigua and Barbuda to facilitate the concealment of illegal transfers that could reach US$1.6 billion. The executives were linked to Odebrecht and the brewery company Grupo Petrópolis. The information was made public in June 2016, during Operation Xepa, the 26th phase of Operation Car Wash. * Argentina – Odebrecht made illicit payments of US$35 million to intermediaries linked to at least three infrastructure projects between 2007 and 2014 under the government of Cristina Kirchner. * Chile – Publicist Duda Mendonça said in an award-winning accusation that Brazilian contractor OAS funded the Michelle Bachelet presidential campaign in 2013. She governed Chile from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018. Now United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Bechelet denies any ties to OAS. Also in the 2013 campaign, the contractor allegedly loaned an executive jet to another candidate, the defeated Marco Enríquez Ominami, to travel the country. * Colombia – The contractor spent about US$11 million on middlemen between 2009 and 2014, even involving the name of President Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016. Senator Otto Bula, arrested 14 January was accused of receiving US$4.6 million in bribes to award the Brazilians a no-bid contract to build the Ocaña-Gamarra freeway. * Cuba – Marcelo Odebrecht revealed, in a deposition given in exchange for a reduced sentence, that former President Lula and Minas Governor Fernando Pimentel (PT-MG) acted politically to make it possible for the group to obtain contracts for work at the Port of Mariel, Cuba. Lula was already being investigated for influence peddling involving the contracts. The venture was budgeted at US$957 million, of which US$682 million came from the Brazilian Development Bank. [24] * Dominican Republic – According to the US Justice Department, bribery was practiced over 13 years from 2001 to 2014. Odebrecht is still under investigation for paying US$92 million in bribes to public officials in the Dominican Republic in this period. In January, the construction company's general manager in the Dominican Republic was questioned by the country's Attorney General. The period investigated covers the terms of three presidents: Hipólito Mejía (2000-2004), Leonel Fernández (2004-2012) and Danilo Medina, who took office in 2012 and remains in power. * El Salvador – Odebrecht says it paid $5.3 million to bankroll two election campaigns for presidential candidate Mauricio Funes, elected in 2009. The payment was allegedly made in 2008 to marketer , who ran Funes' campaign that year.[25] In February 2016 Funes became a defendant in the country's Supreme Court for not justifying personal transactions of over US$600,000. Seven months later, the Nicaraguan government granted Funes political asylum, finding him persecuted as a politician. The case has not yet been tried. (see also: Operation Acarajé) * Ecuador – Bribes were allegedly paid over a decade between 2007 and 2016 in exchange for preferential treatment on construction projects in the country. Odebrecht executives said they gave over US$33.5 million to Ecuadorian politicians during this period. * Guatemala – Odebrecht's operations in the country took place between 2013 and 2015, with estimated expenses of US$18 million in bribes. Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana said she would seek the collaboration of the United States Department of Justice and the Attorney General of Brazil to investigate the payment of bribes to the country's civil servants during the term of former president Otto Pérez Molina, arrested in 2015, accused of pocketing more than 50 percent of all customs revenue in the country. * Mexico – Between 2010 and 2014, the Brazilian contractor paid a total of US$10.5 million to intermediaries in the country. The payment was confirmed by Odebrecht executives in testimony given in exchange for a sentence reduction from the US Department of Justice. * Mozambique – Since July 2015, Brazil and Mozambique have exchanged information on corruption involving Brazilian contractors in the African country. In January 2016, Época magazine published a report stating that the Brazilian government authorized the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to provide loans to the Mozambican government to build the Moamba Major dam on the condition that the contractor was Andrade Gutierrez. * Norway – MP Norway also investigated bribes on the order of R$140 million ($) by its companies to former directors of Petrobras. Former employees of the Brazilian state-owned company were suspected of resorting to intermediaries of Scandinavian companies to supply accounts with money from bribes paid to their former directors, political agents and authorities in Brazil, in a collusion and diversion scheme. At the center of the investigation between Norway and Brazil was Sevan Drilling – a company specialized in offshore oil exploration with representation in Rio. * Panama – An alleged US$59 million in bribes under former president Ricardo Martinelli (2009-2014). In July 2016, Lava Jato pointed to the existence of an international money laundering scheme set up by which allegedly acted to illegally open 44 offshore companies in countries with little or no tax on assets. The FPB allegedly acted in conjunction with Mossack Fonseca, of the Panama Papers investigation. * Peru – Odebrecht reportedly disbursed millions in bribes between 2005 and 2014, with US$20 million to build the Interoceanic Highway linking the country to Brazil. The Peruvian prosecution has called for the arrest of former President Alejandro Toledo, who was arrested pre-emptively, and the Brazilian contractor prohibited from operating in the country. * Portugal – Lava Jato has the support, in Brazil, of researchers who worked in Portugal on Operation Marquês, which brought about the jailing in late 2014 of former Prime Minister of Portugal, José Sócrates. In October 2013, Odebrecht funded a trip by former President Lula to Lisbon, in conjunction with the release of a book by Socrates. The contractor justified the trip by saying that they paid for the former Brazilian president's trip because he would participate in a ceremony marking the 25-year anniversary of the founding of Odebrecht. Portuguese officials suspected Lula would be lobbying for the contractor in Portugal. * Venezuela – The charge is of bribes to officials of the government of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, who is still in power. Odebrecht also claims to have paid US$98 million to authorities in the country during the Chávez administration.

They have been shown to regulate signal complex assembly on both their cytoplasmic and extracellular domains through interaction with scaffolding that contains a PDZ domain and adjacent cell's receptors, respectively. JAMs adhere to adjacent cells through interactions with integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1, which are contained in leukocyte β2 and α4β1, which is contained in β1. JAMs have many influences on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, which are primarily moderated by the integrins discussed above. They interact in their cytoplasmic domain with scaffold proteins that contain a PDZ domain, which are common protein interaction modules that target short amino acid sequences at the C-terminus of proteins, to form tight junctions in both epithelial and endothelial cells as polarity is gained in the cell.  Structure  Based on crystallographic studies conducted with recombinant extracellular mouse JAMs (rsJAM) and human JAMs (hJAM), it has been shown that JAM consists of immunoglobulin-like V-set domain followed by a second immunoglobulin domain that are linked together by a short linker sequence. The linker makes extensive hydrogen bonds to both domains, and the side chain of one of the main linker residues, Leu128, is commonly embedded in a hydrophobic cleft between each immunoglobulin-like domain. Two JAM molecules contain N-terminal domains that react in a highly complementary fashion due to prolific ionic and hydrophobic interactions. These two molecules form U-shaped dimers and salt bridges are then formed by a R(V,I,L)E motif. This motif has been proven to be important in dimer formation and is common among different types of JAMs. It commonly consists of Arg58-Val59-Glu60 located on the N-terminus and can dissociate into monomers based on the conditions of the solution it is exposed to. This motif has been shown to be present in many common variants of JAMs, including rsJAM, hJAM, JAM-1, JAM-2, and JAM-3.  Types  Three major JAM molecules interact with various molecules and receptors within the body: Tight junctions are formed from action of different JAM proteins working in conjunction. Many of these JAM proteins will be localized in these junctions.  JAM-1  JAM-1 was the first of the junctional adhesion molecules to be discovered and is located in the tight junctions of both epithelial and endothelial cells. JAM-1interacts with cells in a homophilic manner in order to preserve the structure of the junction while moderating its permeability. It can also interact with receptors as a heterophilic structure by acting as a ligand for LFA-1 and facilitating leukocyte transmigration. JAM-1 also plays a significant role in many different cellular functions, including being both a reovirus and a platelet receptor.  JAM-2  Like JAM-1, JAM-2 also is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. JAM-2 localization is moderated by serine phosphorylation at tight junctions as the molecule adheres to other tight junction proteins like PAR-3 and ZO-1. JAM-2 has been shown to interact with these proteins primarily through the PDZ1 domain and also through the PDZ3 domain. JAM-2 has also shown to act as a ligand for many immune cells and plays a role in lymphocyte attraction to specific organs.  JAM-3  JAM-3 functions similarly to JAM-2 as it is localized around the tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial cells, but has been shown to be unable to adhere to leukocytes in the manner that other JAMs can. Mutations of JAM-3 introns have been shown to lead to brain hemorrhages and development of cataracts. Like JAM-2, JAM-3 has been shown associate with tight junction proteins like PAR-3 and ZO-1. JAM-3 has also been shown to interact with PARD3 (partitioning defective 3 homolog).  Function  JAMs serve many different functions within the cell:  Cell motility  JAMs play a critical role in the regulation of cell movement in multiple different cell types, such as epithelial, endothelial, leukocyte, and germ cells. JAM-1 regulates motility in epithelial cells by moderating expression of β1 integrin protein downstream of Rap1. JAM-1 has been shown to be able to cause cell adhesion, spreading and movement along β1 ligands like collagen IV and fibronectin. JAM-1 also acts to moderate migration of vitronectin in endothelial cells. Vitronectin is a ligand for integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which exhibit selective cooperativity with bFGF and VEGF in the activation of the MAPK pathway. JAM-1 and JAM-3 allow leukocytes to migrate into connective tissue by freeing polymorphonuclear leukocytes from entrapment in endothelial cells and basement membranes. In the absence of JAM-1, these leukocytes cannot moderate β1 integrin endocytosis and cannot be effective expressed on the surface of the cell, which is essential for motility.  Cell polarity  JAM-1 and JAM-3 have significant roles in regulating cell polarity through their interactions with cell polarity proteins. JAM-1, JAM-2, and JAM-3 all interact with PAR-3 to influence cell polarity. PAR-3 is a significant factor in a cell's polarity-regulating complex and regulates polarity in different cell types in many different organisms. All components of the PAR complex are required for tight junction formation between cells, but premature adherens junctions can form without PAR complex components being present. However, these junctions cannot efficiently develop into mature epithelial cell junctions. JAM-3 has also shown to affect cell polarity in spermatids by regulating the localization of cytosolic polarity.  Cell Proliferation  In order to preserve homeostasis of adult tissue, aged cells must be replaced with new cells at varying frequency, depending on the organ. Some organs that require high rates of cellular turnover are the small intestine and the colon. JAM-1 has been shown to regulate the proliferation of cells in the colon. In JAM-1 deficient mice it has been found that the amount of proliferating cells in the colon greatly increased due to the increased proliferation of TA cells. JAM-1 acts to suppress cell proliferation, which is performed by restricting Akt activity. Recent studies have also pointed to JAM-1 to be ability to preserve structural integrity of tissues more so than regulating cell number.  Role in physiological processes  JAMs play a significant role in many diverse physiological processes within the human body, including:  Tight junction formation  Tight junctions serve to provide most of the function for the barrier that is present on epithelial cell surfaces. Tight junctions feature the localization of both JAM-1 and JAM-3, and JAM-3 is localized exclusively at tight junctions. The role of JAM-1 in tight junction biology is to function through mediation partly due to the localization of the Par-αPKC complex at adherens junctions during junction creation. Once the tight junction is formed, many JAM-1 proteins are present, many of which are now phosphorylated at Ser285. JAM-1 also regulates the activity of many different claudins within different epithelial cells.  Angiogenesis  Angiogenesis is the generation of blood vessels from old blood vessels. Studies have shown that proteins found in tight junctions serve as intermediaries that moderate angiogenic signaling pathways. JAM-1 induces proliferation of endothelial cells, which begins the process of angiogenesis. An analysis of JAM-1 showed a correlation between JAM-1 activity and FGF2-induced angiogenesis in both cancerous proliferation or vascular repair.  Male fertility  JAM-3 has been shown to be a primary regulator of the development of spermatids as well as the rest of the male reproductive system. Within the Sertoli cells of the male reproductive system, JAM-3 interacts with JAM-2 to influence the polarity of both round and elongated spermatids. JAM-1 and JAM-2 are also present in and contribute to the polarity of the blood-testis barrier. Studies have also shown that inactivation of JAM-3 has been shown to significantly impede fertility by blocking male germ cell development and proliferation.

Early life and education UNDP logo Raj was raised in Saratoga, California in an Indian American family and attended Saratoga High School and graduated in 2002. He completed his undergraduate studies at University of California, Riverside, participating in a study abroad program at the University of Hong Kong, and graduating in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in political science. At U.C. Riverside he was active in Pi Sigma Alpha, the National Political Science Honor Society, Model United Nations and Amnesty International. He then earned a Masters in International Human Rights as well as a Certificate in Humanitarian Assistance at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver in Colorado. He was honored there with the Brinser Award for humanitarian service. Career After his studies, Raj worked with Amnesty International, serving in Washington, D.C. as the country specialist for Myanmar. Beginning in 2010 he served on Amnesty International’s Board of Directors for a year. He worked for the UNDP for over nine years. The UNDP is engaged in approximately 170 countries and is focused on ending poverty. Raj's work spanned several countries, including Myanmar, South Sudan and Afghanistan.

The way that Anil’s life was cut tragically short underscores the grave dangers that human rights workers in Afghanistan face.

It saw the reelection of incumbent mayor Konstantina B. Lukes, who had been appointed to the position earlier that year after Tim Murray resigned to become Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. Lukes became the city's first elected female mayor as a result of this election. Election system In order to be elected mayor in Worcester, a person must place first in the mayor's race and also finish among the top six in the at-large city council election, being also elected a councilor at large. An individual cannot be elected mayor without additionally winning at at-large city council seat. In addition, the candidate elected to the office of councilor at large who receives the second-highest number of votes for the office of mayor will become vice-chair of the Worcester City Council. Candidates *William Coleman, III, community activist candidate for mayor in 1993, 2001, 2003, and 2005 *Konstantina Lukes, incumbent mayor, Worcester City Council at-large member since 1990, mayoral candidate in 1999 and 2005 *Gary Rosen, Worcester City Council at-large member since 2006 and 1996–97, former five-term Worcester School Committee member *Frederick C. Rushton, Worcester City Council member and attorney Withdrew *Dennis L. Irish, Worcester City Council at-large member *Mike C. Perotto, Worcester City Council at-large member Campaign Lukes saw two strong challengers, Rushton and Rosen. Rather than issues, the election largely focused on the personality and the leadership style of Lukes. Lukes and Rushton were the best-funded candidates. Lukes managed to raise $31,381 for her campaign. Rushton managed to raise $80,000 for his campaign. Despite the fact that Lukes identified as a Democrat, the city's Democratic Party leaders sought to unseat her. They hoped to coalesce opposition to Lukes behind a single candidate, and ultimately Rushton became their candidate. Rushton would ultimately receive most of the endorsements from major Democratic politicians in the region. Rushton's brother-in-law, Worcester County's new District Attorney Joseph D. Early, appeared at campaign events for him, marking the first time in decades that a District Attorney had involved himself in a political campaign. There was an unusually large field of candidates running to be at-large city councilors in 2007. This field large large enough that a primary was mandated for the at- large city council election, which was held in mid-September. Due to the laws requiring that a mayor also be elected an at-large city councilor, anyone who wanted to compete in the mayoral race (whether they had announced yet or not) would need to be on the ballot in the at-large City Council primary and advance to the at-large City Council general election if they hoped to be elected mayor. While it was not at all required that mayoral candidates declare their candidacies before the at-large City Council primary, four candidates already had declared their candidates. After the at-large City Council primary, in which Lukes placed second among all candidates, and Rushton placed third, two of the candidates, dropped-out of the mayoral race. These were Dennis L. Irish and Mike C. Perotto, who had respectively placed fifth and eighth out of all candidates in the at-large City Council primary. This bolstered the Democratic Party's hopes of coalescing opposition to Lukes around a single candidate, which had emerged to be Rushton. Rosen declared his candidacy after the at-large City Council primary, in which he had placed first. Rosen's entrance into the race posed an obstacle to the Democratic Party leadership's hopes of coalescing opposition to Lukes behind a single candidate. As of early October, Lukes and Rushton were the only two candidates with campaign websites. Finances {  - ! Candidate ! Receipts ! Expenditures -  William Coleman III  $854.72  $839.52 -  Konstantina Lukes  $31,381.00  $25,406.41 -  Gary Rosen  $14,631.00  $15,148.94 -  Frederick C. Rushton  $78,668.99  $83,589.73 -  Total  $125,535.71  $124,984.60 } Results The result was narrow enough that a hand-recount was conducted. In the end, only 116 votes separated Lukes and Rushton. , this was the narrowest margin of victory in a Worcester mayoral election since the city started popularly electing its mayors in 1987. Lukes finished second in the at-large city council election. Rosen finished first, Rushton finished fourth, and Coleman finished twelfth. Rushton, by the rules of the city charter, became the vice-chair of the Worcester City Council.

He was Sveriges Television's (SVT) first CEO from 1978 to 1981 and served as Swedish consul general to New York City from 1988 to 1992. Faxén was Swedish ambassador in Tunis and a number of West African countries during the 1990s. Career Faxén was born on 21 November 1930 in Uppsala, Sweden, the son of Lars Faxén, a lector, and his wife Nina (née Stjernfelt). He had his very first journalism job in the 1940s when, for a few summers, he had a temporary work at the Dalpilen newspaper in Falun. He passed studentexamen in 1949 and studied in Uppsala and Stockholm. Faxén was employed by Svenska Dagbladet from 1951 to 1953 and by Norrlandsposten in Gävle in 1953 and in 1955. He was employed by AB Radiotjänst in 1956 (which became Sveriges Radio in 1957) and worked as a program producer from 1959. Faxén made a large number of reporting trips to Africa for Sveriges Radio. Around 1960, Faxén came to Dagens Eko and its foreign editorial staff. He reported from Congo, where he met, among others, Congo's first president, Patrice Lumumba. While delivering his phone reports from Congo's capital Léopoldville, his wife Marianne gave birth to the couple's first child back in Sweden. The chief of Dagens Eko, Per Persson, thought it was crazy that he would have to stay in Congo when he had just become a father and was therefore sent home to Sweden. He was back in Congo at the end of 1961 and witnessed from his hotel room how Swedish fighter aircraft under UN flags attacked the post office in Élisabethville. Faxén also reported on the liberation of Algeria, including the Algiers putsch in which French generals tried to take power over what was then a large French province in North Africa. He was Sveriges Radio's Paris correspondent from 1963 to 1966 and foreign affairs commentator from 1966. He went from radio to television in 1969. Sweden's second TV channel, TV2, was to be started and so was a new news program, Rapport, which was broadcast for the first time on 5 December 1969. Even during his time at Rapport, Faxén traveled extensively. Among other things, he covered the civil war in Jordan, the Black September in 1970. Faxén was then correspondent in Washington, D.C. from 1971 to 1973 where, in addition to covering the 1972 presidential election, he also had to report on the first incidents in the Watergate scandal, which later led to the resignation of President Nixon. Back in Sweden, he was then managing editor of TV2's factual television editorial office from 1973 to 1974. Faxén was then radio program manager from 1974. On 1 July 1978, Sveriges Radio was reorganized into four broadcasting companies under one parent company. Faxén reluctantly accepted the position of CEO of Sveriges Television (SVT) from the radio chief Otto Nordenskiöld. During its first three years as an independent company, SVT had a slightly reluctant CEO who struggled with willful TV channel management and a sometimes partially unsympathetic board of directors. All at a time when new challenges such as competition from satellite TV, cable TV, home video devices and other things started to emerge. In the spring of 1981, Faxén had had enough and in connection with a conference in Ronneby, he announced to SVT's first chairman Lennart Sandgren that he did not want to extend his three-year contract as CEO. Shortly afterwards he received a call from the then Foreign Minister Ola Ullsten, who wondered if Faxén wanted to become a press officer at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He accepted and became director (departementsråd) and was head of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs' press and information unit from 1981 to 1983. In 1984, he was appointed consul general to New York City. Faxén was then ambassador in Tunis from 1988 to 1992 where he several times met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Faxén then had special assignments at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with a position as ambassador from 1992, including West Africa (Niamey and Dakar from 1992, Conakry and Nouakchott from 1993 and Bamako from 1994). He retired in 1995. Personal life In 1957, he married to Marianne Ek (born 1933), the daughter of Gunnar Ek and Margareta (née Eriksson). They one child: Karin (born 1960).

Other estimates of its size are given below, from various sources. Membership According to the Party's own history, Canada's Party of Socialism, in 1925 party membership was about 4,500 people, mainly miners, lumber workers, and railway, farm, and garment workers. Ivan Avakumovic, in The Communist Party in Canada: a history, puts the membership at just under 20,000 in January 1946 (p 176). He says the Party's membership has never exceeded 25,000 (pp 175-76). Avakumovic says that in 1945 the Party had \\"several hundred French-Canadian [i.e., Québec] members\\" (p 256). Avakumovic estimates the membership at 1500 to 3000 during the 1960s.The Communist Party in Canada: a history″ However, the United States Department of State estimated the Communist Party of Canada's membership to be 3500 in the mid 1960s.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122. Proportion of women According to Ivan Avakumovic, women were 12-15 per cent of the Party memnership during the period 1934-38; and 28 per cent in 1951 (p 248). Other indicators of size On the release of Party leader Tim Buck from prison in 1934, the Party held a mass rally attended by an overflow crowd of more than 17,000 supporters and sympathizers in Maple Leaf Gardens. Party press Ivan Avakumovic says that in about the year 1950, the Party's English-language newspaper, the Canadian Tribune, had about 4,000 subscribers at a time (p 210). He says that during the period of about 1937-1950, the Tribune had at one time or another about 75,000 subscribers. In addition to subscriptions, the paper was distributed by free handout and by street sales. The Canadian Tribune was weekly; in January 1961 its size increased to 12 pages from 8 (Avakumovic, p 243). Avakumovic says that, according to a Soviet book, the Tribune's circulation was 9,000 in 1965. Vestnik, a Canadian pro-Communist weekly in Russian, had a circulation of 5,000 (Avakumovic, p 243). In 1961, the Communist Party of Canada's provincial newspaper in British Columbia, the Pacific Tribune, was still published. The Communist Party of Canada also published newspapers in French and eight other languages.Ivan Avakumovic, around page 243. Electoral numbers At its height in the mid-1940s, the Party had fourteen sitting elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal level, including federal Member of Parliament Fred Rose, who was elected in 1945, the year in which the Party's proportion of the federal election vote was its highest ever: 2.13 per cent. The Party ran its most-ever federal candidates in the 1953 election, 100 candidates, but got only 1.06 per cent of the national vote. Those 100 candidates encompassed 7 provinces and included 22 women and 11 \\"youth candidates\\" (Avkumovic, p 221). Sources Ivan Avakumovic, 1975.

It is situated northeast of Pemberton, south-southeast of Mount Gardiner, and east of Mount Oleg, which is its nearest higher peak. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 21, 19796, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Climate Mt. Olds (left) and Mt. Oleg (right) Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Olds is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. This climate supports the Place Glacier on the north slope of Mount Olds. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Olds.

The public health measures introduced to combat the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the competition being delayed. On 17 March, the GAA confirmed that the opening fixture – due to have taken place at Gaelic Park in The Bronx on 3 May – had been postponed. In June the GAA announced that the 2020 championship would be straight knock-out, the first straight-knockout since 2000. Thirty-one teams have been scheduled to take part – thirty-one of the thirty-two Counties of Ireland. New York were unable to participate due to travel restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. London will play no part in the 2020 All-Ireland championships after a meeting of the GAA's Ard Chomhairle on September 12, 2020. London were initially scheduled to host Roscommon at Ruislip at the beginning of May, before all GAA activity was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Michael Maher's team were then set to play their rescheduled Connacht football quarter-final on the weekend of October 31, with the winner facing Mayo or Leitrim the following weekend. Roscommon advanced directly into the semi- final. It emerged that in order for London's quarter-final to take place their entire squad and backroom team would have to self-isolate in Ireland for two weeks prior to the match. Kilkenny, as in previous years, did not enter. Initially the GAA intended to introduce the Tailteann Cup, a second-tier championship for Division 3 and 4 National Football League teams who failed to reach their provincial finals or get promoted to Division 2 of the league. The Tailteann Cup was delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and will be introduced in 2021. Dublin are the defending champions. Competition format Provincial Championships format Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster each organise a provincial championship. Traditionally, some of the teams who lose a match in their provincial championship enter the All-Ireland qualifiers – New York does not enter the qualifiers. All matches are knock-out. If the score is level at the end of the normal seventy minutes, two periods of ten minutes each way are played. If the score is still level the tie goes to a replay. All-Ireland format The four provincial champions compete in the semi-finals. If the score is level at the end of the normal seventy minutes in a semi-final, two periods of ten minutes each way are played. If the score is still level the semi-final is replayed. If the score is level at the end of the normal seventy minutes in the final, the match is replayed. Changes from 2019 competition ; Advanced Mark Initially trialled in the 2019 Leagues, the advanced mark rule was introduced in 2020. The referee awards a mark when a player catches the ball cleanly on or inside a 45m line from a kick in play delivered by an attacking player on or beyond the opposition's 45m line that travels at least 20m and without it touching the ground. The catching player can either signal his intent to stop and take the mark by raising an arm or continue to play on immediately. ; Sin-bin A player who commits a black card offence is sent off the pitch to the sin-bin for ten minutes. Teams are not permitted to replace the player while he is in the sin-bin, leaving them at a numerical disadvantage. If a player commits another black card offence or a yellow card offence after returning to the field he is red-carded. ; Kick-out Goalkeepers must take their kick-out from the 20 metre line (previously kick- outs were taken from the 13 metre line). The ball must be kicked forward and all players must be 13 metres from the ball until it has been kicked. Following a motion proposed by Kildare at the GAA Congress on 28 September 2020, the kick-out rule was further modified so that an outfield player receiving a ball direct from the kick-out cannot play the ball back to their goalkeeper. Unusually, the \\"no back-pass\\" modification was not trialled before its introduction in the 2020 senior championship. Provincial Championships Connacht Senior Football Championship =Matches= Quarter- Finals Semi-Finals Final Leinster Senior Football Championship Leinster Senior Football Championship Munster Senior Football Championship The two teams who won the semi- finals in the previous year are given byes to this year's semi-finals.

Lukes, as she did in the previous election, saw two strong challengers, the two this time being O'Brien and Toomey. O'Brien's candidacy was supported by lieutenant governor and former Worcester mayor Tim Murray. O'Brien was also supported by congressman Jim McGovern, for whom he once served as district director. Many other local Democrats threw their support behind O'Brien. Toomey was endorsed by the Worcester County Sheriff and once of the city's two state senators. The election focused more on the leadership and personality of Lukes than it did on particular issues. O'Brien and Toomey criticized Lukes for being to inactive a mayor, and argued that she was ineffective at advocating for the city at the state and federal level. Lukes refuted accusations that she was too inactive, arguing that the role of mayor was not intended to be a full-time position. Lukes argued that she had independence from what she claimed was a Murray-McGovern run political machine. Lukes argued that O'Brien was simply seeking to use the office of mayor as a platform to seek higher office, and argued that she herself was free from such ambitions. O'Brien pledged to commit attention to inner-city neighborhoods, and called attention to the fact that he resided in the less- affluent Main South area of the city. O'Brien aimed to run a movement-style campaign, seeking small online donations and utilizing the internet to organize campaign events. Lukes raised $33,895 for her campaign. Lukes collected mainly small donations, and solicited her donations primarily by mail. Financially, Lukes ran a low-cost campaign, even using her private law- office to house her campaign headquarters. O'Brien raised $43,300 for his campaign. O'Brien was additionally supported by the grassroots group Neighbor to Neighbor, which funded $6,000 in mailers for his campaign. Toomey raised $33,633 for her campaign. Tsitsilianos did not raise any money for his campaign, and received little attention. However, he did participate in the mayoral debates. Results O'Brien also finished first in the at-large city council election. Toomey finished second, Lukes finished fifth, Tsitsilianos finished eleventh. Lukes, by the rules of the city charter, became the vice- chair of the Worcester City Council. O'Brien was the only non-incumbent individual elected to a citywide office in Worcester that year.

He played baseball and Canadian football, but is best known as one of Canada's finest basketball players. A 2019 profile by TVOntario described him as \\"the greatest Canadian athlete you've never heard of\\". He excelled at many sports, including the abovementioned three. He was a stand-out on his college basketball team and went on to play on semi-pro or pro teams in all three sports. He would likely have been more famous had blacks not been denied opportunities to compete in major professional sports leagues in the 1940s and 1950s. Early life and education Thomas grew up in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He was a fifth-generation Canadian whose ancestry can be traced to enslaved Africans fleeing North Carolina and Barbadian immigrants. His parents were Charles Fred Thomas and Edith May Thomas. He had seven siblings; one brother and six sisters. He was the second oldest and his athletic prowess let him excel at many sports. He attended high school at the J. C. Patterson Collegiate Institute in Windsor, beginning in the late 1930s. He was a football and track star there, competing in hurdles, high jump, sprints, long jump and triple jump. He also led the basketball team to a province championship, beating Ottawa Glebe Collegiate in Toronto for the All- Ontario Basketball Title. He graduated in 1943 and then enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He earned his wings shortly before the end of the war. After being discharged from the service, he enrolled at Assumption College where he became known as one of the country's best basketball players. He played four years under coach Stanley Nantais. In 1945, the Harlem Globetrotters, who were \\"widely considered the best team in the world\\", were defeated by the Assumption basketball team 49–45. A 1952 newspaper article said Thomas \\"was a constant thorn in the side of his visitors\\" and \\"His terrific speed enabling him to leap high into the air after burning down the floor to break up passing plays. His performance was amazing and the most amazed were the confused Globetrotters.\\" In 1949, his senior year, he led the team to the Ontario Senior Men's Finals where they defeated Toronto Central by 90–56, 47 of which he scored himself. At the time, the Toronto Globe and Mail called him the \\"best Negro athlete in Canada.\\" During Thomas's college four- year basketball career (1945-1949), he scored 2,059 points, third highest on the NCAA scoring list at the time of his graduation. This includes a record 639 points in the 48–49 season. His time at Assumption was known as the \\"Thomistic Era\\". The 1952 newspaper article summarized his college basketball career by saying \\"There was probably never a Canadian basketball player who so dominated the key area and was so deadly with the hook shot as Fred. He played the game with the grace of a swan and the agility of a gazelle.\\" Baseball Outside of college, Thomas turned to baseball. He played with the negro league Detroit Senators in 1947 and Farnham Pirates in 1948 in the Quebec Provincial League. Over 58 games with Farnham, he was batting .351 which caught the attention of Major League Baseball (MLB) scouts. He was selected by the organization's Cleveland Indians to join the Wilkes-Barre Barons farm-team who played in the Eastern League, where he took the field for the first time in a July 4, 1948 doubleheader. This appearance was the first by a black player in the league, and he had two singles, and RBI, and a stolen base in the second game. He broke the color barrier in this league about a year after Jackie Robinson did so in Major League Baseball. He was the 21st black player to sign a contract with a team in the MLB organization and the first from Canada. Thomas played 12 games with the Barons in 1949 but never played professional baseball again. Globetrotters Racism prevented him from playing in the professional basketball leagues. He played with the Cincinnati Crescents, a negro all-star barnstorming team owned by Abe Saperstein, who also owned the Harlem Globetrotters. This connection brought him to the Globetrotters and he was invited to their training camp in Chicago in 1949. He arrived late because he had to finish the football season with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League where he was the first black player. He played a season for the New York Renaissance, a Globetrotter all-black professional basketball team from Harlem, New York. After one season, he moved to the western division Kansas City Stars, another Globetrotter team. Later life Thomas won the batting title of the Ontario Intercounty Baseball League in 1951 while playing for the Kitchener Panthers, an independent, semi- professional team where he batted 0.383. and was a Most Valuable Player in this league. He also played for the Windsor Jets and Toronto Beaches. In 1952, he was not selected for the Canadian Olympic basketball team, where he would have been the only black on an otherwise all-white team. After having surgery to repair a knee injury, he could no longer play professional sports but continued to play in smaller independent leagues in Canada. He played basketball for the Toronto Tri-Bells, a Canadian men's amateur team, leading the team to the 1953 Canadian senior men's basketball title. He became a coach and physical education teacher at Valley Park High School in East York, Ontario for over twenty years. Thomas died from cancer on May 20, 1981. Lack of recognition Thomas was known mostly in the Windsor area. He competed during a time of racism in sports just before the beginning of integration. According to William Humber, a historian on Canadian sports, racial barriers prevented Thomas from becoming a national star, as well as kept him relatively unknown. \\"Today, he would have been a star in any of those sports\\" said Humber. According to Miriam Wright, a history professor at the University of Windsor, Southern Ontario was racially segregated like parts of the United States during the Jim Crow era. Thomas and his black teammates were often not served at restaurants and his teams were not allowed to compete with white teams. As a black, he did not have the same opportunities as whites. Wright says that Thomas's story is not well known because \\"African-Canadian history was not something that was considered important or was only considered in the context of the Underground Railroad story.\\" Awards and honors *Voted 2nd in a Canadian Press poll to determine Canada's finest basketball player of the 1900-1949 period. *Windsor/Essex County Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1981) *University of Windsor Alumni Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1986) *Afro- American Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1994) *Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame (inducted 1995) *Fred Thomas Park (formerly Glengarry Park) in Windsor, Ontario, is named after him. *Nominated for the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame *Honored during Black History Month at Windsor Express game, February 22, 2015 Notes References External links *Thomas at the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame Category:1923 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Assumption University (Worcester) alumni Category:Canadian people of African-American descent Category:Canadian people of Barbadian descent Category:Sportspeople from Windsor, Ontario Category:Baseball people from Ontario Category:Basketball people from Ontario Category:Black Canadian baseball players Category:Black Canadian basketball players Category:Players of Canadian football from Ontario Category:Harlem Globetrotters players Category:Toronto Argonauts players ","title":"Fred Thomas (athlete)"},{"id":"62457301","text":"' is a former Imperial Palace located in modern-day Nara Prefecture in the Kansai region of Honshu. It was the imperial residence when the capital was located in Nara. There were at least four palaces constructed on the site.

The building was constructed and finished by autumn 642 CE during the time of Kogyuko, who occupied the building in 643 CE. From 643 to 645 CE, the palace served as the palace during the reign of Empress Kōgyoku when it was moved from Oharida-no-miya. It lost its status as palace when she abdicated the throne. Emperor Kōtoku had returned the imperial residence to the palace, the same palace which was continued by Koyoku as the official residence upon her return and second reign as empress.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 21.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 23. Itabuki Palace is the location of the Isshi Incident. This event saw Japanese statesman Fujiwara no Kamatari, then prince Prince Naka no Ōe, and others conspire in their effort to eliminate the main branch of the Soga clan. This effort successfully cleansed the near-total influence and control the Soga clan had over the imperial family. With the leader Soga no Iruka deceased and the family members dispersed, the prince was made heir apparent. This led to the issuance of issuance of the Taika Reform, a turning point in history that moved feudal Japan into a more centralized government with the Emperor as the Supreme power.  Construction  The palace had a roof with wooden planks instead of the traditional thatch covering. It was built alongside a temple. Archeological work at Asuka in Nara began in 1951 and had unconvered the foundations of the palace.

Strand became a member of the Norwegian Entomological Society in 1920, and he is one of the leading figures in Norwegian entomology. His professional career included work as an administrator, secretary, vice chairman, and accountant. After passing his examen artium, Andreas Strand graduated from the Telegraph School and later joined the Telegraph Service in Haugesund. In 1917 he moved to Kristiania and received a position with the Telegraph Board. Later he worked as head of the foreign affairs department, a position he held until he retired. He became interested in nature and insects at an early age, already in middle school. In 1914, he was in Stavanger, where he met Tor Helliesen, who was the manager of the Stavanger Museum. Helliesen was particularly interested in beetles (Coleoptera) and had a large collection from Rogaland, and he recommended that Strand start collecting beetles. Together they went on an excursion, and Stand was introduced to the collection and preparation of insects. However, it was not until 1917, when he moved to Kristiania, that Strand's interest was seriously awakened. Strand had no formal education in zoology (or entomology), and he said that this was a conscious choice, reckoning that a full-time entomologist had to deal with a lot of paperwork. Strand also took many trips abroad as part of his work in the Telegraph Service, but he did not collect beetles from abroad; he stated that his interest was limited to Nordic species. When abroad, the Telegraph Board delegation was often met by foreign beetle researchers that wanted to meet Strand. Beetles Strand first concentrated on Palearctic ground beetles in the genus Carabus. This collection was later left to Lund University, which already had a large collection of ground beetles collected by Carl H. Lindroth. Strand then concentrated on collecting beetles, especially from northern Norway. He made several contributions to the knowledge of northern Norwegian beetles, the first in 1932. His main work, a book of over 600 pages called Nord-Norges Coleoptera (Northern Norway's Coleoptera), was published in 1946. Strand was skilled at taxonomic details and solved several ambiguities in difficult beetle genres. He contributed to a better overview the systematics of beetle species. Altogether, he described 49 beetle species that were new to science. It is said that Strand would take a cigar box to a meeting of the Norwegian Entomological Society, and in the box was a needle, with a \\"small black dot\\" on it, a small beetle. He could then tell a long story about this \\"dot,\\" such as that it was new to Norway and had previously only been found in the Caucasus or something similar. Strand often used unconventional methods to find beetles. After flood periods in rivers, he collected loose material that was washed ashore. This was carefully examined and often contained large numbers of small insects. He also examined animals' nests, which often yielded rare species. Another method was the use of chicken dung as a bait to attract beetles. He also used to drive a car with a net hanging out of the car window, or moped along forest roads, while holding the net out from the handlebars. This proved to be a good method for catching small swarming beetles. Strand's insect collection with Nordic beetles can be found at the Bergen Zoological Museum. It contains approximately 80,000 specimens, divided into 4,609 species. In addition to the collection itself, Strand's notes and library are also kept at the museum. Honors and awards In 1965, Strand was appointed doctor honoris causa at the University of Bergen. That same year, he received the King's Medal of Merit in Gold for his research achievements. He was an honorary member of the Norwegian Entomological Society and several other Nordic entomological societies. Publications Andreas Strand authored more than 120 publications, most of which were published in the Norwegian Journal of Entomology. Astrid Løken compiled a list of Strand's publications in her article series on Scandinavian entomologists.

Kwasi Panin succeeded his uncle, Atta Obuom, popularly called Obiwom, as a teenager in 1867. He was an allied soldier in the Sagrenti Anglo-Ashanti War in 1874, fighting for the interests of British, led by Major-General Garnet Wolseley. After the war, there was a refugee internal migrant inflow from Juaben. He partnered with colonial officials to remediate the refugee crisis. He instructed one of his sub-chiefs, Nana Ampaw, divisional monarch of Kukurantumi in northeastern Kyebi to provide a parcel of stool land between Kukurantumi and Ejisu to the colonial government for the resettlement of the Juaben refugees who named their new home, New Juaben with their administrative capital at Koforidua. During his reign, Amoako Atta I was accommodating to the Basel missionaries operating in his kingdom, as they had been his tutors a few years prior. School enrollment had skyrocketed by December 1867. Local shamans rejected the establishment of schools in the area. They feared the socio-cultural change that the new learning centres and Christian proselytism had wrought in their culture. In the second half of 1868, missionary activity focusing on freeing palace-owned slaves resulted in rising political strain between the chief and Basel missionaries. As slaves became liberated, baptised and educated, Amoako Atta felt that his authority was being undermined by the Basel Mission, as new Christians lived in their own quarters called Salem.. Furthermore, Amoako Atta I, his sister, Kyerewaa and, the Okyehene’s mother, Ampofoaa, other royal courtiers and traditional state functionaries opposed conversion of domestic slaves to Christianity and the abolition of local slavery as they viewed the practice as a wealth generator for influence peddling. The Basel-trained missionary and Akan linguist, David Asante was the cousin of Amoako Atta and lived in Kyebi as the resident minister. He disagreed vehemently with his relations and preached the egalitarian ideals of freedom and justice which diluted the social hierarchy of African traditional authority. He encouraged the enslaved to defy their owners. By mid-1875, this anti-slavery campaign had led to the liberation of 100 to 200 slaves by David Asante and other Basel missionaries. As tensions escalated, British authorities requested the transfer of David Asante to a different mission station far from Kyebi. The departure of Asante did not repair deteriorated relations between the Basel Mission and the Akyem monarchy. On 14 May 1880, Amoako Atta was convicted of arson, by an Accra court. As punishment, he was exiled to Lagos, Nigeria for a half-a-decade. The exiled Okyehene returned to the Gold Coast on 8 January 1885 and was re-enstooled as chief by popular acclaim of his subjects. At the end of 1886, the king’s money, jewellery, and cloths were stolen from the palace. The natives blamed the catechist of the Kyebi Basel Mission Church, Joseph Bosompem for the pilfering, which culminated in clashes between traditionalists and Christians. In January 1887, the colonial government summoned Amoako Atta to a commission of enquiry set up in Accra to investigate the skirmishes.  Death  He died from exhaustion and pneumonia on 2 February, 1887, before the commission hearings began.

Portrait of Mr Henry William Mobsby, Government Artist and Photographer Department of Agriculture and Stock 1926 Photo courtesy: Queensland State Archives 3761  Early life  Henry William Mobsby (1860-1933) was born on 17 August 1860 in Hove, Sussex, England the son of William Mobsby, a watchman, and his wife Sarah. He was educated at Hampton Place school. He received training in art, design, chemistry and commercial practice at the South Kensington School of Arts, London and the School of Arts, Brighton. He emigrated to Australia in 1883 with artist Isaac Jenner and his family. His brother, Benjamin Mobsby also emigrated with his family to Australia. Henry Mobsby married Jenner's eldest daughter Mary Ellen “Nellie” on 10 September 1884 in Brisbane, Queensland.  Career  Mobsby taught decoration and photography at the Brisbane Technical College. He was appointed an artist and photographer with the Department of Agriculture and Stock in 1897 and the Chief Secretary’s Department and the Intelligence and Tourist Bureau in 1907. He became an assistant to Frederick Wills in 1899, who had been charged by the Queensland government to make an early form of motion picture, a cinematograph, celebrating the state’s primary industries and resources. Within six months Wills and Mobsby had produced thirty 1 minute films of excursions they took around Queensland, the Torres Straits, and topical events such as the Boer War departure of Queensland troops. By 1900 the technology they had used to film these events had already evolved. Mobsby took over as official artist and photographer for the Department of Agriculture in 1904 and continued in this role until 1930. He did not continue with film production, preferring to outsource this work to others. He created exhibitions for annual shows and the Royal National Agricultural Exhibition. Mobsby’s photography gained international recognition when he represented Queensland at the Franco- British Exhibition in London in 1908. He also exhibited at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. He undertook a motion picture certificate course during this exposition. He also exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley in 1924. He exhibited in Dunedin, New Zealand for the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in 1925-1926. Mobsby gave public lectures on Queensland which were illustrated by lantern slides. He also participated in radio broadcasts. He retired in 1930.  Memberships  Fellow, Royal Geographical Society Fellow, Royal Society of Artists, London  Legacy  Mobsby died on 9 April 1933 in Brisbane. He was survived by his wife and daughter Berta, his son Arthur having pre-deceased him in 1905. The Mobsby Memorial medal was created in his son’s name and awarded to Year 8 students at Indooroopilly State School from 1916-1950. Two boxes of his papers, photographs and other materials are held in the University of Queensland Fryer Library and his albums have been digitised. A book describing his life and work was published in 2017. The Lumiere cinematograph is held by the Queensland Museum. Lantern slides of his work are held by the State Library of Queensland.

The key observation is noting that these Ramsey-type theorems can be expressed as the assertion that a certain category (or class of finite structures) has the Ramsey property (defined below). Structural Ramsey theory began in the 1970s with the work of Nešetřil and Rödl, and is intimately connected to Fraïssé theory. It received some renewed interest in the mid-2000s due to the discovery of the Kechris–Pestov–Todorčević correspondence, which connected structural Ramsey theory to topological dynamics.  History  is given credit for inventing the idea of a Ramsey property in the early 70s, and the first publication of this idea appears to be Graham, Leeb and Rothschild's 1972 paper on the subject. Key development of these ideas was done by Nešetřil and Rödl in their series of 1977 and 1983 papers, including the famous Nešetřil–Rödl theorem. This result was reproved independently by Abramson and Harrington, and further generalised by . More recently, Mašulović and Solecki have done some pioneering work in the field.  Motivation  This article will use the set theory convention that each natural number n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} can be considered as the set of all natural numbers less than it: i.e. n = \\\\\\\\{ 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n-1 \\\\\\\\}. For any set A, an r-colouring of A is an assignment of one of r labels to each element of A. This can be represented as a function \\\\Delta: A \\\\to r mapping each element to its label in r = \\\\\\\\{ 0, 1, \\\\ldots, r-1 \\\\\\\\} (which this article will use), or equivalently as a partition of A = A_{0} \\\\sqcup \\\\cdots \\\\sqcup A_{r-1} into r pieces. Here are some of the classic results of Ramsey theory: * (Finite) Ramsey's theorem: for every k \\\\leq m, r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, there exists n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that for every r-colouring \\\\Delta: [n]^{(k)} \\\\to r of all the k-element subsets of n = \\\\\\\\{ 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n-1 \\\\\\\\}, there exists a subset A \\\\subseteq n, with A=m, such that [A]^{(k)} is \\\\Delta-monochromatic. * (Finite) van der Waerden's theorem: for every m, r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, there exists n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that for every r-colouring \\\\Delta: n \\\\to r of n, there exists a \\\\Delta-monochromatic arithmetic progression \\\\\\\\{ a, a+d, a+2d, \\\\ldots, a+(m-1)d \\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq n of length m. * Graham–Rothschild theorem: fix a finite alphabet L = \\\\\\\\{ a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{d-1} \\\\\\\\}. A k-parameter word of length n over L is an element w \\\\in (L \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_{k-1} \\\\\\\\})^n, such that all of the x_i appear, and their first appearances are in increasing order. The set of all k-parameter words of length n over L is denoted by \\\\textstyle [L]\\\\binom{n}{k}. Given \\\\textstyle w \\\\in [L]\\\\binom{n}{m} and \\\\textstyle v \\\\in [L]\\\\binom{m}{k}, we form their composition \\\\textstyle w \\\\circ v \\\\in [L]\\\\binom{n}{k} by replacing every occurrence of x_i in w with the ith entry of v. Then, the Graham–Rothschild theorem states that for every k \\\\leq m, r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, there exists n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that for every r-colouring \\\\textstyle \\\\Delta: [L]\\\\binom{n}{k} \\\\to r of all the k-parameter words of length n, there exists \\\\textstyle w \\\\in [L]\\\\binom{n}{m}, such that \\\\textstyle w \\\\circ [L]\\\\binom{m}{k} = \\\\\\\\{ w \\\\circ v: v \\\\in [L]\\\\binom{m}{k} \\\\\\\\} (i.e. all the k-parameter subwords of w) is \\\\Delta-monochromatic. *(Finite) Folkman's theorem: for every m, r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, there exists n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that for every r-colouring \\\\Delta: n \\\\to r of n, there exists a subset A \\\\subseteq n, with A=m, such that \\\\textstyle \\\\big( \\\\sum_{k \\\\in A} k \\\\big) < n, and \\\\textstyle \\\\operatorname{FS}(A) = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{k \\\\in B} k : B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(A) \\\\setminus \\\\varnothing \\\\\\\\} is \\\\Delta-monochromatic. These \\"Ramsey-type\\" theorems all have a similar idea: we fix two integers k and m, and a set of colours r. Then, we want to show there is some n large enough, such that for every r-colouring of the \\"substructures\\" of size k inside n, we can find a suitable \\"structure\\" A inside n, of size m, such that all the \\"substructures\\" B of A with size k have the same colour. What types of structures are allowed depends on the theorem in question, and this turns out to be virtually the only difference between them. This idea of a \\"Ramsey-type theorem\\" leads itself to the more precise notion of the Ramsey property (below).  The Ramsey property  Let \\\\mathbf{C} be a category. \\\\mathbf{C} has the Ramsey property if for every natural number r, and all objects A, B in \\\\mathbf{C}, there exists another object D in \\\\mathbf{C}, such that for every r-colouring \\\\Delta: \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,D) \\\\to r, there exists a morphism f: B \\\\to D which is \\\\Delta-monochromatic, i.e. the set ::f \\\\circ \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B) = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{ f \\\\circ g: g \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B) \\\\big\\\\\\\\} is \\\\Delta-monochromatic. Often, \\\\mathbf{C} is taken to be a class of finite \\\\mathcal{L}-structures over some fixed language \\\\mathcal{L}, with embeddings as morphisms. In this case, instead of colouring morphisms, one can think of colouring \\"copies\\" of A in D, and then finding a copy of B in D, such that all copies of A in this copy of B are monochromatic. This may lend itself more intuitively to the earlier idea of a \\"Ramsey-type theorem\\". There is also a notion of a dual Ramsey property; \\\\mathbf{C} has the dual Ramsey property if its dual category \\\\mathbf{C}^\\\\mathrm{op} has the Ramsey property as above. More concretely, \\\\mathbf{C} has the dual Ramsey property if for every natural number r, and all objects A, B in \\\\mathbf{C}, there exists another object D in \\\\mathbf{C}, such that for every r-colouring \\\\Delta: \\\\operatorname{Hom}(D,A) \\\\to r, there exists a morphism f: D \\\\to B for which \\\\operatorname{Hom}(B,A) \\\\circ f is \\\\Delta-monochromatic.  Examples  * Ramsey's theorem: the class of all finite chains, with order-preserving maps as morphisms, has the Ramsey property. * van der Waerden's theorem: in the category whose objects are finite ordinals, and whose morphisms are affine maps x \\\\mapsto a + dx for a,d \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, d eq 0, the Ramsey property holds for A=1. *Hales–Jewett theorem: let L be a finite alphabet, and for each k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, let X_k = \\\\\\\\{ x_0, \\\\ldots, x_{k-1} \\\\\\\\} be a set of k variables. Let \\\\mathbf{GR} be the category whose objects are A_k = L \\\\cup X_k for each k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, and whose morphisms A_n \\\\to A_k, for n \\\\geq k, are functions f: X_n \\\\to A_k which are rigid and surjective on X_k \\\\subseteq A_k = \\\\operatorname{codom}f. Then, \\\\mathbf{GR} has the dual Ramsey property for A = A_0 (and B = A_1, depending on the formulation). *Graham–Rothschild theorem: the category \\\\mathbf{GR} defined above has the dual Ramsey property.  The Kechris–Pestov–Todorčević correspondence  In 2005, Kechris, Pestov and Todorčević discovered the following correspondence (hereafter called the KPT correspondence) between structural Ramsey theory, Fraïssé theory, and ideas from topological dynamics. Let G be a topological group. For a topological space X, a G-flow (denoted G \\\\curvearrowright X) is a continuous action of G on X. We say that G is extremely amenable if any G-flow G \\\\curvearrowright X on a compact space X admits a fixed point x \\\\in X, i.e. the stabiliser of x is G itself. For a Fraïssé structure \\\\mathbf{F}, its automorphism group \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\mathbf{F}) can be considered a topological group, given the topology of pointwise convergence, or equivalently, the subspace topology induced on \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\mathbf{F}) by the space \\\\mathbf{F}^\\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\\\\\{ f: \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\\\\\} with the product topology. The following theorem illustrates the KPT correspondence: > Theorem (KPT). For a Fraïssé structure \\\\mathbf{F}, the following are > equivalent: # The group \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\mathbf{F}) of automorphisms of > \\\\mathbf{F} is extremely amenable. # The class \\\\operatorname{Age}(\\\\mathbf{F}) > has the Ramsey property.

Boyd is a Democratic politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1996 to 2000. She unsuccessfully ran for the Florida Senate in 2000, losing the Democratic primary to Al Lawson. History Boyd moved to Tallhassee in 1972 with her husband, where she attended Tallahassee Community College, graduating with her associate's degree in nursing in 1975. She worked at a hospital and several managed-care plan start-up companies. Florida House of Representatives When State Representative Allen Boyd opted to successfully run for Congress rather than seek re-election, Janegale Boyd, his sister-in-law, ran to succeed him in the 10th District, which stretched from Apalachicola to the Tallahassee suburbs and down into North Central Florida. Boyd faced former State Representative Gene Hodges, whom her brother-in-law succeeded in the House, in the Democratic primary. Owing largely to her strong margin in Jefferson County, where her hometown was located, Boyd narrowly defeated Hodges, 54–46%. In the general election, Boyd faced Bill Blue, the Republican nominee. Given Boyd's massive fundraising advantage over Blue, along with the district's strong Democratic lean, Boyd was widely expected to prevail. Boyd ended up defeating Blue in a landslide, winning 67% of the vote to his 33%, and winning sizable majorities in all of the district's counties. In 1998, Boyd won her second term in the House unopposed. 2000 State Senate campaign In 2000, when incumbent State Senator Pat Thomas was unable to run for re-election due to term limits, Boyd ran to succeed him in the 3rd District, which included Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Jackson, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Madison, and Wakulla Counties. She faced fellow State Representative Al Lawson, former Leon County Sheriff Eddie Boone, and Dean J. Fenn in the Democratic primary. Given the sizable African-American electorate in the district, most observers assumed that Lawson would be able to secure a spot in the primary runoff based on his support from black voters, leaving Boone and Boyd to fight for the second spot in the runoff. The race quickly turned negative, with one political commentator calling it the \\"ugliest campaign\\" of the year, and Boyd calling it \\"one of the nastiest in state history.\\" Florida Consumer Advocates, an association of the state's trial lawyers, backed Boone and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attacking Boyd for her votes in favor of limiting public access to wetlands, selling drivers license information to private companies, and allowing holders of out-of-state concealed-carry permits to bring their weapons into the state. As expected, Lawson placed first in the primary, receiving 39% of the vote, and advanced to the runoff, where he was joined by Boyd, who edged out Boone for second place, 31–23%. In the runoff, the trial lawyers continued to air advertisements against her, including a new advertisement that attacked her 1999 vote in favor of tort reform. The ad featured a Cocoa woman whose husband died when his tire blew out arguing that Boyd \\"voted to make it more difficult to sue companies like Firestone.\\" Boyd condemned the advertisement as inaccurate, arguing that the group was blaming her for the Firestone accidents and that she cast her vote based on the best information she had at the time. Boyd, in turn, attacked Lawson for his vote against legislation that required mandatory sentences for criminals who used guns during crimes. Lawson, along with many other members of the legislature's black caucus, had voted against the legislation out of worries it would be disproportionately used against African-American offenders. Boyd convened a press conference to denounce the negative advertisements run against her, which Lawson crashed, using the opportunity to accuse her of \\"running ads that insinuate racism into this campaign,\\" which he called \\"Willie Horton all over again.\\" Ultimately, despite the perceived closeness of the race and despite overwhelmingly outspending Lawson, Boyd lost the runoff to Lawson in a landslide, winning just 41% of the vote to his 59%. While Boyd won the counties that made up her State House district by wide margins, Lawson racked up larger margins in Gadsden County and Leon County, which ultimately allowed him to easily win. Lawson's primary victory eventually allowed him to serve as the first black State Senator to represent the area since Reconstruction. Later life After leaving the legislature, Boyd became the President and CEO of the Florida Association of Homes and Services for the Aging.

She is Associate Professor in linguistics at the University of Sydney. and Director of the Sydney Corpus Lab. She is one of the co-developers of Discursive News Values Analysis (DNVA), which is a framework for analyzing how events are constructed as newsworthy through language and images. Her work ranges across various linguistic sub-disciplines, including corpus linguistics, media linguistics, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, stylistics, and applied linguistics.  Biography  Bednarek was born and educated in southern Germany. She received her PhD in English Linguistics (summa cum laude) in 2005 from the University of Augsburg under the supervision of Wolfram Bublitz. She received her Habilitation in English linguistics in 2008 from the same university. Her first academic appointment was at the University of Augsburg. Following a DFG-funded research fellowship at the University of Sydney, Australia, she then held a post-doctoral research fellowship at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). Since 2009 she has held a continuing position in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Sydney. From 2009 to 2015, Bednarek was book reviews editor of the SAGE journal Discourse and Communication. Since 2017, she has served as co-editor, along with Lachlan Mackenzie and Martin Hilpert, of the international journal Functions of Language (John Benjamins).  Contributions to linguistics  Much of Bednarek's research makes a contribution to corpus-based discourse analysis or corpus-assisted discourse studies. Key projects include the analysis of TV series (with a focus on dialogue), news discourse (news values analysis, shared news, and health news), the language of evaluation/emotion, and innovation in research methodologies in corpus linguistics. Her research contributes to the newly emerging field of linguistic research on films and television series. Her research has also contributed to the linguistic investigation of news discourse and to the development of theory and analysis regarding evaluation, emotion, and appraisal.  Television dialogue  Bednarek's research on television dialogue has focused mainly on US TV series, with current work extending this to Australian series. Contributions include the theorizing of televisual characterization, for example, the concept of 'expressive character identity', a new framework for analysing the functions of dialogue (FATS), and methodological innovation in taking a trinocular view of how language is used in television series, how such language is produced by screenwriters, and how it is consumed in transnational contexts. A new corpus of dialogue from 66 different TV series was compiled for this project. Her work on swear and taboo words in television dialogue has resulted in a novel operationalization and theorization of such words as well as a new taxonomy of relevant linguistic practices.  News discourse  Early corpus-assisted discourse analysis systematically compared the expression of opinion in British broadsheet and tabloid newspapers. In collaboration with Dr. Helen Caple, Bednarek later created a framework for the discursive analysis of news values, called DNVA. This approach uses corpus and discourse analysis to examine how news values are constructed through semiotic resources (language, image, etc). = Evaluation, emotion, attitude = Bednarek has made contributions to the study of language and evaluation/emotion. Her 2006 book, Evaluation in Media Discourse, introduced a parameter-based framework of evaluation, while her 2008 book, Emotion Talk Across Corpora, developed a corpus linguistic approach to the analysis of emotion talk and explored this across British English registers. The book includes a chapter describing a local grammar of affect, evaluated by Susan Hunston as 'probably the most successful' version. She has also contributed to critiquing and developing research on appraisal, especially in relation to attitude and affect.  Key publications  * Bednarek, M.

It is situated east of Pemberton, east of Cayoosh Mountain, and northeast of Joffre Peak, its nearest higher peak. Highway 99 traverses the southern base of the mountain between Cayoosh Pass and the west end of Duffy Lake, while Mount Chief Pascall rises on the opposite (south) side of this highway. Mount Rohr forms the westernmost boundary of Duffey Lake Provincial Park as it also represents the park's highest point . The mountain's name was submitted by Rev. Damasus Payne, a mountaineer, to honor Rev. Victor Sebastian Rohr (1873-1965), who spent 40 years in British Columbia and was a missionary to the First Nations in the region between Skookumchuck and Williams Lake. The name was officially adopted on April 21, 1966, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Two established climbing routes are the West Ridge and via Rohr Lake, both of which can be skied in winter. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains north into headwaters of Haylmore Creek, or south into Cayoosh Creek. Climate Mount Rohr's south side Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Rohr is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Rohr.

Life  Despite his being one of the most famous poets of his century, the historical record of Al-Hilli's life is often vague. Al- Hilli's birth is recorded as August 26 1278 in most sources, though one of his contemporaries gives his birth as October or November 1279. He was born in Hillah, modern-day Iraq, to a Shii family. Early in his life, one of his uncles was murdered, and Al-Hilli fought in a battle to avenge his death. He wrote a poem about his family's exploits in this battle, which won him some fame. After he achieved his initial success as a poet, wars and disasters forced him to leave Iraq in 1302, leaving behind his wife and family. At this time, he became a court poet in Mardin, Turkey under the Artuqids. He made his living through commerce, and by writing eulogies of wealthy princes. Al-Hilli died in 1338 or 1349.  Poetry  Al-Hilli, alongside Ibn Nubata, was one of the two most celebrated Arab poets of the 14th century. Al-Hilli's poetic style was innovative and experimental, integrating established poetic traditions with new vocabulary. Al-Hilli is perhaps best remembered for the poetic lines which inspired the Pan-Arab colors: \\"White are our deeds, black are our battles, / Green are our tents, red are our swords.\\" These lines are from Al-Hilli's fakhr (\\"boasting\\") poem written to celebrate his family's victories in the battle to avenge his uncle. His major poetic works are a collection of eulogies titled Durar al-Nuhur (\\"Jewels for Necks\\") and his Diwan (\\"Poems\\"). In his Diwan, he organizes his poems into twelve categories: 1. Boasting and bravery. 2. Eulogy, praise and thanksgiving. 3. Hunting poems and other description. 4. Friendship. 5. Elegy and condolence. 6. Ghazal and other erotic themes. 7. Wine and flower/nature poems. 8. Complaints and chiding. 9. Gifts, apologies and requests for leniency. 10. Riddles and complex ideas. 11. Adab, asceticism and other things. 12. Funny and satirical anecdotes. In addition to writing poetry, he wrote several works of literary criticism on poetic forms.

Biography He was the fourth son of Philip Benjamin Kruseman (1781-1842), a hatter, and Jacoba Mooij. He received his first drawing lessons from Jan Reekers (1790 - 1858) and attended the Vocational School in Haarlem from 1832 to 1833. That year, he began to study painting with Nicolaas Johannes Roosenboom and, in 1835, moved to het Gooi, where he took advanced studies with Jan van Ravenswaay. He also studied briefly with the landscape painter, Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. After a short time back in Haarlem, he went to Kleve, where he painted landscapes, then returned home in 1839. Two years later, he moved to Brussels where, except for a few months in Paris, he remained until 1852. After four years at home in Haarlem, he went back to Belgium and lived there until his death in 1882. In his output of approximately 300 to 350 paintings, only three still-lifes are known and the rest are landscapes. He also made a large number of drawings.

The main members are Danny Sorentino (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Rob Ruiz (bass guitar, backing vocals), Rory Judge (drums), Steve Barbieri (lead guitar, backing vocals), Russ Kerger (keyboards), and Steve Lee (lead guitar, backing vocals). Danny Sorentino, by his own estimation, has written about 1,000 songs. The Sorentinos, including solo albums and side projects by Danny Sorentino, have recorded 26 albums. They have performed thousands of gigs, mostly in the greater San Francisco Bay and North Bay Areas, but also throughout California and the United States, and have toured in the United Kingdom as well. They have performed as an opening act for dozens of well-known artists.  History  Danny Sorentino was born in 1955 in San Francisco, and grew up in the Excelsior District. He moved to Petaluma (Sonoma County) in 1970. He graduated from Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park (Sonoma County), and studied at Santa Rosa Junior College (Santa Rosa, California). He started playing the guitar at age 17, and wrote his first song in 1975. Danny has worked as a longshoreman in the San Francisco Bay Area since 2004, and is a member of the ILWU. He and his wife have three grown children and four grandchildren. Danny was the founder and lead singer of the rock band The Chills, a precursor band to The Sorentinos. Prior to forming The Chills, Danny Sorentino was a member of the Billy C. Farlow Band from 1979 to the end of 1980. Billy C. Farlow is the former lead singer of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. Danny Sorentino formed The Chills in 1981. The initial line-up included Danny Sorentino (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Steve Barbieri (lead guitar, backing vocals), Rick Escalante (bass guitar), and Ed Bale (drums). Ellery King took over the bass chair for about nine months, and then Julia Farey (later of the band Big Trouble) took over bass duties for about six months before Rob Ruiz joined as the permanent bass player. Rob Ruiz was born in Oakland, California, and grew up in Concord, California. Rob has worked as a park ranger with Marin County Parks for over 30 years. Rob played with the Eureka, Humboldt County-based power trio Rolls Rock. Rolls Rock toured nationally in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and opened shows for many well-known acts. After Rolls Rock disbanded, Rob played with the rock band The Bats. Rob is an avid collector of rock memorabilia. Danny Sorentino and Rob Ruiz met at the Mabuhay Gardens nightclub in San Francisco in 1985 when they were with separate bands, The Chills and The Bats, respectively, that shared the same bill one night. (The Chills and The Bats were San Francisco Bay Area-based bands, and unrelated to the New Zealand-based Dunedin sound bands of the same names.) Rob joined forces with The Chills in 1985, and has been a Sorentino ever since. The next line-up included Danny Sorentino (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Steve Barbieri (lead guitar, backing vocals), Rob Ruiz (bass guitar, backing vocals), Dave Carlson (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Dean Johnson (drums). Dave Carlson is also a long-time member of the Marin County-based band Tazmanian Devils. Shortly after Rob Ruiz joined The Chills in 1985, the band recorded its first single, \\"Heart Of America\\" b/w \\"I Surrender\\". At this point The Chills morphed into Danny Sorentino And The Sinners, and Steve Barbieri and Dave Carlson left the band, and Gary Reynolds took over the lead guitar spot, which made the line-up Danny Sorentino (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Rob Ruiz (bass guitar, backing vocals), Gary Reynolds (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Dean Johnson (drums). This line-up lasted for about three years, and was in many ways the \\"classic\\" line-up. During this time the band did most of their auditions for music industry A&R; executives in Los Angeles, and it was during this time that the band was named one of the best unsigned bands in the country by the New Music Seminar (music conference and festival), and they performed at the New Music Seminar in New York City in 1987. In 1988 the band signed with Centerfield Management, and in 1989 they recorded their first studio album Danny Sorentino And The Sinners, at which point Chris Paulsen replaced Dean Johnson on drums. Howard Vatcher (lead guitar) is from Eureka, California, and played with the rock bands Mister Science and Stereotactics prior to joining The Sorentinos. During that time, Howard met Rob Ruiz when Rob was playing for Rolls Rock. Sometime later when Howard relocated to the San Francisco area, Rob asked Howard to join The Sorentinos. Howard and his twin brother Don have also released several albums of their own music, as members of the San Francisco Bay Area-based electronic rock duo The Vatcher Brothers.

Stadium Upgrade In February 2017, Wood unveiled plans for the first major renovation to the Detroit Lions’ home stadium, Ford Field, since it opened its doors in 2002. The $100 million investment incorporated a complete overhaul of the audio and visual experience that features new videoboards as well as a new state-of-the-art sound system. The stadium’s premium spaces also received a complete makeover with expanded offerings to fans. Wood has also discussed adding a retractable roof to the field to attract MLS teams to play there.

Director Siddharth Thatholu along with the supervision of Ram Gopal Varma focused more on the unnecessary elevations for the hero and the slow-paced narration will test the patience of the audience.

He specialized in Romantic style landscapes.  Biography  In 1835, his father enrolled him at the Vocational School, where he studied drawing with Jan Reekers (1790-1858). From 1837 to 1838, he learned landscape painting from Nicolaas Johannes Roosenboom and, in 1839, won a silver medal at an exhibition in ’s-Hertogenbosch. This was followed by a study trip to Belgium and Germany. Many of his sketches were made in the dunes of North Holland. While travelling in Germany, he may have visited Kleve and studied briefly with Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. In 1846, he was named a member of the artists' society, \\"Kunst Zij Ons Doel\\", and was given some administrative functions. Later that year, he was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Art in Amsterdam. The following year, he became a Freemason and took a painting trip to the Harz mountains. He was one of the artists who participated in decorating the \\"Parkzaal\\" at the during the celebration of Rembrandt's 400th birthday in 1852. He set off travelling again in 1853; visiting the Rhine region, Switzerland and North Italy; painting some of his few mountain landscapes. From 1854 to 1856, he was a regular guest at the artists' colony in Oosterbeek. Just before his death, he paid an extended visit to Twente and Drenthe, where he sketched the dolmens in addition to his usual landscapes. In 1858, he married Johanna Cornelia Burman (1838-1887), but died two years later of an unspecified \\"chest disease\\"; leaving behind a two- year-old child, with another on the way. Among his best known students, one may mention Hendrik Dirk Kruseman van Elten and Paul Gabriël.

Background As Chinese merchants brought news of the Spanish withdrawal to the Dutch, telling them that the Spanish intended to abandon Formosa altogether and were merely waiting for permission from the king. The Dutch were growing interested in northern Taiwan because they had heard reports of gold mines in the northeast and felt they could not go prospecting until the Spanish had been removed. After making contact with the aborigines of Danshui, the Dutch decided to launch their attack. In courteous terms, the Dutch Governor Paulus Traudenius informed the Spanish governor of their intentions. The Spanish governor was not inclined to give in so easily and replied in kind. The siege Location of Keelung, Taiwan In August 1641, a Dutch expedition sailed to the Bay of Jilong to study the Spaniards' situation and, if possible, capture San Salvador. Warned by an aboriginal friend, the Spanish prepared for an attack. The Dutch soldiers landed on the shore of the bay across from the island. Since the Spanish governor had refused to allow aborigines to seek refuge in the fortress, many fled into the mountains. The Dutch brought with them some 500 northern aborigines, they entered Kimaurri without opposition. They spent the night there and the next morning climbed the hill behind the village and proceeded methodically to count the Spanish infantry by telescope, \\"seeing in this way everything that they wanted to.\\" Later, even though the Dutch outnumbered the Spanish and had the support of hundreds of aborigines, the Dutch commander realized he did not have enough cannons to mount a proper siege. The Dutch disengaged and left, burning Kimaurri on the way. Aftermath As the Spanish watched the Dutch depart, they were impressed by the number and orderliness of their enemies' aboriginal allies. \\"The enemy,\\" wrote one, \\"convened the entire Danshui River and all the villages that are under their jurisdiction, which was a very large number of Indians, and, when from this fortress we saw them arrayed at intervals on the hills and beaches, we [realized] that they [the Indians] were an army.\\" Indeed, on their way back from San Salvador to southwestern Taiwan, the Dutch made an agreement with the \\"natives of Danshui,\\" promising them protection against their enemies. Not long afterward, emissaries from Danshui went to the Dutch headquarters in Zeelandia and, according to Dutch sources, officially handed over their lands to the Dutch, in the same manner that the villages of the southwestern plains had done in the 1630s. The balance of power had changed in Formosa. Without help from Manila, the Spanish had little means of withstanding a Dutch attack, which is exactly what happened in the Second Battle of San Salvador. The Spanish celebrated the departure of the Dutch with a procession of thanksgiving. But the Dutch had already delivered a major blow to Spanish authority in Taiwan. By making peace with the aborigines in Danshui, the Dutch turned an area that had once been a central part of the Pax Hispanica into enemy territory for the Spanish. Moreover, by burning Kimaurri and mocking the Spanish beneath their very fortress, the Dutch had denigrated the Spaniards' military reputation, an attribute most necessary in the warlike world of seventeenth-century Formosa. The Spanish governor complained to Governor- General Corcuera that he could no longer persuade the aborigines to cooperate even in small matters: \\"They are traitors and are risen against us, being of a nature that they only help those who vanquish them.\\" See also * Spanish Formosa * Dutch Formosa * Spanish East Indies * :Category:History of the Philippines (1565–1898), Spanish colonial period in the Philippines Category:Spanish Formosa Category:Spanish East Indies Category:Dutch Formosa Category:History of the Philippines (1565–1898) Category:1642 in New Spain ","title":"Battle of San Salvador (1641)"},{"id":"62458639","text":"Kunzang Chhoden Namgyel became Bhutan's first female ambassador and the country's permanent representative to the United Nations in January 2014.

She was born and raised in Zagreb, and studied comparative literature and philosophy at university. She writes in a wide range of genres, including short stories, novels, travelogues and essays. Her debut novel Trojan Horse appeared in 1991. Her recent novel Wild Woman received critical acclaim and was translated into English by the prolific translator Christina Pribichevich Zorić.Bio References MARINA ŠUR PUHLOVSKI Marina Šur Puhlovski was born in Zagreb on September 20, 1948. She finished grammar school in Zagreb and got her B.A. in Comparative Literature and Philosophy at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Philosophy. During her youth, she was engaged in journalism, and, for a while, in literary criticism, after which she decided to commit herself to literary writing. She lives and works in Zagreb. She's married, and has a daughter. Marina Šur Puhlovski began writing in her early childhood, when she was writing poetry. Later, during her studies, she focused on prose. The first story, \\"Under the Table\\", was published in 1974 in the Journal of the Croatian Writers' Republika. Since then he has published stories in numerous literary magazines and newspapers, but the first book, a novel Trojanska kobila (The Trojan Mare) was published in 1991 - just before the outbreak of the war in former Yugoslavia. By 1991, however, she had nine books written, which she failed to publish, for various reasons (not political); it was more about Šur Puhlovski adamantly refusing to fit into the 'postmodernist' generation, then active, close-knit and praised. She openly distanced herself from that circle and pursued her own literary 'voice,' not recognized at the time. \\"You're not going to publish anything for a long time now,\\" the reviewer of \\"Trojan Mare\\" said to her, and so it was like that, indeed. War broke out, everything else was on stand-by. During the war, however, she still published stories in magazines, and Ništarija (A Good- for-Nothing Man), a novel she had written in her youth, was published in two parts in 'Forum' (Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts). It was only in 1996, when she was 48, that her second collection of short stories - written when she was 30 years old - A Rabbit in the Attic was published. In the following twenty years, she has been able to publish all the books 'from her drawer,' publishing one, and even two a year, together with those she was writing alongside - a total of twenty titles. Her novels were always longlisted or shortlisted for the national awards. Finally, her latest novel, Divljakuša (A Wild Woman) won the publishing house VBZ's prize for the best unpublished novel of the year, and was subsequently published in 2018, becoming a literary bestseller. Her interests are diverse, so, apart from six novels and six story collections, she has written and published a collection of songs in prose, two travel books about the Adriatic, a collection of essays on the meaning of literature and the difference between art and sophisticated kitsch, a collection of mini-essays, and several books of auto-fictional mixed genres (travel, journal, aphorisms).

His thesis Passage of Neutrons through Ferromagnetic Materials was supervised by Otto Halpern. His Master's degree was earned at Columbia University in 1936. From 1941 he worked in a research lab at Westinghouse Electric Corporation. In 1960, he left Westinghouse and became a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1965 he became a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. With Henry Primakoff in 1940 he introduced the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. It is important for the theory of spin waves. His most notable contribution to atomic physics was in 1947 when he was the first to treat the capture of resonance radiation in gases correctly (later applied in laser physics, astrophysics and photochemistry, but was also applied to phonons and in the solid state). Other significant papers included the polaron (introduction of the small polaron), infrared absorption of metals, a microscopic theory of the collision drag phenomenon by Brian Pippard, Bloch Electrons in magnetic fields (Hall effect) and his review on the transport properties in an electron-phonon gas. He corrected the Förster-Dexter theory of photoinduced energy transfer between molecules and found new mechanisms for energy transfer in disordered systems.

It can be used to allocate several indivisible items among several people, such that the allocation is \\"almost\\" envy-free: each agent believes that the bundle he received is at least as good as the bundle of any other agent, when at most one item is removed from the other bundle.  Setting  There are m objects to allocate, and n people (\\"agents\\") with equal rights to these objects. Each person has different preferences over the objects. The preferences of an agent are given by a vector of values - a value for each object. It is assumed that the value of a bundle for an agent is the sum of the values of the objects in the bundle (in other words, the agents' valuations are an additive set function on the set of objects).  Description  The protocol proceeds as follows: # Number the people arbitrarily from 1 to n; # While there are unassigned objects: #* Let each person from 1 to n pick an unassigned object. It is assumed that each person in his turn picks an unassigned object with a highest value among the remaining objects.  Properties  The round-robin protocol is very simple to execute: it requires only m steps. Each agent can order the objects in advance by descending value (this takes O(m log m) time per agent) and then pick an object in time O(1). The final allocation is EF1 - envy-free except one object. This means that, for every pair of agents i and j, if at most one object is removed from the bundle of j, then i does not envy j. : Proof: For every agent i, divide the selections made by the agents to sub-sequences: the first subsequence starts at agent 1 and ends at agent i-1; the latter subsequences start at i and end at i-1. In the latter subsequences, agent i chooses first, so he can choose his best item, so he does not envy any other agent. Agent i can envy only one of the agents 1,...,i-1, and the envy comes only from an item they selected in the first subsequence. If this item is removed, agent i does not envy.  Additivity requirement  The round- robin protocol requires additivity, since it requires each agent to pick his \\"best item\\" without knowing what other items he is going to get; additivity of valuations guarantees that there is always a \\"best item\\" (an item with a highest value). In other words, it assumes that the items are independent goods. The additivity requirement can be relaxed to weak additivity.  Extensions  The round-robin protocol guarantees EF1 when the items are goods (- valued positively by all agents) and when they are chores (- valued negatively by all agents). However, when there are both goods and chores, it does not guarantee EF1. An adaptation of round-robin called double round-robin guarantees EF1 even with a mixture of goods and chores. When agents have cardinality constraints (i.e., for each category of items, there is an upper bound on the number of items each agent an get from this category), round- robin might fail. However, combining round-robin with the envy-graph procedure gives an algorithm that finds allocations that are both EF1 and satisfy the cardinality constraints.  See also  Round-robin is a special case of a picking sequence. Round-robin protocols are used in other areas besides fair item allocation. For example, see round-robin scheduling and round-robin tournament.

Savithri playing supporting roles. The film, produced by S. Sriskandarajah who had previously produced Ennavo Pudichirukku (2004), had musical score by Sri Mahan and was released on 7 March 2008 after many delays. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Premistu. Plot Bharathi (Ramana) arrives in Munnar to work as an estate manager and his assistant Sanjini (Mansi Pritam), who is from Mumbai, helps in his job. One day, a labourer working in the estate dies of snakebite and they cannot save in time so Bharathi arranges a job interview to appoint medical staff. Bharathi then befriends with his assistant Sanjini and he thinks that she in love with him. Meanwhile, Bharathi receives anonymous love letters and an audio cassette of a woman singing. Later, Sanjini tells Bharathi that she considers him like a brother and she ties a rakhi around his wrist thus Bharathi symbolically becomes her brother. Bharathi slowly becomes obsessed with finding the woman who loves him. Roja (Swathi), a childlike woman full of joy, spends her time roaming with her friends and Bharathi begins to suspect her of being his secret lover. Roja reveals to Bharathi that she is in love with her relative Pulipandi (Ponnambalam), an ex-convict. Roja and Pulipandi then get married and they leave Munnar. When he returns home, Bharathi finds a letter telling him to come to an isolated place. Bharathi comes across a middle-aged woman (K. R. Savithri) and she tells him that she was the one who has written the letters. She also reveals that she is the mother of Devi and tells him everything. A few months ago, Devi (Akhila) attended the nurse interview and Bharathi who interviewed her praised her for her well-thought answers. Devi instantly fell in love with Bharathi. Devi was a young woman living with her parents and elder sister in the estate. She first told it to her family and they accepted for the marriage. One day, Devi had an epileptic seizure and was admitted to the hospital, the doctors revealed that there was no treatment to cure for epilepsy. Her father then died of a heart attack and her mother decided to support her love at any cost. Thereafter, Devi and her mother decided to meet Bharathi but during the drive, they had an accident and Devi was heavily wounded. Back to the present, Devi's mother begs him to forget her but Bharathi looks forward to finally see her. Bharathi goes to their place and finds Devi in a pitiful state: Devi has wounds all over her body and has developed an unusual behaviour. The film ends with a weeping Bharathi taking Devi with him.

The building has a hollow masonry cylinder, which is believed to have been used for astronomical purposes. Apart from its theorized uses as a hunting lodge and observatory, it is also believed to have been used as a clock tower Etymology The monument's original name was Khushk-i-Shikar(hunting lodge). Its current name Pir Ghaib literally means the saint who vanished. This refers to the popular story of an islamic saint , who had occupied a part of the building(two chambers to be exact) after it had been abandoned by the rulers, vanishing into thin air towards the end of his life. Because of this miracle, he came to be known as \\"Pir Ghaib\\" (the saint who vanished) and is still revered today by a few localities. History The monument, and the stepwell next to it, were built by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq in the year 1351 AD. The hunting lodge, along with an enclosure for game animals, was built by the Sultan following the death of his favorite son, Fateh Khan, to help him divert his mind by hunting.

In 1924 he began running the company in partnership with two brothers, Curtis J. Velare (1880-1970) and Elmer C. Velare (1884-1947), who specialized in operating and running mechanical fairground rides. Fred Dahlinger, Jr., \\"Big Wheels and Band Organs\\", Carousel Organ #29, October 2006 The business expanded rapidly through the 1920s and 1930s as Sedlmayr signed lucrative contracts with state fairs and festivals throughout the Midwest, Southern United States, and western Canada. The company claimed that its carnival was \\"dedicated to the principle of carrying clean, high-class entertainment to the public\\". The company won its first contract with the Calgary Stampede in 1934, and Sedlmayr became \\"the undisputed king of the carnival circuit\\". In 1938, when employees at the Barnum & Bailey Circus went on strike, RAS were able to expand further into spaces left vacant by the circus, but during World War II, restrictions on rail use meant that the company was unable to travel to Canada. Royal American Shows: History, ShowmensMuseum.org. Retrieved 29 November 2019 Troy Volhoffer, \\"When the Fair Arrived by Train\\", Leader Post, July 26, 2003. Retrieved 29 November 2019 From about 1931, the company employed Tom Parker, later the manager of Elvis Presley. Through his work as a \\"carny\\" with RAS, selling candy apples, Parker met his future wife, Marie Mott, and acquired an awareness of the cultural and political dynamics of the South and Midwest. He left Royal American Shows in 1938. The partnership between Sedlmayr and the Velare brothers continued until the early 1940s. Sedlmayr then owned and operated the Rubin & Cherry shows for two years in partnership with Sam Soloman, before relaunching Royal American Shows as the company's sole owner in the mid-1940s. The company regained the Western Canadian \\"A\\" circuit of fairs in 1946, and its shows starred Lash LaRue, exotic dancers Gypsy Rose Lee and Sally Rand, and Leon Claxton's all-black musical revue Harlem in Havana. The fairground rides embraced new technology that had been developed in World War II, and included four Ferris wheels placed side by side. The company continued to expand and develop through the 1950s. According to circus historian Fred Dahlinger Jr.: \\"Always innovative in presentation, technology and operation, few carnivals approached the Royal behemoth in quantity, diversity and splendor.\\" By 1967, the company was regularly moving over 800 people, together with livestock and equipment, and \\"carried the greatest number of flatcars ever carried by any traveling amusement organization in the world.\\" After Carl J. Sedlmayr Sr. died in 1965, the business was run by his son Carl J. Sedlmayr Jr. (1919-2001) and grandson Carl J. Sedlmayr III (1945-1991). The increasing cost of rail transport affected the finances of the company, and in 1975 the company was accused of tax evasion and fraud by the Canadian authorities. Sedlmayr Jr. was arrested, but freed after paying an outstanding tax bill. The inquiry into RAS affairs led to the foundation of the Alberta Gaming Commission. Sedlmayr Jr. vowed never to return to Canada, and many of the company's properties remained in storage there until the 1990s. The company continued to operate in the United States, but steadily diminished in size. The last RAS show was staged in Lubbock, Texas, in 1997. The Shows' equipment and materials were sold by auction at its winter base in Tampa, Florida, in 1999.Tim O'Brien, \\"Norton Auctions Off Royal American Shows Memorabilia For Big Dollars\\", Amusement Business, May 10, 1999.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History The area of Southfield that includes the present Plumbrooke Estates was set aside for residential development in the 1920s, as the rise of the automobile made the farther suburbs more accessible from Detroit. The Plumbrooke Estates land was owned at the time by real estate investor J. Lee Baker. Although other sections of this land were developed soon after, Plumbrooke Estates remained an undeveloped investment property until after World War II, when it was sold to Muriel C. Alger. Alger had the land platted into 97 lots in 1960, after the incorporation of Southfield as a city. Development by Maceday Construction began immediately, and the first model homes opened in the neighborhood in May 1961, and by 1965 all but eight of the 97 lots had been sold. Although the neighborhood was predominantly white at first, it quickly and quietly integrated into the 1970s. Since its inception, Plumbrooke Estates has remained a quiet neighborhood filled with high quality suburban houses. The subdivision looks substantially as it was in the 1960s, with only a few more recent additions and alterations. Description Plumbrooke Estates is a residential neighborhood located on a rectangular parcel covering 27.5 acres. It contains ninety-five houses, most of which are constructed in Mid-Century Modern styles including Colonial Revival, Ranch, and Contemporary. The houses are located along Plumbrooke Drive, which has a series of six cul-de-sacs projecting from one side of the street so that the majority of the houses are on a cul-de-sac. The lots are rectangular or wedge-shaped, depending on their location, and houses typically sit in the center of the lot. Although the architecture of the houses varies, their uniform size and setback gives the neighborhood a cohesive look.

She is a member of The Horde. She appears to be part-human, part-scorpion. Instead of hands she possesses scorpion-like claws, which she uses to great effect when fighting with members of The Great Rebellion. Media Television =She-Ra: Princess of Power (1985)= Scorpia is a member of the Horde, who lives in the Crimson Waste. At Crimson Waste, she owns slaves, which suggests that she is a powerful figure on Etheria. At Crimson Waste, Scorpia's home is shaped like a huge scorpion. Within the home can be seen a throne, suggesting Scorpia has some kind of rule over a region of Etheria. Scorpia and Catra possess a fierce rivalry between them, only working together as a last resort. She possesses claw-like pincers instead of hands and a powerful tail which she can employ to capture members of the Rebellion. Her tail is at times a disadvantage to her as She-Ra uses it several times to hurl her out of the way. She is not the most intelligent member of the Horde and is easily fooled, which is evidenced on several occasions, most notably when she allows Bow to enter the secret factory of the Horde believing him to be a handsome inspector. Scorpia is also the owner of the Crawler, a scorpion-shaped tank. One of the powers which the tank possesses is the ability to fire a sleep ray from its tail. =She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018–present)= In the rebooted series, Scorpia is a Force Captain in the Horde, of nominally equal rank to Catra. Nonetheless, she usually winds up as Catra's sidekick in her attempts to get revenge on Adora or advance the Horde's agenda. However, unlike in the original series, Scorpia is not malevolent at all. She is also one of the Princesses of Power; however, her family, the original rulers of the Fright Zone, capitulated to Hordak and surrendered their Black Garnet runestone to him. Scorpia thus spends most of the series as a faithful member of the Horde. As the series progresses, Scorpia became good friends with Entrapta while having romantic feelings towards Catra in wanting to help her while constantly making excuses for Catra's abusive behavior. Eventually, after standing by as Entrapta was sent to Beast Island during the 3rd season, Scorpia leaves the Horde after accepting Catra to be increasingly unstable and see the alliance's help in rescuing Entrapta. As a result, Scorpia ends up joining the Rebellion and established a connection to the Black Garnet, gaining electrical powers. Other media Scorpia appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Slaughterhouse on the Prairie\\", voiced by Eden Espinosa. She accompanies Catra and Entrapta into attacking Castle Bright Moon only for She- Ra to cut off her scorpion tail (which She-Ra used on Catra) and kill her. Reception The rebooted version of Scorpia has received very positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.

After working as a journalist with a focus on opera and voice for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Neue Musikzeitung, Opernwelt and Hessischer Rundfunk, he was artistic director of the opera house of Brussels, La Monnaie, from 1990, and has been Intendant of the Oper Frankfurt since 2002, where he encouraged a capable ensemble, international guest artists, and the production of rarely performed operas. He received the 2018 International Opera Award in the category Leadership in Opera.

He worked freelance for the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, moderating the morning journal Vor dem Alltag and responsible for the biographical Lexikon der Stimmen, presenting in alphabetical order world-famous and forgotten opera singers in interviews and recordings. In 1979, Loebe moved to Hessischer Rundfunk, responsible for opera and especially its international festivals such as the Bayreuth Festival and Salzburg Festival. In November 1990, the opera La Monnaie in Brussels appointed Loebe as artistic director. He worked as a consultant for the Oper Frankfurt from 2000, where he became Intendant with the 2002/03 season. His contract was renewed several times and now runs to 2023. When he took up the post, he faced a reduced municipal budget. In his first season, he produced Schubert's Fierrabras staged by Tilman Knabe, a good choice to international interest reviewers.<, ref name=\\"Weber\\" /> Other works that season included operas between Joseph Haydn and Salvatore Sciarrino: Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer staged by Christof Nel, Schreker's Der Schatzgräber, Britten's The Turn of the Screw and Die Frau ohne Schatten by Richard Strauss. He has consistently supported an ensemble, performing eight to nine new productions per season, sometimes conducted in collaboration with other opera houses. After his first season, the Oper Frankfurt received the Opernhaus des Jahres award by the critics of Opernwelt, the second time since 1995. The opera house was awarded the title again for the 2018/19 season. For the 2014/15 season, it received the award by the journal Deutsche Bühne for the best program.

In an interview, he said that he alone decides the playbill for a season, based on his interest and curiosity. Passionate about voices, he has selected members for the ensemble with long-range plans, and a focus on team spirit. He is present in eight of ten performances at the Oper Frankfurt, and led the opera house to international recognition. In 2014, the opera house produced the world premiere of Rolf Riehm's Sirenen, based on the Greek myth of Odysseus, Circe and the Sirens. In the 2018/19 season, Loebe produced Franz Schreker's Der Ferne Klang which had received its world premiere in Frankfurt, conducted by Sebastian Weigle, with Jennifer Holloway and Ian Koziara in the leading roles. The production was dedicated to Michael Gielen who had initiated the Schreker revival in Frankfurt with Die Gezeichneten in 1979.

Its sphere of influence extended to all the centre of the city of Naples for over four decades. History The clan was founded by Pio Vittorio Giuliano (1926 - September 27, 2009), known as ‘o padrino in the early post-war years, primarily dedicated to cigarette smuggling. He had 11 children, among them Luigi, Erminia, Guglielmo, Carmine and Raffaele Giuliano. Since the 1950s the organization started to accumulate a huge fortune, in fact, Pio Vittorio was considered one of the richest cigarette smugglers of Naples in the time, at its heyday the cigarette traffic alone gave to the Giuliano clan over 200 million lire a week. In the mid-1970s Luigi Giuliano, known as 'O rre (the king), replaced his father as head of the clan, what made him the most powerful Camorra boss for the next 20 years. The Giuliano family was widely known for their luxury lifestyle, family members were always seen in the company of influential people in trendy nightclubs. In the 1980s, photos of the former football player Diego Maradona posing with some of the sons of Pio Vittorio inside a huge shell-shaped bathtub with golden taps in one of the villas of the Giuliano family made the international newspaper headlines. In fact, Maradona was seen numerous times in the company of the Giulianos in parties, nightclubs and weddings. War with the NCO The Giuliano clan had been in good terms with the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, headed by Raffaele Cutolo until the first half of 1979, but the two organizations then broke out into conflict. Cutolo demanded to receive a cut from the Giuliano's illegal gambling centres and lottery system in his power base of Portici. Following this, the head of the Vollaro clan, Luigi Vollaro raised the idea of an anti-Cutolo alliance with Giuliano family. A provisional death squad was set up, which contributed to the dozens of gangland deaths that year.Behan, The Camorra, pp. 56 The breaking point was reached when the NCO tried to expand their territories into the Giuliano's stronghold of Forcella, Piazza Mercato and Via Duomo, in the centre of Naples. The clash, which had occurred in a period of growing tension between the historic Camorra clans and the newly created NCO, led to the formation of the Nuova Famiglia, consisting particularly of the Giuliano clan, the Zaza clan, then headed by Michele Zaza, the Nuvoletta clan and the Casalesi clan, headed at the time by Antonio Bardellino. After the defeat of Cutolo, the leaders of the Nuova Famiglia achieved absolute dominance over all criminal rackets in the city of Naples. Luigi Giuliano relinquished control of the Quartieri Spagnoli to the Di Biasi brothers, who then founded the Di Biasi clan. 2000s The Giuliano clan was headed by Luigi Giuliano for nearly thirty years. However, he was arrested in early 2000 and was succeeded by his sister, Erminia Giuliano'Mob queen' found in cupboard, BBC News, December 24, 2000 Erminia became the boss because the only direct male heir to the family business still unimprisoned was deemed inept. She was ranked as one of Italy's 30 most dangerous criminals, and eventually arrested on December 23, 2000, after being a fugitive for over 10 months. In September 2002, Luigi Giuliano decided to collaborate with the Italian authorities and became a government witness, giving another hard blow to his organization. In 2006, his son Giovanni Giuliano was killed in retaliation. Despite the marriage, in 1996, between Marianna Giuliano, daughter of Luigi, with Michele Mazzarella, son of Vincenzo Mazzarella, one of the bosses of the Mazzarella clan, the two organizations have always been rivals, which culminated in several episodes of violence in the 2000s.

The third generation of the Giulianos along with other small groups aligned to them, such as the Amirante-Brunetti-Sibillo, is dubbed by the media \\"Paranza dei bambini\\". After years at war, in 2015 the Italian justice delt a big blow against the Paranza dei bambini, arresting virtually the entire group. By 2019, the group Giuliano-Amirante-Sibillo, known as Paranza dei bambini, due to the young age of its affiliates, is still active, but strongly weakened.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2015. Overview The Mimitori ruins are located in the Higashiyama Hills in the eastern portion of the Niigata Plain, on a ridge with an altitude of 76 meters. The size of this village ruin extends over 16,000 square meters, which makes it the largest in the Hokuriku region. The settlement existed from the middle Jōmon period (3000–2000 BC) through the late and final Jōmon period (2000–300 BC). and covered three overlapping areas. The middle Jōmon settlement was in the center of the hill, with houses in a horseshoe-shaped configuration and a central plaza, measuring 60 meters north-south by 70 meters east-west. The foundations of 12 oval-shaped pit dwellings measuring 8 x 3 meters were found, as was a large (10.6 centimeter) jade sphere. The settlement expanded in the late Jōmon period to the west, forming a donut- shape, 200 meters north-south by 118 meters east-west. and a central plaza 18 meters in diameter. A total of 66 pit dwelling foundations were found in this area. A midden was also discovered from this period. The final Jōmon period extended to the east of the original settlement. The style of buildings appears to have transitioned to elevated floor buildings. The pillar hole about 130 cm in diameter and was dug more than 1 meter deep, and a pillar about 50 cm in diameter was erected in it. Only two buildings were confirmed, but 36 similar holes were found in a wide area on the eastern side of the ruins. These are also considered to be pillar holes of the same building. The site has been known since the end of the 19th century; however, it was not first excavated until 1967 after a spate of tomb robberies occurred in the area. As a result of these survey results, the momentum for protecting the ruins increased, and a development plan for a large-scale housing area was canceled.

Art of Mathura, 100 BCE.Dated 100 BCE in Fig. 85 Mudgarpani was a Yaksha deity in ancient India. His name means \\"Mudgar- holder\\", the Mudgar being an ancient form of heavy cub, usually made of wood, but it can also be made of iron. A Yaksha Yakshas seem to have been the object of an important cult in the early periods of Indian history, many of them being known such as Kubera, king of the Yakshas, Manibhadra or Mudgarpani. The Yakshas are a broad class of nature-spirits, usually benevolent, but sometimes mischievous or capricious, connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest, treasure and wilderness, and were the object of popular worship. Many of them were later incorporated into Buddhism, Jainism or Hinduism. Sculptures Some of the earliest works of art of the Mathura school of art are the Yakshas, monumental sculptures of earth divinities that have been dated to the 2nd-1st century BCE. Yakshas became the focus of the creation of colossal cultic images, typically around 2 meters or more in height, which are considered as probably the first Indian anthropomorphic productions in stone. Although few ancient Yaksha statues remain in good condition, the vigor of the style has been applauded, and expresses essentially Indian qualities. They are often pot-bellied, two-armed and fierce-looking. The Yashas are often depicted with weapons or attributes, such as the Yaksha Mudgarpani. Mudgarpani (\\"Mace-holder\\") Yaksha from Bharana Kalan A statue of Mudgarpani (\\"Mace-holder\\") Yaksha from Bharana Kalan, visible in the Mathura Museum, is dated to circa 100 BCE. It was discovered in Bharana Kalan, 32 kilometers northwest of Mathura. In the right hand he holds a mudgar mace, and in the left hand he used to hold the figure of a small standing devotee or child joining hands in prayer.Fig. 85 in The inscription in Brahmi script on the base of the statue is in very bad condition, but has been partly deciphered. Some parallels with the contemporary Agnipani statue, probably dedicated by the same person, also helped interpretation: A relief in the Mathura Museum also shows a similar Mudgarpani, dated to the same period, but with clearer attributes: especially the figure of a small standing devotee or child joining hands in prayer is much more visible. Style Detail of the \\"Hellenistic\\" drapery. It is often suggested that the style of the colossal Yaksha statuary had an important influence on the creation of later divine images and human figures in India.\\"The folk art typifies an older plastic tradition in clay and wood which was now put in stone, as seen in the massive Yaksha statuary which are also of exceptional value as models of subsequent divine images and human figures.\\" in The female equivalent of the Yakshas were the Yakshinis, often associated with trees and children, and whose voluptuous figures became omnipresent in Indian art. A relief is also known from the Mathura Museum, which shown the Mudgarpani with the same attributes.Fig. 85 in Some Hellenistic influence, such as the geometrical folds of the drapery or the contraposto stance of the statues, has been suggested. According to John Boardman, the hem of the dress in the monumental early Yaksha statues is derived from Greek art. Describing the drapery of one of these statues, John Boardman writes: \\"It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism\\", and suggests it is possibly derived from the Hellenistic art of nearby Bactria where this design is known. Under the Indo-Greeks, the cult of the Yakshas may also have been associated with the Bacchic cult of Dionysos.\\"We have no way of knowing whether there was any direct association between the cult of the Yashas and Dionysos during the Indo-Greek era, but this is a distinct possibility\\" in In the production of colossal Yaksha statues carved in the round, which can be found in several locations in northern India, the art of Mathura is considered as the most advanced in quality and quantity during this period.\\"With respect to large- scale iconic statuary carved in the round (...) the region of Mathura not only rivaled other areas but surpassed them in overall quality and quantity throughout the second and early first century BCE.\\" in Stories and later history An ancient Jain story named the Antagadadasao tell the story of a man named Ajjunaka who was worshipping the image of the \\"Yaksa who held a mace\\", when he was attacked by five bandits, an event which shaked is devotion to the Yashka. Afterwards the Yaksa possessed Ajjunaka, giving him the strength to kill the five bandits. Nowadays, for training purposes when using Indian clubs, one or two wooden gada (\\"mudgar\\"), reaching up to 70 kilograms in weight, can be used: they can be swung behind the back in several different ways; this is particularly useful for building grip strength and shoulder endurance.

The attacker, Briton Usman Khan, had been released from prison in 2018 on licence after serving a sentence for terrorist offences. Khan was attending an offender rehabilitation conference in Fishmongers' Hall when he threatened to detonate what turned out to be a fake suicide vest and started attacking people with two knives taped to his wrists, killing two of the conference participants by stabbing them in the chest. Several people fought back, some attacking Khan with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk as he fled the building and emerged on to London Bridge, where he was partially disarmed by a plain-clothes police officer. He was restrained by members of the public until additional police officers arrived, pulled away those restraining him, and shot him dead.  Background  A conference on offender rehabilitation was held on 29 November 2019 in Fishmongers' Hall, at the northern end of London Bridge, in the City of London, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Learning Together, a programme run by the Cambridge Institute of Criminology to help offenders reintegrate into society following their release from prison. Learning Together was set up in 2014 by University of Cambridge academics Ruth Armstrong and Amy Ludlow from the Faculty of Law and Institute of Criminology to \\"bring together people in criminal justice and higher education institutions to study alongside each other in inclusive and transformative learning communities\\" to enable students and prisoners to work together. Former prisoner Usman Khan had been invited to the conference as a previous participant in the programme, and although banned from entering London under the terms of his release, he was granted a one-day exemption to attend.  Attack  At 13:58 on 29 November, the police were called to Fishmongers' Hall after Khan, wearing a fake suicide vest, threatened to blow up the hall. Holding two kitchen knives taped to his wrists, he began stabbing people inside the building. Several fought back, including a chef working at Fishmongers' Hall who grabbed a narwhal tusk from the wall to use as a weapon, and Steven Gallant, a convicted murderer attending the conference on day release from prison, after participating in the Learning Together programme. Khan fled and began stabbing pedestrians outside on the north side of the bridge. Several people were injured before members of the public, including a tour guide and a plain-clothes British Transport Police officer, later seen walking away with a knife, restrained and disarmed Khan on the bridge. One of the people who stepped in to fight the attacker drove him back by spraying a fire extinguisher. Armed officers of the City of London Police arrived at 14:03 and surrounded the attacker, who at the time was being restrained by a Ministry of Justice communications worker attending the rehabilitation meeting. The officers pulled this person away to provide a clear shot, before one fired twice. Khan died at the scene. A Transport for London bus which had stopped adjacent to the site of the shooting was found to have damage to both its front and rear windows, possibly caused, according to the Metropolitan Police, by a ricocheting bullet.  Victims  Three of the victims were associated with Cambridge University's Learning Together prison-rehabilitation programme; two died and one was injured. The two who died from their stab wounds were Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones. Merritt was a 25-year-old law and criminology graduate who had studied at the University of Manchester and Cambridge University. He worked as a University of Cambridge administration officer and was from Cottenham. Jones, 23 years old, was a former Anglia Ruskin University and University of Cambridge student from Stratford-upon- Avon. Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together. Funeral services for Merritt and Jones were conducted on 20 December 2019. Two other women were seriously injured, while the chef who stopped the attacker was stabbed but had less serious injuries.  Attacker  The attacker was identified as Usman Khan, a 28-year-old British national from Stoke-on-Trent, of Pakistani descent. Khan appears to have left school with no qualifications after spending part of his late teens in Pakistan. He was known to police and had links to Islamist extremist groups.Newsnight, BBC2, 29 November 2019 In December 2018 he had been automatically released from prison on licence, where he was serving a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences, and was wearing an electronic tag. Khan had been part of a plot, inspired by Al-Qaeda, to establish a terrorist camp on his family's land in Kashmir and bomb the London Stock Exchange. The plot was disrupted by MI5 and the police, as part of MI5's Operation Guava (police Operation Norbury), and Khan was given an indeterminate sentence. Of the nine men involved, Khan was the youngest at 19 and according to Mr Justice Wilkie, Khan and two others were “more serious jihadis” than the others. In 2013, his sentence was revised after an appeal, and he was ordered to serve at least 8 years of his new 16-year sentence, with a 5-year extended licence allowing recall to prison. According to the anti- extremism group Hope not Hate, Khan was a supporter of Al-Muhajiroun, an extremist group with which scores of terrorists were involved. He was a student and a personal friend of Anjem Choudary, an Islamist and terrorism supporter. Khan had previously participated in the Learning Together programme. Post-mortem examination showed evidence of \\"occasional use of cocaine\\" by Khan.  Aftermath  The news of the attack was broken live moments after it happened on the BBC News Channel by one of its reporters, John McManus, who witnessed members of the public fighting Khan as he crossed the bridge, and heard two shots being fired by police officers. McManus said that he was certain that more than two shots were fired during the incident. The police, ambulance, and fire services attended the scene and a major incident was declared. A large police cordon was set up in the area and residents were told to stay away. Police closed both Monument Underground station and London Bridge station after the attack. The police reported that there had been no prior intelligence of the attack. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, returned to Downing Street following the incident, after campaigning in his constituency for the forthcoming general election. Johnson commended the \\"immense bravery\\" of the emergency services and members of the public, and claimed that anyone involved in the attack would be \\"hunted down\\". The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, thanked the emergency services and members of the public who helped to restrain the attacker, saying they had shown \\"breathtaking heroism\\". The Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats temporarily suspended campaigning in London for the general election. A parliamentary election hustings event scheduled to be held at Great St Mary's Church in Cambridge on 30 November was cancelled and replaced by a memorial vigil for the victims of the attack. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick made a statement following the attack describing events. She said there would be an increased police presence on the streets and that cordons in the London Bridge area would remain in place. An appeal was made for the public to submit any film or picture evidence or information that could assist the investigation. In Pakistan, publication of Khan's Pakistani origins by the leading newspaper Dawn were deemed unpatriotic and defamatory, and led to demonstrations demanding that the publisher and the editor be hanged.Pakistan newspaper besieged by Islamists calling for editor to be hanged over London Bridge coverage, The Independent, 4 December 2019.London Attack Coverage Prompted Riots Against a Pakistani Newspaper, Voice of America, 4 December 2019.Recent attacks against independent media in Pakistan, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 16 december 2019. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack. Its news agency, Amaq, claimed Usman Khan was one of its fighters. A janaza prayer for Khan was held at a mosque in Birmingham, and he was buried in his family's ancestral village in Pakistan, following objections to his burial in the UK by local Muslims in his native Stoke.  Investigations  London Bridge was closed until the early hours of the following Monday for forensic investigation of the scene. Two properties, in Stafford, where Khan lived, and in Stoke-on- Trent, were searched by police. An inquest was opened on 4 December, at the Central Criminal Court in London, and was subsequently adjourned. A pre- inquest review hearing took place at the Old Bailey on 16 October 2020, before the Chief Coroner for England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC. A full inquest into the deaths of Merritt and Jones is scheduled for April 2021, with Khan's to take place after that, overseen by the chief coroner. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is holding an investigation into the shooting. In a separate investigation Staffordshire Police are also under IOPC scrutiny. Royal prerogative of mercy for Steven Gallant Gallant was granted the Royal prerogative of mercy by the Lord Chancellor on behalf of the Queen in October 2020, in order to bring his parole hearing forward by ten months to June 2021. The Ministry of Justice said this was \\"in recognition of his exceptionally brave actions at Fishmongers’ Hall, which helped save people’s lives despite the tremendous risk to his own\\". Though the parole board still has to decide on whether to release him, it was reported that it would be unlikely for his case to be denied after the Queen's intervention. The families of both Merritt and of Gallant's 2005 murder victim approved of the action due to his heroic deeds and efforts to turn his life around since the murder.

Description The 377-meter-long-street starts at 202, Rue Saint-Honoré and ends at 1, Rue de Beaujolais. It has a north-south orientation and is a one-way street. Name The street was named after Louis Philippe I, Duke of Valois, the son of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. History To pay debts, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the owner of the Palais-Royal, decided to divide the lands around the Palais' garden into plots. The street was opened in 1784 under the name Passage de Valois. It was named Rue du Lycée from Thermidor 2, Year VI (July 20, 1798) to April 27, 1814; then it was called Rue de Valois-Palais-Royal to distinguish it from Rue de Valois-Saint-Honoré (disestablished in the 1850s) and Rue de Valois-du-Roule (merged into Rue de Monceau in 1868). During the July Revolution, clashes between insurgents and troops took place in the street. Under the Second Republic, the street was renamed Rue du Vingt-Quatre-Février (\\"February 24 Street\\") to commemorate the date of Louis Philippe I's abdication and of the provisional proclamation of the Republic. Notable buildings *No. 3: headquarters of the Ministry of Culture. The media often use the term Rue de Valois as a metonymy to refer to the Ministry of Culture. *No. 4: the Grand Hôtel of the Palais-Royal. It became a five-star hotel in July 2013. It had famous guests like Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin and composer Jean-Baptiste Lully. Since July 8, 2013, the hotel's Lulli restaurant has paid tribute to the compsoser. *No. 8: Le Bœuf à la mode, a restaurant established on the former site of the restaurant Mérot created in 1796. The name bœuf à la mode was inspired by the restaurant's sign and the statuette located inside, whose clothes changed according to the fashion of the time.

Overview Crude oil was discovered in Echigo Province from the end of the Nara period, occurring in naturally-occurring petroleum seep. In 1874, the Nakano clan, the local village headman, applied to the Meiji government for a permit to commercially mine the crude oil, and hand-pumping operations began almost immediately. This operation was later taken over by Nippon Oil (now JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy) and with the industrialization of Japan in the Meiji and Taisho periods, demand for petroleum skyrocketed and over 100 small companies began drilling for oil in this area. The crude oil of Niitsu is deep black to deep green in color, with high viscosity, high sulfur and high acid content, and low in paraffin. In the early Meiji Era, when petroleum was in demand largely for lamps, Niitsu crude was regarded as poor quality. However, with the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and improvements in refining technology, Niitsu heavy oil and machine oil grew in demand. By 1917, the field had reached its peak production of 120,000 kiloliters, and was the largest in Japan. Commercial production mostly stopped in the 1980s, due to decreasing yield and high costs compared with imported oil. In 1996, the last well was closed. and the site was subsequently transformed into a public park with a museum. In 2007, the Niitsu Oil Field was selected as one of the \\"Top 100 Geological Sites in Japan\\", and was certified as a “Modern Industrial Heritage Site”. And in 2018, the “Niitsu Oilfield Kanazu Mining Site” was designated as a National Historic Site of Japan.Niigata City official home page See also *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Niigata) References External links *Akika Ward official site *Petroleum World Museum Category:Oil fields in Japan Category:Parks and gardens in Niigata Prefecture Category:Niigata (city) Category:Historic Sites of Japan ","title":"Niitsu Oil Field"},{"id":"62460072","text":"Riku Selander (born 22 November 1994) is a Finnish professional footballer who plays for HIFK, as a midfielder.

Originally conceived as a very short five minute film, it was expanded to a running time of over 30 minutes during production. Synopsis The film starts with the commander of one of ATA ferry pools and his assistant receiving telephone calls about aircraft to be moved between factories and airfields and working out pilot rosters. It moves on to introduce the variety of people, both men and women, who are pilots in the ATA. The movements of two pilots, an older Englishman and a young American as they are transported to a factory in an ATA Avro Anson to collect two Supermarine Spitfires for delivery to an RAF base somewhere in England. After delivering the Spitfires, the English pilot flies an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley to another airfield with the American pilot as a passenger. The two land, unaware that they came close to being attacked by German aircraft, and are picked up by another ATA crew to return to their base. The film ends with the two signing-off for the day with the ferry pool commander.

Discovery and naming Location map In the Lagerstätte of Hjoula, ten kilometres inland from the port of Byblos, commercial fossil hunters regularly make important discoveries. A rare pterosaur skeleton was acquired by an anonymous benefactor and donated to the Mineral Museum at Beirut, part of the Université Saint-Joseph. It was prepared in Canada by Luke Allan Lindoe, a technician of the University of Alberta. Since 2017, the museum displays two life-size models of the animal, one standing, the other flying, and a hologram. In 2019, the type species Mimodactylus libanensis was named and described by Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner, Michael Wayne Caldwell, Borja Holgado, Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia, Roy Nohra, Juliana Manso Sayão and Philip John Currie. The generic name combines a reference to the MIM, the usual acronym of the museum, with a Greek δάκτυλος, daktylos, \\"finger\\". The name was intended to honour the philanthropist as well. The specific name refers to the provenance from Lebanon. The holotype, MIM F1, was excavated from a marine deposit of the Sannine Chalk dating from the late Cenomanian, about ninety-five million years old. The layers were deposited off the coast of the Afro-Arabic plate, in the south of the Tethys Sea. It consists of a relatively complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. It lacks some vertebrae and some pelvic elements. The skeleton is largely articulated and partly three-dimensionally preserved but the rear of the skull is strongly compressed. It is a juvenile individual. It represents the most complete pterosaur skeleton ever found on the Afro-Arabic plate. The University of Alberta made a cast, with inventory number MN 7216-V. Description Size and distinguishing traits Life reconstruction by Julius Csotonyi The holotype of Mimodactylus has a wingspan of 132 centimetres but the exemplar was far from being full-grown. The describing authors identified some distinguishing traits. Two of these are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The humerus has a rectangular deltopectoral crest. The humerus has less than half of the length of the second phalanx of the fourth (wing) finger. Additionally the fossils shows a combination of traits that is unique for the Ornithocheiroidea. The palate has a distinct ridge. The upper jaws each have eleven teeth and the lower jaws each ten. The shoulderblade is somewhat longer than the coracoid. The humerus is 30% longer than the thighbone. The deltopectoral crest covers 40% of the shaft length of the humerus. From the Lagerstätte of Hjoûla two other pterosaur specimens are known. One of these is the holotype of Microtuban, the other is specimen MSNM V 3881. According to the describing authors, both clearly differed in proportions from the Mimodactylus holotype, proving that they represented different taxa. Skeleton =Skull= Skull The snout of Mimodactylus is wide but not rounded in front, ending in a pointed tip. The upper jaw bears eleven teeth. These are somewhat transversely flattened, but not dagger-shaped or serrated. They are conical with an oval cros-section. Their outer side is convex. Sharp cutting-edges or carinae are lacking. Their apices are sharp and slightly bent inwards. They possess a cingulum, a thickened ridge at the crown base. The first tooth is smaller, with a circular cross-section. Subsequent teeth are longer, straight and widely spaced. They are only present in the front half of the jaw. The palate forms a concave plate with a small ridge. The choanae, the internal nostrils, are large and separated by the vomers. The fenestrae postpalatinae are elongated and egg-shaped in profile, as with Hongshanopterus. The quadrate is angled at 150° relative to the jaw edge. The lower jaw has a preserved length of 105 millimetres. It bears ten teeth for a total of forty-two in the head as a whole. The lower jaws have a central forwards pointing odontoid process in front. Of the hyoid bone two first ceratobranchialia have been preserved, thin elongated fork-shaped elements. =Postcrania= Skeletal diagram The front vertebrae of the back are not fused into a notarium. A series of seven tail vertebrae is visible. These quickly diminish in size towards the rear, indicating that the tail was very short. The breastbone is rounded in front. Its cristospina, central crest on the underside, is short and deep. The shoulder blade is robust and constricted. It is longer than the coracoid, different from the condition in the Istiodactylidae. The coracoid facet touching the breastbone is concave, with a process extending to behind, again different from the isiodactylid morphology. The wings are conspicuously elongated, with a low aspect ratio. The humerus is fifty-two millimetres long. Its deltopectoral crest has distinctive straight distal edge. This crest covering 40% of shaft length exceeds the ratio in all other Ornithocheiroidea, except the Pteranodontidae. The pteroid, the bone supporting the forward wing membrane or propatagium, is very long, somewhat longer even than the humerus. It clearly points towards the neck and articulates with the proximal syncarpal; this had been a point of contention among researchers. The first and second phalanx of the fourth finger are relatively longer than with istiodactylids. The fourth phalanx is curved to behind. Phylogeny In 2019, Mimodactylus was, within the Lanceodontia, placed in the Istiodactyliformes. More precisely, it would be a member of the Mimodactylidae, as sister species of Haopterus. The cladogram below is a topology recovered by Kellner et al. (2019). In the analyses, they recovered Mimodactylus as the sister taxon of Haopterus within the family Mimodactylidae, and placed within the more inclusive group Istiodactyliformes. Paleobiology The standing model at the MIM The habitat of Mimodactylus consisted of the islands and archipelagos situated on the wide chalk plateau extending from the north coast of the Afro-Arabische plate, in the Neotethys. The dentition of Mimodactylus differs from all other known pterosaurs. Its short unserrated straight conical teeth would have been useful to crack the exoskeletons of arthropods. That could indicate it was an insectivore, but insects are largely absent from the Lagerstätte layers. A lack of plant fossils proves that the location was far from land. Its elongated wings did not provide the manoeuvrability needed to catch fast flying insects. However, they would allow for a stable flight during dynamic soaring over the sea surface. The site is rich in fossils of crustaceans belonging to the Decapoda. Such shrimp-like creatures could have been scooped from the water surface by the wide beak, similar to the way some extant ducks, herons and shoebills catch prey.

She is professor of paediatric neuroscience and a senior Wellcome Trust research fellow at the University of Oxford. She is also a professorial fellow in Neuroscience at St John's College. Her research focuses on infant pain, using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques to improve understanding and measurement of pain in preterm (premature) and term infants. In this regard, she has established the Paediatric Neuroimaging Group (c. 2013), which aims ultimately to improve neonatal care through developing quantitative neuroimaging measures of pain in infants and translation to clinical practice.  Career  Slater established the Paediatric Neuroimaging Group at the University of Oxford in 2013 as an Associate Professor of Paediatric Neuroimaging, which she continues to lead. She was awarded a Title of Distinction by Oxford University in 2018 to become a Professor of Paediatric Neuroscience. She is also a Senior Wellcome Trust Research Fellow, was awarded a Statutory Chair in Paediatric Neuroimaging in 2019, and has been a Professorial Fellow at St John's College since 2019. Research Slater's work constituted the first evidence for specific cortical pain response in premature infants from 25 weeks old. She measures the blood flow changes in the brain during clinically required blood tests using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and compares it to the blood flow during non-painful tactile stimulation. She was the first to directly measure pain-specific neural activity in infants using electroencephalography (EEG), during clinically required blood tests. This EEG measure was then developed by Slater and her research group into a general EEG template for measuring pain response in infants - a significant step towards using objective neuroimaging tools to evaluate pain experience in infants - which has been used to validate pain relief interventions for infants during clinical procedures. She is an advocate for neuroimaging tools for objective measurement of infant pain, and has demonstrated that brain activity could be more sensitive to pain responses in infants than other common assessment tools. As well as work directly within her research group, she is a collaborator on the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), a large-scale multi-centre project to develop the first developmental map of human brain connectivity between 20–44 weeks of age, that will include and link imaging, clinical, behavioural and genetic information. She has also been on the scientific organising committee for the International Symposium on Paediatric Pain. She is part of a collaboration to develop wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanners for children, described by Physics World as one of the Top 10 Breakthroughs of the Year for 2019. One research study published in April 2015 involved infants, accompanied by their parents, being gently poked with a rod-like device while being scanned by MRIs to measure and understand infant pain. This research suggested that \\"not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults\\" stated Slater.  Public engagement and media  Slater is considerably involved in public engagement and media communication. With her research group, she has produced several videos for a public audience to communicate research in infant pain and neuroimaging as well as developing artwork and games in collaboration with artists, and her group is very active at public engagement events and science festivals such as the Cheltenham Science Festival. She has appeared on radio and podcasts to talk about measurement and understanding of infant pain, including Radio 4 pieces \\"From agony to analgesia\\", Case Notes with Dr Mark Porter, as well as the BBC World Service: Health Check, and The Naked Scientists podcast \\"Do Newborn Babies Feel Pain?\\" She has also appeared on BBC News, and in articles by the BBC, The Guardian, and Scientific American to communicate advances in measuring and managing infant pain.

Bohemians were due to participate in both national domestic cup competitions this season, namely the FAI Cup and the EA Sports Cup. The later was deferred indefinitely due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Bohemians competed in the UEFA Europa League for the first time in seven years as they qualified with a third-place finish the previous season. Bohs were drawn against arch-rivals Shamrock Rovers in an opening day Dublin Derby when fixtures for the 2020 season were released in late December 2019. The club would go on to announce record-high sales for season tickets and memberships prior to the start of their league campaign. However, all football activity in the Republic of Ireland was halted in March due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The Football Association of Ireland announced a contingency plan with a view to completing the domestic season at a later date, with a reduced number of games. Matches after the restart are played without fans in attendance. Club Kits Bohemians announced a new four-year partnership with Des Kelly Interiors as new main sponsors, beginning with the 2020 season. Manufactured by O'Neills, the red and black striped shirt features a special gold crest and has the club's name written in the Irish language. This is to mark the club's 130th anniversary and their 100th season in the League of Ireland. On 12 February 2020 Bohemians announced a new away kit, a white jersey with diagonal red and black pinstripes. It includes a Refugees Welcome logo on the chest and is in conjunction with Amnesty International. On 16 March 2020, Bohs launched a blue and navy striped third kit featuring a yellow trim. This kit also includes the commemorative inscriptions for the 130 year anniversary of the club. This kit was selected for use in Bohemians UEFA Europa League campaign.

Hill dumped his victims' corpses along the East-West Highway, known as \\"California State Route 60\\", earning him the nickname The 60 Freeway Killer. He also committed at least one of the Southside Slayer murders in South Los Angeles, and investigators suspect he's been involved in more. Hill was captured and convicted based on DNA profiling.  Biography  Ivan Hill was born on March 30, 1961 in Los Angeles. He was the second in a family of five children. Ivan grew up in a socially disadvantageous environment, his father being aggressive towards his wife and children. Shortly before Christmas in 1968, Hill's father shot his mother in the face with a .22 caliber rifle, and was sent to prison. Despite the serious injury, Hill's mother survived, and later divorced his father. Thereafter, Hill's grandmother began to take part in his upbringing. Due to financial difficulties, Hill's mother had to work two jobs, forcing Ivan to take care of his younger siblings throughout the 1970s. Hill spent his teens in Pomona, attending Pomona High School. During his school years, Ivan was involved in sports, being elected team captain of the school football team. Most of his acquaintances from those years spoke very positively of him. In 1978, a year before graduation, Hill became addicted to drugs and lost interest in studying. Suffering from financial difficulties, Hill began leading a criminal lifestyle in early 1979, committing several thefts.  Criminal career  In January 1979, Hill, along with accomplices, committed several robberies. On January 23, 17-year-old Hill and his accomplice, 18-year-old Venson Myers, robbed a liquor store in Glendora, during which Myers killed one store employee and seriously wounded another. For this crime, Vernon Myers was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole. As a minor, Hill was found guilty in complicity to murder, but due to cooperating in the investigation, he received a short sentence. During his detention, Hill graduated from high school, receiving his high school diploma. He later studied at one of the local colleges, after which he received parole and was released in the mid-1980s. After his release, Hill spent a lot of time in the San Gabriel Valley, constantly changing his place of residence. At various times, he worked as a day laborer, storekeeper, and forklift driver. In the late 1980s, he was rearrested for theft and convicted. Hill was released again in February 1993. Having problems with employment, he was engaged with low-skill labor and soon returned to his criminal lifestyle. During 1993, he committed several additional robberies; he was arrested in early 1994, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  Murders  While serving his 1994 sentence, a blood sample was taken from Hill. He was due to be released in February 2004, but in March 2003, Hill's DNA test showed his profile corresponded to that of an unidentified serial killer, who had left DNA evidence during attacks on six women in different suburbs of Los Angeles from November 1993 to January 1994. Based on this, in November 2003, Ivan Hill was charged with the murder of: * 37-year-old Betty Sue Harris, strangled on November 1, 1993 in Pomona; * 31-year-old Roxanne Bates, a Pomona resident whose body was found four days later in Chino; * 36-year-old Helen Ruth Hill (no relation), strangled in Walnut; * 35-year-old Donna L. Goldsmith found murdered on November 16; * 34-year-old Cheryl Sayers, found strangled on December 30, 1993 in the vicinity of Pomona * 33-year-old Debra Brown, whose body was found on January 12, 1994 in Ontario.  Trial  The trial of Ivan Hill opened in October 2006. His lawyers tried to get an indulgence for him on the basis that Ivan had been abused as a child, arguing this had ultimately led to mental, emotional and behavioral problems. Hill himself claimed that the murders occurred while he was in an unwell state of mind, characterized by complete confusion and uncontrolled impulsive action. Hill stated this resulted from a depressive disorder that he developed in September 1993, due to a fallout with his girlfriend, his dismissal from work, and his drug addiction. However, the court considered these circumstances insignificant, and found that Hill was sane at the time of the murders. He was convicted of six murders and received the death penalty on March 21, 2007. In late 2008, on the basis of the results of another DNA test, the investigation connected Hill with two more murders. In May 2009, at a new trial, Ivan Hill was charged with, and plead guilty to, the murder of 35-year-old Lorna Reed, strangled on February 11 in a Los Angeles suburb named San Dimas, and the murder of 23-year-old Rhonda Jackson, killed on February 27, 1987 in Pomona. The court sentenced him to an additional life term without parole. As of November 2019, the 58-year-old Hill is still alive and awaiting execution on San Quention State Prison's death row.

It was first released on the group's 1966 extended play Ready Steady Who. It, along with \\"I'm a Boy\\" are of the earliest compositions in which Townshend questions gender identity and identity crisis', a prevalent aspect found later in his songwriting. \\"Disguises\\" and \\"I'm a Boy\\" also marks the first time Kit Lambert received credit as a record producer for the Who, something that had previously been credited to Shel Talmy and Townshend. The thematic concept for the song proved successful and Townshend was subsequently praised by critics. It has since been covered by The Jam as the B-Side for their top-five single \\"Funeral Pyre\\" in 1981 and Of Montreal for their 1997 EP The Bird Who Ate the Rabbit's Flower.  Recording  Both \\"Disguises\\" and \\"I'm A Boy\\" were written to be parts of a concept album titled Quads, in which parents would be able to choose the gender of their children. However, this idea was later discarded and the pair of songs are the only ones that survived. They were first attempted on 14 June 1966 as demos, And were worked on for some months, before being finalized on the 31st July to 1 August of the same year. Paul Clay was the studio engineer for the recording. The previously mentioned backing track would later go on to be mimed by the band the following day, on 15 June for their final appearance on the television show A Whole Scene Going, in which Townshend appears with a false handlebar moustache. Following this performance, rumors started circulating that this would become their next single. It is one of the earliest songs recorded by them that features rather unique instruments. Claves can be heard clicking throughout the track, played by drummer Keith Moon, who would also later use them on \\"Magic Bus\\" in 1968. French horn is featured in a distinct solo played by bass guitarist John Entwistle. \\"Disguises\\" was never performed live by the band. The only live recording of the song originates from a session the Who recorded on 13 September, which was later broadcast on 17 September for an episode of Saturday Club. This version, apparently recorded as a joke, ends with Moon smashing his drums, interrupting presenter Brian Matthew, much to the bands' approval, with Matthew exclaiming \\"I see\\". This version can be found on their 2000 compilation album BBC Sessions.  Release and reception  \\"Disguises\\" remained unreleased for about three months, following a failure in securing the rights for a live EP recorded live from the Who's Ready Steady Go! TV-Special entitled Ready Steady Who! Reaction Records would then compile some previously unissued tracks and released them on Ready Steady Who. Although a nod to the TV-Special, it was completely unaffiliated with the show. In the US, it remained unissued for well over two years, before finally getting its first official release in the September 1968 compilation album Magic Bus: The Who on Tour, where the mono version was used. The songs was mixed in stereo, but never released in this format, which remained unreleased for about thirty years, before getting its first official release on Thirty Years of Maximum R&B; in 1994. The stereo version is nine seconds longer than the mono version, since the fade out in the latter comes in quicker. It was heavily praised for its innovative and original concept, most notably its use of reverb and feedback, which the group was well known for. John Atkins writes in his Biography of the group The Who on Record: A Critical History, 1963-1998, that \\"Disguises\\" was an inventive track based on a droning guitar figure drenched in reverb. He also mentions the influences of raga rock found in the track, possibly inspired by \\"See My Friends\\" by the Kinks. Mentions of the departure of rhythm and blues and venture into Psychedelia in the group's sound is also evident in \\"Disguises\\". In the AllMusic review of Ready Steady Who, Richie Unterberger states that \\"Rounding things off was a quite good Townshend original, \\"Disguises,\\" that played around his early themes of identity confusion. It was too good to be a cast-off on an EP\\". It is also highlighted in the review of Magic Bus: The Who On Tour.  Personnel   The Who  * Roger Daltrey – lead vocals * John Entwistle – bass guitar, french horn, harmony vocals * Pete Townshend – lead guitar, harmony vocals * Keith Moon – drums, tambourine, claves  Technical  * Kit Lambert – producer * Paul Clay – studio engineer  In other media  Ultimate Classic Rock ranked \\"Disguises\\" number 63 on their list of All 245 Who Songs Ranked Worst To Best, citing that \\"Waves of audio interference dovetail with Townshend’s lyrics about a girl who camouflages herself to get away from a suitor. “Disguises” is both a refreshing take on an unrequited love song and a strange way to record a plucky pop song. The whooshing sheets of noise bring a surreal quality that remains unsettling.\\" ULR also ranked it as number ten on their list of Top 10 Underrated Who Songs.

Ubaldi is credited for the selection, marketing and sale of bottom sirloin subprimal cuts in New York City as the \\"Newport steak.\\" Ubaldi was born in Perugia, Italy on September 16, 1910.Certificate of United States Citizenship No. 3615990, Petition No. 194554. Notarized August 18, 1932. In February 1918, he traveled with family aboard the Dante Alighieri and was processed at Ellis Island, receiving American citizenship in 1932. Ubaldi left formal education after the eighth grade to train as a butcher and chef, working variously for independent and family-owned ventures before opening Greenwich Village butcher shop Florence Prime Meat Market in 1936. He kept the business temporarily closed while serving in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946, and sold it in 1976. From 1976 to 1995, Ubaldi instructed demonstration courses in selecting, preparing and cutting meat at The New School for Social Research and the Institute of Culinary Education. Ubaldi described his introduction to and use of the bottom sirloin: > When I was discharged from the United States Navy, and returned to New York > to reopen my store, I found that meat wholesalers had switched over to the > system of selling beef that now prevails, that of \\"fabricating\\" beef, that > is, cut-down sections of the meat instead of forequarters and hindquarters. > Many of these cuts were new to me. The bottom butt caught my eye and, as the > price was reasonable, I bought three pieces, each weighing about 8 to 10 > pounds. When I got them back to the store and took them apart, I liked the > high quality of the meat and its fat content. I sliced the piece that is > shaped like a triangle into little steaks about 1 to 1¼ inches thick. At > that time a lot of my customers were single people or young couples, and > they really took to these steaks and their reasonable price, but they wanted > to know what to ask for next time they came in. One night [after 1957] I saw > an ad for Newport cigarettes on television and was struck by the similarity > of the white quarter moon opening the ad to the shape of my little steaks. > So we christened them Newport steaks. Ubaldi was one of several American butchers and chefs in the 1940s and 1950s to have independently utilized the bottom sirloin from fabricated beef. Ubaldi's preparation of the bottom butt involved a unique, undisclosed cut and folding technique, which is reproduced by current ownership of Florence Prime Meat Market in its offering of the Newport steak.

Among other positions, he acted as President of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, of which he was a member between 2001 and 2008. Biography Luiz Olavo Baptista was born in Itu, in rural São Paulo, in 1938. In 1958, he was admitted to Law School at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo. After graduating in 1963, he started practising law at a firm of his own. During the Military dictatorship in Brazil, he defended persecuted politicians as a lawyer, and later joined the truth commission of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil in São Paulo. After being blackmailed into dropping the defense of defendants during the regime of Ernesto Geisel, Luiz Olavo moved with his wife Marta Rossetti Batista and son Humberto to France in the 1970s, where he developed his doctorate. After returning to Brazil, he resumed his practice as lawyer and was a pioneer in advocating the use of arbitration in the country with research and publications at the University of São Paulo Law School, where he was a professor of international law for three decades. After being nominated by the President of Brazil in 2001, he became a member of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, of which he was president between 2007 and 2008, when he returned to legal and arbitral practice in Brazil at his firm, L.O. Baptista Advogados. In 2015, he left this office and founded Atelier Jurídico, an educational and research think tank, where he worked as arbitrator and legal expert, and the firm Nakagawa Baptista & Baptista, specializing in private law. Luiz Olavo passed away in São Paulo (SP, Brazil) on October 18, 2019, at 81 years of age. Academic career Luiz Olavo Baptista was one of the Brazilian pioneers in international arbitration and international trade law, worked as professor at universities in Brazil, the United States and France, and was the author of several books. After completing his law degree from Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo in 1963 and starting his career as a lawyer, Baptista completed his postgraduate studies at Columbia University in the US and The Hague Academy of International Law. In 1973, he became a law professor at PUC-SP, where he taught until 1980. Between 1976 and 1981, he obtained a doctorate in the use of joint ventures in international trade from the University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas, and in 1979 he was visiting scholar at the University of Michigan. In 1978, he began teaching at the University of São Paulo Law School, where he defended, in 1986, his habilitation on the then emerging topic of international electronic funds transfer, and obtained full professorship at USP in 1992. In the late 1990s, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Paris II. After retiring from USP in 2008, he received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Lisbon in 2009. He was lauded professor emeritus at the University of São Paulo Ribeirão Preto Law School in 2015 and, in 2018, he received the \\"Studies of Peace and Conflict Resolution\\" chair in honor of Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies by the University of São Paulo. Legal career Luiz Olavo Baptista was recognized as one of the most eminent Brazilian jurists in the field of international and commercial law, as well as one of the most active arbitrators in the country's history, having participated in about 1,400 arbitrations in over 50 years of activity. He worked as an attorney for over 40 years, helping the law firm he joined after graduation grow into one of the most renowned offices in Brazil, advising governments, international organizations and large companies in Brazil and abroad. Baptista was part of the United Nations Compensation Commission that ruled on compensation for victims of the Gulf War. He was project advisor to the World Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Center on Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Within the Mercosur, he was an arbitrator at the Protocol of Brasilia, where he ruled on a dispute over subsidies for pork production between Argentina and Brazil. He served as arbitrator in major Brazilian and international arbitration courts, including the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). In the investment arbitration sector, he ruled in several high-profile cases, such as Lanco v. Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Malicorp v. Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18), and Alten v. Spain (SCC Case No. 2015/036). He worked in class associations throughout his career, and was elected president of the São Paulo Lawyers' Association (AASP) between 1979 and 1980 and the Federal Branch of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil between 1981 and 1983. In 2001, he was appointed by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration to serve as a member of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, the first Brazilian to hold such office. He chaired the body for a year in 2007. During his time in court, he judged over important disputes involving the Brazilian government, such as the case of Brazilian cotton and sugar exporters against the US and Europe and a dispute between Embraer and Bombardier, in which Brazil accused Canada of subsidizing its aircraft industry. From 2015 until his death in 2019, he worked as arbitrator, wrote legal opinions and developed research and other projects at the Atelier Jurídico think tank. Honors In addition to academic titles, Baptista was appointed Great Officer of the Order of Rio Branco in 1996 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Brazil. In 2005, he received the High Distinction Award by the Brazilian Superior Military Court.

It was founded in 1838 and is located on Poststrasse on Paradeplatz.. It has belonged to Credit Suisse for several decades.Zürich damals-heute The hotel includes the two restaurants, Baur and Orsini, as well as the Savoy Bar.  History  Johannes Baur Johannes Baur, originally a journeyman bakerGrand Hotels: Reality and Illusion by Elain Denby - Google Books from Vorarlberg, Austria, immigrated to Zürich in the 1820s. He initially ran the Zum Kirschbaum in Marktgasse, opposite the confectioner David Sprüngli,Walter Baumann: Zu Gast im alten Zürich. München 1992, co- founder of Lindt & Sprüngli. In 1837, Baur bought the building in Zürich which had previously served as a parsonage and opened Café Baur right next to the city's most important post office. Together with his wife, Anna Knechtli, Baur converted the house into a hotel between 1836 and 1838 according to plans by architect Daniel Pfister, and, on 24 December 1838, opened Baur en Ville as the city's first hotel. 140 beds and stables for 36-40 horses were available at the time. The chronicle of 1845 contains the names of various notable people of the time who stayed at the Hotel Baur en Ville, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Bismarck and Anselm von Rothschild, Felix Mendelssohn and Franz Liszt. From 1877 to 1878, the house and the restaurant Orsini were rebuilt. After Baur's death, Heinrich Brunner took over the hotel and in 1899 sold it to the property speculator Jakob Lassmann from Constantinople. In 1899, the architects Alfred Chiodera and Theophil Tschudy approved a reconstruction and extension project in the French Renaissance style, but it was not carried out. Lassmann's speculations led to financial ruin and the hotel was sold to Jakob Schwarz. In 1907, under Schwarz, the conversion and extension was commissioned from the architects Pfleghard & Haefeli and 170 rooms were reopened on 13 June 1908. Since then, the hotel has borne the name Savoy. Since 1923 the hotel has been home to the United Guilds of Gerwe and Schumachern, and on 28 November 1924 the United Guilds celebrated their first meal in the hotel. Since 1923, the Savoy Club, founded in 1890 by Zürich returnees, has met in the hotel. From 1975 to 1978 the hotel was closed due to urgently needed renovation work. It was reopened on 31 March 1978. In the 1990s, the architects Fässler & Partner carried out various conversion work during ongoing operations, such as the renovation of the facade and roof in 1997, the conversion of 90 guest bathrooms and the redesign of the Orsini restaurant in 1998, the redesign of the banqueting and guild hall in 1999 and the redesign of 30 guest rooms and replacement of the canopy at the main entrance in 2000. Between 1985 and 2015, Christina and Manfred Hörger managed the hotel. Manfred died in 2015, and in 2017 Christina handed over the management to Werner Knechtli. The terrace was reopened in 2018 as an extension of the Savoy Bar. Today the hotel has 104 rooms and suites and 170 employees. Baur en Ville should not be confused with Baur au Lac, on Lake Zürich, which was also built by Baur in 1844.  Architecture and construction  From 1836 to 1838, the master builder and architect Daniel Pfister erected a regular, block-like structure, divided by Ionic columns and pilasters with Ionic capitals. During the 1907 conversion, the hotel was extended by two storeys, preserving the architectural style of the original building. Instead of the formerly continuous loggia, all the rooms behind the main façade were fitted with verandas and the pillars on the ground floor were narrowed down. The new floors were joined together by pillars with plant capitals that spanned several storeys. The top floor is distinguished by a meandering stone railing and pharaoh figures supporting the beams. In the 1970s, the building had to be completely demolished in accordance with fire protection guidelines, but also for reasons of comfort; conversion was not possible. At the same time, however, the street scene, consisting of the Tiefenhofhäusern, the Kreditanstalt and the Hotel Savoy Baur en Ville on Paradeplatz, was to be retained. The contract for the construction was awarded to Karl Steiner AG, which removed the façade step by step, erected a new building and then rebuilt the historic façade. Inside, the hotel is therefore built in the style of the 1970s, while from the outside it still shows the historic facade.

History  Around the year 1050, the territory of Höchst detached itself from the March (territory) Umstadt, which had already been erected by the Imperial Abbey of Fulda in about 755. In order to protect their interests and territory the abbots of Fulda then used the noble lords Reiz von Lützelbach as bailiffs. Wiknand of Lucelenbach, was the grandfather of the first Breuberg Konrad I (Reiz von Lützelbach) and is first mentioned in documents in 1160M. Stimming, Mainzer Urk.- Buch I 1932 Nr. 586 und 6(5)https://www.dilibri.de/rlb/content/titleinfo/1922528 and his son Konrad again in 1189 Valentin Ferdinand Gudenus: Codex Diplomaticvs: Exhibens Anecdota Ab Anno DCCCLXXXI, Ad MCCC. Mogvntiaca, Ivs Germanicvm, Et S.R.I. Historiam Illvstrantia. Göttingen 1743, S. 293f. Nr. 106 Their ancestral castle was previously suspected to be near the Lützelbach Protestant Church. In 2001 a strong foundation was found during the excavation of pipe trenches at the Lützelbach cemetery, presumably a keep, which archaeologically supports this assumption. Breuberg Castle Konrad I and his descendants built Breuberg castle around 1200 and named themselves after it from then onwards. Thanks to the marriage of his son Eberhard I. von Breuberg to Mechtild (Elisabeth?) in 1239, one of the hereditary daughters of the imperial bailiff Gerlach II. von Büdingen, the family increased its power, properties and interests also to the Wetterau, where Konrad II. (builder of Frankenstein Castle), Arrois, Gerlach and Eberhard III successively held the office of imperial bailiff of the Wetterau. All of them found their last resting place in the monastery Konradsdorf near Ortenberg, being donators and supervisors of the foundation. Under Gerlach (1245-1306) and his son Eberhard III, the family reached its zenith with the greatest territorial expansion, power and possessions. In 1282 under the reign of King Rudolf I of Germany, the Breuberg family's possessions, in addition to the original possessions of the house of Büdingen, could be extended by the high-court of Selbold and the Gelnhausen Mint (facility). The lordship included the imperial city of Mosbach am Neckar, the Schwäbisch Hall Mint and Köppern, Bergen and Oberrad as imperial fiefs in 1297.

It is bordered to the west and north by the Vallone di San Rocco, to the east by the Capodimonte ascent, to the south by the valleys of the Scudillo and the Fontanelle.  Etimology  The name \\"Colli Aminei\\" (Aminei Hills) was coined in ancient times: the beauty of the places, used as a vegetable garden, struck the Neapolitan inhabitants, who called them pleasant hills, from which the current name derives from deformation. Another interpretation traces the name \\"Aminei\\" to a population of Thessaly, also mentioned by Aristotle, who colonized the area during the Doric period, planting numerous vineyards on the hill called Capodimonte which produced the famous vino amineo, cited by Macrobio, that the Romans called Falerno.  History  Since Roman times, the Hills, along with Capodimonte, were considered a renowned resort and healthy air, thanks to the presence of thick woods. The Roman presence is evidenced by the ruins of the Mausoleo della Conocchia, a Roman sepulchral monument, which was very famous even in the romantic age, helping to attract foreign travelers and tourists to the area. Following the extraction limitations decreed in the city boundaries, in the XVIII century the area (then outside the city, like the other hilly areas of Vomero, Posillipo and dell'Arenella) saw the extraction of the tuff, in particular near the valley of San Rocco, both open-air and through underground quarries with access from above (latomie) or lateral from the valley itself (caves). During the Second World War the caves were used to guarantee the productive continuity of the Neapolitan aeronautical industries (for example IMAM - Southern Aeronautical Mechanical Industries) also under Allied bombing. Torre Caselli, country house of the Marquis Caselli in the Colli Aminei, now in ruins. The last inhabitant was the painter Antonio Berté (until the early nineties). Open mining, albeit in reduced form, continues today. The caves and the latomie are instead abandoned, although presenting a significant tourist potential as finds of industrial archaeology and for the natural context in which they are inserted. The urbanization of the Neapolitan hills reached the neighborhood in the sixties; fortunately the latomies and the inaccessible topography have limited the building disfigurement. Today the district has a densely inhabited area, with a population of about 30,000 inhabitants, surrounded by a green area, used as a public park or agricultural crops. The neighborhood is mainly residential. There are numerous small businesses, as well as a small induced from the many hospitals present in the Hospital Area, as well as the Juvenile Court of Naples and the relevant First Reception Center. It houses the headquarters of the Archiepiscopal Seminary of Naples, and of the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Southern Italy.  Transport and traffic  The Colli Aminei constitute a hinge of the city connections on the north-south axis, also due to the presence of the Colli Aminei station of Line 1 (Naples subway) with attached multi-storey car park. The roads are Viale Colli Aminei and Via Nicolardi; many crosses depart from both, named after plants and flowers, in memory of the historical natural beauty of the places. Originally the cross streets of Viale Colli Aminei were private streets that were part of large apartment buildings (Parco La Pineta, Rione Sapio). The sleepers were later acquired by the Municipality.  Parks  The parco del Poggio Several urban parks are present in the neighborhood or in its immediate vicinity. Of rare beauty is the Parco del Poggio, opened in 2001, which winds along the slope of the hill that faces the sea. It gives a view of Naples from a fairly high point that embraces Vesuvius, almost in front, and the area of Piazza Municipio with the Vomero hill overlooking it. Inside the park has a pergola path that descends towards its lowest point (right above the Naples ring road), an area equipped for children, a mini botanical garden with an exhibition of exotic plants, and above all an artificial lake, surrounded by from masonry seats like an arena. At the center of the lake there is a stage to give way, in the summer, to represent singing and various shows or film screenings. On April 5, 2008, the Park of Via Nicolardi was opened, smaller than the Parco del Poggio, with a skating rink and nature trail. The contiguous Vallone di San Rocco, although not easily accessible to the public, is protected as a green lung and included in the urban reserve of the Neapolitan hills. Not far from the neighborhood there are the Park of Capodimonte, with the historic Bourbon palace and the Museum of Capodimonte, as well as the large and wild Camaldoli Park.

The preeminent and oldest family of the ‘Cabang Atas’ gentry in Cirebon all through the 19th and early 20th century, their most well-known member today is Tan Tjin Kie, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen (January 25, 1853 – February 13, 1919). The Chinese Officership of Cirebon For over a century and five generations, the family dominated Cirebon's Chinese officership, a civil government institution consisting of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen through which the Dutch governed the local Chinese community of the colony. The first known member of the family, Tan Kong Djan, was Kapitein der Chinezen of Cirebon in the mid-1820s. In 1830, he celebrated the completion of the renovation of – the city's main Chinese temple – by putting up a commemorative wooden plaque, bearing his name. It is unclear whether any family relationship existed between the Kapitein and his predecessors, many of whom bore the surname of Tan. The Dutch-Indonesian researcher Steve Haryono suggests that the family, whose origin in Java probably predated Kapitein Tan Kong Djan, may have originally come from Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. In the second generation, two of his sons succeeded him in the Captaincy of Cirebon. Kapitein Tan Kim Lin took over the post from his father in the early 1830s, before dying in 1835. Soon after his brother's death, Kapitein Tan Phan Long (died in 1848) acceded to the Captaincy, and held office until retiring in 1846. He was the first Kapitein of Cirebon to be recorded in the colonial government's Regerings- almanak, that of 1836. Another brother, Tan Pin Long, served as Luitenant der Chinezen in Batavia from 1830 until 1837. In the third generation, Luitenant Tan Pin Long's son, Tan Siauw Tjoe, held the honorary rank of Luitenant- titulair der Chinezen in his capacity as a Boedelmeester in Batavia's Boedelkamer or Estate Chamber, the government custodial body in charge of the inheritance of minors. Luitenant-titulair Tan Siauw Tjoe was, however, dismissed from office in 1847 for his involvement in opium smuggling; reinstated in 1849, he was dismissed again in 1854. In Cirebon, upon the resignation of Kapitein Tan Phan Long in 1846, his nephew Tan Tiang Keng (1826 – 1884), part of the third generation as the eldest son of Kapitein Tan Kim Lin, was raised to the office of Luitenant der Chinezen, serving under his uncle's successor. Although Luitenant Tan Tiang Keng did not immediately accede to the Captaincy, he was given the honorary rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen in 1873 after 26 years in office. In 1882, Kapitein-titulair Tan Tiang Keng was finally elevated, like his grandfather, father and uncle before him, to the post of Kapitein der Chinezen of Cirebon. Also in 1882, the newly- inaugurated Kapitein's son, Tan Tjin Kie, the most prominent member of the fourth generation, was installed as Luitenant der Chinezen. In 1884, when Kapitein Tiang Keng died in office, Luitenant Tan Tjin Kie was passed over in the succession in favor of an older officer; but, two of his in-laws, the cousins Kwee Keng Eng and Kwee Keng Liem (husbands of the Luitenant’s sister and cousin respectively), were both raised to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen. In 1888, when the Captaincy again became vacant, Luitenant Tan Tjin Kie finally succeeded his father, granduncle, grandfather and great- grandfather as Kapitein der Chinezen of Cirebon. In 1913, as an unusual mark of high esteem, the colonial authorities awarded Kapitein Tan Tjin Kie the rank of Majoor-titulair der Chinezen. Cirebon – unlike the capital cities of Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya – was normally headed only by a Kapitein, not a Majoor. The Majoor died in office in 1919, and was given a lavish and much- remembered 40-day-long funeral ceremony, drawing visiting dignitaries from far and wide. In 1897, Kapitein Tan Tjin Kie's eldest son, Tan Gin Ho – a fifth- generation descendant of Kapitein Tan Kong Djan – was installed as Luitenant der Chinezen under his father. Also part of the fifth generation was Kwee Zwan Hong, who was appointed in 1908 as Luitenant of Losari, Sindanglaut and Ciledug, and further raised to the rank of Kapitein-titulair in 1924. Kapitein-titulair Kwee Zwan Hong was the son of Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem and, through his maternal grandmother Tan Sioe Nio, was a great-grandson of Kapitein Tan Kim Lin; in office until 1934, he was also the last serving Chinese officer in the Residency of Cirebon. Sugar barons The Tan family of Cirebon played a pioneering and significant role in Java's sugar industry until the Great Depression (1929–1939). The famous sugar mill of Loewoenggadjah was founded in 1828 by Kapitein Tan Kim Lin of Cirebon. This mill was inherited by his eldest son, Kapitein Tan Tiang Keng, his grandson, Majoor-titulair Tan Tjin Kie, then by his great-grandsons, Luitenant Tan Gin Ho and Tan Gin Han. By the 1880s, the Tan family owned a constellation of other sugar mills in addition to Loewoenggadjah, including Ardjosarie, Karangredjo, Krian, Mabet, Porwasrie, Soemengko and Tjiledoek. They were allied with the closely related Kwee family of Ciledug, owners of the Djatipiring and Kalitandjoeng sugar mills. The aftermath of the Great War (1914–1918) proved catastrophic for the Tan family of Cirebon. In 1922, they were forced to sell their main sugar mill, Loeowenggadjah, due to mounting debts. In 1926, Majoor Tan Tjin Kie's daughter, Tan Ho Lie Nio, was declared bankrupt. In 1931, both of her brothers, Luitenant Tan Gin Ho and Tan Gin Han were also declared bankrupt. Their Kwee cousins, descended on the female line from Kapitein Tan Kim Lin, fared better financially. Although forced by circumstances to sell their Djatipiring sugar mill in 1931, they maintained their political, social and economic prominence well into the 1950s.

He was in the front lines of many labor and democratization movements, and he portrays the lives and emotions of these protestors using vivid language in his writing. Park is well-known as the original author of the widely popular protest song from the 1990s, \\"Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\" (솔아 푸르른 솔아).  Life   Pre-debut  Park was born in 1958, in Buan County, North Jeolla Province. Because of his parent’s enthusiasm for education, Park spent years away from his hometown, graduating from Iksan Middle School and Jeonju Highschool.Association for the Commemoration of the Movement for Democracy, https://www.kdemo.or.kr/patriot/name/%E3%84%B1/page/1/post/497 As a high school student, he was an avid reader of Changbi Magazine, Sasanggye Magazine, and explored the works of Go Un, Hwang Seok-young, Kim Ji Ha and many others. His statements at school on the October Restoration and the made him a person put under surveillance by his school. Deciding that the repressive school life would no longer be necessary, Park eventually withdrew himself from high school. The next year, he joined the high school literary circle and published a passionate poem in the style of Soviet Revolutionary poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. He subsequently faced hardships as he had his home searched and was taken into custody at the police station for 20 days.Choe, Jaung, \\"History of Buan People 35- \\"Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\" Korean Democracy Movement and the Buan People in the 1970s and 80s, mixed emotions\\", Buan Independent Newspaper. After this, he went to Seoul to participate in the labor movements and Christian Young Adult movements while continuing to write poems. He officially made his debut as a poet with the publication of poems such as \\"Suyurieso\\" (수유리에서 In Suyuri) Association for the Commemoration of the Movement for Democracy Member Information, 2018.06.15.http://www.ibuan.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=22183  After his debut  In 1982, while working at a book-binding factory in the Guro Industrial Complex, Park actively engaged with activists in labor movements, student movements, culture movements of the masses, and Christian democracy movements. He participated as one of the leaders for various cultural activities and meetings, and founded the Folk Song Research Association (민요연구회) along with Shin Kyeong-nim, Im Jintaek, Jeong Huiseong, Gim Jeonghwan, and others. In 1984, he published a poetry collection, Chwieopgonggopan apeseo (취업공고판 앞에서 In Front of the Job Search Board) and a prose collection, Gongjangoksange olla (공장옥상에 올라 Up on the Factory Rooftop). Afterwards, he relocated to Bupyeong, Incheon until the 1990s living as a laborer and activist, while trying to faithfully reflect the realities of life as a worker in his writings. Furthermore, he participated in producing a video about Bak Jongcheol and worked at various publishing companies as a committee planning member or as an editor for literary magazines.Association for the Commemoration of the Movement for Democracy Member Information, https://www.kdemo.or.kr/patriot/name/%E3%84%B1/page/1/post/497 In 1987, Park’s poem \\"Baekje #6 Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\" - from the collection Chwieopgonggopan apeseo was adapted by An Chi-hwan for the song \\"Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\". \\"Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\"First known as a folk song, \\"Pine Tree, Green Pine Tree\\" was released in 1987 as a full album after a series of pro-democracy movements.

These works are based on Park’s own experiences as a worker and the activist.Gim, Myeongin, \\"Looking back on the life and death of a poet and critic\\", Hwanghaemunhwa, Autumn 2016. That is, in the 1980s labor was the basic condition for Park to write his poetry. However, as the times changed, Park’s poems also changed.Hwang, Hyeonsan, \\"Factory and Hometown – Reading Park Young-geun's Collection\\", Changbi, Autumn 2016. Chwieopgonggopan apeseo (1984) discusses the unstable lives for Korean workers in the 70s and 80s. However, from the words of a poetic narrator, it is difficult to find solidarity or the worker’s fighting spirit. For example, the narrator in the title poem \\"In Front of the Job Search Board\\" has been recently discharged from the army and stands face to face with the job search board grasping onto his resume in his hopeless situation. Therefore, the poetic narrator’s interests cannot realistically describe the worker’s reality or suggest any sort of prospect of freedom to the workers. Rather, the prominent idea in this collection is people’s existential sadness as they are unable to claim their own space and must wander among the periphery of the city, while holding onto the longing and pity for family in their hometown.Na, Huideok, \\"Flower Roots Facing the Travel’s Records: Park Young-geun Memorial\\", Changbi, Autumn 2016. This aspect of Park’s poems can be seen as a result of the poet’s own past, as he was made to leave his hometown and make his own living in another city. Daeyeol (대열 Workers Queue)(1987) in comparison, discusses the worker becoming clearly aware of their own class identity, and foregrounds the conflict between worker unity and the fight against capitalism. The poet’s struggle is finding effective methods while experimenting with various poetic forms. This includes adding poetic verses to a prose poem, or copying a whole wall of graffiti from factories onto the page, for example. What the poet wants most importantly out of these experiments is to establish a junction between poetry and reality. The opening lines from Pojang senteo (포장 센터 Packing Station), \\"The break bell rang and as I went to the bathroom I glanced at the shipping area lounge, and I stared at those dirty truck drivers and loading dock workers start to gamble\\", this passage reflects how the poet clearly understands the realities of the workers and their struggles. Through works such as \\"Nongseongjangui bam\\" (농성장의 밤 Strike Site Night), \\"Jabonga\\" (자본가 The Capitalist), \\"Amerika\\" (아메리카 America), \\"Ssaum jeonya\\" (싸움 전야 The Eve of the Fight), and others, Park, from the title alone, is able to capture the subject matter and themes of labor struggle. Park is able to present almost every aspect of 1980s labor reality in his vivid writing.  Poetry collection from the 1990s  In Gimmisunjeon (김미순전 The life of Gim Misun)(1993), the poetic narrator appears as an individual, rather than as a member of a community who voices solidarity to fellow workers. The optimism toward the worker’s struggles and will are pushed to the background, while fading memories of the struggles in the past are presented with painful emotion. These changes reflect the rapid decline and stagnation of Korea’s labor movements in the 1990s. Park’s last poetry collection published during his lifetime was Jeo kkochi bulpyeonhada (저 꽃이 불편하다That Flower is Uncomfortable) (2002); Park gazes upon the path that he has walked. \\"Gil\\" (길 Road) describes the road he has taken until this point, describing it as desolate winter scenery. Although, the poet arrives at home at the end of his difficult journey, he is unable to find any vestige of those that he tenderly remembers. Ultimately, the poet finds himself wandering endlessly without a home. The self-awareness of the poet that he is standing on the road, in spite of all that, enables him to endure the weight of life’s futility and maintain the tension of existence in reality.Yu, Seongho, \\"A Dark Song for the ‘Road’ between Memory and Reality – Park Young-geun, ‘That Flower is Uncomfortable’\\", Changbi, Silcheonmunhaksa, February, 2003.

It is based on the children's book of the same name by Bernard Wiseman, and was produced by Churchill Films. In 1993, the company created another short film based on Morris the Moose called Morris Has a Cold.  Plot  Morris the moose is happily strolling through the countryside, when he finds a penny, and stashes it with his others. He decides to head into town and buy something. He mistakenly enters a fish store (\\"It's Mel's Fish\\"), and asks the cashier for candy. The cashier explains that it is a fish store, and discovers that Morris can't read, and points him to the candy store. At the candy store, the candyman discovers that Morris can only count to four. After helping him with getting candy, he takes Morris to the local school (Wiseman Elementary School). The candyman introduces Morris to the teacher, Mrs. Fine, and Morris takes a seat with the rest of the students. While learning the alphabet, the letter B reminds Morris of a stinging bee. The letter C then reminds Morris of how much he loves the sea. Mrs. Fine tells him that he needs to raise his hand when he wishes to speak. Morris then has to go to the bathroom, but accidentally goes into the girl's bathroom, since he can't read. Later on, while spelling words, Morris is upset that they didn't spell \\"moose\\". The class then spells moose. It is then time for lunch, and recess. Morris plays with the other students. Next it's time for art, and they are fingerpainting. During art, Mrs. Fine explains thegrammar of the phrase \\"this is fun\\". Next it's time to count. Mrs. Fine shows Morris that he can count all the way to 12 using his antlers. Then it's music time and they all sing a song called \\"Feed Your Brain\\". After that, they play \\"make-believe\\". When school is over, Morris decides to celebrate his first day by buying gumdrops from the candy store, this time doing all the reading and counting himself.

As a writer for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert he is a 5 time Emmy nominee. Early life Kibblesmith attended Oak Park and River Forest High School. Internet writing Kibblesmith was an early employee of Groupon, joining in 2009. When he left the company in 2014, he was then the in-house comedy writer and senior marketing copywriter. He was also in charge of developing the company’s morale boosters. He left the company to become a freelancer. Kibblesmith became a founding editor of ClickHole in 2014, and afterward served as humor editor for BuzzFeed in 2015. Television writing In 2015 he then became a staff writer for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In a touch of irony, New York Times Magazine has once introduced him to its readership in a profile on Kibblesmith that began \\"he's never written jokes for Jimmy Kimmel\\", referring to Colbert’s late-night contemporary before Kibblesmith was hired. At the Late Show, he has received several Emmy nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series, three for the original series, and one for the special Stephen Colbert's Live Election Night Democracy's Series Finale: Who's Going To Clean Up This Sh*t?, with five total nominations. He has also been nominated for Writers Guild Awards for Comedy/Variety Talk Series. Kibblesmith was also the writer for the Celebrating Marvel's Stan Lee television special in 2019. Books Kibblesmith is the author of the books Princess Dinosaur (2021), We Wish You a Harley Christmas: DC Holiday Carols, and Santa's Husband (2017). Santa's Husband was inspired by a humorous tweet by Kibblesmith, who had heard of someone employed as Santa Claus at the Mall of America, who happened to be black. He wrote that he would tell future children that Santa Claus was black, and that any white Santa Claus was \\"Santa’s husband\\". Following the tweet, illustrator A.P. Quach created an image of a black and white Santa in romantic positioning. He is also the co- author of the book How to Win at Everything (2013). Comic books In 2017 Kibblesmith was the writer for the satirical Valiant Comics book Quantum and Woody, Valiant High, and the Harley Quinn 25th Anniversary Special. He is also the writer for several Marvel comics, including variants of Spider-Man, Loki, Black Panther Vs. Deadpool, and Lockjaw. In 2019 he discussed his Loki series, that it described Loki as the Marvel Universe’s \\"bad roommate\\". In March 2020, he was announced as writer for the relaunch of the New Warriors comic, for which he co-created Marvel’s first non-binary character. The use of pejorative internet slang in the character names received severe criticism, and the concept for the comic received anti-progressive social media criticism as well. Social media Kibblesmith developed the idea for GOP Teens in 2012 with a dormant website, which he first began using as a parody space in 2014. In addition to the tweets, Kibblesmith also developed a line of parody merchandise sporting the GOP Teens logo. During the 2016 US Presidential Republican Primary, Kibblesmith the parody Twitter account \\"GOP Teens\\" was described by Bustle as, \\"a Republican youth outreach campaign that hilariously skewers politicians’ misguided attempts to appeal to young people\\" by tweeting \\"messages written from the perspective of someone who doesn’t really understand how social media works\\". Kibblesmith’s personal Twitter account has also been covered by the news as he releases comic tweets and items such as fan theories. He has also used his social media to issue parody comics focused on comic strips such as Calvin and Hobbes. Personal life Originally from Oak Park, Illinois, he lives in New York City with his wife, Jennifer Wright, whom he married in 2017.

It is a light tan colour with black elytra (wing cases), and is found in tropical Asia where it is a pest of mango (Mangifera indica). Distribution The mango leaf-cutting weevil is native to tropical Asia where it occurs in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Hosts In Thailand, this weevil has been found living on several different hosts including Mangifera indica, Mangifera caloneura, Mangifera boetida and Bouea burmanica. It can also be found on cashew (Anacardium occidentale), but the damage is seldom serious. Life cycle The adult female uses her ovipositor to deposit eggs singly in small hollows excavated on the upper surface of a young leaf near the midrib; she then severs the leaf near the stalk from edge to edge, including the midrib, whereupon it falls to the ground. The eggs hatch in about two days, and the larvae mine into the leaf tissue. After a larval state lasting about eleven days, the larvae exit the leaf and form themselves earthen chambers in which to pupate. After undergoing metamorphosis, the adults emerge in about eight days. Six days later they are fully mature and start to breed, copulation usually taking place early in the morning, and lasting for about an hour. Female fecundity averages 614. The females live for about ten weeks and the males for about a week less. Damage Adult weevils scrape the surface layers of mango leaves which turn brown, crumple and become contorted. They also cut \\"windowpanes\\" between the veins. The most obvious sign of infestation is the presence of cut leaves on the ground beneath the tree, and the stripped, leaf-less shoots, which can be seen from a distance. Infested trees have reduced growth rates, poor flowering and lower yields, the growth of root suckers may be slowed and grafts fail.

He was most well known for his character roles in the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis.  Career  Kerwin enjoyed some success on the stage and screen before being discovered by Herschell Gordon Lewis through the promotional short Carving Magic. His first feature film with Lewis was Living Venus, and he went on to star in some of the director’s best known works such as Blood Feast. In addition to playing principal roles, Kerwin served variously as the assistant director, makeup technician, gaffer, key grip and propman for Lewis’ films. Kerwin was thus often involved in creating the gory practical effects that would become Lewis’ trademark. Whether working with Lewis or other directors, Kerwin was closely associated with the exploitation film movement. In particular, he was known for work in nudist films and splatter films. Throughout his career, Kerwin often performed under pseudonyms such as Thomas Wood in order to appear in non-union productions. He was registered with the Screen Actors Guild under the name Willam Kerwin.  Personal Life  Kerwin’s first marriage was to actress Hanna Hertelendy from 1952 to 1958. Kerwin had one daughter from his marriage to Hertelendy, costume designer Barbara Kerwin. In 1964, Kerwin married Connie Mason, who he met while filming Blood Feast. The couple had two daughters, Denise and Kim,and remained married until Kerwin's death in 1989. Kerwin was the brother of director Harry Kerwin and appeared in several of his films throughout the 1970s including God's Bloody Acre, Barracuda and Tomcats. All three of Kerwin’s daughters pursued film careers for at least a decade. Half-sisters Barbara and Kim Kerwin had bit roles in Herschell Gordon Lewis’ The Gruesome TwosomeThe Gruesome Twosome (1967) - IMDb as children; William Kerwin himself did not appear in this movie. Both girls also collaborated with their uncle Harry Kerwin; Barbara had a small role in Sweet Bird of Aquarius while Kim acted in Cheering Section.

The goal of ASA is to link together sanctuary directors and founders in order to share experiences and to enable unwanted and wild unreleasable animals to find safe haven. The ASA is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.\\"American Sanctuary Association (ASA).\\" Encyclopedia of Associations: National Organizations of the U.S., edited by Tara E. Atterberry, 57th ed., Gale, 2018. Gale Directory Library, https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/XBIUTU575770232/GDL?u=tplmain&sid;=GDL&xid;=e0c346c9. Accessed 8 Dec. 2019.  History  ASA was founded in 1998 in large part to fill the role for animal sanctuaries that the AZA fills for zoos, and in disagreement with the prevailing accreditation standards. Actress and animal activist, Tippi Hedren, founder of the Shambala Preserve, was elected as the first President, and still serves in that role.  Accreditation  ASA serves as an accrediting body for animal sanctuaries, ensuring that ASA accrediting facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by U.S. law. As of 2019, the ASA has 50 accredited sanctuaries in the United State. To receive accreditation by the ASA, a sanctuary must first submit an application demonstrating that it meets the ASA's criteria. Once the application receives preliminary approval, ASA conducts a site visit before granting accreditation. Among other things, the ASA looks at the sanctuary's financials, nonprofit status, APHIS inspection reports, habitat designs, food prep areas, staff and board of directors, emergency procedures, and general condition of the sanctuary and its inhabitants.  Placement  ASA does not have a sanctuary facility of its own, but assists accredited sanctuaries with animal placement. Unlike wildlife rehabilitation centers, wildlife sanctuaries provide homes to wild animals that have been deemed non-releasable, usually due to injuries or habituation to humans. Some animal sanctuaries specialize in wildlife; others work with domestic animals and livestock. ASA can help to find the right sanctuary to house specific animals in need of homes.

The education system started to take shape in 1847 when Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah state. The first schools were predominantly run by the Mormon community, with ecclesiastical leaders organizing the curriculum and facilities as well as teaching Mormon doctrines. When Utah became a state in 1896, schools became government-funded, allowing for free public-school education throughout the state. Today, the education system hosts a range of public, charter, and private K-12 schools. There is also a mix of private and public higher learning institutions throughout the state.  History   Pioneer arrival and LDS influence  Early Mormons fled to present-day Utah – which was a Mexican territory at the time – to escape religious persecution and the Missouri Governor's extermination order, arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. For the first two decades following the settlement, most schools were run through church institutions. Classes generally took place in LDS church meeting houses and school boundaries mirrored the boundaries of LDS wards. The schools were each controlled by a local trustee that was appointed by the bishop of each ward. Schools were financed almost entirely by the families who attended the school, meaning that they heavily relied on the local economy. The independent nature of each school and the fluctuating funds between areas meant that the quality of education and curriculum offered to pupils varied throughout the state. As they were mainly supported and sponsored by the church, the curriculum often covered Mormon moral values and even included LDS scripture as part of the supporting course content. In 1851, efforts were made to standardize curriculum and school policy through the new territorial superintendent of schools' office, however the impact of centralization was not immediate.  19th century  Schoolhouse in Pleasant Grove, originally built in 1852–53 with additional wings being built in 1864. Now recognized as a Daughters of Utah Pioneers historical site. During the 1860s, an influx of Protestants and Catholics settled in Utah, which forced schools to shift from ecclesiastical control to government control. County superintendents were put in place, and the legal responsibility for school operations moved from Bishops to city councils. Local governments began to collect taxes to provide for teacher salaries and school supplies. Though Utah Mormons had been relatively isolated, the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 grew the population with a number of non-LDS groups. Many of these new minority groups sought to “Christianize” the majority LDS population, despite Mormons considering themselves to be a Christian denomination.. Protestants sought to eliminate Mormon teachings in schools by educating the children of Utah in the hope of converting them. Mission schools were established to serve this purpose, the first of which was St. Mark's School and was built in 1867. The school still exists today. These schools also provided private education, free from Mormon doctrine and influence. By 1870, most public schools still required fees to provide salaries and materials, resulting in a push for publicized education. The legislature began using territorial receipts to provide these funds. The non-LDS community made up 20% of the population at this point, and resisted the idea of regionally funding public schools which were still essentially Mormon-dominated schools. The minority religions called for a separation of church and state, a call made more significant as the Territorial Superintendent of District Schools at the time was John Taylor, the third president of the LDS church, who had defeated the first liberal candidate to run, M.W. Ashbrook. In 1887, the federal government stepped in, issuing the Edmunds–Tucker Act which required changes to many of the Church's political and social practices. This included a call to end polygamy and abolishing the territorial Superintendent of Schools. The Territorial Supreme Court was then given appointment power of a \\"commissioner of schools\\" who would approve content used in schools and look to integrate Mormon students, non-Mormon students and teachers. Soon after, legislation passed the School Law of 1890 which made public education free throughout the territory. When Utah achieved statehood in 1896, this law expanded to make the schools government-funded and free of sectarian control.  20th century  Utah children reading in school, Santa Clara, Utah, 1940 In the 20th century, Utah became one of the first states to equalize education throughout the state.In 1919, the first compulsory attendance laws were passed in Utah, leading to increased enrollment in schools. However, the rise in student enrollment across the public school system created in itself new issues that would challenge the state. = Conflicts between church and state = The conflict between church and state commonly existed in public schools in Utah during this time. At the turn of the 20th century, Utah boasted one of the lowest private enrollment rates in the U.S. (0.5%). Non-Mormon families in Utah felt that public schools were essentially private because of the heavy Church of the Latter-day Saints influence on curriculum. The Church attempted to create private school system in response to Protestant education reforms, but they were transformed into public schools, which in turn led to a low private school enrollment rate. = Financial crises and reforms = After World War II, Utah's attention turned back to improving education. It was notable that students continued to achieve above-average test scores despite the deprivation of funds. This can partly be attributed Utah's above-average birth rate compared to other U.S. states. After World War II, teachers and schools started to seek more funding from the government. This proved challenging during the governorship of J. Bracken Lee (1949–1957) due to sweeping budget reforms and his objection to receiving federal aid. Once Lee left office, governors sought ways to better fund teachers and the education system, but these efforts proved insufficient. In 1960, around 12% of teachers in Utah moved states for work, partially due to having lower salaries. Many students who trained to be teachers ended up working outside Utah. This resulted in around half of Utah teaching jobs filled by uncertified people or those certified through questionable means. The maintenance of buildings was also a challenge for teachers. Some schoolhouses were falling apart and prevented effective teaching, with some roofs of buildings collapsing during school hours. In May 1964, the financial crisis became so extreme that the National Education Association (NEA) sanctioned the Utah state education system. This was the first time this had happened to a whole state in the history of the NEA. After Cal Rampton, a democratic governor elected after Lee, resolved some of the financial issues raised through NEA sanctions, the sanctions were lifted in 1965. After Rampton conducted his educational reforms and provided better funding for schools, they restarted operations. Student performance was no longer above the national average. In 1983, the National Commission of Excellence in Education ranked US students below average compared to other developed and developing countries around the world, prompting additional educational reforms in Utah and throughout the United States. Utah's governor, Scott Matheson, adopted new goals which helped improve education in Utah following the trends of the US. = Indian Placement Program (1953–1996) = The Indian Placement Program was an official LDS program that aimed to provide Native American children education in schools dominated by white settlers in the Mormon Corridor. The program stemmed from the Church's desire to invite Native Americans or \\"Lamanites\\" into the church and become one people with them. The Intermountain Indian School in Brigham City that ran from 1950 to 1984 The church invited Native American children to live with an active family in the city for the duration of the school year, allowing them to attend a local school close to their \\"foster\\" home. Participation required children to be baptized members of the church, be relatively free of emotional oddities, want to be educated, and keep good grades. Their biological parents would sign a form to allow them to participate in the program. The church and the \\"foster\\" family would provide for the remaining needs of the child. The program reached maximum enrollment in the 1970s at about 5,000 students. There were mixed reactions regarding involvement in the program. Some participants felt the program helped them, while others felt that their involvement in the program took them away from their culture, which they could no longer identify with. Other critics claimed that the church was kidnapping children to indoctrinate them into their faith and culture, while some claimed it harmed the children's psychological welfare by separating them from their biological parents. As schools on reservations improved throughout the 1980s, enrollment in the Indian Placement Program fell until the church officially ended the program in 1996. Present Day Primary and Secondary Education Public education in Utah follows the K-12 system in which students attend primary and secondary schools of which there are three kinds throughout the state: public, charter, and private. The Utah State Board of Education oversees all public education legislation and standards throughout the state including all public and charter schools (which are funded through the state). There are currently forty-two public school districts with a total student population of 666,858 https://www.schools.utah.gov/, 'Fall Enrollment Demographics Guide' (pdf) and a student-teacher ratio of 1:21. https://www.schools.utah.gov/file/b4d547ed- ea42-4f4b-9911-44af4505d8ba, 'USBE Studen-Teacher Ratios.' The approved public education budget for the 2020 fiscal year was $5.6 billion, and the state graduation rate for 2019 was 87.4%. https://www.schools.utah.gov/file/cf1d9a7b-85f6-46d9-b608-73f166a42ba5, 'USBE Utah 2019 Graduation Rates.'

Recently, the polynomial method has led to the development of remarkably simple solutions to several long-standing open problems. The polynomial method encompasses a wide range of specific techniques for using polynomials and ideas from areas such as algebraic geometry to solve combinatorics problems. While a few techniques that follow the framework of the polynomial method, such as Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, have been known since the 1990s, it was not until around 2010 that a broader framework for the polynomial method has been developed.  Mathematical overview  Many uses of the polynomial method follow the same high-level approach. The approach is as follows: * Embed some combinatorial problem into a vector space. * Capture the hypotheses of the problem by constructing a polynomial of low-degree that is zero on a certain set * After constructing the polynomial, argue about its algebraic properties to deduce that the original configuration must satisfy the desired properties.  Example  As an example, we outline Dvir's proof of the Finite Field Kakeya Conjecture using the polynomial method. Finite Field Kakeya Conjecture: Let \\\\mathbb{F}_q be a finite field with q elements. Let K \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n be a Kakeya set, i.e. for each vector y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^nthere exists x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n such that K contains a line \\\\\\\\{x + ty, t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q \\\\\\\\}. Then the set K has size at least c_nq^nwhere c_n > 0 is a constant that only depends on n. Proof: The proof we give will show that K has size at least c_nq^{n-1}. The bound of c_nq^n can be obtained using the same method with a little additional work. Assume we have a Kakeya set K with K < {q+n-3\\\\choose n-1} Consider the set of monomials of the form x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2} \\\\dots x_n^{d_n} of degree exactly q-2. There are exactly {q+n-3\\\\choose n-1} such monomials. Thus, there exists a nonzero homogeneous polynomial P(x_1,x_2, \\\\dots , x_n) of degree q-2 that vanishes on all points in K. Note this is because finding such a polynomial reduces to solving a system of K linear equations for the coefficients. Now we will use the property that K is a Kakeya set to show that P must vanish on all of \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n. Clearly P(0,0 \\\\dots , 0) = 0. Next, for y eq 0, there is an x such that the line \\\\\\\\{x + ty, t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q \\\\\\\\} is contained in K. Since P is homogeneous, if P(z) = 0 for some z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n then P(cz) = 0 for any c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q. In particular P(tx + y) = P(t(x+t^{-1}y)) = 0 for all nonzero t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q. However, P(tx+y) is a polynomial of degree q-2 in t but it has at least q-1 roots corresponding to the nonzero elements of \\\\mathbb{F}_q so it must be identically zero. In particular, plugging in t = 0 we deduce P(y) = 0. We have shown that P(y) = 0 for all y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n but P has degree less than q - 1 in each of the variables so this is impossible by the Schwartz–Zippel lemma. We deduce that we must actually have K \\\\ge {q+n-3\\\\choose n-1} \\\\sim \\\\frac{q^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}  Polynomial partitioning  A variation of the polynomial method, often called polynomial partitioning, was introduced by Guth and Katz in their solution to the Erdős distinct distances problem. Polynomial partitioning involves using polynomials to divide the underlying space into regions and arguing about the geometric structure of the partition. These arguments rely on results from algebraic geometry bounding the number of incidences between various algebraic curves. The technique of polynomial partitioning has been used to give a new proof of the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem via the polynomial ham sandwich theorem and has been applied to a variety of problems in incidence geometry.  Applications  A few examples of longstanding open problems that have been solved using the polynomial method are: * The finite field Kakeya conjecture by Dvir *The cap set problem by Ellenberg and Gijswijt with the original framework developed on the analogous problem over \\\\mathbb{Z}_4^n by Croot, Lev and Pach * The Erdős distinct distances problem by Guth and Katz *The Joints Problem in 3D by Guth and Katz.

His programme has attracted protest on religious grounds and was briefly halted in 2019 before being reinstated. Moffat was awarded an MBE in 2017 for services to equality in education. Early life and education Moffat has described growing up in 80s Britain as characterised by homophobic bullying, and said, \\"School was brutal really in the eighties...Virtually every gay person [who grew up in the era has] the same story about being bullied\\". Moffat attended John Willmott School, Sutton Coldfield, until 1988 and Josiah Mason College until 1990. He received a BA in English with drama and American Studies from the University of Derby in 1993, followed by a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, also from Derby. He was later awarded an MA in emotional and behavioural difficulties from the University of Birmingham. As of 2019 he is studying for a PhD entitled The role of schools in reducing potential for radicalisation. Teaching career Early in his career Moffat worked with challenging youths in the West Midlands including those involved in gang culture. He worked as a teacher and schools advisor in several schools before becoming an assistant head teacher at a Birmingham primary school, Chilworth Croft Academy in 2009. Moffat was also responsible for training primary school teachers on how to manage homophobic bullying using resources some of which he had written while a teacher, including Challenging Homophobia In Primary Schools: An early years resource (2007), later published as Challenging Homophobia In Primary Schools (CHIPS) (2012). While teaching a series of lessons about tolerance for people of different sexual orientations in 2014, the school received a complaint from a \\"Christian parent\\" objecting to the material and content of the lessons. There followed a meeting with 40 parents, mostly Christian and Muslim, at which some parents reportedly complained they were not happy that their children \\"learn that it’s OK to be gay\\". As a result of the meeting Moffat resigned. In a statement the school said, \\"The...objections were primarily voiced by those whose own religion took an opposing stance to homosexuality.\\" Moffat has stated that the objections surfaced after he came out publicly as gay in a school assembly. Shortly after, he took a position at another primary school, Parkfield Community School, an academy also in the Birmingham area as a Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) teacher and assistant head teacher. It was at Parkfield where he first implemented his No Outsiders programme on inclusivity and tolerance for children in primary schools. The programme does not address sex or sex education. Following the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, and in response to his school children's questions, Moffat put together online resources for teachers covering terrorism and hate crime, particularly concerning refugees. In 2016, Parkfield school, where he was at the time assistant head teacher, was rated as \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted, and particular mention given to \\"the provision for pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is a strength and permeates the school’s work. This is an inclusive school that celebrates diversity.\\" Moffat also has responsibility for pastoral care of pupils and teachers within the school. In 2017 Moffat was given an MBE \\"for services to equality and diversity in education\\". In June 2019, Moffat along with 7 other prominent school leaders presented a parliamentary briefing on behalf of the National Association of Head Teachers entitled Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) and Health Education. The presentation in Westminster and accompanying document advised parliament on current policy and asked for clarity and support in providing education around the Equality Act 2010's protected characteristics. In 2019 Moffat was a finalist for the Global Teacher Prize from the Varkey Foundation. No Outsiders Moffat began to design the No Outsiders programme of learning prior to becoming assistant head teacher at Parkfield Community School, an academy school in Birmingham, UK. The programme addresses issues of inclusion, and covers topics which are protected by the 2010 Equality Act, including religion or belief system, race, gender reassignment and sex, not sexual orientation. Age-appropriate books are used as part of the programme to illustrate key concepts, such as Odd Dog Out by Children's Book Prize winner Rob Biddulph which covers inclusion, Stonewall Book Award winner Julián Is a Mermaid by Jessica Love which looks at diversity and gender roles, and And Tango Makes Three by Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson which looks at same-sex marriage and parenting. The programme attracted criticism and protest at the school from a vocal minority of parents when it was introduced. The school has a 98% majority of children with Muslim parents, and the protestors objected principally on the grounds that they did not want their children to be taught about LGBT issues. In 2019, following Moffat's nomination for the Global Teacher Prize from the Varkey Foundation, protests grew and spread to other schools in the area. Following continuing protests, the programme was temporarily halted in March 2019 at these schools and Parkfield whilst a resolution with parents and guardians was sought. Moffat, as an openly gay staff member, was advised by the police to do a risk assessment of his travel arrangements from school. Following 5 months of consultation the programme restarted in September 2019, entitled \\"No Outsiders for a Faith Community\\", and included year group consultations with parents in advance of the lessons starting. Despite Ofsted having assessed the programme as age-appropriate, objections from some parents, and calls for him to be dismissed, continued. In 2019 Birmingham City Council applied to the High Court for an injunction to create an exclusion zone to protect the schools from organised protests following an investigation by the Commission for Countering Extremism which revealed the protests had been taken over by Hizb ut-Tahir and other pro-Islamist groups, unconnected to either school, with a specific aim to “entrench social division” and “amplify hate” against LGBT people. The judge, Justice Warby upheld a permanent exclusion to the groups and stated they had deliberately “grossly misinterpreted” the programme by suggesting it promoted paedophilia which was not true.\\" Moffat also runs an after-school club called Parkfield Ambassadors. Here children learn more about the programme and visit other local schools to tell pupils about it. One aim of the club is to make connections between school children and reduce the risk of radicalisation in vulnerable groups. As of 2019, Moffat is CEO of No Outsiders, a charity which describes its mission, \\"No Outsiders prepares young people and adults for life as global citizens, reducing potential for terrorism and promoting community cohesion.\\" In 2020 the school announced Moffat had taken on a development lead position across the academy trust in order to train more teachers to deliver the No Outsiders programme. He has also assumed responsibility for delivering the Right Respecting Schools programme, a UNICEF initiative which ensures a safe learning environment based on children's rights. In April 2020 Moffat released a second book, No Outsiders: Everyone Different, Everyone Welcome, an updated book about the programme. Personal life Moffat describes teaching as \\"the best job in the world\\" and \\"an honour\\". He is openly gay and has received threatening emails and abuse because of his sexuality throughout the protests. He did not come out to his family until he was 27. In May 2019 Moffat led Birmingham Pride along with LGBT Muslims Saima Razzaq and Khakan Qureshi. Moffat also speaks as a children's rights communicator and has presented at Humanists UK 2019 convention and the 2019 Blackham lecture with Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson. Moffat entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

It is composed of a B-type star and an unseen object that might be a black hole. If the star is an ordinary main sequence B-type star (with its luminosity in conflict with a mainstay astronomic satellite's parallax measurements), the companion which is strongly suspected to be solitary, would be a black hole having mass outside of ordinary single stellar evolution parameters. Star The optically observed star, LB-1 A, or , is a B-type star nine times the mass of the Sun and located at least from Earth. It was found to exhibit radial velocity variations by Chinese astronomers using the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and the radial-velocity method to search for such wobbly stars. The astronomers observed the star orbiting an unseen companion every 78.9 days, in what researchers described as a \\"surprisingly circular\\" orbit. Follow-up observations using the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain and the W. M. Keck Observatory in the United States better defined the findings. The parallax to LB-1 has been published in Gaia Data Release 2, implying a distance around . The observed spectral properties of the star are inconsistent with those expected for an ordinary main sequence B-type star at this distance. A separate spectroscopic analysis of the star suggests that instead of a B-type main sequence star as had been indicated, LB-1 A is more likely a stripped helium star (whose spectrum is very similar) with only ~, if at the distance determined by the Gaia satellite. An additional spectroscopic analysis utilised multi-epoch spectroscopy and disentangling techniques and found that LB-1 comprises of two non-degenerate stars: a rapidly rotating B-type star with a disk (a Be star) and a slowly rotating stripped helium star. Unseen companion The unseen companion to the star was discovered by measuring the radial velocity shifts of its companion star. If it is a black hole, this would mark the first time a stellar black hole was discovered without observation of its X-ray emissions. If the distance from parallax is ignored, and the star is assumed to be an ordinary main sequence B-type star, the unseen companion LB-1 B or LB-1 *, could be hypothesized to be a black hole, with a mass of about 70 solar masses, more than twice the mass as the maximum predicted by most current theories of stellar evolution. It would be in the stellar-mass black hole range, below the size of intermediate-mass black holes; however, it would fall in the pair-instability gap of black hole sizes, whereby sufficiently massive black hole progenitor stars undergo pair- instability supernovae and completely disintegrate, leaving no remnant behind. LB-1 would be the first black hole discovered in the mass gap range. The companion mass would be high enough that anything other than a black hole would be expected to be easily detected. According to one of the researchers, \\"This discovery forces us to re-examine our models of how stellar-mass black holes form [...] This remarkable result, along with the LIGO-Virgo detections of binary black hole collisions during the past four years, really points towards a renaissance in our understanding of black hole astrophysics.\\" Alternatively, the evidence for the star to be a stripped helium star reduces the mass estimate of the compact object to as little as ~ and raises the possibility of a neutron star. A revised multiepoch spectroscopic study of LB-1 has revealed that LB-1 does not contain a black hole at all. Instead, it comprises a rapidly rotating Be star and a slowly-rotating helium star. The system was proposed to have formed through a past mass-transfer event. In this framework, the stripped helium star was originally the more massive star and has therefore evolved faster than its companion. After leaving the main sequence, the progenitor star transferred mass to its companion, which became the massive rapidly rotating Be star we see today.

The premise of the series is that a teenaged Queen Cleopatra is brought to the far future to attend school and fight a space tyrant together with her friends Akila and Brian. So far, five comic books have been published: Target Practice (2014), , The Thief and the Sword (2015), , Secret of the Time Tablets (2016), , The Golden Lion (2017), , and Fallen Empires (2019), , with a sixth one, Queen of the Nile (2020). Maihack revealed in October 2020 he wrote the protagonist, Cleopatra, as a character with bit of ADHD and having \\"depressive disorder.\\" It was adapted into an eponymous animated television series by DreamWorks Animation; the series was first broadcast in Southeast Asia on DreamWorks Channel beginning on November 25, 2019, and was released in the United States on Peacock, which launched on April 15, 2020, to certain customers. Maihack would help produce the TV series. Reception Reviews of Maihack's comics have been generally positive. J. Caleb Mozzocco, in School Library Journal, described Target Practice as having an art style with a \\"touch of anime/manga influence\\" along with other cartoonist styles, resulting in a clean, simple, and inviting looking to pages, which is well suited for various characters, settings, and technologies, while adding that Cleopatra is a likable character in these comics as a \\"kick-butt, teen girl heroine.\\" Rich Clabaugh, a staff writer for The Christian Science Monitor built on this, reviewing the same book, writing that they were pleased to see a \\"strong, spunky female main comic character that will appeal to both girls and boys\\" and called Maihack a skilled artist who can breath a \\"vibrant life into his characters, human, alien, and cat.\\" Robert Greenberger was more critical but still admitted that Maihack is a talented and \\"clever storyteller\\" who uses an \\"expressive and a restrained color palette.\\" Maihack's other comics were also reviewed positively, some calling Secret of the Time Tablets an all ages \\"sci-fi series full of pizzazz, high energy, and lots of questions to answer\\" and The Golden Lion as having beautiful illustrations, complete with a \\"terrific cast of characters that continue to evolve.\\" Apart from this, others called Maihack's comics \\"a rollicking all-ages adventure,\\" and involving a \\"series of Star Trek–style space adventures punctuated with far-future high school drama.\\" On September 11, 2020, Daniel Toy described Target Practice on CNN's Underscored an \\"action-packed journey through space and time that will excite any young reader\\" and called the rest of the series \\"out of this world.\\" References External links * Mike Maihack's Cleopatra in Space website Category:Depictions of Cleopatra in comics Category:2014 comics debuts Category:American graphic novels Category:Comics about women Category:Mental and behavioural disorders ","title":"Cleopatra in Space"},{"id":"62461867","text":"Lepelsky Uyezd (Лепельский уезд) was one of the subdivisions of the Vitebsk Governorate of the Russian Empire.

It lies along the Chambal and Yamuna river valleys, in southeastern Rajasthan, southwestern Uttar Pradesh and northern Madhya Pradesh. It is well- known for its badlands and extensive ravine systems, that have hosted an untold number of dacoits.  Geology  The Chambal badlands are part of the greater Vindhyan Basin.  Geography  It covers the districts of Baran, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, and Dholpur districts of Rajasthan, parts of Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Auriya and Jalaun districts of UP, and Bhind, Morena and Sheopur districts of Madhya Pradesh. The region is covered by an estimated 5 Lakh hectares of badlands. It drains the northwest of the Central Vindhya Plateau and the southeastern part of the Aravalli Range. Southeastern tributaries like the Kali Sindh and Parbati begin at the extreme south of the Vindhyas and flow north in deep valleys, forming a triangular alluvial plain at elevation of 240-270 m. Afterwards the Banas, a northwestern tributary of the Chambal draining the Aravalli Range, joins the Chambal after crossing the hills near Sawai Madhopur in southeastern Rajasthan. The valley of the Chambal is wider near the confluence of the Kali Sindh and the Parbati and narrower after the confluence of the Banas. The Chambal extends to the ravines of the Choti Parbati in Rajasthan and the Kwari river in northeastern Madhya Pradesh.  Culture  Armed men in Joura, MP - a town in the Chambal In the western part of the Chambal, Harauti, a Rajasthani dialect, is the main language and the region is dominated by the Meena. The eastern Chambal overlaps much with Bundelkhand, and Bundeli is the language of the area. Most people live in villages and are involved in agriculture. The Chambal is infamous in India for its general lawlessness. The extensive systems of ravines and badlands have been home to various outlaws and dacoits for hundreds of years. Most agree that the continuing extreme poverty and slow encroachment of agricultural lands and villages by the ravine systems have caused great hardship to villagers and people. In addition, caste is still a strong identifier in the area. Dalits make up a quarter of the population, and the Sahariya tribals also are a significant group. The caste oppression done by feudal thakurs like the Rajputs and Gujjars against lower castes like Nishads and Kurmis forced many into banditry. Historically dacoits like Phoolan Devi and Man Singh gained huge followings among the people for being robin-hood figures challenging the hegemony of the landlords. To this day dacoit gangs are mostly organized along caste lines, with Rajput, Meena (Rawat), Gujjar, Kurmi, Dalit and Brahmin gangs each having followings belonging to their castes and receiving political patronage. Dacoits of one caste generally target almost exclusively other castes.

She discovered and characterized polyphosphate kinase (PPK), an enzyme that helps build long chains of phosphate groups called polyphosphate (PolyP) that play a variety of metabolic and regulatory functions. She worked closely with her husband and research partner, Arthur Kornberg, contributing greatly to the characterization of DNA polymerization that earned him the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  Early life and education  Sylvy was born Sylvia Ruth Levy in 1917 in Rochester, New York. She was the eldest of three children to parents who were Jewish refugees from Latvia and Belarus with no formal education who had worked in factories their entire lives. After high school, Sylvy enrolled in the University of Rochester, stating on her application that English and American history were her favorite subjects, while listing chemistry and general science as her least favorites. Her attitude towards science soon changed—she became enamored to the point where she commuted from the College for Women's campus to the River Campus—the College for Men—to take advanced biology and chemistry courses that were only offered there. She was one of the few female students to do so. She earned an undergraduate degree in biochemistry in 1938, then went on to earn a Masters of Science in biochemistry in 1940, also from the University of Rochester. She carried out her graduate research at the university's School of Medicine and Dentistry under Walter Bloor, who specialized in lipids. Her work during this time focused on lipid metabolism and characterizing lipids in tumors. While at the University of Rochester, she served as editor of the campus newsletter, The Tower Times. It was also here that she met her future husband and research partner, Arthur Kornberg, who was a medical school student at the time.  Career and research  After earning her master's degree in biochemistry from the University of Rochester, Sylvy took a position at the National Cancer Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland, where she worked jointly with organic chemist Jonathan Hartwell, synthesizing novel carcinogens from plant extracts and biologist Murray Shear, studying their effects on mice. She re-met Arthur in Bethesda, where he had taken a position at the National Institutes of Health. They got married in 1943 and had three sons between 1947 and 1950. Sylvy took time off from the lab during this period to act as a full-time mother and wife. During this time she edited science books from home for Interscience Publishers (now part of Wiley) and returned to the lab when her youngest son, Kenneth, was 3. In 1953 they moved to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri where Arthur took a position as professor and chair of the microbiology department. They stayed there from 1953 to 1959, during which time Sylvy worked in the lab with Arthur, and contributed greatly to the work on DNA replication that would earn him the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Severo Ochoa. In Arthur's 1959 autobiography, For the Love of Enzymes, Arthur writes that Sylvy \\"contributed significantly to the science surrounding the discovery of DNA polymerase.” One large contribution Sylvy made to the work on DNA replication was the discovery and characterization of a contaminating enzyme that was inhibiting the DNA polymerization process they were trying to study. Sylvy was able to isolate and characterize the culprit: an enzyme that was degrading one of the DNA building blocks, deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) by removing its phosphates as a “tripolyphosphate” before it could be added. As Robert Lehman, who was a postdoctoral researcher in the lab at the time and is now a professor emeritus at Stanford, puts it, “We were having a major problem with inhibitors of the replication reaction, and she solved the problem.” Her work during her time at Washington University also included research into an enzyme responsible for synthesizing long chains of phosphate groups, called polyphosphate (PolyP) and studying their role in helping cells store and retrieve energy. In 1955 she isolated an enzyme from E. coli bacteria that synthesized PolyP and named it polyphosphate kinase (PPK). This was the second example of enzymatic catalysis of a polymer. Arthur Kornberg returned to the study of PolyP in his later research years, after Sylvy's passing. In 1959, the Kornbergs moved to California, where Arthur had accepted a position as chief of biochemistry at Stanford University. Sylvy continued to work with Arthur there for a couple of years before retiring. At Stanford, she researched how bacteria-infecting viruses (bacteriophages) are able to avoid destruction of bacterial DNA by modifying their own DNA letters through the addition of glucose molecules. Sylvy isolated and characterized several of the enzymes the bacteriophages make to carry out this glucosylation. After retiring, she continued to review and edit manuscripts from home, and returned to the lab for a couple more years to work with Arthur on studying the mechanism of how the anticancer drug bleomycin interferes with DNA replication.  Personal life  Sylvy married Arthur Kornberg in 1943 and they had three sons. Sylvy and Arthur provided strong scientific stimulation in the home as is reflected in their sons' career choices. Their eldest, Roger Kornberg, became a professor of structural biology at Stanford University and received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 for work on transcription, the process in which the DNA instructions for making proteins are first copied into messenger RNA. Their middle son, Thomas Kornberg, became a professor of biochemistry and physics at the University of California, San Francisco, and was the first to characterize DNA polymerases II and III. Their youngest son, Kenneth Kornberg, became an architect and president of the Kornberg Association, which specializes in designing research and clinical care facilities. Sylvy was stricken by a rare neurodegenerative disease related to ALS, whose first symptoms arose within a few years of moving to Stanford in 1959. She became confined to a wheelchair, requiring round-the-clock care, and died at home in San Mateo, California, June 6, 1986, at the age of 69.

Aiguabarreig is a natural space with great importance as an area of reproduction, wintering and resting of migratory fauna located in Mequinenza (Bajo Cinca, Aragón, Spain). It constitutes the largest river confluence of the Iberian Peninsula (with the union of Ebro, Segre and Cinca rivers) and one of the largest in all Europe. Is considered as one of the greatest biological natural spaces of Aragon.  Name  The term \\"Aiguabarreig\\" comes from the Catalan word that designates the mixture of waters in the place where two or more streams of water meet and form one. The Aiguabarreig Segre-Cinca-Ebro is formed at the time that the Cinca river brings its water to the Segre river, in the municipal area of La Granja d'Escarp, and then they arrive to the Ebro river, already in Mequinenza.  Geography  Territorially, it is located in the center of the Ebro Valley. It borders to the west with the Monegros, to the east with Almatret and to the south with the Ribarroja reservoir. This great natural space is divided between two autonomous communities (Aragon and Catalonia) and also in two regions; Segrià for Catalonia and Bajo / Baix Cinca in Aragon. Segre and Cinca form a first Aiguabarreig between the towns of La Granja d'Escarp, Massalcoreig and Torrente de Cinca. A few kilometers later, the waters of Segre and Cinca converge with the waters of the Ebro, in the municipality of Mequinenza. Aiguabarreig of Mequinenza is controlled by the Matarranya- Aiguabarreig Special Protection Area which has a length of 36,821 ha, of which 7,417.26 ha are located in the municipality of Mequinenza. The Special Protection Area encompasses the central area of the Aiguabarreig, from the south of Torrente de Cinca, all the Mequinenza river area to the junction with the Matarraña river in the homonymous region.  Landscape  Inside Aiguabarreig we find hundreds of meters of water width, with numerous river islands and riverside forests, of the largest in the Ebro area, large masses of reed bed, pebble beaches and \\"galachos\\". It is also the point of confluence of the steppe flora, from the arid zone of Monegros and the Mediterranean flora that ascends through the Ebro valley, including some elements of the mountain. The intertwined connection of river banks and lagoons with an arid and Mediterranean environment where vertical cliffs abound and at the same time fruit trees give this exceptional biological richness. The landscape has a great contrast between the great wetland that forms the junction of the Ebro, Segre and Cinca rivers and the surrounding aridity, a circumstance that makes this place a strategic point for many birds, whether to winter, to reproduce or as stopping point in the long migratory route. The fact of being located in the middle of the Ebro depression and the proximity of the Delta Natural Park allow the Aiguabarreig to become an extraordinary biological connector.Carceller, F. & Chacon, G. 2003. L’aiguabarreig on s’uneixen els rius més cabalosos. Mètode 38: 52-59 (en catalán).  Vegetation  In the Aiguabarreig there is repopulated vegetation of Pinus halepensis. There is also presence of Rosmarinus officinalis and some thermophilic species, being frequent that diverse feet or small masses of Quercus coccifera or Juniperus phoenicea appear in its bosom. There are also some characteristic species such as Populus alba, Salix alba or Tamarix gallica, and helophytes such as Phragmites australis or Typha domingensis. Gyps fulvus in Mequinenza. Thanks to these characteristics, species from very opposite environments coexist where birds are the most prominent group, ranging from colonies of Ardeidae, in the fluvial islands, to all types of birds of pray, as well as birds typical of desert environments, including an extensive representation of species scarce and threatened in Europe. Other well represented faunal groups are: reptiles, amphibians and mammals, the latter, with an extraordinary representation of different species of bats, an abundant population of deer, roe deer, presence of the otter and the increasingly abundant of wild goat, being able to reach and to observe them from the same town or in the castle of Mequinenza. The endemisms are notable in the entomofauna and within the waters, together with the Naiads, subsist with difficulty (due to the effects of the reservoirs and the introduction of fish species for sporting purposes) populations of native fish such as the \\"fraret\\". The accumulation of sediments in the Ribarroja reservoir has allowed to form different islands between the first confluences of the Segre and the Cinca in recent years until reaching the Ebro, already in the Aragonese population of Mequinenza. Among them, it is worth highlighting the Illa dels Martinets that has become over the years an important nesting colony for many species of Ardeidae, such as the egret, the great egret, the little egret, the little bittern and the Black-crowned night heron. During the recent years, was possible to find between the masses of reed Squacco heron and Eurasian bittern. The riverside forests and the well- preserved and large-scale reeds host an ornithic population, interesting and well nourished, which can be observed throughout the year, taking advantage of the different phases of this ecosystem; Rail (bird), Pythidae, Thrush (bird), Tit (bird), Finch, Bunting (bird). In the steppe environment we will find: Little bustard, Black-bellied sandgrouse, Pin-tailed sandgrouse, European roller, Greater short-toed lark and Lesser short-toed lark. Some of the most emblematic species in the areas of transition are Western Orphean warbler, Spectacled warbler, Blue rock thrush, Black wheatear and Black-eared wheatear. Among the reeds are species such as Calopteryx virgo, Sympetrum flaveolum, Ishnura pumilio and even Anax imperator. Finally, highlight the escarpments, characteristic of the Ebro Valley, and that undoubtedly house a large group of riparian species, especially birds of pray, being able to observe many of them without great difficulty, including some of them with a great conservation interest, at national and regional level:Griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, Golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, Booted eagle, Short-toed snake eagle, Common buzzard, Western marsh harrier, Black kite, Red kite, Peregrine falcon and Eurasian eagle-owl. The amphibians and reptiles identified in the Aiguabarreig are Common midwife toad, Pelobates cultripes, Common parsley frog, Common toad, Natterjack toad, Perez's frog, Spanish pond turtle, European pond turtle, Tarentola mauritanica, Acanthodactylus erythrurus, Ocellated lizard, Podarcis hispanicus, Psammodromus algirus, Psammodromus hispanicus, Ladder snake, Coronella girondica, Malpolon monspessulanus and Natrix maura.  Cultural Heritage  History Museum of Mequinenza. Sport fishing and navigation are two of the most frequent activities. The Aiguabarreig is, thanks to fishing, an international point of interest with hundreds of fishermen, particularly Central Europeans, who visit these rivers every year and enjoy the extensive network of existing offers around this activity. The species of introduced fish, of great attraction for the fisherman, are especially the black bass, the pike-perch or the well-known catfish. We must not forget the hundreds of naturalists who visit the area every year, attracted by its great biological diversity, particularly birdwatchers. The surroundings of the Aiguabarreig is marked by the coalfield of Mequinenza and the more than 150 years of mining history in the town. The extraction of lignites and their transport has marked the villages of Aiguabarreig, given its close link with the rivers. Symbol are the extinct \\"llauts\\", boats that held together the people and culture of all the riverside villages. You can still see different spaces of mining industrial heritage around the rivers whose waters served to transport coal in typical Mequinenza vessels known as \\"llauts\\". Museums of Mequinenza focus on the mining and historical heritage of the Old Town of Mequinenza that was demolished and flooded under the waters of the Ebro River after the construction of the Ribarroja and Mequinenza reservoirs. In the Museum of the Mine you can visit an authentic coal mine of more than a kilometer of interior route with historical material and machines that have been used for the extraction of coal for more than 150 years in the mining basin of Mequinenza. In the Museum of the History of Mequinenza you can explore the past of the population, from Prehistory to the demolition of the old town of Mequinenza as well as a space dedicated to the mequinenzano writer Jesús Moncada. Castle of Mequinenza stands almost on the edge of a great steep right at the confluence of the Ebro, Segre and Cinca rivers in Mequinenza. Its plant is an irregular quadrilateral, with seven rectangular towers except one, the most robust, which is pentagonal. Few fortresses will have a better location than this one, contemplating an extensive and impressive landscape over the confluence of the rivers and their surrounding lands, reaching the Pyrenees on clear days. The building is an authentic Castle-Palace, one of the best that Gothic art bequeathed to the Crown of Aragon, dated to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Part of the ancient population of Mequinenza can be visited today because it has become a large outdoor memory park after its demolition and flooding by the Ebro swamps. The original paths of the streets have been recovered from the runes and of the houses that were above the water level. The old Mequinenza, the \\"Old Town\\" as the mequinenzanos know it, is an invitation to walk through the memory of its streets and alleys, to rediscover part of the old Church, to imagine the old docks and to know a thousand stories, curiosities and legends of that millenary and historic town of navigators and miners on the banks of the Ebro river.

It was a set of television tapings for future episodes of MLW's television program Underground, which aired on Sunshine Network throughout the month of August 2003. Twelve matches were contested on the card. The main event was a tag team match, in which the Global Crown Tag Team Champions The Extreme Horsemen (CW Anderson and Simon Diamond) took on The Sandman and Steve Williams, where if Sandman and Williams won then they would earn a title shot against Anderson and Diamond for the tag team titles but if they lost, they must leave MLW. Also on the undercard, Steve Corino defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Mike Awesome, Terry Funk took on Abdullah the Butcher and the team of Raven and Norman Smiley faced CM Punk and Michael Shane. Production Background In April 2003, Major League Wrestling signed a new deal with Sunshine Network to air its new television program Underground, which would feature matches from MLW's supercard events. Storylines The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Underground. At Hybrid Hell, Mike Awesome defeated Satoshi Kojima to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. Steve Corino challenged Awesome to an immediate match for the title as he said that Awesome had promised him a title shot. Corino would defeat Awesome for the title with the help of his Extreme Horsemen teammates. On the July 7 episode of Underground, it was announced that Corino would defend the title against Awesome in a rematch at Rise of the Renegades. At Hybrid Hell, Extreme Horsemen members CW Anderson and Simon Diamond defeated Steve Williams and D-Lo Brown to retain the MLW Global Crown Tag Team Championship. Later at the event, The Sandman made his MLW debut by rescuing Steve Williams and Terry Funk from an assault by Extreme Horsemen. On the July 11 episode of Underground, it was announced that Sandman and Williams would wrestle Anderson and Diamond in singles matches to earn a Global Crown Tag Team Championship opportunity. At Hybrid Hell, Michael Shane helped CM Punk in defeating Raven in a match. Norman Smiley made the save for Raven after the match and challenged Shane and Punk to a tag team match against Raven and himself, which was made official for Rise of the Renegades on the July 11 episode of Underground. At Hybrid Hell, Terry Funk defeated Steve Corino in a No Ropes Barbed Wire match. On the July 18 episode of Underground, Corino said that he was putting a bounty on Funk. At Hybrid Hell, Sabu defeated his originally scheduled opponent La Parka's replacement Mikey Whipwreck in a match. He was attacked by Jerry Lynn and Christopher Daniels after the match and Whipwreck left with them. On the July 11 episode of Underground, Sabu was jumped by Lynn and Whipwreck, who slammed his face to the car door many times. This led to a rematch between Sabu and Whipwreck at Rise of the Renegades. At Revolutions, the upstart Paul London defeated Jerry Lynn for an upset victory and was attacked by Lynn and Christopher Daniels after the match. On the July 11 episode of Underground, Joey Styles announced that Lynn and London would compete in a best of three series where if London won two matches then he would earn a MLW contract and if Lynn won then London must leave MLW. However, the idea was scrapped when London signed a contract with WWE, thus legitimately leaving MLW. Event Preliminary matches The opening match of the event was a tag team match pitting Los Maximos (Joel Maximo and Jose Maximo) against Jimmy Yang and Tony Mamaluke. Maximos hit a Spanish fly to Mamaluke from the top rope for the win. Next, Josh Daniels took on Richard J. Criado. Near the end of the match, Criado missed a splash on Daniels in the corner and Daniels hit a dragon suplex for the win. Next, Da Hit Squad were supposed to take on The Samoan Island Tribe (Mana and Samu) in a match but they attacked the Samoan Island Tribe before the match started. After brawling with each other outside the ring, both teams went to the ring to begin the match but the match went out of control when the Samoan Island Tribe took the referee out and brawled with Da Hit Squad, which resulted in the match ending in a no contest. Next, one half of the Global Crown Tag Team Champions CW Anderson took on Steve Williams in a match, which stipulated that if Williams or The Sandman won their respective matches against Anderson and his tag team championship partner Simon Diamond, then they would earn a tag team title shot against Anderson and Diamond. Williams nailed a backdrop driver to Anderson for the win. Next, Jerry Lynn was supposed to take on Paul London but London was unable to compete due to his signing with WWE and Lynn berated London in a promo. Homicide would show up to replace London as Lynn's opponent. Near the end of the match, Sinister Minister caught Homicide on the top rope, allowing Lynn to nail a hurricanrana from the top rope but Homicide countered it into a roll-up and pinned Lynn for the win. Next, the Global Crown Tag Team Champion Simon Diamond took on The Sandman. CW Anderson interfered in the match as the referee was distracted by Diamond and superkicked Sandman, allowing Diamond to nail a Gem Cutter on Sandman for the win. Next, Sabu took on Mikey Whipwreck. Near the end of the match, Sabu applied a camel clutch on Whipwreck but Whipwreck's manager Sinister Minister distracted Sabu, allowing Whipwreck to hit Sabu with a chair and he smashed Sabu's arm with the chair and pinned him for the win. Next, Richard J. Criado issued an open challenge for a match, which was answered by Nosawa. Criado nailed a sitout scoop slam piledriver on Nosawa for the win. Next, the team of Norman Smiley and Raven took on CM Punk and Michael Shane. Raven had the match won as he performed a Raven Effect on Punk and covered him for the pinfall but Punk's valet Francine broke up the win, which led to Raven and Smiley's valet GI Ho interfering in the match. Shane knocked her out by superkicking her and then he hit Smiley with a chair and attempted to hit Raven with it but Raven ducked it and the chair accidentally hit Shane by bouncing off the top rope. Raven attempted to nail a Raven Effect on Shane but Punk threw powder in his eyes and nailed a DDT to Raven for the win. Later, Terry Funk came to wrestle for the bounty that Steve Corino had issued on Funk's head and Corino revealed that it would be Abdullah the Butcher but said that he did not need Abdullah to take his own bounty and distracted Funk enough for Abdullah to attack him from behind to begin the match. After a back and forth action, Funk hit a crossbody on Abdullah for the win. World championship match The initially scheduled main event for Rise of the Renegades pitted Steve Corino defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Mike Awesome. Extreme Horsemen interfered in the match to attack Awesome but Terry Funk made the save by attacking everyone with a garbage can. He threw a chair at Corino but Corino ducked and the chair hit Awesome instead, allowing Corino to pin Awesome to retain the title. Extreme Horsemen attacked Funk after the match until The Sandman and Steve Williams made the save, challenging Extreme Horsemen to a tag team match. Main event match The tag team match pitted The Sandman and Steve Williams against CW Anderson and Simon Diamond as the main event of the show, which stipulated that if Sandman or Williams lost then they would be forced to leave MLW. Funk interfered in the match by nailing stunners to Extreme Horsemen. Sandman nailed a Rolling Rock to Diamond for the win. Aftermath The Sandman and Steve Williams received their Global Crown Tag Team Championship title opportunity against CW Anderson and Simon Diamond at Summer Apocalypse, where Anderson and Diamond retained. The feud between CM Punk and Raven continued at Summer Apocalypse, where Punk defeated Raven in a Straight Edge Rules match. Norman Smiley and GI Ho would take on Michael Shane and Francine in a mixed tag team match, which the latter team won. The feud between Da Hit Squad and Samoan Island Tribe would lead to a falls count anywhere match between the two teams at Summer Apocalypse, where B-Boy replaced a no-showing Dan Maff. Samoan Island Tribe would win the match. At Summer Apocalypse, Steve Corino issued a bounty of $25,000 on Terry Funk and Jerry Lawler offered to take the bounty and went on to defeat Funk.

Media coverage of his numerous escapes from captivity to seek out human contact earned him a degree of popularity with the public. He has been described as one of the most famous wisents ever and the only known case of an individual of his species retaining friendly contact with humans throughout his life. Bieszczady Mountains in Poland History A panorama of Baligród On 26 July 2005, a lone bison calf was discovered and rescued by charcoal burners, in Rabe near Baligród, after a flood swept across the Bieszczady Mountains. He was said to be no more than two days old judging by the umbilical cord remnants that were still present; it was speculated that the male calf was separated from his mother by the flood and thrown onto the road by the rising water levels. After waiting with him for several days for the possibility of his mother returning, the calf was taken into the care of local foresters, who named him \\"Pubal\\". Officially Pubal was not supposed to have a name as they are not given to wild animals, but the rangers who raised him and looked after him prior to his departure from the region started calling him \\"Pubal\\"; the letters \\"P\\" and \\"U\\" are reserved for the Białowieża-Caucasus race of the European bison species, while the ending \\"bal\\" comes from Nadleśnictwo Baligród or the Baligród Forestry. For nine months, the Baligród forester Witold Szybowski and his wife Urszula looked after the young wisent, initially feeding him milk with a baby bottle. Kompania Piwowarska, the brewing company of the popular Żubr beer brand, donated 2400 złoty to cover some of the growing bison's feeding costs. In April 2006, Pubal was released into the wild near a wisent herd, but he soon lost interest in rejoining his own species and continued to seek out human contact – at one point interrupting the picnic of a family of tourists and frightening them, before the group realised that he was not aggressive and completely tame. The plan to reintroduce Pubal into the wild was carefully managed to potentially increase the genetic diversity of the group of bison that were supposed to be his new herd, but even though he was spotted in their vicinity, Pubal was relatively quickly seen on his own again, trying to find humans. Initially he was released into the valley of the San river, but due to his constant encounters with tourists Pubal was moved back to a sizeable enclosure in Wola Michowa with an older wisent named \\"Bolo\\"; this was done in hopes of getting him used to the company of his own species and to encourage Pubal to start finding his own sources of food. By early 2007, Pubal continued to resist all efforts made at reintegrating him into the wild by breaking out of his enclosures multiple times; when roaming free he was often seen wandering around local villages, approaching humans for food, walking between houses, interacting with people, and following cars. Since Pubal weighed 250 kilograms (over 550 lbs) at this point and there were concerns that he could harm someone when frightened, a decision was made that he must leave the Bieszczady area permanently. In spring of 2007, the almost two-year-old bison was transported northwest to become the semen provider at a żubroń (domestic cattle and wisent hybrid) breeding farm in Karolew. The owner of the farm, Henryk Ordanik, had heard about Pubal on TV; Ordanik worked together with the foresters under the approval of the authorities to secure Pubal's role as a semen provider at his farm. The Subcarpathian rangers who had up until this point been looking after Pubal condemned the actions of a tour guide who had lured the animal out of his enclosure into a local town, further reinforcing Pubal's old habits of relying on people feeding him. As of September 2009, Pubal was still taking an active part in experimental żubroń breeding efforts at the facility in Karolew with a degree of success in their results. His status since then is unclear, though some sources from 2017 state that Pubal died. Legacy In addition to the widespread media coverage of his friendly encounters with local villagers and tourists alike, Pubal has also been mentioned in a number of books and articles. A poem and an award-winning ballad have also been written about him. In 2007, TVP3 Rzeszów created and broadcast a short documentary film about Pubal entitled Żubra żal – Polish for \\"Regret of the Bison\\" or \\"Bison's Regret\\". Directed by Jacek Szarek, it received accolades such as first place at the Ninth International Touristic Film Festival \\"TOUR - FILM\\" in Poznań and was later shown to pupils at primary schools in May 2008. Although a few stories of long and solitary bison journeys have appeared in Polish history prior to this one from the mid-2000s—such as the case of Pulpit and Pulon from the 1960s—none of them featured as much and as close interaction with humans as that of Pubal.

She qualified at the age of 23 and became French national champion in 1953 and a world champion in 1954. Rousseau made a world record jump on 25 August 1955 from a height of . She later attended many Fédération Aéronautique Internationale committees and was appointed an officer of the Legion of Honour.  Early life  Odette Rousseau was born in 1927 in Saigon, French Indochina. Her father was a French engineer and held a private pilots license. In 1946 she moved to Paris, France to further her studies. Whilst at college in 1950 she saw a Ministry of Transport poster advertising aerosports. Rousseau began parachute training at the Saint-Yan Aeroclub where she was the only female member. Her initial 300 jumps were carried out from a parachute tower as she was considered too young to jump from an aircraft. She qualified as a parachutist at the age of 23. Rousseau's parents, still in Indochina, knew nothing about her hobby until they read an article about her training in Paris Match magazine. Rousseau was trained by former world champion parachutist and made more than 200 jumps from aircraft between 1950 and 1955. Rousseau participated in the first French Parachuting Championship in 1953 and became French national champion in all categories, ahead of the men (all competition was mixed). She qualified as an instructor the following year and also married Vincent Balési, President of the International Parachuting Commission. Rousseau became a world parachuting champion later that year, again beating men in a mixed category. Throughout this time she had to wear a parachute rig intended for men and weighing , no female version being available. She also had to subsidise her jumps by operating airshows across France and the world. The popular press depicted her as a rival of fellow French parachutist , though this may not have reflected the actual relationship between the two women. Rousseau found work as a parachuting instructor at the regional training center for Île-de-France, in Gisy-les- Nobles. In 1955 she started training with General Jean Gilles, commander of the French Army's 25th Parachute Division. This was her first experience of military-style static line jumping. She was awarded an honorary military qualification certificate, an uncommon honour for women in this period. As a particular honour the certificate was signed by General Gilles.  World record and afterwards  On 25 August 1955 Rousseau set a new women's freefall parachute world record by jumping from a height of and opening her parachute only at the height of ; breaking a record set by Russian parachutist Aminet Sultanova. Rousseau set the record from a French military Nord Noratlas that flew from Brétigny-sur-Orge Air Base and jumped over Saint-Yan. The record was supervised by Aéro-Club de France officials on the aircraft and on the ground. Due to the altitude Rousseau wore an air mask and \\"was equipped with three flight suits: one in silk, one in linen, and one with fleece lining; three pairs of gloves: two in silk and one in fur-lined leather; one helmet in leather; large antifreeze goggles; an inhalation mask; a portable bottle of oxygen; a little plank board placed on the front parachute bearing two altimeters, the chronometer and the heavy and cumbersome registered barograph of the International Aeronautic Federation (FAI)\\". Rousseau landed in the River Yonne and almost drowned, being saved at the last moment by a passing bargeman. Afterward Rousseau was active in the FAI, attending its general conferences as a companion of honour, observer and/or delegate. She was technical secretary of the organisation's parachuting commission from 1967 to 1982. She was awarded honorary FAI membership in 1982 and also received the FAI bronze medal and the Leonardo Da Vinci Parachuting Diploma. She was also appointed an officer of the Legion of Honour by the French government. Rousseau attended her final FAI conference, in Turkey, in 2012 and died on 7 December that year.

She was most notably a founder of the New York Female Moral Reform Society.  Early life  Finney was born in New Britain, CT, the fifth child of Nathaniel Andrews and Sarah Marcy. She grew up with her family in the then religiously vibrant Whitestown, NY where she lived until she married her husband, Charles Grandison Finney, in 1824. When she first met her would-be husband, he was not Christian and she prayed for his conversion, which would ultimately occur a few months after they first met in Adams, NY. They were officially married on October 5, 1824.  Career  Finney was an active revivalist throughout her life, and joined her husband on many revival tours across the country. While her husband would preach, she would often lead women's prayer sessions. She would also often establish maternal organizations and women's church groups in the towns that they visited. Along with helping her husband, she was one of the founders and first directress of the New York Female Moral Reform Society. The group initially focused on what they saw as the widespread plague that was prostitution in America during the time, and advocated for approaches that would hold men as well as women responsible, as well as practical ways to reduce prostitution. It eventually grew to have many branches outside of New York, and shifted to focus on more general women's issues. Finney's actions were controversial during the time, as she and other women openly discussed the then-taboo topic of prostitution. In 1835, her husband took a job teaching theology at Oberlin College in Ohio, and shortly after she and their children moved to join him. She was very active both politically and socially in Oberlin, and helped found multiple organizations including the Oberlin Female Moral Reform Society, the Oberlin Maternal Association, and the Ohio Ladies Anti-Slavery Society. She also arranged for three former prostitutes to study at Oberlin as part of her anti-prostitution activism.

Background Flaxer supported a group against \\"The Arrest of Morris Schappes\\" (here, a drawing by Hugo Gellert, depicting Schappes' arrest amidst Rapp-Coudert Committee hearings (1941) Abram Flaxer was born \\"Abraham Flaxer\\" on September 11, 1904, in Vilnius, Russian Empire (now Lithuania). Around 1910, his family immigrated to the United States, where they settled in the Williamsburg, Brooklyn area of New York City. He studied at the Rand School of Social Science and then the City College of New York, where he received a BS (or AB). He joined the \\"Pen and Hammer\\" (Marxist) club and supported the defense of professor Morris Schappes. In 1932, he obtained a degree from New York University Law School; that summer, he also studied mathematics at Columbia University. In 1935, he told his first wife Victoria that he would be joining the Communist Party USA under the Party name \\"John Brant.\\" Career Vito Marcantonio (from 1949's Pictorial Directory of the 81st Congress) was an important political ally of Flaxer's Flaxer was a social worker who in the early 1930s joined radical \\"Rank and File\\" movements like the Communist Party USA or the Socialist Party of America along with others like Mary van Kleeck, Jacob Fischer, Bertha Capen Reynolds, and Lewis Merrill. Flaxer taught in a Bronx vocational school, at which time he also became an organizer for unemployed teachers. He joined the New York City Emergency Relief Bureau (ERB) and the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and became ERB executive secretary. The growing ERB changed its name to the Association of Workers in Public Relief Agencies. Flaxer gained political relationships with New York City's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and Harlem-based Congressman Vito Marcantonio (and joined Marcantonio's American Labor Party). Flaxer helped form the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) member. In 1937, Flaxer broke with the AFSCME to form the New York-based State, County and Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA) union as member of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The SCMWA represented local government workers. Flaxer became SCMWA's SCMWA's national president as well as member of the CIO's Executive Board. He became active in the National Municipal League and the Civil Service Assembly. In 1939, Flaxer led SCMWA into an anti-war stance. He became a leader in the American Peace Mobilization group as a member of its national council. In 1941, Flaxer reversed into a strong pro-war stance. That same year, Lewis G. Hines, secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of Labor and Industry stated that Flaxer had \\"been singled out on a number of occasions as one of the leader members of the Communist Party in this country.\\" In 1941, SCMWA's membership reached 53,000 government employees. During World War II, bitter infighting arose within SCMWA between pro- and anti-Communist groups. SCMWA also faced congressional scrutiny from the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 1941 at a SCMWA convention, Flaxer said and, again in 1942, wrote in Survey Magazine that government employees should reserved the right to strike during war. In 1944, Flaxer was a four-page subject in a report by the United States House of Representatives. It noted he had been president of the SCMWA CIO since inception in 1937 and a Communist Party activist \\"as far back as 1936.\\" He had been a \\"general manager\\" of the \\"American Federation of Government Employees\\" AFL, a member of which (John P. Frey) testified to his Communist links. He had headed the Association of Workers in Public Relief Agencies and joined with the \\"Communist-controlled\\" Workers Alliance (to request a parade permit). The report noted that the New York City Teachers Union had joined the SCMWA. As of 1944, his Popular Front memberships included the Committee on Election Rights, Prestes Defense Committee, Schappes Defense Committee, Reichstag Fire Trial Anniversary Committee, National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, American Committee to Save Refugees, United Spanish Aid Committee, Non- Partisan Committee for the Re-election of Congressman Vito Marcantonio, National Negro Congress, Public Use of Arts Committee, and National Council of American-Soviet Friendship. In 1946, SCMWA and the UFWA merged to form the United Public Workers of America (UPWA). UPWA had an overtly pro-Soviet foreign policy, which contributed to a severe drop in members, who moved to rival AFSCME. On January 26–28 and February 2, 1948, a hearing of the House Education and Labor Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Representative Clare E. Hoffman, occurred on the topic of a strike by United Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers (Local 471) and its parent, the United Public Workers of America (UPWA), CIO, against Government Services, Inc. (GSI), which had already lasted nearly a month. Hoffman refused to let Flaxer read a statement and asked questions, including whether Flaxer was a communist. One of his UAW attorneys, Nathan Witt, objected to \\"abuse of congressional power.\\" When another attorney, Joseph Forer, rose to follow on from Witt, Hoffman asked him, \\"Are you the same Forer who defended Gerhard Eisler?\\" When Witt objected to Hoffman's question, Hoffman ejected Witt from the hearing. On January 26, 1948, UPWA negotiations director Alfred Bernstein (father of Carl Bernstein), charged that House committee agents had raided the union's offices. During January, William S. Tyson, solicitor for the Labor Department, and Robert N. Denham, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, both agreed that nothing in the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited GSI from bargaining with a non-complying union. However, Denham added, the Act intended to \\"eliminate Communist influence from unions by denying to such unions the services of NLRB.\\" On November 24, 1948, Flaxer sent a letter to Truman decrying the tendency to brand a person disloyal simply because they advocated for improvements in civil rights. In November 1949, attack on the UPWA culminated at a CIO convention. The CIO passed resolutions barring Communist Party members from holding leadership positions. CIO convention delegates then charged 10 unions, the UPWA among them, of being communist-controlled. A committee of anti-communist CIO vice presidents, chaired by Textile Workers Union of America President Emil Rieve, was established to try the union and (individually) Flaxer on the charges. The UPWA immediately ceased paying its member dues to the CIO,\\"Murray Cites 6 Units For Not Paying C.I.O.,\\" New York Times, December 17, 1949. and denounced the committee as biased due to the strong anti-communist feelings of its members.\\"Unions Denounce C.I.O. Trial Board,\\" New York Times, November 28, 1949. As the trial approached in January 1950, the UPWA issued a lengthy document which purported to show that it had not parroted the Communist Party line and had upheld the CIO political platform.\\"Union Facing Trial Accuses the C.I.O.,\\" New York Times, January 9, 1950. When the informal trial opened on January 9, the UPWA attempted to bring more than 250 witnesses in its defense, but the crowd was barred on the grounds it would intimidate the committee.\\"C.I.O. Bars Crowd at Trial of Union,\\" New York Times, January 10, 1950. At the hearing, Transport Workers Union of America President and communist Mike Quill (who had broken with the Communist Party USA some years earlier but not abandoned his communist beliefs), testified that Flaxer had coordinated his organizing efforts and criticism of the CIO with CPUSA leaders. The CIO executive board on February 16, 1950, voted 34-to-2 to expel the UPWA. On March 1, 1950, the CIO expelled UPWA in a purge of Communist dominated unions. On August 8, 1951, Flaxer's ex- wife Vivian White Soboleski testified that Flaxer had been a Communist Party member and that he had joined in 1935. On August 23, 1951, Louis F. Budenz testified that he had known Flaxer (as well as Alfred Bernstein, father of journalist Carl Bernstein) as a Communist Party member from 1940 to 1945 (when Budenz left the Party). On October 5, 1951, Flaxer appeared with David Rein as counsel. In February 1953, the UPWA dissolved. Flaxer joined many radicals in opposing Executive Order 9835, signed by US President Harry S. Truman in 1947 (here, page 1) Flaxer opposed anti-subversive (anti-communist) witch-hunts. He debated US Representative Richard Nixon on the radio regarding the federal loyalty program under Executive Order 9835. By 1950, he found himself accused of CPUSA membership. On October 5, 1951, Flaxer appeared before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security (SSIS) but refused to name names on the UPWA membership list. On October 6, 1953, he was found guilty by jury of contempt of Congress and sentence to two months in jail plus a $1,000 fine. On June 21, 1956, a Federal Court of Appeals upheld Flaxer's conviction; David Rein defended Flaxer, helped by Joseph Forer. In 1958, David Rein (partner of Joseph Forer) defended in Flaxer v. United States, 358 U.S. 147 [1958]), which ruled in Flaxer's favor. Personal life and death In June 1928, Flaxer married Victoria White of Exeter, New Hampshire; they stayed married \\"exactly ten years.\\" Some time after 1940, Flaxer married Charlotte Rosswaag, who served in the SCMWA as a welfare investigator as well as chair of its Lower Manhattan subgroup. Flaxer had a bank account at the Emigrant Savings Bank (listed in 1951 testimony as the \\"Immigrant Savings Industrial Bank\\"), as well as the Corn Exchange Bank, East River Savings Bank, and Bankers Trust.

She earned tenure in 1998 and was promoted to Professor in 2005. In 2017 she was appointed Director of the Institute of CyberScience. Her research considers the genesis and decay of tropical cyclones, including the extratropical transition and landfall. She has investigated the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones. She has developed statistical methodologies for forecasts of tropical cyclones and a metric to for cyclogenesis activity in climate change situations. Evans has looked at the relationships between tropical cyclone intensity and organised convection with sea surface temperature, and how these will change with global warming. She has considered how the tropical cyclone boundary layer structures impact the intensity and impacts of convection on the development of African easterly jets. Evans co-chaired the World Meteorological Organization International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones. Evans has described hurricanes as one of the last remaining weather systems that cannot be predicted. Evans is a member of an interdisciplinary team charged with reviewing catastrophic risk models used for setting hurricane insurance rates in Florida. Alongside her observations, modeling and statistical analysis of meteorological phenomena, Evans develops new approaches to communicate the risk of natural disasters. She has worked with Mark Ballora on new ways to demonstrate the risks of hurricanes. Evans contributed her expertise in natural disasters and Ballora his background in music, and together they convert data that is typically in charts or graphs into music. Evans monitored the latitude, longitude, asymmetry and air pressure of several hurricanes and convert this into an audio file. Evans has served as Lead Meteorologist advising the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology. In 2019 Evans participated in a National Science Foundation grant to establish the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub.  Academic service  Whilst serving on the United States Army Science Team Evans was involved with the relocation of their tropical test facility to Panama. Evans was elected President of American Meteorological Society (AMS) in 2019, which was the 100th year of the AMS.

Congress went on to censor several cabinets of the Belaúnde administration, and a general political instability was perceived. General Juan Velasco Alvarado led the coup.  Context  A dispute with the International Petroleum Company over licenses to the ' oil fields in Talara Province, northern Peru sparked a national scandal when a key page of a contract (the 11th) was found missing. The Armed Forces, fearing that this scandal might lead to another uprising or a takeover from the APRA party, seized absolute power and closed down Congress, almost all of whose members were briefly incarcerated. General Velasco seized power on October 3, 1968, in a bloodless military coup, deposing the democratically elected administration of Fernando Belaúnde, under which he served as Commander of the Armed Forces. President Belaúnde was sent into exile. Initial reaction against the coup evaporated after five days when on October 8, 1968, the oil fields in dispute were taken over by the Army.  Coup d'état  At 1:00 AM on Thursday of October 3, 1968, an armored squadron of tanks went from the Tank Division towards the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Lima, along with support from the armed forces. The intention was to avoid confrontation with the palace guards with an early attack. Although rumors of a coup and of a possible overthrow circulated around the Council of Ministers and Presidential Cabinet, no special measures were taken in the event of defending the palace from mutiny. Additionally, due to the early timing, the chief military aide to President Belaúnde was still sleeping at his home away from the Presidential Palace, and the Presidential Guards immediately surrendered at the site of the armored squadron at the steps of the pavilion. At 2 AM, President Belaúnde was woken up and dragged out of his bed in his pajamas by Velasco-Alvarado and his militants. Belaúnde offered no resistance. Close advisers to Belaúnde also reportedly saw him as drugged the night before the coup, presumably by traitors in the presidential residence itself.  Ousting of Belaúnde-Terry  After hearing a barrage of bullets outside the palace in the morning, Belaúnde found himself alone in the Presidential Palace along with a couple of other family members and ministers. In the morning, a group of officers found Belaunde and informed him of his arrest at gunpoint. Belaúnde, furious, exclaimed \\"Identify yourself, you miserable traitor. You are talking to the Constitutional President of the Republic!\\" The group backed, and Colonel Enrique Gallegos explained Velasco's orders for his deportation to him. Belaúnde responded \\"You sons of...traitors...unworthy of the uniform that the country has entrusted to you. You are dismissed! Bringing so many tanks and guns just to detain an unarmed man! Shoot me then, damn it!\\" President Belaúnde attempted to resist the arrest. Four officers threw themselves on President Belaúnde, taking him by the arms, and held him back. He was then detained. Following the coup d'état, at 7 AM, Belaúnde was taken to a barracks and was forcibly taken to Jorge Chavez International Airport in Callao, Peru. Velasco, having assumed authority, immediately ordered Belaúnde to be deported, and ordered an ASPA (a privately owned international Peruvian airline) jet on the runway of the airport. Belaúnde was forced into the jet, and the exiled president was deported to Argentina. Belaúnde would spend the next years of Velasco's regime in both Argentina and the United States as a professor.  Council of Ministers  The President of the Council of Ministers, as well as many other Ministers, were rushed at their homes and the presidential palace. They immediately surrendered. Prior to being attacked and hearing of Belaúnde's arrest, the President of the Council of Ministers attempted to establish order by calling an emergency Cabinet meeting to swear in the Vice President, Mario Polar. Only three ministers attended, but the Vice President was also detained by the insurgents.

On June 18, 1905, while sailing upbound on Lake Huron with a cargo of coal, she was rammed and sunk by the freighter Amasa Stone off Presque Isle Light. For nearly 106 years the location of Etruria wreck remained unknown, until the spring of 2011 when her wreck was found upside down in of water. History Design and construction Etruria was named after the famous Cunard Line ocean liner, RMS Etruria. Etruria was built by the West Bay City Shipbuilding Company in West Bay City, Michigan for the Hawgood Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She had an overall length of , and a between perpendiculars length of . Her beam was wide, and in her original enrollment, her depth was listed as ; also, in her original enrollment, her gross tonnage was listed at 4744 tons and her net tonnage was listed at 4439 tons. She was powered by a 1500-horsepower triple expansion steam engine, which was fueled by two Scotch marine boilers. She had a cargo capacity of 7000 tons. She was also built with a single deck, and twelve cargo hatches. Etruria was the first of four identical sister ships built for the Hawgood Transit Company. Her sisters were (in order of construction), Bransford, J.M. Jenks and H.B. Hawgood. Service history Etruria was launched on February 8, 1902 as hull number #604. She was enrolled for the first time on April 12, 1905 in Port Huron, Michigan, and was given the official number #136977. On April 15, 1902 Etruria was re- enrolled in Cleveland, Ohio. On March 25, 1903 an error in Etruria enrollment was corrected; her depth was corrected from to ; and her gross tonnage was corrected from 4744 tons to 4653 tons, and her net tonnage was corrected from 4439 tons to 3415 tons. Final voyage Amasa Stone On June 18, 1905 while upbound with a cargo of coal from Toledo, Ohio, heading to Superior, Wisconsin, Etruria was rammed by the larger steel freighter Amasa Stone on her starboard side, abreast of her No.9 hatch. After just five minutes, Etruria rolled over and sank about off Presque Isle Light; her entire crew was rescued by the steamer Maritana. At the time of her sinking, Etruria was the largest freighter ever to have sunk on the Great Lakes. Etruria enrollment surrendered on June 30, 1905. Aftermath Shortly after Etruria sinking, the Hawgood Transit Company and the Mesaba Steamship Company (owners of Amasa Stone) filed several lawsuits against each other for the damage done to their respective vessels. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rendered a final judgement on June 15, 1908. A brief by the Hawgood Transit Compay stated that: > The steamer Etruria was laden with 7,000 net tons of coal loaded on Lake > Erie and destined for Lake Michigan ports. At all times the Etruria was > properly crewed and fully manned. About 01:00 hours on June 18, 1905, the > hazy night turned to rain and fog set in, and the Etruria proceeded at a > moderate pace, sounding her fog signal regularly. About 03:35 hours that > morning on a proper course headed for the Straits of Mackinac, the Etruria > heard the fog signals of a steamer, which proved to be the Amasa Stone. It > sounded a long distance from the Etruria and was distinctly to her > starboard. At this point, the Etruria blew a two-blast signal but the Stone > didn’t reply with the same passing signal, and the Etruria slowed to bare > steerage, stopped her engine completely and shortly thereafter, without > warning or signal, the Stone came out of the fog at full speed. The Stone > struck the Etruria a heavy blow on her starboard side abreast hatch No.9, > breaking in her side. The Etruria began to list and sank at once, meanwhile > blowing distress signals. The Etruria launched its lifeboats just in time to > see the steamer roll over. As it turned upside down, the hatches gave way, > and the coal cargo spilled out before the sinking ship. The Amasa Stone then > departed the scene without rendering assistance. The steamer Maritana was > upbound in the vicinity and picked up the crew, landing them at Detour and > at the Sault. The lawsuit stated that Etruria had a value of $265,000, her cargo had a value of $13,460.70 and the crew's effects had a value of $3,029.11; in total, Etruria was a $281,489.81 loss. The suit further stated that the collision was \\"due solely to the negligence and want of care on the part of Amasa Stone and those in charge of navigation\\". Amasa Stone was found to be guilty of the following actions: *Not maintaining an efficient lookout *Not answering passing signals *Running at excessive speed *Failing to stop and reverse *Failing to stand by Lawyers for the Mesaba Steamship Company concluded that Etruria was not proceeding slow, but at a fast rate of speed and that her navigational officers were guilty of inattention. They also concluded that Amasa Stone did not leave the scene following the collision, but that she turned round, and tried to offer assistance, but Etruria crew took to the lifeboats, and rowed off in the opposite direction. When both sides made their argument, Judge Henry Harrison Swan ruled in Detroit, Michigan that both vessels were equally at fault, and that insurance proceeds were the only means of recouping each vessel's loss. Etruria wreck Discovery Bow of Etruria In 2011 a group consisting of expert shipwreck hunters and high school students from Saginaw, Michigan tried to locate the long sought-after semi- whaleback steamer Choctaw. Their search effort was made into a documentary named \\"Project Shiphunt\\", which was sponsored by Sony and Intel. On May 17, 2011 they discovered two shipwrecks, Etruria and the schooner M.F. Merrick which sank in 1889 after a collision with the steamer R.P. Ranney. Etruria today The remains of Etruria rest in of cold fresh water. The wreck is upside down, with of her hull exposed, with a portion of her stern being buried. Her bow is raised above the sediment by several feet allowing access to her intact pilot house and forward deck house area and first cargo hatch. Her forward ladder is in place running to the port side bridge wing, which is buried in sediment. Her two stockless anchors are still intact at her bow. Discovery of the wrecks was made public on July 13, 2011. Her wreck is part of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. National Register of Historic Places nomination On September 19, 2014 the wreck of Etruria was nominated for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, for her state level significance. Her listing was denied; had she been listed, she would have been given the reference number #14001009.

An iron framed, steel-plated double-ended screw ferry, it was the archetype of the familiar Manly ferry shape of the 20th century. The name \\"Kuringai\\" is an ethnonym referring to indigenous Australian peoples from between the Gamilaraay and Sydney Design and construction left Kuring-gai was ordered by the Port Jackson Co-operative Steamship Co. Ltd, which became the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company. The vessel was designed by renowned naval architect, Walter Reeks and was a development of Reeks' previous Manly ferry, the wooden Manly. Kuring-gai's wheelhouses were located immediately adjacent either side of her single funnel. She was the first Manly ferry to have gangway exits on both upper and lower decks. The subsequent Binngarra-type of vessels were larger versions of Kuring-gai but with wheel houses at the far ends of the upper deck. Her basic design was emulated on eleven ferries that formed the twentieth century fleet of Manly ferries; namely the Binngarra-type ferries, the two Dee Why-class ferries and the South Steyne. This layout is also seen in the four current Freshwater-class ferries introduced in the 1980s and still operating. Kuring-gai was built in 1901 at Mort's Dock and Engineering in Balmain. Her triple expansion steam engines, also supplied by Mort's Dock, generated 85 hp. She reached 15.66 knots on her trials on 28 April 1901. Service life Kuring-gai ran her first revenue trip to Manly on the 11 May 1901.ferriesofsydney.com The high standard of passenger accommodation including polished timbers, mirrors and electric lights was greatly appreciated by passengers. In 1905, Kuring-gai overshot the wharf at Circular Quay and became stuck in a hole that the new Binngarra had created when it too crashed four days earlier. Kuring-gai was freed by the paddle steamer, Brighton. Kuring-gai was reboilered in 1922. Her capacity of 1,228 passengers became too small for the booming Manly route, particularly in comparison to the larger Binngarra class ferries that had been subsequently introduced. Following the arrival of the fast and big Dee Why and Curl Curl from Scotland, she was sold to Newcastle Ferries Ltd in 1928 and used as a ferry at Walsh Island, now known as Kooragang. She was also used to run excursions to Raymond Terrace, Nelson Bay and Broughton Island. Demise She was tied up and hulked in 1934. The wooden superstructure was demolished and in World War II, US forces used her in New Guinea as a storage barge. After the War, the vessel was towed back to Newcastle, moored at Hexham and at one point sank in the mud near Hexham Bridge where she is still visible.
