Local telephone network provider, KC, have also commemorated the win by painting one of their telephone boxes, near to St Paul's Boxing Club, gold. Campbell was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to boxing. ==Professional boxing career== Early career Campbell's first professional fight took place on 13 July 2013 at Craven Park in his home city of Hull. His opponent was Andy Harris who he beat in the first round. Campbell continued his undefeated start to his career with a fifth-round stoppage of Lee Connelly in Hull on 2 November 2013. In his fifth professional bout Campbell carried on his undefeated record and became the first person to stop Scott Moises. In April 2014, Campbell announced that he would be taking a break from boxing, pulling out of his next scheduled bout, following his father being diagnosed with cancer. Despite announcing he would be taking a break from boxing, Campbell fought a further four times in 2014. A points win over Craig Woodruff, a knockout win of Steve Trumble, a technical knockout (TKO) victory over Krzysztof Szot and another TKO win over Daniel Eduardo Brizuela. In March 2015, Campbell faced off against 24 year old Nicaraguan Levis Morales (11–1–1, 4 KOs) at the Ice Arena in Hull. Campbell knocked down Morales in round two and three, before the referee Howard John Foster stopped the fight resulting in a TKO victory for Campbell. On 1 August, Campbell claimed the vacant WBC International lightweight title by defeating fellow Hullensian Tommy Coyle (21–2, 10 KOs) via ten-round TKO at the KC Lightstream Stadium. This was also a WBC lightweight eliminator. Coyle was knocked down once in round two following a left to the body and three times in round twelve before the referee waved off the fight. Only four months later in December, Campbell lost the title and mandatory status in a split decision loss to French boxer Yvan Mendy (32–4–1, 16 KOs) at The O2 Arena in London on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dillian Whyte. Campbell was floored for the first time in his professional career in a ragged defensive display as Mendy received a split decision with scores of 115–112, 115–113, while the third judge scored it 115–113 for Campbell. After a three-month lay off, Campbell started a comeback trail in March on the undercard of Brook-Bizier at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, fighting British boxer Gary Sykes (28–4, 6 KOs) for the vacant Commonwealth lightweight title. Campbell made a winning return to the ring in spectacular fashion only needing two rounds to finish Sykes off in his first fight since losing his unbeaten professional record. A left hook that landed hard on the top of Sykes' head had him struggling before a straight right put him down. Although Sykes beat the count, Campbell was all over him. It was the left-hook that opened the door again, this time in the midsection, followed by a right to the temple. Referee Steve Gray moved swiftly in as Sykes' corner was throwing their towel to halt the fight. Promoter Eddie Hearn revealed Campbell was next due to fight on 30 July 2016 at the First Direct Arena in Leeds for the vacant WBC Silver lightweight title against 30 year old former IBF junior- lightweight champion Argenis Mendez (23–4–1, 12 KOs). Although being floored by a sharp right hand in the second round, Campbell proved to be too quick and dominated the remainder of the fight to claim the vacant WBC Silver lightweight title. From the third round, it became a comfortable fight for Campbell who moved his opponent around the ring and caught him with a succession of punches. The scorecards were all in favour of Campbell 116–111, 117–110, 115–112, who stated he would now like to land a world title shot.  Rise up the ranks   Campbell vs. Mathews, Lopez  Campbell fought former British and Commonwealth lightweight champion and former world title challenger Derry Mathews (38–10, 20 KOs) on the undercard of the world cruiserweight title fight between Tony Bellew and BJ Flores at the Echo Arena on 15 October, live on Sky Sports. This was the first defence of the WBC Silver lightweight title in a scheduled twelve round bout. The fight started off as a brawl, however Campbell proved to be too quick as he retained his titles and kept his future world title shot alive after stopping Mathews in round four. Mathews was dropped following a couple of left hooks to his body. In the post fight interview, Campbell claimed, despite winning via stoppage, his game plan was 'to outbox Mathews for a points win'. On 3 January 2017, it was announced that Campbell would defend his WBC Silver title against Jairo Lopez (21–6, 14 KOs) at the Ice Arena in Hull on 25 February. The title defence would be part of a triple header, also including fellow Hullensian Tommy Coyle and Gavin McDonnell challenging for the vacant WBC super- bantamweight title. Campbell won the fight in round two after a well timed uppercut floored Lopez. Referee Ian-John Lewis halted the fight. Lopez was also dropped in round one just before the bell rang. Campbell retained his WBC Silver lightweight title. After the fight, Campbell and promoter Eddie Hearn both said the fight they were chasing next is a rematch with French boxer Yvan Mendy, to avenge his sole loss. \\"Mendy has done the worst thing possible in beating me\\", Campbell said after the fight. Campbell vs. Pérez On 10 April 2017, Eurosport and Sky Sports announced that Campbell would be involved in a WBA lightweight title eliminator against former WBA interim lightweight titlist Darleys Pérez (33–2–2, 21 KOs) on the Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko undercard at the Wembley Stadium on 29 April 2017. The winner would be in the number one position to challenge champion Jorge Linares. Pérez weighed over the limit at 136.3 pounds, so had he won the bout, he would not have been eligible for the mandatory spot. Campbell racked up the win via a ninth-round stoppage win, which was due to injury. It was said that Pérez hurt his left arm after a throwing a left hook. He signaled to the referee that he could not continue and the fight was stopped at 1 minute 28 seconds into the round. Although Pérez started the fight well, enough to win the first three rounds, he physically looked gassed by the later rounds where Campbell took over. With the win, Campbell was made the new mandatory challenger to WBA champion Jorge Linares. Eddie Hearn said he would speak to Golden Boy Promotions to push things forward for the fight to be made.  World title challenge  Campbell vs. Linares Golden Boy Promotions matchmaker, Robert Diaz, announced that WBA and The Ring lightweight champion Jorge Linares (42–3, 27 KOs) would next fight on 23 September 2017 and ruled out Campbell as his opponent.

Linares later told HBO that he wanted to reduce his amount of offence so that he wouldn't get hurt. Once the championship rounds started, Linares regained control of the fight. Had Campbell not been dropped early in the fight, the verdict would have been a split draw. Campbell believed he won the fight, speaking to Max Kellerman he said, \\"No one can ever doubt my heart. Yeah, I got off to a rocky start. He hit me with a nice, clean shot in the second round, caught me on the eye, cut it. I wasn’t dazed. From there, I had double vision in one eye for the rest of the fight. But from then, I out-classed him. I thought I won the fight. He’s a great champion, but I thought I out-classed him. I didn't think he was landing any shots whatsoever, and I was catching him with all the clean shots.\\" Linares praised Campbell for his efforts, \\"He was a tough opponent. Many people said he was very easy, but it’s not for no reason he’s an Olympic champion. I fought very well all the way to the twelfth round. And I think in the fifth round, I started to box him a little bit because I didn't wanna get hurt.\\" CompuBox stats showed Linares landed 140 of 414 thrown (34%), while Campbell was credited to landing 141 of his 524 thrown (27%). After the fight, promoter Eddie Hearn stated that Campbell could fight the winner of Crolla vs. Burns or another possible opponent would be WBO lightweight champion Terry Flanagan.

On 31 July, Campbell announced Shane McGuigan as his new trainer. Speaking on the partnership, Campbell said, \\"I'm incredibly excited to be teaming up with Shane. I've always heard good things about him within boxing but having trained under him for a few weeks now I can vouch for just how good he is. We've already struck up a great relationship and I have no doubt he is going to help take me to the next level. I want to become a world champion and Shane has a proven track record of achieving that with his fighters. It's a thriving gym with a great atmosphere and world class fighters, and that's where I want to be.\\" In his statement, McGuigan said he would help Campbell become an elite as well as win a world title.

After twelve rounds the scorecards read 119–109, 118–111 and 116–112 in favour or Campbell.

She worked at the Natural History Museum and received an OBE in 1961. == Early life and education == Gordon was born in Keith, Scotland on 18 May 1901 the eldest child of Margaret (née Lamb) and James Gordon. She attended Keith Grammar School before going to the University of Aberdeen in 1918. As she had limited funds to support her education she took positions as a student demonstrator in zoology. She graduated from the University with BSc in zoology. She also completed training in primary and science teaching at Aberdeen Teachers' Training College. In 1923 she was awarded the Kilgour Research Scholarship and studied alcyonaria. She then took up postgraduate research scholarship at Imperial College which lead to her PhD in the embryology of end echinoderms. She continued her research into echinoderms in the United States at both the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University and Yale University. In 1928 she received a DSc from the University of Aberdeen. ==Employment and professional associations== While at Yale University William Thomas Calman, Keeper of Zoology at the Natural History Museum, London, offered her a post at the museum. She returned to the UK and in November 1928 took up the position of Assistant Keeper (2nd class) with responsibility for the Crustacea Section. Gordon was the first woman to be appointed as a full-time permanent member of Museum staff. In 1937 the Crustacea Section was split into two parts; J.P. Harding took over entomostraca while Gordon managed malacostraca as Principal Scientific Officer. During her time at the Museum she published many articles and books and identified specimens of crabs sent to her from all over the world. She was a Fellow and Council member (1950-1953) of the Linnean Society and a member of its Curatorial Board until her 1981. She was also a Fellow of the Zoological Society. In 1960 she became one of the original members of the Editorial Board of the peer reviewed journal Crustaceana. ==Visit to Japan and meeting with Hirohito== In April 1961 on the occasion of Emperor Hirohito's 60th birthday Gordon was invited to spend several weeks in Japan under the sponsorship of the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun. On 5 April she was invited to the laboratories of the Imperial Household where she had an informal audience with the Emperor, a keen marine biologist himself. The visit gave Gordon great pleasure and she retained contact with her Japanese colleagues for the rest of her life. ==Humour and limericks== Gordon had a great sense of humour and was a fan of limericks. In 1958 she published a review of Siewing's 'Anatomie und Histologie von Thermosbaena mirabilis' under the title 'A thermophilous shrimp from Tunisia'. The title inspired Dr A.J. Bateman to send her the limerick :A thermophilous shrimp from Tunisia :said: when it gets cold I get busier :I dig a hole :And fill it with coal :and there's nowhere as warmer as it is 'ere To which she replied :The idea's OK but Aplysia :Is the rhyme I should choose for Tunysia :A purist and Scot :I simply could not :pronounce it to rhyme with 'it is 'ier-r-r !! ==Later life== She retired from the Natural History Museum in 1966 and retained a room in the Crustacea Section which she shared with Dr Sidnie Manton, and continued to work in the Museum until about 1971. In 1983 she suffered a stroke which left her partially paralysed. In 1987 she moved from London to live with the family of her nephew Dr John Gordon in Carlisle. Her health deteriorated after a cataract operation in March 1988 and she died on 11 May 1988.

Edmondson, the Kra languages contain words in metalworking, handicrafts, and agriculture that are not attested in any other Kra–Dai language.Diller, Anthony, Jerold A. Edmondson, and Yongxian Luo ed. The Tai–Kadai Languages. Routledge Language Family Series. Psychology Press, 2008. This suggests that the Kra peoples may have developed or borrowed many technological innovations independently of the Tai and Kam-Sui peoples. ==Reconstruction== The Proto-Kra language has been reconstructed by Weera Ostapirat (2000). ==Classification== Morphological similarities suggest the Kra languages are closest to the Kam–Sui branch of the family. There are about a dozen Kra languages, depending on how languages and dialects are defined. Gelao, with about 8,000 speakers in China out of an ethnic population of approximately 500,000, and consists of at least four mutually unintelligible language varieties, including White Gelao, Blue (Green) Gelao, Red Gelao, and Chinese Gelao. Ostapirat (2000) The internal classification below is from Weera Ostapirat (2000), who splits the Kra branch into the Eastern and Western branches. According to Jerold Edmondson (2002), Laha is too conservative to be in Western Kra, considered t to constitute a branch of its own. However, Edmondson (2011)Edmondson, Jerold. 2011. Notes on the subdivisions in Kra. Published as Geyang yuyan fenlei buyi 仡央语言分类补议 in Journal of Guangxi University for Nationalities. 广西民族大学学报. 33.2.8-14. later reversed his position, considering Laha to be more closely related to Paha. Ethnologue mistakenly includes the Hlai language Cun of Hainan in Kra; this is not supported by either Ostapirat or Edmondson. Hsiu (2014) Hsiu's (2014)Hsiu, Andrew. 2014. Kra-Dai notes. classification of the Kra languages, based on computational phylogenetic analysis as well as Edmondson's (2011) earlier analysis of Kra, is as follows. ;Kra *Northern Kra **Lachi **Gelao ***Red Gelao ****Vandu ****A'ou ***Core Gelao ****Dongkou Gelao ****White Gelao (Telue) ****Central Gelao: Hagei, Qau *Southern Kra **Guangxi Buyang (Yalhong) **Laha, Paha **Qabiao **Yunnan Buyang: Ecun, Langjia, Nung Ven Substrata Andrew Hsiu (2013, 2017) reports that Hezhang Buyi, a divergent, moribund Northern Tai language spoken by 5 people in Dazhai 大寨, Fuchu Township 辅处乡, Hezhang County 赫章县, Guizhou, China, has a Kra substratum.Hsiu, Andrew. 2013. “Shui” varieties of western Guizhou and Yunnan.

Beijing: Central University for Nationalities Press. the Yang Zhuang people of southwestern Guangxi may have been Kra speakers who had switched to Zhuang. ==Demographics== The Kra languages have a total of about 22,000 speakers. In Vietnam, officially recognized Kra peoples are the Cờ Lao, La Chí, La Ha and Pu Péo. In China, only the Gelao (Cờ Lao) have official status. The other Kra peoples are variously classified as Zhuang, Buyi, Yi, and Han. Within China, \\"hotspots\\" for Kra languages include most of western Guizhou, the prefecture-level city of Baise in western Guangxi, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in southeastern Yunnan, as well as Hà Giang Province in northern Vietnam. This distribution runs along a northeast-southwest geographic vector, forming what Jerold A. Edmondson calls a \\"language corridor.\\" Multilingualism is common among Kra language speakers. For example, many Buyang can also speak Zhuang languages.李锦芳/Li, Jinfang and 周国炎/Guoyan Zhou. 仡央语言探索/Geyang yu yan tan suo.

Copeland Ltd of 9 Mallusk Drive, Newtownabbey, BT36 4GX who retain the rights to the image, worked from the original scale maquettes by Scott, with the bronze globe cast by Beltane Studios in Peebles. As an icon for Belfast it has been adopted by Belfast City Council, tourism authorities, TV companies and several businesses as an emblem and logo; and in early October 2006 was recognised as the best artwork in the city by the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce. == Concept == The artwork is based on a concept proposed by Myrtle Smyth, who was inspired by Thanks-Giving Square in Dallas in Texas. Lord Diljit Rana, Baron Rana, chairman of the Thanksgiving Square charity, said the aim of the project was to create some public space for giving thanks. ==Gallery== Image:Beaconofhope.JPGBeacon of Hope, September 2009 Image:Belfast (138), October 2009.JPGBeacon of Hope, October 2009 Image:Belfast (139), October 2009.JPGThanksgiving Square, October 2009 Image:Belfast (143), October 2009.JPGBeacon of Hope, October 2009 == See also == * Beacon of Hope (disambiguation) * Andy Scott, sculptor * Thanksgiving Square, in Belfast *List of public art in Belfast == References  External links == * Andy Scott Public Art * Arts Council of Northern Ireland * Department for Social Development Category:Outdoor sculptures in Northern Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Tourist attractions in Belfast Category:Steel sculptures in Northern Ireland Category:2006 sculptures ","title":"Beacon of Hope (sculpture)"},{"id":"20221137","text":"Shelter Bay is a ferry landing and unincorporated locality on Upper Arrow Lake in British Columbia, Canada.

The single was released on December 15, 2008. The song is in Drop D tuning. It was nominated for the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Roboshobo (Robert Schober), debuted on December 7, 2008, on Metallica's official website and Yahoo! Video. The video, which does not feature the band, is an alternate history narrative done in grainy mockumentary style, depicting a sequence of fictional events following the historic 1908 Tunguska event, at which Soviet scientists discover spores of an extraterrestrial organism, a small harmless thing resembling an armored worm. However, it turns out the incredibly hardy spores are able to reanimate dead tissue, and subjects turn violent sometime after exposure to the spores; a cartoon then shows the USSR adapting them as a bioweapon and scatters them from balloons in a preemptive strike against the U.S., causing a localized zombie apocalypse before intervening militarily to distribute humanitarian aid. At the end of the cartoon, a hybrid U.S.–USSR flag is raised in the now- Soviet-ruled America, and in 1972, a headless corpse is shown breaching containment and escaping from a Soviet biowarfare lab. The uncensored version of the music video ends with an incident in Arkansas, similar to the start of the video, with various news reporters reporting on chemtrails. Video origin Initially, in a video on the website Metclub.com, Kirk Hammett explained the origins of the video. He claimed to have bought the film from a fan for $5 in Russia and soon forgot about it. After digging it up and watching the animated film, he said that he was fascinated by it, researched about its background, and asked a friend's Russian girlfriend to translate parts of it. Following this, Hammett had supposedly been trying to incorporate the film into one of the band's music videos. However, as it was later revealed, Hammett's story was a fake to produce hype about the video: the film was not made in Russia and Hammett did not actually buy it there. Rather, as the video's director Roboshobo stated in an interview, the live action segments (including the ending) were specially shot to look like excerpts of old Russian documentary footage. The video bears similarities to the underground documentary Experiments in the Revival of Organisms, where animal experimentation to produce life extension is depicted. The subtitles and everything else included in the video are part of its concept. The word \\"Тунгусский\\" (\\"Tunguska\\") appears several times with different typos (\\"тунгузский\\", \\"тунзский\\", \\"тчнгзский\\"). ==Lyrical meaning== In an interview, James Hetfield commented on the song's lyrical meaning: ==Release versions== The single is available in a three-disc collectors set. The first disc was released as a digipack to store the remaining two discs with the album version of \\"All Nightmare Long\\", along with the songs \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\", recorded live in Berlin at the Death Magnetic release bash at the O2 Arena back in September 2008. The second disc also has the studio version of \\"All Nightmare Long\\", along with the songs \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Seek & Destroy\\", also recorded at the Berlin O2 Arena. The third disc is a DVD, which, along with the album version of the song as audio, includes a ten- minute-long mini-documentary about the bands' day in Berlin, along with twenty minutes' worth of live tracks from that night's album release party, as well a fifteen-minute-long movie from the tuning room at the Rock im Park. ==In pop culture== *The song first appeared as one of the songs off of Death Magnetic that was made available as downloadable content for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.

It stands above and to the west of the village of Cofton Hackett, and is part of the Lickey Hills Country Park. The three hilltops comprising The Lickeys—Bilberry Hill, Rednal Hill and Cofton Hill—form the northern extremity of the Lickey Ridge, a formation of hard quartzite. Views over Birmingham and the surrounding countryside can be seen from the top of these hills. The hill is named after the tracts of Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) bushes that cover the hill, between the pathways. Local people have been cropping the bushes of their fruit each autumn for hundreds of years to make jams, preserves or apple and bilberry pies. ==History== View from Bilberry Hill looking East over Cofton Hackett village and the reservoirs In 1888 the Birmingham Society for the Preservation of Open Spaces purchased Rednal Hill and handed it to the City in trust. In 1913 they also arranged for Bilberry Hill and Pinfold Wood to be leased to the city on a nominal peppercorn rent in perpetuity. Birmingham City Council finally purchased Cofton Hill, Lickey Warren and Pinfield Wood outright in 1920. With the eventual purchase of the Rose Hill Estate from the Cadbury family in 1923, free public access was finally restored to the entire hills with what would become the Lickey Hills Country Park in 1971. The Bilberry Hill Centre is a hostel and sports facility, run by Birmingham Clubs for Young People, nestling at the base of Bilberry Hill. The building was donated to the people of Birmingham by Mr. and Mrs. Barrow Cadbury in 1904 as the Lickey Tea Rooms and remained in use as a restaurant until the early 1960s. The hostel can accommodate up to 65 persons. In the winter of 2008 the centre was under threat of imminent closure over funding issues and there was an internet campaign to save the facility for future use by young people. ==Geology== A quarry cutting on Bilberry Hill through the Lickey Quartzite. The Lickey Hills area is of significant geological interest due to the range and age of the rocks. The darker quartzite making up Bilberry Hill shows signs of having been deposited as sand at the bottom of a shallow sea. The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area's diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises: *Barnt Green rocks - tuffs and volcanic grits siltstones and mudstones from the Tremadocian stage of the Ordovician *Lickey Quartzite - an Ordovician quartzite with thin beds of mudstone and possibly tuff *Halesowen Formation - a Carboniferous mudstone of Westphalian D age *Clent Formation - a breccia of lower Permian age *Bunter Pebble Beds - beds of Triassic water-worn pebbles The soil is marl and the subsoil gravel, sand and clay. There is a small quarry where Wenlock limestone was worked at the time of the making of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and there are some gravel-pits. ==See also== *Lickey Incline ==References== *Margaret Mabey, A Little History of the Lickey Hills, The Lickey Hills Society, 1993, *Around Rubery and The Lickey Hills compiled by Martin Hampson.

Plaque of Aleksander Majkowski in Greifswald, Germany Aleksander Majkowski (; 17 July 1876 - 10 February 1938) was a Kashubian writer, poet, journalist, editor, activist, and physician. He was the most important figure in the Kashubian movement before World War II. He was the editor of \\"Gryf\\" (The Griffin) and author of the greatest Kashubian novel Żëcé i przigodë Remusa (\\"The Life and Adventures of Remus\\"), and The History of the Kashubs. ==Early life== Aleksander Jan Alojzy Majkowski was born into a farming family on July 17, 1876, in Kościerzyna (then Berent, West Prussia), the eldest child of two sisters and three brothers. In Berent, he completed primary school (Volksschule) and in 1885-90 attended a German progymnasium. He was given a scholarship of Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej (Society of Educational Aid), based in Chełmno (then Culm). In 1891, he began his education in gymnasium in Chojnice (Konitz), living in a convent there. Also there, he became acquainted with Polish literature and history. In 1895, he earned his matriculation certificate. At first, he meant to study theology and become a priest, but instead he enrolled at the Berlin University and in 1897, began studying medicine. In Berlin, he became involved in social activities; for example, he gave lectures for Poles who lived there. Early influences In 1898, he took part in the ceremony of the erection of Adam Mickiewicz's monument in Warsaw and was reminded of his Slavic identity. In 1899, he published his poem Pielgrzymka Wejherowska (\\"The Wejherowo Pilgrimage\\") and satire Jak w Koscérznie koscelnygo obrele, abo Pięc kawalerów a jedna jedyno brutka (\\"How in Kościerzyna they chose the sacristan or Five bridegrooms and only one bride\\"). In 1900, Majkowski moved to Greifswald to continue his studies. There he got involved in the agenda of an early Polish socialist organization called Zet, and a local student society called \\"Adelphia\\". Because he also tried to establish his own political organization, in 1901, he was relegated from the university. Later on, he moved to Munich to continue his studies there. Aside from regular curriculum, he carried on with his earlier established cultural interests and worked for Towarzystwo Studentów Polaków (Society of Polish Students) and founded the \\"Vistula\\" society. In 1903, he finally completed his studies and moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on blood cells in plumbism. In September 1904, he defended his Medical Doctor (MD) degree and, at the end of the year, returned to Kashubia. In Gdańsk, he fulfilled his year-long medical practicum at a local hospital. With immense energy, he decided to get involved in the cultural and social activities in the area. ==Professional career== In 1905, he accepted a position of chief editor of \\"Gazeta Gdańska\\" (\\"The Gdańsk Gazette\\") and its supplement \\"Drużba. Pismo dlö polscich Kaszubów\\" (\\"Friendship. Magazine for Polish Kashubs\\"). Meanwhile, in Poznań, he published a selection of his Kashubian language poems Spiewe i frantówci (\\"Songs and merry verses\\"). At that time, he also prepared the re-editions of Hieronim Derdowski's poems Jasiek z Knieji (\\"Johnny from Knieja\\", i.e., the forest) and Kaszubi pod Widnem (\\"The Kashubs near Widno\\"). In 1906, he returned to his native Kościerzyna, where he opened a private practice while continuing his involvement in the cultural and social spheres, e.g. in a venture \\"Dom Kaszubski\\" (\\"The Kashubian House\\") and Towarzystwo Czytelni Polskiej (Polish Reading Room Society) that he had set up. He is also actively involved in Towarzystwo Wyborcze (Electional Society), Towarzystwo Śpiewacze (Singing Society) \\"Halka\\", and Związek Młodych Kupców (Young Merchants' Union). During this time, he cooperated with Izydor Gulgowski, Friedrich Lorentz, and the German Verein für Kaschubische Volkskunde (Society for Kashubian Folk Studies). While studying the folklore of the region, he did not forsake publishing in Gazeta Gdańska. Between 1908-12, Majkowski continued to publish in Kościerzyna and, starting in 1911 in Gdańsk, a monthly entitled \\"Gryf. Pismo dla spraw kaszubskich\\" (\\"Griffin. Magazine for the Kashubian issues\\"). Concurrently, he initiated other Kashubian cultural and political programs and began gathering Kashubian intelligentsia around himself. In parallel, he took part in many cultural activities that promote Kashubia. He immortalized the Black Griffin as the emblem of the Kashubians. The Kashubian Griffin became the symbol of the strength and steadfastness of the Kashubian people also in Canada. He organized a Kashubian-Pomeranian exhibition, singlehandedly writing all of the supporting printed material for it. However, not only did he write a lot, but also he travelled extensively, taking many pictures. As a pedagogist, he remained in consistent touch with students; encouraging them to explore Kashubia; he offered himself as a tour guide. In early 1912, he finally settled in Sopot, continuing to work as a physician until 1921. Society of Young Kashubians A capstone to years of efforts, in June 1912, Aleksander Majkowski managed to set up his Gdańsk-based Towarzystwo Młodokaszubów (The Society of Young Kashubians), established for \\"the cultural, economical and political development of Kashubia\\". Another member of this society was the newly ordained Roman Catholic priest Leon Heyke. In September of the following year, he instituted the Kashubian- Pomeranian Museum in Sopot, including the adjacent society, and wrote a guide to Kashubia called Zdroje Raduni (\\"The Radunia River's Wells\\"). Recognized for his accomplishments, he sadly encountered opposition from some local social activists and the Catholic Church. Fortunately, he managed to win a defamation court case posed by a catholic magazine \\"Pielgrzym\\" (The Pilgrim). Wartime activities In August 1914, Majkowski was drafted into the Prussian Army, where he served as a physician in Poland, Romania and France. During the war, he wrote a diary, sketched for Kashubia's history, and two novels: Pomorzanie (\\"The Pomeranians\\", unfinished) and Żëcé i przigodë Remusa (\\"The Life and Adventures of Remus\\"). Return from the war In July 1918, he returned to Sopot, became politically active, and participated in some military activities taking place in what is now called the Trojmiasto area (Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot). During the same year, he also became a member of Rada Ludowa (The People's Council). A year later, in Gdańsk, he set up Koło Demokratyczne (Democratic Circle), became chief editor of \\"Dziennik Gdański\\" (\\"The Gdańsk Daily\\"), and continued teaching at a local folk university. For his military efforts, he earned the rank of captain of the Polish Army, and was later promoted to colonel. In 1920, he sat on the board of the commission responsible for establishing the Polish-German borders and in Rada Pomorska – Towarzystwo Ochrony Polskości na Pomorzu (Pomeranian Council – Society for the Protection of Polish Interests in Pomerania) as its head. For the next two years, he resided in Grudziądz, though he traveled extensively throughout Poland. In Grudziądz, he met his future wife, Aleksandra Starzyńska. Also there, he organized the Exhibition of Fine Arts, having Pomeranian artists in mind, which was officially opened on June 7, 1921, by the head of Poland, Marshall Józef Piłsudski. In the coming years, Majkowski continued his political and cultural activities aimed at promoting Kashubia and Kashubian culture. He established a drama theater in Toruń, become a leader of Stowarzyszenie Artystów Pomorskich (Society of Pomeranian Artists) based in Grudziądz, and a chief editor of a magazine called \\"Pomorzanin\\" (\\"The Pomeranian\\") – all this between 1921 and 1923. In addition, during this time he resumed publishing \\"Gryf\\", and continued to write, collaborating with various periodicals and radio in Toruń. In \\"Gryf\\", he also published the first chapters of his book Żëcé i przigodë Remusa. Marriage On October 6, 1921, in Warsaw, Aleksander Majkowski marries Aleksandra Komorowska (former name: Starzyńska, 1891–1982). The newlywed couple settled in Kartuzy, in a villa called \\"Erem\\" (The Hermitage). They paranted four children: Damroka (1922–1979), Mestwin (1924–1944), Barbara (1928–1983) and Witosława (1929–1955). Somehow, in his free time, Majkowski managed to collect stamps and postcards, read detective stories, and go mushroom picking. Continued business activities In Kartuzy, he worked as a physician in a number of places, mainly at the railroad clinics, often volunteering to help people in need, but without neglecting his writing. Attending to his patients on the country side, he kept collecting samples of folklore artifacts and photographs the life of the Kashubs. For his commitment to \\"social work in Pomerania\\", Majkowski received the Officer's Cross of the Order of Poland's Restitution, from President Stanisław Wojciechowski in April 1923. A year later, he published his Przewodnik po Szwajcarji Kaszubskiej (\\"A Guide to the so-called Kashubian Switzerland\\") and, in 1925, a single issue of \\"Gryf\\". Shortly thereafter, he endured yet another round of criticism in being accused of separatism, bolshevism, immorality, crimes, and bad influence on society at large. ==Withdrawal from public affairs== Due to recession, personal failures and health problems, Aleksander Majkowski retracted from public life and concentrated on literary work. He patronized the actions of Aleksander Labuda and Jan Trepczyk – young Kashubian activists, who in 1929 establish Zrzeszenie Regionalne Kaszubów (Kashubian Regional Union) in Kartuzy, with Majkowski as its head. Later, he fruitfully and with dedication collaborated with the associated magazine \\"Zrzesz Kaszëbskô\\" (\\"Kashubian Union\\"). Soon Majkowski also joins Polski Związek Zachodni (Polish Union of the West) and collaborates with Instytut Bałtycki (The Baltic Institute). For his tireless efforts, in 1930, he received The Golden Cross of Merit, one of the most prestigious awards of the Republic of Poland. Although a member of the board of editors of the revived \\"Gryf\\" since October 1931, he did not return to a full-time journalism until 1934. In October 1935, he publishes the first part of his three-part novel Żëcé i przigodë Remusa. He was awarded The Silver Literary Laurel (Srebrny Wawrzyn Literacki) by Polska Akademia Literatury (The Polish Academy of Literature). Meanwhile, in his villa, he organized a folklore exhibition and tries to cure his fatigued health by taking repetitive trips to various spas. 1936 and 1937 were busy years for Majkowski. He worked on Gramatyka kaszubska (\\"The Kashubian Grammar\\", incomplete) and Historia Kaszubów (\\"The History of the Kashubs\\"). He put a lot of effort into his guide to Kashubia and adapted his satire Jak w Koscérznie koscelnygo obrele... for the theatre under a new title of \\"Strachë i zrękovjinë\\" (\\"Fears and Engagements\\"). All along, he wrote extensively for the press. ==Death and legacy== Grave of Dr. Aleksander Majkowski; Kartuzy, Poland.Aleksander Majkowski died on February 10, 1938, at the hospital in Gdynia of a heart failure. His remains were buried with great ceremony four days later in the cemetery of the Carthusian monastery in Kartuzy. His coffin were escorted by the railroad workers whom he had tended to and the young Kashubian activists who vowed to continue his work. A few months after Majkowski's death, his Historia Kaszubów and the entire novel Żëcé i przigodë Remusa were published. After the war, Żëcé i przigodë Remusa reappeared on a few occasions and in 1964, was translated into Polish by the Kashubian-Polish writer and activist, Lech Bądkowski. Historia Kaszubów was published with a foreword by the Kaszubian scholar Gerard Labuda. Many of Majkowski's other, less known, writings were also published or republished. For example, his recollections, letters and the war diary were jointly published under a title of Pamiętnik z wojny europejskiej roku 1914 (\\"The Diary from the European War of the Year 1914\\"). Aleksander Majkowski is regarded as the leading figure in the Kashubian movement and the founder of its historic and intellectual base. By design, he captured the Kashubian cultural ideology in the literary figure of the humble Kashubian farm laborer Remus (who is not to be confused with the Roman mythological or the American literary figure of the same name). Majkowski also worked to define Kashubian grammar and spelling, promoted protection of historical monuments and regional folklore, set up social and economical Kashubian-Pomeranian institutions, represented the Kashubes on the country's forum and the Slavonic scene. Majkowski was also a translator of German texts into Kashubian language. His multifaceted activity covered all sides of the social life of Kashubia and its impact continues to this day. In Poland, 2008 was declared the year of Aleksander Majkowski. An English translation of Żëcé i przigodë Remusa, by Blanche Krbechek and Katarzyna Gawlik-Luiken, was published in 2008 by the Kashubian Institute in Gdansk as \\"Life and Adventures of Remus.\\" The translation \\"Life and Adventures of Remus\\" was accomplished under the aegis of the Kashubian Association of North America and can be purchased through the Kashubian Association's website. There is a street named for his in e.g. Gdańsk. ==See also== *Kashubians *Kashubian language *Slovincian *Pomerania ==References== *Worldcat ==Bibliography== * J. Borzyszkowski, J. Mordawski, J.

The line was built in 1883 and was then a part of the Vandalia Railroad. The route was about 60 miles long and it passed through many towns. ==StationsIndustries served== The route was a very important link for Studebaker Auto since it ended at their factories in South Bend, Indiana. The line also had several grain elevators, which several are still in business. One of the reasons it was built was for people going to Lake Maxinkuckee in Culver, Indiana when it was a resort town. ==Abandonment== After Studebaker closed in 1963, rail traffic started declining and the last daily freights were gone by 1969. The first part of the line to go was between Nutwood and Culver, which was abandoned in 1973 and removed in 1974. The second piece to go was from Culver to Logansport which was abandoned in 1974 and removed in 1976. For a while in Plymouth, Indiana, they used the line for the old industrial park, but this rail was gone by 1990.

His regular position was at full back. He was born in East Markham, Nottinghamshire. He played for Newton Heath, Notts County, and Rotherham Town. (registration & fee required) ==Early career== There is no record of when John Clements left East Markham and came to Nottingham. By the year of his 20th birthday he had signed for a Nottingham amateur club called St. Saviour's. (nothing is known about this club) and played for them in the 1887–1888 season. In 1888 he was discovered by Notts County and signed for them in October 1888. ==League & Notts County debut== John Clements made his League and club debut at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on 27 October 1888. He played left- back. The opponents were Burnley, 4,000 were in attendance. Burnley won the toss and chose ends so that County had to kick into the wind. However, this fact seemed to make little difference to the play. County were two up in 11 minutes, the scorers Harry Daft and Bob Jardine. Later in the first-half Daft and Jardine combined for Jardine to shoot past the Burnley goalkeeper but the 'goal' was disallowed as the referee judged Jardine was off-side. Early in the second-half County goalkeeper, Jack Holland was injured and then Burnley got one back through Jack Yates so, it appeared that Burnley were going to get back into the game. However, ten minutes into the second-half Jardine became the first Notts County player to score a brace in a League match. Soon after he scored the first Notts County League hat-trick. Towards the end of the match Jardine made it four in a match (the first player to score 4 in a League match for Notts County) and then Jardine made history. He scored his fifth, Notts County' sixth becoming the first player to score five in a match in a League game. A remarkable achievement. John Clements had a quiet match but made his own bit of history. The first Notts County player to win a match on his debut. Final Score – Notts County 6-1 Burnley. ==1888–1889 season== John Clements made his club and League debut on 27 October 1888 at left-back at Trent Bridge, Nottingham for a home match against Burnley. From 27 October 1888 to 16 March 1889 John Clements played 12 League games and three F.A. Cup ties, all at left-back. Having played 12 times at left-back he became the main player in the left-back position for 1888–1889 season. Clements played 12 league matches for Notts County and when he played his team scored 25 goals (out of 40) and conceded 40 out of 73 goals. The 40 goals was the joint third lowest tally by any League club that season. The 73 goals conceded was the worst by any League club in 1888–1889. Notts County finished 11th and had to seek re-election. (registration & fee required) ==1889 onwards== Clements was retained for the 1889–1890 season but was now considered a reserve player. He only appeared in two League games and once in the FA Cup. In seasons 1891-1892 he remained on the Notts County books but did not play in the first team. Clements left Notts County in June 1892 and joined Newton Heath who had just been admitted to the Football League. Clements played in 36 League games (over two seasons) and appeared in one FA Cup tie in 1892–1893. In August 1894 Clements transferred from Newton Heath to Rotherham United who were in Football League Division 2. He played only one season at Rotherham. He played 27 League matches, scoring three goals. He also played one FA Cup tie. In May 1895 he transferred to Newcastle United. However, he never played for the first team due to injuries. It is also not recorded when he left Newcastle United. (registration & fee required) ==Life after football== As said Clements date of retirement from football was not recorded. It is not clear what Clements did for a living after leaving football. He eventually moved to Chesterfield Derbyshire and passed away there in 1945 at the age of 77. ==References *MUFCInfo.com profile Category:1867 births Category:English footballers Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Rotherham Town F.C.

The episodes were filmed quickly and cheaply, and the premise of the show was simple. An episode typically begins in a room in a museum, with artifacts on display while the unseen and unnamed narrator (Bernard Cowan) introduces the era and historical person(s) to be featured. Key figures whose biographies were explored in the series included Paul Revere, Buffalo Bill, and Daniel Boone, among many others, with Max dubiously claiming to have helped all of them over the course of his very long life. A few years later, Krantz reused the general format (and voice cast) for the similar series Professor Kitzel. The show's theme music was also later used by Siskel and Ebert's movie review series for PBS, Sneak Previews. ==Max== Max, voiced by Paul Soles, is a pink mouse who lived in the museum, essentially served as comic relief and also helped with the narration, while repeatedly claiming to have been a witness of and/or participant in various historical events. Footage of Max, set in the past or present, typically shows him as comically clumsy with contemporary tools and weapons. ==Episodes== *Leonardo Da Vinci *Buffalo Bill *Marie Curie *Peter the Great *Davey Crockett *David and Goliath *Elizabeth I *Johnny Appleseed *Lewis and Clark *Manfred von Richthofen *Thomas Edison *William the Conqueror ==ReferencesCategory:1960s Canadian animated television series Category:1970s Canadian animated television series Category:1980s Canadian animated television series Category:1990s Canadian animated television series Category:1967 Canadian television series debuts Category:1992 Canadian television series endings Category:Animated television series about mice and rats Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian children's animated television series Category:Television series by Grantray-Lawrence Animation ","title":"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse"},{"id":"20221342","text":"Moglicë is a village and a former municipality in the Korçë County, southeastern Albania.

Gladwin (born 28 March 1907) was an English footballer. His regular position was at right-half or inside forward. Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, he played for Worksop Town, Doncaster Rovers and Manchester United, as well as guesting for Barnsley, Wrexham, Doncaster Rovers and West Ham United during the Second World War.Rollin (2005). ==Career== Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Gladwin began his football career with local Midland League club Worksop Town while also working as a bricklayer. At the end of the 1929–30 season, Doncaster Rovers were short on funds and were unable to pay summer wages to many of their players; as a result, they were only able to retain 16 players for the 1930–31 season. Gladwin was among those brought in to augment the threadbare side and soon became a regular in the team, playing in either inside forward position or at right-half. In 1934–35, he was part of the Doncaster team that won the Third Division North title and they were promoted to the Second Division. The club avoided relegation in their first season in the second tier, but despite leading the league after two games in 1936–37, they were firmly rooted to the bottom of the table by the end of October and were relegated at the end of the season. After 226 league appearances in which he scored 22 goals, Gladwin was able to escape the sinking Doncaster ship in February 1937, only to join a Manchester United team that was in similarly dire straits in the First Division for a fee of £3,000.McCartney (2013), pp. 175–6. Including his debut against Chelsea on 27 February 1937, in which he scored, Gladwin played in eight of Manchester United's last 12 matches of the season – the first four as an inside right and the next four as a right half. They still had a chance to avoid relegation in their final game against West Bromwich Albion on 24 April 1937; however, a 1–0 defeat meant that they finished in 21st place and were relegated to the Second Division, where they had spent the last five seasons. Gladwin made just seven appearances the following season, as Manchester United won promotion back to the First Division after finishing in second place, ahead of Sheffield United by virtue of a better goal average. He was more involved again in 1938–39, helping Manchester United in his 12 appearances to a 14th-place finish in the league, ensuring that the club would still be in the First Division at the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, Gladwin made guest appearances in the Wartime League for various clubs, including Barnsley (1939–40; two appearances),Rollin (2005), p. 272.

After the end of the conflict, he worked in various institutions in Paris. At this time he made the acquaintance of Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, who encouraged him to study Celtic languages. == Career == In 1883 he was appointed to the Faculty of Arts at Rennes University, where he taught Celtic. That same year he founded the journal Annales de Bretagne, in which he published numerous studies and edited until 1910. He was appointed professor at the Collège de France in 1910 and was elected member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1919.

The original Dominator was designed in 1947 and 1948 by Bert Hopwood, who had been on the Speed Twin design team at Triumph. Available for sale from mid 1949, this design set the pattern for Norton twins for the next 30 years. ==Model 7== The first Dominator, the Model 7, had a 497 cc parallel twin engine with iron cylinders and cylinder head and a Lucas K2F magneto. The crankshaft was of 360-degree layout with two main bearings. A single camshaft at the front of the engine was driven by gears and chain. The rocker box was integral with the head, so there were fewer gasket faces to leak and less valve noise. The engine was a long stroke design with bore and stroke and mild tuning, resulting in more torque low down. For the first few years a plunger frame was used, but in 1953 the Model 7 was upgraded with a single downtube swinging arm frame, 19-inch front wheel and 'pear shaped' silencers, still known as a Model 7. The Model 7 continued in production through to 1955 and was often used with a sidecar, which could not be fitted to the later Featherbed frame Dominators. ==Model 77== The first Model 77 was a rigid-framed telescopic-forked Dominator version of 500 cc produced from 1950, and supplied to the Australian market only. This used the all-iron Dominator 500 cc twin engine, with an oil pressure gauge in the ES2 style but flat-bottomed petrol tank. About 240 were made, from 1950 to 1952. The 596 cc Model 77 Dominator was introduced in late 1956. Essentially the cycle parts of the ES2 and a 600 cc Dominator 99 engine, it was in production at the same time as the Dominator 99 as a sidecar motorcycle but was dropped from production after 1957, when sidecar Featherbeds were introduced. ==Featherbed frames== Duplex cradle frames known as 'featherbed' were introduced in two types; the initial design was discontinued from 1960, becoming known as wideline when followed by an updated-version introduced during the 1960 model year (known as slimline) until eventual discontinuation circa 1970 on the low-specification 650 cc Norton Mercury. ==Model 88== The Featherbed frame was first designed and raced by the McCandless brothers in Ireland with the design bought by The Norton Motorcycle company who had the frames made by the Reynolds company because the Norton works did not have the necessary welding capacity for its manufacture. The Featherbed frame led to the Model 88 Dominator, also called the Dominator De Luxe, which used the same 497 cc engine and was developed in 1951. Originally developed for export it was sold on the home market from 1953. The 88 suffered from oil leaks from the primary chain case but it was the outdated and inefficient Norton works that resulted in quality control problems for the 200 Model 88's produced each week. ==Model 99== Model 99 Dominator The 597cc featherbed framed Model 99 Dominator was introduced in september 1955, as a larger capacity version alongside the 500 cc Model 88 version. Due to the increased engine capacity, the 99 had a power output of 31 bhp, partly due also to a higher compression ratio possible with the alloy head introduced a year earlier. Full width alloy hubs with improved brakes had also been introduced a year earlier, preparatory for the capacity increase from 500 cc to 600 cc ==Slimline Featherbed frames from 1960== From 1960 model year, the featherbed frame for all Dominators was altered so that the frame tubes in front of the seat were narrower, for improved rider comfort. The seats and tanks and indeed the whole styling of the Dominator was redesigned to suit. A large metal tank badge completed the look, along with some two-toned paint schemes. And some optional enclosed body styling on the \\"Deluxe\\" Models of the 88 and 99, along the lines of the 'bathtub' Triumph models. ==1960 Manxman 650 and 1961 Dominator 650SS== A new 650 cc model was added to the lineup late in 1960. The frame was altered so that the top rails were closer together at the front of the seat area to create what became known as the 'slimline' featherbed. A 650 cc engine was installed to create the Norton Manxman. First built from 7 November 1960 to September 1961, these machines were a Limited Edition for the USA only, in custom-cruiser style - with high handlebars, all polychromatic blue paint and bright red seat with white piping round the edge. In September 1961 the 650SS was introduced. It had USA cafe bar style and twin carburettors. The SS stood for Sport Special and the 600 cc models were discontinued to concentrate on production of the 650SS, which quickly earned a reputation as the \\"best of the Dommies\\". 1967 Norton Atlas ==Norton Atlas 745 cc== A development of the Dominator with enlarged engine was available from 1962. ==Racing== Engineer Doug Hele had joined the Norton factory in 1956 under parent company AMC – instead of combining the two race shops, the AJS/Matchless facility was closed to Grand Prix development, and Hele was briefed to secretly develop an engine intended to ultimately compete at Daytona under AMA race regulations, requiring machines to be based on production roadster designs with a compression ratio no greater than 8.5:1, and using a kick starter mechanism. Dennis Greenfield and Fred Swift won the 500 cc class in the Thruxton 500 event for road-legal production machines in 1960. Race-styled 1961 Norton Dominator Norton briefly used race-tuned Dominators from circa 1960, but they were still outclassed by the Manx Norton which was used for general purpose racing. The highly developed 500 cc Dominator engine intended as a successor produced and revved to 8,000 rpm. The overall weight was less than the Manx, when mounted in a special lightweight-frame (dubbed lowboy), creating the factory \\"Domiracer\\".Story of the Domiracer, by Charlie Rous, Classic Racer (EMAP), Autumn 1988, pp.52-56 Accessed 23 December 2017 In the 1961 Isle of Man TT Tom Phillis took the bike to third place and lapped at over , a first for a pushrod engine and a first for any twin. Norton abandoned the Domiracer project a year later when the Bracebridge Street race shop closed and the Domiracer and factory spares were sold to Paul Dunstall, who continued with development and began producing Norton performance parts, eventually selling complete Dunstall Norton bikes to customers including Steve McQueen. ==See also== *List of motorcycles of the 1940s *List of motorcycles of the 1950s ==References== Dominator Category:Standard motorcycles Category:Sport bikes Category:Motorcycles introduced in the 1940s ","title":"Norton Dominator"},{"id":"20221377","text":"Lekas is a village and a former municipality in the Korçë County, southeastern Albania.

It runs between Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire and Edwalton, on the course of the Midland Railway's route between Kettering and Nottingham which closed to passengers on 1 May 1967Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench page 65 and to goods in 1968. It is in length. ==History== Old Dalby railway test centre The track was set up by British Rail Research Division, which had used it from May 1966. After closure as a through route in 1968, it was converted into a test track for the Advanced Passenger Train APT-E project, re-opening in September 1970. The track saw extensive use in the heyday of the Research Division and was used for pantograph development and OHLE testing. Following privatisation of Britain's railways, the track became the property of BRB (Residuary) Limited, the body set up to own former BR assets that were not sold off. The track was leased for one peppercorn per annum to Serco and later to Alstom and Metronet (LUL). Following the abolition of the BRBR, ownership passed to Network Rail on 30 September 2013. On 17 July 1984 the track was used to test the integrity of flasks used to transport nuclear fuel elements by rail. A Class 46 diesel locomotive (No. 46009), weighing 138 long tons (140 tonnes) and pulling three carriages, was intentionally crashed at about into a pre-arranged, derailed, flask-carrying wagon. The behaviour of the flask was monitored in detail and the observations used to validate numerical modelling of flasks subjected to impact loading. A photographic record is available, as well as a video. ==Twenty-first century== British Rail Class 800 undergoing dynamic testing at Old Dalby, 2015 In 2001 the track was leased to Alstom Transport, which electrified the former Down line at 25 kV AC OHLE to test and commission the Class 390 Pendolino trains for use on the West Coast Main Line, and re-instated six miles of the former Up line from Old Dalby to the southern portal of Stanton Tunnel to test and commission the proposed European Rail Traffic Management System system for Network Rail. When Alstom withdrew from the United Kingdom train-building market, the track was threatened with closure before being leased to Metronet in 2007 to test and commission London Underground S Stock trains being manufactured by Bombardier at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The former Up line was equipped with approximately of London Underground-style conductor rails from Old Dalby (milepost 111) to a point near milepost 114. Testing of 'S' stock began at the end of March 2009. The former Down line retains its 25 kV OHLE. Serco was awarded the contract to manage the track on behalf of Metronet, giving it the opportunity to attract other users. In April 2010, the track was used by Class 172 diesel multiple units, also manufactured by Bombardier in Derby. Network Rail uses the track on an ongoing basis for calibration and testing of measurement and gauging trains. Plans include the testing the Thales automatic train control system for London Underground, and new mainline infrastructure such as the Series One OCS system by Network Rail. During mid January 2014, Network Rail applied for changes to the original planning controls to increase train passes on the line substantially during weekdays citing commissioning of the new Hitachi IEP stock based on the Javelin stock on High Speed 1 for the future electrification of the Great Western Main Line, this undoubtedly secures the future of the line's testing capabilities even further. In December 2017, the local council suggested that the line could be reopened to passengers to allow a direct link between Nottingham and Melton Mowbray, as part of the Government's strategy to open up new areas for housing by recommissioning disused rail lines. == References The Old Dalby website contains photographs and a comprehensive history of the line * Melton Times report on expansion of testing capacity 2014 and beyond * Youtube video of the Asfordby storage sidings with SERCO LU stock testing December 2012 Category:British Rail research and development Category:Railway test tracks ","title":"Old Dalby Test Track"},{"id":"20221450","text":"George Haslam (born 23 March 1898 – 13 August 1980) was an English footballer who played as a centre-half.

It was originally part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad route to the suburb of Castle Shannon. It replaced an earlier incline dating to 1825 that brought coal down from a mine in Mount Washington. Initially opened on 26 August 1890, the incline operated for only a few days before breaking down, the original machinery being unable to bear the strain of the large freight and passenger cars. After a second abortive run in October, it was decided that the machinery had to be replaced. The refitted incline opened on 7 March 1891. It ran from Bailey Avenue west of Haberman Avenue down to Carson Street just west of Arlington Avenue. The oldest part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a coal mine in Mount Washington. When the mine was played out in 1861, the company opened the back (south) side of the mine and continued it down a horseshoe curve into the Saw Mill Run valley to other coal mines. The company began passenger service in 1874 to develop towns at Fair Haven (Overbrook) and Castle Shannon. Trains ran up the old incline, through the enlarged coal mine tunnel, down the slope and horseshoe curve, and through the valley. Improvements starting in 1890 replaced the route over Mount Washington with the new incline, which became known as Castle Shannon Incline No. 1 when a second less steep incline was built on the south side as Castle Shannon Incline No. 2 in 1892. From that date, the old incline, the coal tunnel, and the railroad down through the horseshoe curve were used only for coal trains and not passengers. The incline's large cars were able to carry both passengers and wagons, and later automobiles. In 1909, steam railroad passenger service on the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was replaced by electric cars of the Pittsburgh Railways that ran through the Mount Washington tunnel (still in use today). No longer part of a through route, Incline No. 2 soon became superfluous, but development of a residential area on top of Mount Washington kept Incline No. 1 in business. Originally steam powered, it was converted to electrical operation in 1918 by the Otis Elevator Company. The incline was closed 21 June 1964. The site of the bottom of the incline is still visible as a gravel slope next to Carson Street where the bus lane joins. Up from there, it passes under existing bridges carrying a railroad, East Sycamore Street, and the P. J. McArdle Roadway. Farther up, Cola Street ends at the incline site. The bottom is near the now-popular Station Square. ==See also== * List of funicular railways * List of inclines in Pittsburgh ==References External links == * Engineering drawings Category:History of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Category:Defunct funicular railways in the United States Category:Railway inclines in Pittsburgh Category:10 ft gauge railways in the United States Category:Railway lines opened in 1890 Category:Railway lines closed in 1964 Category:1890 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1964 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Castle Shannon Incline"},{"id":"20221454","text":"The ectotympanic, or tympanicum, is a bony ring in the tympanic part of the temporal bone that holds the eardrum, or tympanic membrane.

Reuters, The Religious Retreat That Sparked India's Major Coronavirus Manhunt, The New York Times, 2 April 2020. ==History==  Early history  The Banglewali Masjid (Bungalow Mosque) was built in Nizamuddin by Mirza Ilahi Baksh, a relative of the last Mughal emperor, sometime after 1857. Mawlana Muhammad Ismail, the father of Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi, established a madrasa in its premises under the name Kashif al-Ulum. It is said that he used to go out and invite people to come to the mosque and, on one occasion, he happened to bring Meos from Mewat who were in Delhi as labourers. Noticing that they were not schooled in proper practice of prayer, he decided to teach it to them, which was the beginning of the madrasa. After the death of Mawlana Ismail and his elder son, Muammad Ilyas took up the task of teaching at the madrasa. He too was concerned with educating the Meos of Mewat. Noticing that his own direct teaching would be indadequate to the task, in time, he evolved the practices of tabligh that form the foundation of Tablighi Jamaat. This involved turning ordinary Muslims into preachers. Training them in the preaching work became the main activity of the madrasa, gradually turning the Banglewali Masjid into a markaz (centre or headquarters). Ilyas also set up an organisational network for his fledgling organisation bringing in men of influence to gather in the mosque. By the end of Ilyas's life, Tablighi Jamaat emerged as a national organisation with transnational potential.  Transnational centre  Under Ilyas's son and successor, Muhammad Yusuf Kandhlawi (1917–1965), the Tablighi Jamaat expanded worldwide and became a transnational organisation. The Nizamuddin Markaz became the world headquarters (Aalami Markaz). According to a commentator, it is \\"the heart circulating blood through the body\\" for the Tablighi Jamaat organisation. It is the place where people are trained for missionary work, worldwide tours are organised and information to the entire worldwide network is distributed. After Yusuf's sudden death, the senior members chose Inamul Hasan Kandhlawi (1918–1995), a close relative of Ilyas, as the third amir. However, some arugue that Hazrat Kandhlawi, Yusuf's brother, wielded more influence. : \\"Mayaram argues that the process of succession has not been fluid. Some in TJ allege that after Yusuf’s death, his brother, Hazrat Kandhalawi, started to “dominate the decision making structure at Nizamuddin,” with even the official amir having to consult him before decisions were made. It was from this split that the trend toward a dual hereditary leadership emerged.\\" After the 30-year leadership of Inamul Hasan, during which the movement grew to its present size, an executive council (shura) was established to share the responsibilities of leadership.  Recent developments  According to scholar Zacharias Pieri, the final decision-making responsibility fell on two men within the shura: Zubair ul- Hasan Kandhlawi and Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi. : \\"Since Izhar ul-Hasan’s death in 1996, the governing executive council was made up of Zubayr and Saad (Arshad 2007).[3] In the strictest sense, the final decision-making powers in the movement fell to these two men.\\" After Zubair ul-Hasan's death in 2014, Mawlana Saad assumed the leadership of the council and the movement. : \\"In 2014, there was yet another change in TJ’s leadership with the passing away of Zubayr ul-Hasan. Zubayr was seen as the senior leader in the movement and teacher of the current leader Maulana Saad. ... Reetz commented that even before Maulana Zubayr’s death, Maulana Saad moved to the center of the movement and was seen as the “spiritual and symbolic head” attracting immense popularity on an international level.\\" According to The Milli Gazette, the senior members of the Tablighi Jamaat from around the world met at the Pakistan regional markaz at Raiwind in 2015 and resolved that the organisation would be governed by a shura with rotating Amir among the Shura. Raiwind amir Muhammad Abdul Wahhab who was a member of the original shura backed this effort. Mawlana Saad did not accept the recommendations of the meeting, causing a split in the organisation. Correction by Latweef Shen Myint-Thu: Both Maulana Saad and Muhammad Abdul Wahhab rejected the idea of rotating Amir among the Shura. Period. The friction led to division of the Tablighi Jamaat leadership into two groups, the first being led by Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi at the Nizamuddin Markaz, while the other being led by Ebrahim Dewla, Ahmed Laat and others at Nerul Markaz in India. The Raiwind Markaz in Pakistan is part of the latter group and has become the \\"de facto base\\" of the aalami shura group. COVID-19 pandemic The mosque organised a large congregation in March 2020, from 13 to 15 March, participants got stuck in the Markaz Building due to the sudden and surprize announcement of nationwide lockdown in India by the government. Although prior information was furnished with the Nizamiddin Police station, and parellel functions were also held near the same dates (belonging to other religions), some right wing media outlets made a big propaganda of this event as reason for Corona spread in the state. https://scroll.in/latest/964211/covid-19-residents-of-nizamuddin-serve-legal- notice-to-delhi-authorities-for-targeting-muslims ==See also== * Nerul Aalami Markaz, in Maharashtra * Raiwind Markaz, in Pakistan * Tongi Ijtema, in Bangladesh ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Mosques in Delhi Category:Tablighi Jamaat ","title":"Nizamuddin Markaz Mosque"},{"id":"20221518","text":"James Montgomery MM (1890 – 14 November 1960) was an English professional football right half who played in the Football League for Glossop and Manchester United.

It purported to follow one of the maxims of equity that \\"Equity will not assist a volunteer\\". ==Facts== Thomas Medley held shares in a company called the Bank of Louisiana, and wished to transfer them. The bank required the shares be transferred according to regulations in the company constitution. He wanted to give them to his niece, Eleanor Milroy (maiden name Dudgeon). He signed a deed in Louisiana with Samuel Lord, for Lord to hold 50 shares on trust for Eleanor. (This was in fact made in consideration of $1, but this was ignored.) He also gave Lord a power of attorney to receive dividends on the shares and to comply with the company constitution’s formalities. Lord did not actually do it. Thomas Medley lived for three years after signing the deed with Samuel Lord, in which Samuel Lord was receiving dividends and passing them on. When Thomas Medley died the shares still remained in his name. Eleanor Milroy claimed that the shares belonged to her. Stuart VC held that a trust had been created for Eleanor, and the decision was appealed. ==Judgment== The Court of Appeal in Chancery held the attempted transfer failed. An ineffective outright transfer could not be regarded as an effective declaration of trust. Knight Bruce LJ said the following. Turner LJ concurred. Three ways to give something were (1) legal transfer of title to recipient (2) transfer of title to a trustee for a beneficiary (3) a self-declaration of trust. He continued. ==Significance== There were subsequently a host of exceptions to the Milroy v Lord rule. One, almost immediately from Strong v Bird was that if a debtor appointed to an estate as executor will have his debt forgiven if, and only if, the testator manifested an intention to forgive the debt and this intention continued until death. A second, set out in Re Rose, is that the gift will be an effective transfer where the donor has done everything he is obliged to do to make the gift valid. Particularly after T Choithram International SA v Pagarani, it is not clear that Milroy v Lord would be decided in the same way. ==See also== *English trusts law ==NotesReferences== * Category:English trusts case law Category:1862 in case law Category:1862 in British law Category:Court of Chancery cases ","title":"Milroy v Lord"},{"id":"20221528","text":"Pojan is a village and a former municipality in the Korçë County, southeastern Albania.

His first national stint was being part of the RP Youth team that played in the 9th ABC Youth Championships held in Manila. He would become a member of the national team that same year in 1987 under coach Joe Lipa. Asaytono also played for coach Derrick Pumaren at Magnolia Ice Cream in the PABL and won three championships. ==Professional career== Purefoods Hotdogs Asaytono was drafted as the 2nd overall pick by the Purefoods Hotdogs in 1989. He played three seasons for the ballclub that has most of his former national teammates; Jojo Lastimosa, Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codiñera, Glenn Capacio and Dindo Pumaren. With Patrimonio at the starting forward, Nelson mostly would come off the bench. He won two championships at Purefoods. In his final season as a Tender Juicy Hotdog in 1991, he had a notable performances during the All-Filipino finals against Diet Sarsi. Swift/Sunkist In late 1991, Asaytono was traded by Purefoods to Swift in exchange for first round picks in 1994 and 1995. He joined the list of PBA millionaires as he was signed to a lucrative pact by the RFM franchise. For two seasons with Swift, Asaytono made it to the mythical five selection and a decent run at the Most Valuable Player (MVP) plum. In 1993, he was second in the statistical race but would up third after the polls in a frustrated bid for the most coveted award. With Vergel Meneses' first full season with Swift in 1994, Asaytono could only make it to the mythical second team selection but still performed well, averaging 18.6 points and 7.2 rebounds in 65 games. After winning four championships with Swift/Sunkist, Asaytono was traded to San Miguel Beermen, his former team in the amateurs, in April 1996 for one-time MVP Renato Agustin. San Miguel Beermen Asaytono's trade to San Miguel proved to be the turning point of his career. He became go-to-guy in Coach Ron Jacobs's rotation as well as its franchise player. In 1997, he became one of the forerunners for the MVP award but he again came short to former teammate Alvin Patrimonio. Although he lost the MVP race, he led the league in scoring. When the team drafted future MVP Danny Ildefonso in the 1998 season, his minutes was again reduced but still he led the team in scoring. He led Beermen to the finals twice in All Filipino and Commissioner's Cup in that season, but came up short in both occasions to the Alaska Milkmen. A year later, when Jong Uichico took over the coaching reins from Jacobs, he was relegated to the bench and was eventually traded to his former team, the Pop Cola 800s (together with hotshot William Antonio) for Dwight Lago, Boybits Victoria, and Nic Belasco. Pop Cola, Red Bull, Career Milestone and Retirement Asaytono's second stint Pop Cola was a forgettable one, as he started to slow down as he was still at the bench. He spent his last four seasons with the Red Bull Barako until the 2005-06 season. On April 7, 2005, he passed Crispa great Philip Cezar for the fifth spot all-time scoring list after tallying with 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Currently, he is fifth in the PBA all-time scoring list with 12,268 total points in 796 career games, behind only Ramon Fernandez, Abet Guidaben, Alvin Patrimonio and Atoy Co. Non-inclusion in the 40 Greatest PBA Players of All-Time Many basketball fans and even basketball experts and former PBA players are disappointed that Nelson Asaytono was not included on the 40 Greatest PBA Players of All-Time. Majority says that Nelson Asaytono's achievement should have been recognized by including him to the list.

It is named after Roland Bulirsch and Josef Stoer. It is sometimes called the Gragg–Bulirsch–Stoer (GBS) algorithm because of the importance of a result about the error function of the modified midpoint method, due to William B. Gragg. ==Underlying ideas== The idea of Richardson extrapolation is to consider a numerical calculation whose accuracy depends on the used stepsize h as an (unknown) analytic function of the stepsize h, performing the numerical calculation with various values of h, fitting a (chosen) analytic function to the resulting points, and then evaluating the fitting function for h = 0, thus trying to approximate the result of the calculation with infinitely fine steps. Bulirsch and Stoer recognized that using rational functions as fitting functions for Richardson extrapolation in numerical integration is superior to using polynomial functions because rational functions are able to approximate functions with poles rather well (compared to polynomial functions), given that there are enough higher-power terms in the denominator to account for nearby poles. While a polynomial interpolation or extrapolation only yields good results if the nearest pole is rather far outside a circle around the known data points in the complex plane, rational function interpolation or extrapolation can have remarkable accuracy even in the presence of nearby poles. The modified midpoint method by itself is a second-order method, and therefore generally inferior to fourth-order methods like the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. However, it has the advantage of requiring only one derivative evaluation per substep (asymptotically for a large number of substeps), and, in addition, as discovered by Gragg, the error of a modified midpoint step of size H, consisting of n substeps of size h = H/n each, and expressed as a power series in h, contains only even powers of h. This makes the modified midpoint method extremely useful to the Bulirsch–Stoer method as the accuracy increases two orders at a time when the results of separate attempts to cross the interval H with increasing numbers of substeps are combined. , in their discussion of the method, say that rational extrapolation in this case is nearly never an improvement over polynomial interpolation . Furthermore, the modified midpoint method is a modification of the regular midpoint method to make it more stable, but because of the extrapolation this does not really matter . ==References== * . * . * * . ==External links== * ODEX.F, implementation of the Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm by Ernst Hairer and Gerhard Wanner (for other routines and license conditions, see their Fortran and Matlab Codes page). * BOOST library, implementing the Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm by boost library).

It is situated approximately west of Padstow. The South West Coast Path runs around the whole promontory and is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Trevose Head Heritage Coast. In clear weather, visitors to Trevose Head can see virtually the whole length of the north Cornwall coast; to the north, the view extends beyond the Cornwall county boundary to Hartland Point (), Devon; to the south, it extends beyond St Ives to the headland at Pendeen Watch (). ==History== The ruins of St Constantine's chapel can be visited at hole 3 of Trevose Golf Club along an ancient right of way. The club is situated between Constantine Bay and Mother Ivey's Bay, behind Booby's Bay. Trevose Head Lighthouse, maintained by Trinity House, is on the north-west corner of the headland and the Padstow lifeboat is stationed on the east side of Trevose Head. The lighthouse was first lit on 1 December 1847; initially there was an upper and lower light with the lower light no longer used after 1882. The last of the resident keepers left the lighthouse on 20 December 1995 following automation. A lifeboat was established at Padstow before 1825 and in 1967 the lifeboat station was moved from Hawkers Cove to Trevose Head due to silting of the River Camel. The present station was completed in July 2006 and came into service shortly after. Approximately of Trevose Headland was put up for sale in March 2016, comprising of agricultural land and of coastal rough grazing and slope. The area had been in the ownership of the same family since circa 1900. ==Natural history== The headland is within the Trevose Head and Constantine Bay Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which is designated for both its biological and geological interests. Wild asparagus grows on the cliffs of Dinas Head and shore dock at the base of the cliffs. The cliffs are also important for breeding fulmar, razorbill and guillemot. ==References * Trinity House information on Trevose Lighthouse * Padstow Lifeboat Station Category:Headlands of Cornwall Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cornwall Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1951 ","title":"Trevose Head"},{"id":"20221807","text":"Matt Bettencourt (born April 12, 1975) is an American professional golfer. Born in Alameda, California, Bettencourt turned professional in 2001 after attending Modesto Junior College. In 2008, Bettencourt won twice on the Nationwide Tour, at the Oregon Classic in September and a month and a half later at the season-ending Nationwide Tour Championship at TPC Craig Ranch. The second win took him from 12th to 1st in the money list, therefore earning him his 2009 PGA Tour card. He finished 111th on the PGA Tour money list in 2009 to retain his card for 2010. In 2010, he gained his first PGA Tour win at the Reno-Tahoe Open, one shot ahead of Bob Heintz after Heintz missed a birdie putt on the 72nd hole. This win ensures PGA Tour exemption for Bettencourt until the end of the 2012 season in a tough season that saw Bettencourt make 14 cuts in 32 appearances. Bettencourt split time in 2013 between the Web.com Tour and PGA Tour. He finished 16th on the 2013 Web.com Tour regular season money list to earn his 2014 PGA Tour card. In 2014, he made only 4 cuts in 14 events and finished 211th on the FedEx Cup points list, therefore he lost his PGA Tour card and also missed the Web.com Tour Finals.

He served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War. After the conflict he remained in the military for the rest of his life, and authored several works on a variety of subjects. ==Early life and career== Brisbin was born in 1837 at Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, a son of Margaret and Ezra Brisbin. He studied at the Boalsburg Academy, and upon graduating Brisbin began teaching.Warner, p. 45. He later purchased and edited the Centre Democrat newspaper in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and also studied law and was later admitted to the bar of Pennsylvania. Brisbin was prominently known as an anti-slavery orator. ==Civil War service== When the American Civil War began in 1861, Brisbin was a lawyer in practice. He enlisted in the Pennsylvania volunteer services that April as a private. On April 26, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the mounted 2nd U.S. Dragoons.Eicher gives his unit at this time as the 2nd Dragoons, but Warner lists it as the 1st Dragoons, to which he soon transferred to in the fall of 1861. He fought in the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, on July 21. In this battle, Brisbin received two wounds, one in his side and the other in an arm,Eicher, p. 144. and was praised by his superiors for his performance during the fight. On August 3, 1861, Brisbin transferred to the 1st U.S. Cavalry (previously known as the 1st Dragoons until a reorganization of the army) but then was appointed a captain in the 6th U.S. Cavalry two days later. On June 9, 1862, he fought during the action near Beverly Ford, Virginia, and was again wounded when he fell off of his horse. Exactly one year later Brisbin was brevetted to the rank of major for his conduct at Beverly Ford. In 1863 he very briefly led the cavalry forces in the Federal Department of the Susquehanna,Eicher, p. 144. Led cavalry from June 22–28, 1863. and was wounded in a leg during combat near Greenbrier, Virginia, on July 26.Eicher, pp. 144-5. Brisbin was promoted to colonel on March 1, 1864, and organized the 5th United States Colored Cavalry.Eicher, p. 145. He served as the acting head of cavalry on the staff of Brig. Gen. Albert L. Lee during the Red River Campaign, and was again wounded during the Battle of Mansfield in Louisiana on April 8, this time in the right foot. On December 12, 1864, Brisbin was brevetted to brigadier general in the Union Army, and seven days later was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his performance at Battle of Marion in Tennessee. In 1865, he was on recruiting duty in Kentucky, serving on the staff of Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge. On March 13, Brisbin was brevetted to colonel in the regular army as well as brevetted major general in the Union Army, and on May 1 he was promoted to brigadier general. Brisbin was mustered out of the Union Army as a volunteer on January 15, 1866. ==Postbellum== Brisbin in later life After the war, Brisbin remained in the regular army, aiding in the establishment of other colored regiments and served in the Northwestern United States as an officer in several cavalry regiments. From 1868-92, he served as an officer in several cavalry regiments, including the Second, Ninth, First, and Eighth regiments in the Northwestern United States. Brisbin was in command of the 2nd Cavalry of General John Gibbon's Montana Column at the time of the Little Big Horn campaign. Brisbin offered four companies of his 2nd Cavalry to General George Armstrong Custer at the final command meeting of Generals Terry, Gibbon, and Custer just prior to the final march into the Big Horn valley, but Custer declined it, stating that the 7th Cavalry alone could defeat the hostiles. Brisbin never forgave Custer for this, and is alleged to have called the dead Custer an \\"insufferable ass\\". In various correspondence (see Graham \\"The Custer Myth\\", Philbrick, \\"The Last Stand\\") Brisbin was openly critical of Custer's actions - whether or not because of personal jealousy cannot be determined. Brisbin also penned the then-bestselling \\"Beef Bonzana\\" which urged investment in Open Range Cattle. At the time of his death he was a colonel in command of the Eighth Cavalry Regiment and was in command at Fort Meade. Brisbin died on January 14, 1892 in Philadelphia. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Red Wing, Minnesota. ==Personal life== Brisbin married Mary Jane Wagner on June 15, 1861. They had four children. His wife died at Fort McKinney in 1887. In 1891 he married Amelia Wilson in Red Wing, Minnesota. He was also a prolific writer, and contributed articles and letters to Eastern periodicals on many subjects throughout his career.

His main media are oil paint, watercolour and pencil. == Early life == Mark Lundy Upton was born in Wiltshire, England in 1964. His parents, Roger and Jean (nee. Turnell) were living in Marlborough and had recently started a leather and sporting goods retail business in the town. Roger was already a well known falconer and the same year as Mark was born had started to travel in the Middle East, going to Abu Dhabi as a guest of the late Sheikh Said bin Shakhbut. There he met and became a lifelong friend of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who later became ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first president of the UAE. Jean was the eldest daughter of Bob Turnell who was at the time one of the leading jumping racehorse trainers of the time with a yard just outside Marlborough at Ogbourne Maizey. Mark's brother, Guy Upton is eighteen months younger, and is a steeplechase jockey and horseman. He went to the local primary school at Preshute and later attended St Johns in Marlborough. After school, Mark took a year out and worked for Sheikh Surour bin Mohamad al Nahayan in Abu Dhabi. He then returned and spent a year at Swindon College of Art on an art foundation course. Upton had been brought up in a very artistic background. His father painted wildlife pictures, his uncle, Peter Upton was a well known equine artist and his grandmother had been an artist and fashion designer. Her brother was William Cain, a renowned dry point engraver between the wars spending much of his career in the Middle East. Upton is also very well known in the falconry world as one of the top artists as well as an extremely dedicated and good falconer. In this he has followed his father and become much admired for his high-flying falcons in his own right. In 2008, Upton married Rachelle Ormond, niece of art historian Richard Louis Ormond and great-niece of artist John Singer Sargent. == Commissions and patrons == Instead of going on to do a Fine Art Degree at Art School Mark went straight into a painting career. Soon forging a name for himself in the country and sporting art world. At the same time he was frequently travelling in the Middle East, and was receiving commissions for many paintings of that part of the world. He has sold paintings to the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi and many of his family. In Saudi his main patron is Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsin al Saud and he also has paintings in collections of other Saudi Princes. Princess Alia of Jordan has also bought Mark Upton paintings. In the UK Mark's most important patron was HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother who bought various paintings from him including Scottish landscapes and sporting paintings. He has also painted for bodies like the Injured Jockeys Fund, Countryside Alliance, the Game Conservancy and Spinal Injuries Association. ==Publications== Mark has illustrated several books: * Hood,Leash & Lure: Falconry in the 20th Century () by Roger Upton * Arab Falconry: History of a Way of Life () by Roger Upton * The Baz-Nama-Yi Nasiri (A Persian Treatise On Falconry) / Observations On Eastern Falconry/One Thousand Years Of Falconry (ASIN: B001AW3VCQ) by Kenyon Gibson and Lieut.-Colonel D.C.

It was released in 1977 on the Epic record label. ==Background== In the few years following his divorce from Tammy Wynette, Jones career began to sputter; his first two solo albums, 1975's Memories of Us and 1976's The Battle, did not crack the top 20 on Billboard's country albums chart. Things turned around briefly with Alone Again in 1976, which boasted the hit single \\"Her Name Is\\", but I Wanta Sing, his only album of 1977, stalled on the charts at number 38. Two singles, \\"Old King Kong\\" and \\"If I Could Put Them All Together\\", also failed to crack the top 20. Part of the reason for the album's failure was Jones's unreliability at the time, as his personal life began to unravel. The singer had signed a management deal with a local hustler named Shug Baggot, who would later do time for cocaine trafficking. George, who had long indulged in amphetamines and whiskey, was soon addicted to cocaine as well, and the drug would increase Jones's already considerable paranoia. Beset with money problems, he began missing shows and other personal appearances, although he made several television spots to plug his new LP, looking dapper singing \\"If I Could Put Them All Together\\" on Marty Robbins's television show and taking part in a medley with Robbins and Faron Young. The single only made it to number 24. ==Composition== Perhaps to combat all the bad publicity and disturbing stories that were beginning to emerge about Jones, producer Billy Sherrill loaded I Wanta Sing with songs that are predominantly lighthearted. In his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All, Jones confessed \\"I usually let whatever producer I was working for select the songs, then I selected from his selections. I'd usually pick ten from about twenty-five prospective songs. Why not? I wasn't writing myself anymore, and my producer, whoever he happened to be at the time, always brought me songs from the best writers in Nashville.\\" The title track (the only song on the album Jones did have a hand in writing) features snippets of songs by his favorite singers, such as \\"The Great Speckled Bird\\" by Roy Acuff and \\"Always Late With Your Kisses\\" by Lefty Frizzell. Numbers like \\"Please Don't Sell Me Anymore Whiskey Tonight\\" and \\"They've Got Millions in Milwaukee\\" seem to coyly play up Jones hard drinking reputation. \\"They've Got Millions in Milwaukee\\" is a cover of a Larry Chesier song from 1976. \\"I Love You So Much It Hurts\\" is a cover of a Floyd Tillman song from 1946 that was also recorded by Merle Haggard in 1977. \\"Bull Mountain Lad\\" is a cover of a Wild Bill Emerson song from his 1976 album, Bull Mountain Lad. In 2011, the album was paired (somewhat uncomfortably) with Jones's 1972 Epic debut George Jones (We Can Make It) and reissued with bonus tracks. ==Track listing== # \\"I Wanta Sing\\" (George Jones, Earl Montgomery, Ernie Rowell) # \\"Please Don't Sell Me Anymore Whiskey Tonight\\" (Jody Emerson, Ronal McCown) # \\"They've Got Millions in Milwaukee\\" (Larry Chesier, Glenn Sutton) # \\"If I Could Put Them All Together (I'd Have You)\\" (Even Stevens) # \\"I Love You So Much It Hurts\\" (Floyd Tillman) # \\"Rest in Peace\\" (George Richey, Billy Sherrill) # \\"Bull Mountain Lad\\" (\\"Wild\\" Bill Emerson, Jody Emerson) # \\"Old King Kong\\" (Sammy Lyons) # \\"You've Got The Best of Me Again\\" (Ernie Rowell, Bob House) # \\"It's a 10–33 (Let's Get Jesus on the Line)\\" (Earl Montgomery, Alvin McLendon, Al Stancil) ==Personnel== *George Jones – vocals *Cliff Parker – electric guitar *Ray Edenton – acoustic guitar *Jim Vest, Pete Drake – steel guitar *Henry Strzelecki – bass *Buddy Spicher – fiddle *Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins – piano *Charlie McCoy – harmonica *Jerry Carrigan – drums == References == Category:1977 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Albums produced by Billy Sherrill Category:Epic Records albums ","title":"I Wanta Sing"},{"id":"20221835","text":"Uncial 0176 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated paleographically to the 4th century (or 5th). == Description == The codex contains a small part of the Epistle to the Galatians (3:16-25), on one parchment leaf (12 cm by 7 cm).

Historically, the unit dealt primarily with prostitution, later introducing nightclubs, gaming and casinos. During the 60’s and with improved technology its focus had moved onto criminal activity, including drugs, criminal control of clubs and brothels and the obscene publications industry. The base in Vine Street was requisitioned to become the Aliens Registration office in August 1939, so the unit was temporarily closed. It reopened in October in a secret meeting in a public house in Leicester Square for officers to take instructions and collect their expenses. In 1941, the Unit moved onto the 3rd floor of the new West End Central Police Station. This location, near Soho Division, was key as Soho has been the most famous red light district in the United Kingdom since the mid 19th century. During the Second World War the vice scene in the west end of London thrived due mainly to the number of overseas soldiers based in England, many of whom were visitors to Soho. The proprietors of unlicensed clubs in Soho were breaching licensing laws but these also became a haven for prostitution and organised crime. The Clubs officers performed covert operations to tackle these problems. Various legislation has affected the work and direction of the unit over the years, when the Street Offences Act came into force in 1959 the majority of prostitutes left the street, practically overnight, for fear of imprisonment and the fine for living off immoral earnings which increased. The Obscene Publications Act 1964 brought extra responsibilities when the unit were given the task of enforcing the act. As a result, obscenity became a new part of their terms of reference. The unit reached its lowest ebb in the early 1970s when chronic allegations of corruption came to a head with the detailed exposure in 1972 of systematic payments by pornographer James Humphreys led to seventeen policemen, including DCI George Fenwick, head of the obscene publications squad; his direct superior DCS Bill Moody; Cmdr Wallace Virgo, head of the Serious Crime Squad, in overall charge of the unit; and Cmdr Kenneth Drury, head of the Flying Squad. As the ensuing corruption investigations widened, the obscene publications squad was replaced in its entirety with a new group of officers drawn from the uniformed branch, and in all over 20 detectives were dismissed or required to resign. When the cases ultimately came to trial in 1977 the presiding judge Mr Justice Mars-Jones summarised those involved as having engaged in \\"corruption on a scale which beggars description\\".Barry Cox, John Shirley, and Martin Short (1977). The Fall of Scotland Yard. Penguin Books. . As a result of this corruption, officers attached to Clubs were changed to predominantly uniformed officers who were thought to be less corrupt than their CID counterparts. There was also a rotation system where officers were posted to Clubs for a maximum of 12 months and then returned to their police stations. In practice, some returned within a matter of weeks.Kelland, Gilbert (1987) Crime in London, Grafton New challenges have arisen from the introduction of the Licensing Act 2003 (with the potential for 24-hour drinking) and the Gambling Act 2005 (with significant deregulation of gaming). With new legislation expected that covers the possession of \\"extreme obscenity\\" the work of the Clubs and Vice unit continues apace. In 2014 the unit was merged into the Mets Human trafficking command and the focus on clubs and vice was reduced. ==Role== The Clubs and Vice unit was split into five sections: The Clubs Unit is split into three teams: the Proactive Licensing team, Proactive Crime team and the Gaming team. All three units' primary responsibility is to generate intelligence led operations against organised criminals who use licensed premises to supply illegal drugs and gaming establishments to commit gaming fraud. They also support BOCUs in tackling licensed premises associated with serious violence and disorder. The Obscene Publications Unit targets people who manufacture and distribute obscene material through shops, mail order, complex distribution networks and the Internet. Particular attention is focused on the most extreme and/or exploitative material. The Taskable Unit assists BOCUs with offences occurring on the street such as kerb crawling, street prostitution and the advertising of brothels in public phone boxes, known as \\"carding\\". It also provides resources to other units within Clubs and Vice. The Vice Unit provides a centre of investigative excellence to monitor London's off street prostitution industry and in so doing protect the most vulnerable adult and child prostitution victims and seek to investigate and prosecute those who exploit them. Emphasis is placed on rescuing trafficked and coerced victims. The unit also provides support and guidance to borough officers who come into contact with these offenders and victims. The Intelligence Unit provides field intelligence for the proactive teams. The unit includes a dedicated Source team; Counter Terrorism and Promoters focus desks and the Financial Investigation Unit. ==ReferencesSee also== *Paedophile Unit, which was once the Obscene Publications Squad of the Clubs and Vice Unit Clubs and Vice Unit Category:Vice squads ","title":"Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice Unit"},{"id":"20221932","text":"This article discusses the cameras - mainly 35 mm SLRs - manufactured by Ricoh Imaging Corp. and its predecessors, and . It covers from the first \\"Asahiflex\\" models in 1952 and their successor, the pivotal \\"Asahi Pentax\\" single-lens reflex camera, to the present time. == Background == The period around 1950 marked the return of the Japanese photographic industry to the vigorous level of the early 1940s, and its emergence as a major exporter. The newly reborn industry had sold many of its cameras to the occupation forces (with hugely more disposable income than the Japanese) and they were well received. The Korean War saw a huge influx of journalists and photographers to the Far East, where they were impressed by lenses from companies such as Nikon and Canon for their Leica rangefinder cameras, and also by bodies by these and other companies to supplement and replace the Leica and Contax cameras they were using.

This camera was the Pentax K-1 == Screw mount cameras ==  Asahiflex Series  Asahi Optical introduced its first 35 mm camera in 1952. Asahi was unusual in deciding to start with a high-quality 35mm camera that was not a copy of something else. Its designers were convinced of the inherent superiority of the SLR and so proceeded along these lines. This effort resulted in the Asahiflex I, which was also the first Japanese 35mm SLR.The Japanese Historical Camera, p.58. (Japanese SLR cameras go back to Konishi's Sakura Reflex Prano of 1907. The Japanese Historical Camera, p.5.) The Asahiflex IIb There has always been a close design relationship between the products of Asahi, and those made in Germany (and later East Germany) by a variety of manufacturers, most notably Zeiss Ikon. In the case of the Asahiflex, study should be made of the immediate pre-war and immediate post-war models of the Praktiflex, which could be properly called the inspiration for the Asahiflex. This is, however not very likely, since the cameras are very different in mechanical construction and form, although the specifications show many similarities. According to other sources, it was a pre-war Reflex Corelle, owned by president Mr. Matsumoto, that inspired the Asahiflex. The camera was designed by two engineers who had previously worked at Konishi (Konica).The Ultimate Asahi Pentax Screw Mount Guide 1952 - 1977, by Gerjan van Oosten, publ. 1999. The Asahiflex I had a non-interchangeable waist-level viewfinder, with a direct optical viewfinder for eye-level use. The Asahiflex I had a non-returning mirror and shutter speeds from 1/25 to 1/500. The camera used the M37 screw mount. It went through some minor modifications for flash use, resulting in the IA. With the IIB a key advance was made: the quick-return mirror. The problem of mirror black-out was one of the main problems with prior SLR designs, greatly reducing usability and a major reason for the greater popularity of the rangefinder. With the IIB there emerged the first practical quick-return mirror, a vital innovation and one which was quickly adopted by other manufacturers. With the final model in the series, the IIA, the Asahiflex gained slow speeds from 1/25th of a second to 1/2 of a second. * Asahiflex I (1952–1953) * Asahiflex IA (1953–1954) * Asahiflex IIB (1954–1956) * Asahiflex IIA (1955–1957)  Asahi-Pentax Series (pre Spotmatic)  A recognized problem with the Asahiflex series was that, lacking a pentaprism, it was very difficult to use the camera in a vertical position and taking pictures of moving objects was almost impossible. The small viewfinder on top of the camera was of little use when the photographer wanted to use a 135 mm or 500 mm lens. The problem was recognized by Asahi. In 1957, Asahi introduced the Pentax series, a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera (SLR) camera which was so well received that it influenced the design of 35 mm SLRs worldwide for years to come. The Pentax and its later development and likewise classic 1964 Pentax Spotmatic spurred the development of Asahi into a photographic multinational company, eventually renaming itself \\"Pentax\\" after its seminal product. The Pentax series remains pivotal in the development of modern SLR photography. There is some confusion about the etymology of the name. Most sources claim it was licensed from VEB Pentacon the East German successor to Zeiss Ikon, and is derived from the combination \\"PENTaprism\\" and \\"contAX\\", in the same way that \\"Pentacon\\" was taken from \\"PENTAprism\\" and \\"CONtax\\". It's known that the \\"Pentax\\" name was originally registered as a trademark by VEB Pentacon, duly noting that both the M42 lens mount and the first recognizably modern 35mm SLR camera, the Contax D, were products of the East German branch of Zeiss Ikon, circa 1949. There are other stories, too. The word PEN in Japanese actually means small, so you might think that this is the explanation, but it is not. In fact the name Pentax comes from a contraction of PENTAprism and AsahifleX. This was confirmed by the international sales department of Asahi Optical Co. in 1999. The Asahi Pentax of 1957 featured: * Pentaprism * Rapid-wind film advance lever. Earlier 35 mm SLRs, with the exception of Exakta's left-handed lever, and the Edixa Reflex, had knob advance. * Film rewind crank, likewise a first for 35 mm SLRs. * Instant mirror return, unique to the Pentax and its immediate predecessor, the Asahiflex IIb * Microprism focusing aids on the focus screen, unique to the Pentax Moreover, the Pentax placed controls in locations that would become standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the film rewind crank. The photographic giants Canon & Nikon, did not introduce their own SLR cameras until 1959 with the Canonflex and the F-series respectively. By contrast, the Pentax series offered these features at a relatively low price, introducing many photographers to 35 mm SLR photography. Honeywell H3V The Asahi Pentax series went through various iterations until 1964. Each successive model incorporated minor improvements, the most noticeable being the incorporation of the two shutter speed dials (one for high speeds and one for low speeds) into one. The AP of 1957 is externally almost identical to the 1964 SV.  Spotmatic Series  Spotmatic with Super-Takumar 1:1.4 50mm lens However, by the 1960s the clamour for in-camera exposure metering was rising. It was possible to attach an external CdS (Cadmium sulfide) exposure meter to the later AP-derived models, but in 1960 the next breakthrough arrived. At the 1960 photokina camera show, Asahi exhibited the Spot-matic prototype. This camera took exposure measurements, via a spotmeter, through the taking lens, an incredible innovation. The camera excited tremendous attention and in 1964 the first production Spotmatic (hyphen dropped) emerged. The Spotmatic was virtually identical to the prototype; however, the spotmeter was replaced with an all-over average-reading exposure meter in order to give more consistent results. The camera was an instant success and was snapped up by the thousands, although Asahi had been beaten into production by the Topcon RE Super which went on sale in April 1963; the Topcon failed to attract the same degree of commercial success. The Spotmatic was replaced by the Spotmatic II with many upgrades 1971 - 1976. Electro-Spotmatic with Super-Takumar 1:1.8 55mm lens In 1966 Asahi Optical had produced one million SLR cameras since the first Asahiflex of 1962. It took them only another three years, until 1969, to reach two million. This period was a time of complete pre-eminence for Asahi Optical. During the Spotmatic era Asahi were manufacturing more SLRs per month than all the other camera manufacturers combined. One of the technological highlights was the Electro-Spotmatic of 1971. This camera was one of the first to incorporate automatic exposure. The series concluded in 1973 with the introduction of the Spotmatic F (now incorporating open-aperture metering rather than the stop-down metering of the early models). Spotmatic F with SMC Takumar 1:1.4 50mm lens Shift lens, 11 mm maximum shift However, by the mid-1970s the limitations of the M42 mount were being felt. By this time most other manufacturers had opted for a bayonet lens mount. It was a great step for Asahi Optical to take but the M42 screw mount, by now widely known as 'Pentax screw mount', had reached the end of its useful life. Pentax were now to adopt the K-mount that would see them through the next 40 years.  Other prototypes  In 1960, the same year that Asahi Optical introduced the Spot- matic prototype at photokina, they also showed another SLR prototype which they called the Metalica. The Metalica gave a glimpse into the future direction of Pentax cameras; it featured a prototype bayonet lens mount, a vertical-traveling, metallic Copal-type focal plane shutter (from which the camera drew its name), and an already obsolescent coupled selenium light meter. The light meter was not TTL, but instead featured the typical large selenium mini-lens pattern on the front of the pentaprism. Otherwise the camera resembled the Spot-matic in appearance. While Asahi Optical didn't put the Metallica into production, the concepts of a bayonet lens mount and a metal focal plane shutter were already being discussed internally at the company. In 1966 Asahi Optical showed another prototype called Metalica,British Journal of Photography, 9 October 1966, page 912. sometimes referred to as Metalica II. Gone was the cumbersome selenium light meter, replaced with a now standard internal CdS meter. Like the 1960 prototype, the Metalica had a bayonet lens mount, and also featured an improved Copal-square metallic shutter. But the biggest innovation was the fully automatic shutter operation coupled to the TTL meter. The metering system, for the first time in a 35mm SLR, controlled the shutter speed automatically based on the aperture set. With these innovative developments, the Metalica pioneered features that would not surface on Pentax production cameras until the Electro-Spotmatic (ES) (automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1971 and K2 (vertical metal shutter, bayonet lens mount, automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1975. (Cecchi 1991:80-86) == K Mount cameras == K mount  K Series  A Pentax K1000 SE with a SMC 50mm f/2 lens * K2 (1975–1980) * K2 DMD (1976–1980) * KX (1975–1977) * KM (1975–1977) * K1000 (1976–1997) Three new models were introduced at once in 1975: the K2, KX and KM. What set these cameras apart from any earlier Pentax was the replacement of the M42 \\"universal\\" screw-lens mount with a proprietary bayonet mount system of its own, known as the K mount. Still the basis for Pentax lenses and cameras today, the K mount offered greater convenience and enabled the production of faster lenses such as the 50 mm .However, there were 55/1.2 M42 lenses from Tomioka/Yashica and Cosina ( shown here ). To keep M42 users in the Pentax system, an M42-K Mount adaptor was offered, enabling them to continue to use their existing lenses, albeit with the loss of automation and needing to accept \\"stop-down\\" metering, which causes the viewfinder's image to brighten or darken whenever the aperture's f/stop is changed. The K series cameras followed the design ethos of the previous Pentax Spotmatic series cameras, which were large and heavy, although rugged. But by 1975 there was already a general move to smaller 35mm cameras, led by the Olympus OM-1, so even as the K series was introduced Pentax were working on a new camera line, the M Series which started to appear in 1976. All except the K1000 therefore had short production lives as the M Series took over the Pentax mid-range. The KM, the bottom of the original range, was almost identical to the Spotmatic F except for the K mount and the top plate cosmetics. It used a rather dated and slow CdS (cadmium sulfide) photocell for metering. The KX featured a better light meter using SPD (silicon photodiodes), visible aperture and shutter speeds in the viewfinder, and a mirror lock-up mechanism. The K2, the flagship model, incorporated aperture-priority autoexposure with a fully manually selectable range of shutter speeds from 8s to 1/1000. The only other aperture priority camera Pentax had made up to this point, the ES series, only had manual shutter speeds from 1/60 upwards. A special version of the K2, the K2 DMD, was introduced in 1976 that could use a data back and motor drive (hence \\"DMD\\"), together with other enhancements that aimed it at the professional market. Also in 1976 the K1000 was introduced, being the KM stripped of its self- timer, depth of field preview and some other facilities, and aimed at the lower end of the market in which it was very successful and continued in production until 1997, helped by the fact that for many years it was the usually recommended camera for students starting photographic or art courses.  M Series  Pentax MX The M series cameras were noted for their compact size, and are among the smallest 35 mm SLRs ever made, though they are quite heavy when compared to the plastic SLRs of the 1990s. Except for the MX, all were based on the same basic camera body, and featured aperture-priority exposure automation. While superficially resembling the ME, the MX was designed as a manual-only SLR system targeted to the advanced amateur or professional photographer, and had its own set of accessories that were mostly incompatible with the other M series cameras. Conversely, the other M-series cameras were targeted squarely at casual users. None of the M-series, with the exception of the MX, featured a depth of field preview. The ME featured aperture-priority only automation with no manual override. The MX was entirely manual and resembled the earlier KX in features. The ME Super was an ME with a manual mode. The MG, MV, and MV1 were even simpler versions of the original ME. The ME-F was an early attempt at an autofocus SLR using a special 35-70mm zoom with a motor built into the lens. * ME F (1981–1988) * ME (1976–1980) * ME Super (1980–1987) * MG (1982–1985) * MV (1979–1982) * MV1 (1979–1982) * MX (1976–1985)  LX  Pentax LX with accessory grip and FA-1 finder The Pentax LX model was a tough, professional-grade competitor to the Nikon F3, the Canon New F-1, Olympus OM-2, and Contax RTS cameras. It replaced the K2 DMD as the Pentax 35mm flagship. It is rugged, weatherised and sealed against dust, yet compact and light. It has interchangeable viewfinders (more than any of its rivals) and focussing screens; the S69 screen is particularly bright. The LX uses an advanced metering system that also reads the light falling on the film and the first shutter curtain during exposure, the TTL OTF (off the film) feature, a Minolta patent, but utilised in the Olympus OM-2 in 1975. The selected aperture value and shutter speed are shown in the viewfinder. It had a large range of accessories which were mostly not interchangeable with other contemporary cameras. It remained in production for more than 20 years. * LX (1980–2001)  A Series  The A series added fully programmed exposure control (adjusting both aperture and shutter speed automatically) to the M series. To enable control of the lens aperture by the camera body, it used the new KA-mount, a backward-compatible modification that also allowed the array of standard K-mount lenses to be used in manual and aperture-priority exposure modes. The A series were the first cameras from Pentax to use LCD digital displays for exposure information in the viewfinder. The super A / super PROGRAM and the program A / program PLUS both used a translucent white window on the front of the pentaprism to provide backlight to the LCD display without having to use the battery for illumination. * super A / super PROGRAM (1983–1987) * program A / program PLUS (1984–1988) * A3/A3000 (1985–1987)  P Series  The P series featured fully programmed exposure control (in addition to manual mode), DX-code film speed setting (defaulting to 100 if the code couldn't be read), exposure lock and depth of field preview. All but the P3/P30 also offered Av mode, and the P5/P50 offered exposure compensation of ±3 EV. * P5/P50 (1986–1989) * P3/P30 (1985–1988) * P3n/P30n (1988–1990) * P30t (1990–1997)  SF Series  The SFX (called the SF1 in the US) was the world's first AF SLR with built-in TTL auto flash, which is retractable. Pentax has referred to the built-in flash as \\"RTF\\" (Retractable TTL Flash) ever since then. Pentax SAFOX I (Sensor Ability Fortifying Optical Correction System) autofocus module was integrated to these series. * SFX/SF1 (1987–1989) * SFXn/SF1n (1989–1993) * SF7/SF10 (1988–1993)  Z/Pz Series  The second generation of autofocus cameras from Pentax. They are equipped with new SAFOX II autofocus module and power contact to enable power zoom function in power zoom FA lenses. In the USA the series was called PZ, while in the rest of the world it was called Z. * Z-10 (1991) * Z-1 (1991) * Z-20 (1992) * Z-50 (1992) * Z-1P (flagship model) (1994) * Z-5P (flagship model) (1994) * Z-70 (1995)  MZ/ZX Series  A photographer holds a Pentax MZ-5n with Metz flashlight This innovative series brought the \\"small and light\\" concept back from previous generation manual focus cameras. This series known as MZ models elsewhere were named ZX models in the USA except MZ-S, the MZ-5 being known as the ZX-5 in the USA. The exception to this rule was the MZ-6 which was known as the ZX-L in the USA. Models shown on the same row are model replacements/upgrades in the range, so the MZ-10 was replaced by the MZ-7 which was subsequently replaced by the MZ-6. All members of this series are compact autofocus SLRs except the MZ-M. The flagship model in this series is the MZ-S which body materials are metal, faster film drive and higher flash sync speed. Only MZ-S and MZ-6 are compatible with newly introduced P-TTL flash system. Both models can control remote flash wirelessly by popup flash commander mode in normal or high-speed flash sync. SAFOX IV/V autofocus module are integrated into this series. Models which were also backward compatible with both the KA and K mounts: MZ-S (Flagship model) MZ-3 MZ-5 MZ-5n MZ-10 MZ-7 MZ-6/ZX-L MZ-M (manual focus version and no built in flash) Models which were backward compatible with the KA mount but not the K mount: MZ50 MZ30 MZ60  *ist Series (Film)  *ist (2003–2006) == Digital ==  MZ-D Prototype  The Pentax MZ-D, also known by its internal code name of MR-52, was a prototype digital single-lens reflex camera. It was announced at photokina in September 2000 and was demonstrated to the press at the Photo Marketing Association (PMA) show in January 2001. In October 2003, Pentax canceled the camera, stating \\"The cost of manufacturing the prototype SLR 6-megapixel digital camera meant it was not a viable product for our target market.\\"  *ist Series (Digital)  In 2003 Pentax introduced their first Digital SLR under Digital *ist series and released the first flagship model, the Pentax *ist D which uses a Sony 6 megapixel CCD. Since 2003, the *ist D is the only digital SLR that can control HS wireless P-TTL from its pop-up flash and has many advanced features for professional applications. In 2004 Pentax released the second member in the digital *ist line, the Pentax *ist DS which is the first real consumer model (retailing under US$1,000). What set Pentax D and DS DSLRs apart from the competition was the clarity and high magnification provided by their pentaprism viewfinders, a very useful feature considering the support for legacy manual focus lenses. In 2005 Pentax released the Pentax *ist DL, a model with fewer features than the D and DS with a lower price. All Pentax's digital SLRs are compatible with K-mount lenses, and M42 (42 mm screw mount) lenses (with adaptor). Due to the smaller size of the CCD, lenses have an effective field of view of 1.5 × times the same lens in 35 mm format. So, where a 50 mm lens was considered a \\"normal\\" lens on 35 mm film, that same lens on a 1.5× \\"crop factor\\" camera has the field of view of a 75 mm lens on film. This only uses the center of the lens' projected image. To address this \\"crop factor,\\" Pentax created a new series of lenses that were designed only to cover the smaller sensor. These are the DA series for their digital SLRs, which still feature the K-mount but have a smaller back-focus element designed specifically for use with the Digital SLR lineup. The DA series lenses do not have a mechanical aperture ring and so are not backward compatible with some earlier film bodies. The later D-FA lens series re-introduces a mechanical aperture ring in some lenses and these are fully compatible with both film and digital SLRs. SAFOX VIII are integrated into this camera series. * *ist D Flagship model (2003–2006) *Pentax *istD with D-BG1 *ist DS (2004–2005) * *ist DS2 (2005–2006) * *ist DL (2005–2006) * *ist DL2 (2006)  K Series (Digital)  Pentax K-5 In May 2006, Pentax announced a new line of Digital SLR cameras to replace Digital *ist series. The K100D and K110D replaced *ist DL2 and DS2, while incorporating in-body shake reduction in the K100D model. The Pentax K10D, a new flagship model in Digital K series replaced *ist D, adopted Sony 10-megapixel CCD sensor and weather-sealing construction, was announced on 14 September 2006. The K10D featured a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, aperture and shutter priority modes, and a new Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the power zoom function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG). The K100D Super was a slight upgrade to the K100D announced in June 2007. The upgrade included some features from the K10D, such as an improved shake reduction (SR) system, a dust removal system, and power contacts for SDM lenses, but which could not enable the power zoom function as the K10D. On January 23, 2008, Pentax announced the K20D and K200D, which replaced the K10D and K100D series respectively. The K20D featured a Samsung 14.6 megapixel CMOS APS-C sized sensor, a special 21 frame/s burst mode, live preview on the LCD display, and an increased sensitivity range extending to ISO 3200. The K200D adopted the 10 megapixel sensor and weather sealing of the K10D, among other improvements, while retaining the smaller body size of the K100D Super. The K-m / K2000 for US was announced on September 22, 2008 at the 2008 photokina trade show along with the DA-L series of lightweight, inexpensive lenses. On May 20, 2009, Pentax announced the K-7 as a replacement for the K20D. It introduced an updated version of the Samsung CMOS sensor, but with an entirely new compact design. Notable new features included full metal body construction, a pentaprism viewfinder covering 100% of the frame, 720p video capture, a quieter and faster shutter mechanism, and the ability to apply automatic corrections for lens distortion and lateral chromatic aberration. This flagship model uses a 77 multi-zone metering system and updated focus - SAFOX VIII+. The K-7 was available from July 2009. In September 2009 the K-x, was introduced to replace the entry level K-m / K2000 (US). A review by Imaging Resource emphasised its \\"excellent high ISO performance\\" and \\"excellent print quality\\". In September 2010 Pentax announced the K-r, a 6 frames per second 12.4 megapixel camera and the K-5, a 7 frames per second 16.3 megapixel camera. These cameras use a new, faster autofocus system, SAFOX IX. Pentax K-01 In February 2012 information about the Pentax K-01 Mirrorless camera was released. It still uses the standard K mount but lacks an optical reflex viewfinder. The K-01 quickly became one of the most controversial Pentax offerings, with criticism focusing on the innovative Marc Newson design, which many considered made the camera uncomfortable to hold, with poorly-placed controls, while acknowledging its strong image quality and low- light / high ISO performance. Within months, the retail price had dropped by 50% and after a year the model was discontinued. Pentax announced a new mid- level DSLR, the K-30, in May 2012. It has the same APS-C sensor and processor as the K-01, and is fully weather-sealed. Pentax K-30 with a Pentax DA 40mm lens XS lens In September 2012, Pentax announced the successor to the K-5, the K-5 II. It has the same APS-C sensor as the K-5, but has an improved autofocus sensor and a redesigned rear LCD with no air gap. A version of the camera without an anti-aliasing filter would be sold as the K-5 IIs. Both cameras were released in October 2012. In June 2013 Pentax announced the successors to the K-30, the K-50 and K-500. Both are mid-level DSLRs, the K-500 being a stripped-down version of the K-50, having no weather seals and less-advanced electronics. Pentax K-500 uses 4 AA batteries (rechargeable Lithium battery is optional), while Pentax K-50 uses rechargeable Lithium battery. In October 2013 Pentax launched the successor to the K-5ii and K-5iis, the Pentax K-3. The K-3 is the first DSLR to use its shake reduction system to function as an anti-aliasing filter. It has a 24.71 megapixel sensor and other improvements over the K-5 but maintains the rugged stainless steel frame and magnesium alloy body construction, complete with 92 body seals thereby rendering the camera cold-proof and water resistant. * Pentax K100D (2006–2007) * Pentax K110D (2006–2007) * Pentax K10D (2006–2008) * Pentax K10D Grand Prix (limited edition) (2007) * Pentax K100D Super (2007–2008) * Pentax K200D (2008–2009) * Pentax K20D (2008–2009) * Pentax K-m (Pentax K2000 in U.S.) (2008–2009) * Pentax K-7 (2009–2010) * Pentax K-x (2009–2011) * Pentax K-r (2010–2012) * Pentax K-5 (2010–2012) * Pentax K-01 (2012–2013) * Pentax K-30 (2012–2013) * Pentax K-5 II (2012–2014) * Pentax K-5 IIs (2012–2014) * Pentax K-50 (2013–2016) * Pentax K-500 (2013–2014) * Pentax K-3 (2013–2015) * Pentax K-S1 (2014–2016) * Pentax K-S2 (2015–present) * Pentax K-3 II (2015–2018) * Pentax K-1 (2016–2018) * Pentax K-70 (2016–present) * Pentax KP (2017–present) * Pentax K-1 II (2018–present)  Medium Format  645Z medium format camera In March 2010 Pentax announced its first medium format digital camera, the Pentax 645D. The camera has been in and out of development since 2003 and went on sale in Japan in May 2010 at RRP of ¥850,000, with supplies to the rest of the world expected to start soon after. It is targeted at professionals doing outdoor photography—camera body features very high level of airtightness. It uses a 40 megapixels, 44 mm × 33 mm CCD sensor. At the same time, a new series of lenses designated D FA 645 (featuring Weather Sealing on all such lenses) was also released. The 51.4 megapixel CMOS sensor 645Z was announced in February 2014 at the CP+ 2014 Camera and Imaging Show.  Pentax Q  Pentax Q In June 2011 Pentax announced the 'Pentax Q' mirrorless interchangeable lens camera and the 'Q-mount' lens system. It has a small, 1/2.3 inch 12.4 megapixel LED Backlit CMOS sensor. Announced in September, 2012, the Q10 has a slightly redesigned body and an improved sensor. Most features and specifications were unchanged. The launch price was also lower than that of the Original Q. In June 2013, the next generation of the Q series, the Q7, was announced. The most significant change is that the Q7 uses a larger 1/1.7 inch sensor with the same 12.4 MP resolution. The Q-S1, largely a cosmetic update of the Q7 with the same sensor size and resolution, was announced in August 2014.  Optio (Digital)  The Optio line is a series of consumer digital cameras. It is one of the earliest mass-market examples of a digital point- and-shoot camera. Full-frame format In early 2015, Ricoh announced development of a Pentax full-frame DSLR for release later in the year, and at the CP+ show in Yokohama Japan, a mockup was displayed that suggested the camera's potential specifications, including: an IR port for remote release, an anti-aliasing filter simulation mode, and an articulating rear LCD. On February 17, 2016 Ricoh unveiled the Pentax K-1 full-frame DSLR with 36MP sensor. The camera started shipping late April 2016. The updated K-1II was launched on 22 February 2018. url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K-1 == Other formats == Pentax 6 × 7 with a 75 mm shift lens. Pentax is one of the few camera manufacturers still producing medium format cameras. , there are two offerings, one in the 6×7 format—the Pentax 67 II, and one in the 6×4.5 format—Pentax 645NII. Both use 120 or 220 roll film. These cameras build on the Pentax SLR design experience. The shape of the Pentax 67 is broadly similar to a 35 mm SLR camera. By contrast, the Pentax 645 resembles other medium-format cameras by makers such as Mamiya and Bronica, which tend to be cube-shaped. Previous models include the Pentax 645 and 645N, and Pentax 6x7 and 67. Another interesting product was the tiny Auto 110 reflex system, based on the 110 pocket-instamatic film format. == See also == * List of Pentax products * List of digital camera brands * List of photographic equipment makers * History of the single-lens reflex camera * Pentax lenses ==References * Pentax Camera Bodies, Bojidar Dimitrov's Pentax K-Mount Page * Pentax Digital Cameras and Film Cameras Reviews and Specifications, PentaxForums.com * Timeline and information about all Pentax (digital) SLRs, schmickis.de (in German) * The History of Penta Prism SLR pentax-slr.com * Early ASAHI-PENTAX Collection and History, Frank Mechelhoff * Pentax SLR cameras 1952 - 2017 Poster * Pentax history milestones poster * Timeline of Pentax K-mount AF SLRs, PhotoPentax.com * Timeline of Pentax K-mount MF SLRs, PhotoPentax.com Category:SLR cameras Category:Japanese inventions ","title":"Pentax cameras"},{"id":"20221974","text":"\\"Rock n Roll Jesus\\" is the fifth single from Kid Rock's album of the same name.

Ponce was so angry over Velasco's vicious campaign attacks on his government that he resigned on his last day in office rather than preside over the inauguration of his successor. During his campaign, \\"the National Personification\\" had promised government support to the masses of urban poor, many of whom had recently migrated to Guayaquil and other major cities in search of a decent job and a place to live. Velasco's populism continued into his inaugural address, when he renounced the hated 1942 Rio Protocol. He thus came to power with the adoration of the masses, but he saddled himself with expensive commitments to the poor at a time when deficits in the state coffers were approaching a critical level. Additionally, Velasco threatened Ecuador's shaky economy with what amounted to a declaration of hostilities against Peru and the guarantors of the Rio Protocol, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. Sensing the direction of the political wind in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, Velasco magnified his anti-United States rhetoric and included leftists in his government. Meanwhile, the United States encouraged Latin American governments to break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Before long, Ecuador's widening political polarization became manifest in outbreaks of violence between leftist students and the anticommunist right. The rapidly deteriorating economic situation soon brought about a split in the velasquista coalition, however, with the left, led by Vice President Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy (who was also president of the Chamber of Deputies) openly opposing the government in July 1961. By October relations between Velasco's government and Congress had deteriorated to the point where legislators and progovernment spectators engaged in a gun battle. Although dozens of bullet holes were later found in the Chamber, no one was injured. A series of new sales taxes imposed during the same month in order to raise desperately needed revenues then sparked a general strike and a series of demonstrations and riots in several major cities. Amid growing chaos, Velasco ordered the arrest of his vice president, a move that opened him to charges of violating the constitution. On November 8, after only fourteen months in office, Velasco was ousted by the military and replaced by Vice President Arosemena, who was his constitutional successor as well as his leading opponent. ==Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy (1961 - 1963)== Arosemena's insistence on maintaining relations with Cuba, however, became a major domestic political issue in Ecuador. Political opponents labeled Arosemena a dangerous communist, and part of the military went into open rebellion in March 1962. The following month, Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Cuba, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The crisis over Cuba proved to be very costly for Arosemena, who lost not only much of his local political support, but also the self-confidence to pursue his own, independent course. Afterward, the government drifted with little leadership from the president, who allegedly indulged in frequent drinking bouts. The brief appearance of a guerrilla movement in the coastal jungle and a rash of small-scale terrorist incidents (many of which later were found to have been staged by right-wing provocateurs) also left Arosemena open to accusations of being either unable or unwilling to stop communist subversion. By early 1963, military conspiracy was again afoot. On July 11 the high command of the armed forces decided, without dissent, to depose Arosemena. ==Junta (1963 - 67)== The four-man military junta that seized power announced its intention not to return the nation to constitutional rule until the institution of basic socioeconomic reforms, which both Velasco and Arosemena had promised but never implemented. This failure by their two civilian predecessors, the junta believed, had become a source of growing frustration within the lower classes, thus making them more receptive to the lure of communism. The junta combined its reformist anticommunism with the more traditional hard-line variety. After jailing or exiling the entire leadership of the communist left, the new government reorganized the nation's two leading universities in an effort to eliminate them as sources of left-wing political activity. In July 1964, the junta decreed the Agrarian Reform Law to commemorate the first anniversary of its assumption of power. The law abolished the huasipungo system, the feudalistic land tenure arrangement widely used in the Sierra. However, the law resulted in little real improvement in the lives of the long-suffering Sierra peasants and died from lack of funding under subsequent civilian governments. Meaningful reform was precluded, in part at least, by the increasingly cumbersome process of decision making within the politically heterogeneous, plural executive. Insubordination by the air force representative on the junta led to his dismissal and arrest in November 1965; thereafter, the junta had only three members. In 1965 Ecuador also saw a dramatic drop in its revenue from banana exports and, despite generous development assistance from the United States government and the Inter-American Development Bank, the junta suddenly faced an economic crisis of major proportions. The announcement of increased taxes on imports sparked the opposition of the powerful Guayaquil Chamber of Commerce, which in March called for a general strike. Long- disgruntled student groups and labor unions were only too happy to join in the protest, which rapidly spread to other cities. On March 29, 1966, following a bloody and demoralizing attack on the Central University in Quito, the disillusioned military reformers stepped down. Transition (1966-7) The following day, a small group of civilian leaders named Clemente Yerovi Indaburu, a non- partisan banana grower who had served as minister of economy under Galo Plaza, to be provisional president. In October a popularly elected constituent assembly drafted a new constitution and elected Otto Arosemena Gómez, a cousin of Carlos Julio and a political centrist, to act as a second provisional president. During his twenty months in office, the new constitution went into effect in May 1967, and popular elections for president were held in June 1968. Incredibly, Velasco—now seventy-five years old—was voted into the presidency for the fifth time, an incredible thirty-four years after his initial victory. ==Velasco (1968 - 72)== The weakness of Velasco's mandate—he managed only a plurality of barely one-third of the popular vote in a crowded field of five candidates—foreshadowed political difficulties that plagued him during his final term. His newly formed National Velasquista Federation (Federación Nacional Velasquista—FNV) was far short of a majority in either house of Congress, and a failure to build any working coalition made for a stalemate in the legislative process. Even Velasco's own vice president, a Guayaquileño Liberal named Jorge Zavala Baquerizo, turned into a strident and vocal critic. Cabinet ministers came and went with astonishing frequency. This political impasse soon combined with the fiscal and balance-of- payments crises, which by now had become customary under the spendthrift habits and administrative mismanagement associated with each of Velasco's terms in office, to spawn a major political crisis. The turning point came on June 22, 1970, when Velasco, in an action known as an autogolpe (self-seizure of power), dismissed Congress and the Supreme Court and assumed dictatorial powers. Velasco subsequently decreed a number of necessary, though extremely unpopular, economic measures. After devaluing the sucre for the first time since 1961, he placed tight controls on foreign exchange transactions and then decreed a number of new tax measures, the most controversial of which raised import tariffs considerably. Velasco attempted to compensate for his lost prestige by baiting the United States, seizing and fining United States fishing boats found within of the Ecuadorian coast. The intensification of the \\"tuna war\\" inflamed tempers in both countries; Ecuador dismissed United States military advisers, and the United States withdrew almost all economic and military aid to Ecuador. Such nationalistic adventures were of only momentary value to Velasco, however. In 1971, amid mounting civic unrest that verified the extent of the opposition, he was forced to cancel a scheduled national plebiscite in which he hoped to replace the 1967 constitution, with the charter written under his own auspices in 1946 the Constitution, Velasco argued, made the president too weak to be effective. The president's autogolpe and his continuance in power were possible because of support from the armed forces. Velasco's key ally was his nephew and minister of defense, General Jorge Acosta Velasco, who continually reshuffled the high command in order to retain velasquistas in key posts. In the wake of a failed attempt to oust the powerful commandant of the Quito military academy in April 1971, however, Acosta himself was forced to resign his ministerial portfolio and was summarily dispatched to Madrid as ambassador. Having lost the man who was his linchpin in the armed forces and the only apparent heir to the velasquista throne, Velasco was left to the mercy of the high command. Two circumstances proved critical in persuading the military to overthrow Velasco before the scheduled completion of his term in 1972. On the one hand, the state was due very shortly to begin reaping vast revenues under a 1964 petroleum concession. On the other hand, the overwhelming favorite to win the presidency in 1972 was Asaad Bucaram Elmhalim, a former street peddler who in 1960 had seized the leadership of the CFP from Guevara Moreno and later had twice been an extremely popular mayor of Guayaquil. Both the military and the business community regarded Bucaram as dangerous and unpredictable and unfit to be president, especially at a time when unprecedented income was expected to flow into the state coffers. On February 15, 1972, four months before the scheduled elections, the military under the command of Jorge Queirolo G. once again overthrew Velasco, who was sent into his final period of exile. He was replaced by a three-man military junta headed by the Army chief of staff, General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara. ==Junta (1972 - 79)== The military regime called itself \\"nationalist and revolutionary,\\" but the well-known connections of Rodríguez Lara to the Guayaquil business community signaled disappointment for those who anticipated that he would head a progressive military regime such as was ruling in Peru at the time. It shortly became apparent that, ideologically, the General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara regime was a hybrid, reflecting a tenuous equilibrium among the widely divergent political tendencies within the Ecuadorian armed forces. Nevertheless, like the contemporary Peruvian and Brazilian regimes, the regime of Rodríguez Lara, he promised, would not be an interim government, but rather a long-term venture dedicated to introducing structural changes thought necessary to unfreeze the development process.Rudolph, James D. \\"Historical Setting\\". A Country Study: Ecuador (Dennis M. Hanratty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1989). This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain. Rodríguez Lara's regime gave early emphasis to a campaign designed in part to exert firm control over the nation's petroleum resources and in part to consolidate the government's political authority. Several former political leaders, including ex-President Otto Arosemena, were tried for corruption in connection with oil concessions granted during the 1960s. In addition, a large number of functionaries of the Velasco government, supporters of Bucaram, as well as drug traffickers, legitimate importers, and customs officials were charged with corruption and \\"illegal enrichment.\\" Although it thus assailed its major opponents from the start the military regime, however, failed to build its own civilian base of political support. Promises of a \\"meaningful agrarian reform\\" under the auspices of Minister of Agriculture Guillermo Maldonado, a dedicated reformer, were frustrated by intense opposition from traditional elites. Maldonado was eventually forced out, and by the end of Rodríguez Lara's four years in office less than 1 percent of Ecuador's cultivable land had changed hands under the reform. More notable achievements came in the areas of building infrastructure projects, such as the major oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Esmeraldas; various highway and electrification projects; and state capitalist enterprises, particularly the Ecuadorian State Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana—CEPE). The lateter corporation was founded in 1972 and grew to become the major actor in Ecuador's exploitation of its oil reserves. Oil policy was the regime's vehicle for its most forceful expression of nationalism. Minister of Natural Resources Gustavo Jarrín Ampudia presided over Ecuador's 1973 entry into the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with all its attendant prestige and economic benefits. He was also responsible for Ecuador's renegotiation of a number of oil concessions, including the key Texaco-Gulf concession in the Oriente, on terms much more favorable to the state, such as substantial increases in both the royalties paid by foreign firms and the tax rate they paid on petroleum exports. These efforts were initially successful in allowing the government to retain a larger share of Ecuador's petroleum earnings. The oil companies became increasingly disconcerted, however, when Jarrín proposed in late 1974 that the share of stock in the Texaco-Gulf subsidiary held by CEPE be increased from 25 to 51 percent. Claiming that the terms of their concessions negotiated with Jarrín had priced Ecuadorian oil beyond the world market price, the oil companies cut back drastically on their exports, at a cost to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars over the following nine months. This intense financial pressure finally led to a July 1975 announcement that taxes on the oil companies' exports were being reduced. It was thus clear that the military regime had overplayed its nationalistic oil policy, having failed to keep in mind that Ecuador was, after all, a relatively small oil producer and thus not a powerful player within OPEC. The moderation of the regime's oil policy, however, did not result in the anticipated resolution of mounting economic problems. Oil exports rose only slightly, while imports, particularly of luxury items, continued to soar, aided by a low-tariff policy that had been designed to soak up petroleum earnings, and thus control inflation. In excess of 22 percent during 1974, inflation was rapidly eroding the real value of wages within the middle class. In August, in an effort to resolve its balance-of-payments difficulties, the regime decreed a 60 percent duty on imported luxury items. The measure was condemned by the Chambers of Commerce in Quito and Guayaquil, whose constituents had grown dependent on the sale of imports, and caused, a week later, a bloody attempt led by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Raúl González Alvear, to overthrow Rodríguez Lara. Although this coup attempt failed, at a cost of twenty-two lives, on January 11, 1976, a second, bloodless coup was successful in removing Rodríguez Lara. He was replaced by a Supreme Council of Government consisting of the commanders of the three armed services: Alfredo Poveda (Navy), Luis Leoro (Air Force) and Guillermo Durán (Army). Transition Virtually the only item on the agenda of the new military triumvirate was to preside over a return of the government to constitutional, civilian rule. The bloody September 1975 coup attempt had revealed the depth of the breach in the institutional unity of the armed forces. Handing the government back to civilians, it was hoped, might remove the causes of divisions within the military, or at least make it easier to hide them from public view. The original timetable, announced in June 1976, called for a transition that was to culminate in presidential elections in February 1978. First, new government charters and electoral laws were to be drafted by appointed commissions, and then a public referendum would choose between two proposed constitutions. The transition was repeatedly slowed down, however, and in the end, instead of the less than two years originally scheduled, three years and eight months elapsed between the 1976 coup and the inauguration of a civilian president. Two reasons are commonly cited for the delay: the slowness of decision making within the Supreme Council of Government because of ongoing disagreement within the military high command and repeated maneuverings by the military government to manipulate the electoral process, thereby controlling its outcome. Like the Rodríguez Lara government, the Council was particularly interested in seeing a poor electoral performance by the CFP and, especially, preventing Bucaram from winning the presidency. The national referendum to choose the constitution was finally held on 15 January 1978. The results saw 23 percent of the voting population nullify their ballots, an action that had been advocated by the traditional right; 31 percent of the population voted in favor of a revised version of the 1945 constitution, and a plurality of 44 percent voted in favor of the newly drafted national charter. The charter was the more progressive of the two constitutions, its major reforms being the acknowledgement of a role for the state in socioeconomic development, the legalization of a worker self-managed (autogestional) sector in the economy, a unicameral legislature, no presidential re-election, and, for the first time in Ecuador, electoral suffrage for illiterates. Five candidates then campaigned for the presidency. The consistent favorite in polls was Rodrigo Borja of the social democratic Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática—ID). Because the Supreme Council of Government made sure that Bucaram was barred from running, the CFP strongman named his second in command, Jaime Roldós Aguilera, to be the party's candidate. In order to broaden the appeal of the ticket, Osvaldo Hurtado, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party (Partido Demócrata Cristiano—PDC), was tapped to be Roldós's vice presidential running mate. The traditional rightist vote was split between two candidates, and the various parties of the Marxist left coalesced to name one candidate. After a lengthy recount, the final results of the July 16 election confirmed the initial tally of a surprise victory by Roldós, with 27 percent of the national vote. Sixto Durán Ballén, candidate of a coalition of rightist parties, finished second with 24 percent. The electoral law mandated that when no candidate achieved a majority vote, a run-off election between the two top finishers be held. It was more than nine months before the second-round election took place, however. They were months of considerable political tension and doubt as to whether the transition would proceed as planned. First, widespread problems in organizing the election and in the vote count during the first round left serious doubts as to the competence and honesty of the electoral authorities. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Electoral—TSE) was, as a result, completely reorganized. Second, the government—remembering a campaign slogan calling \\"Roldós to the government, Bucaram to power\\"—was understandably dismayed with results of the first-round election. By delaying the second round, the government sought to give rightists the time to build an anti- Roldós coalition under which Durán could emerge as the second-round victor. To complicate matters further, Abdón Calderón Múñoz, a populist candidate who had won 9 percent of the vote in the first round, was murdered under circumstances implicating the government. Finally, as a further distraction during this difficult period, Velasco returned from exile to bury his wife and died in March 1979 at age eighty-six. The second round was finally held on April 29, 1979, with the Roldós-Hurtado ticket sweeping to an overwhelming 68.5 percent victory against a weak performance by Durán. Doubts persisted, however, up to the moment that the winners took office three months later, that the military would allow them to assume their duly elected offices. The size of their popular mandate and, according to political scientist John D. Martz, pressure from the administration of President Jimmy Carter in Washington made it difficult for the military to stop the \\"democratization\\" process at this late date. The military did extract as a price, in any case, unprecedented powers to name representatives to the boards of directors of major state corporations and to participate directly in the naming of the minister of defense. The outgoing government also made it clear to Roldós (who had an early campaign slogan of \\"we will not forgive, we will not forget\\") that it would not tolerate any investigation into the behavior of the military with respect to human rights. With his autonomy thus diminished, Roldós finally assumed the presidency on August 10, and thus Ecuador returned to constitutional, civilian rule after almost a decade of dictatorship. == References == Category:History of Ecuador Ecuador ","title":"History of Ecuador (1960–1990)"},{"id":"20221988","text":"Udënisht (also: Hudënisht) is a village and a former municipality in the Korçë County, southeastern Albania.

Declared surplus to RAF requirements in 1946, the early track included both the runways and perimeter track. An application was made in 1949 by the SDMCC to the Auto Cycle Union for approval of the circuit for motorcycle racing, with the result that an official track inspection took place on New Year's Day 1950. It was attended by Syd Lawton, Arthur Wheeler, Cyril Quantrill and a number of members of the SDMCC. The track certificate was granted and the first Thruxton motorcycle event took place on Easter Monday 1950, organised by the SDMCC. The Bristol Motorcycle and Light Car Club organized a race event on 4 August 1952.

Motorcycle racing continued on the bumpy wartime tarmac (which was slowly breaking) until 1965, when plans were agreed for a new track. The new layout ignored the original runways and followed the perimeter road with an added chicane and three tight corners in succession (named Campbell, Cobb and Segrave) which became referred to as the complex. In 1968 the British Automobile Racing Club took over the track and the longer circuit was used. Racing at Thruxton became famous for the endurance events for production motorcycles, and the Thruxton 500 in particular. The machines were supposed to be the same as could be bought, but most factories of the time invested in a racing team that invariably developed the motorcycles as much as possible.

Both nations are members of the Council of Europe, European Union and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ==History== Former Irish College in Paris (Present day Irish Cultural Centre) France and Ireland have a long history of relations giving the proximity between Ireland and France, there has always been migration back and forth between the two since ancient times. In 1578, the Irish College in Paris was established as a Catholic school to train Irish students. In 1689, France supported Ireland during the Williamite War to restore King James II of England to the throne. After the Treaty of Limerick, for the next hundred years, the French Army would include an Irish Brigade in its army. The Irish who fought for France (and other foreign nations) would come to be known as Wild Geese. Many Irish soldiers also traveled and served with the French in the exploration and colonization of New France. In 1796, inspired by the French Revolution, the Society of United Irishmen began an uprising against British rule in Ireland which became known as the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and was led by Irish revolutionary fighter Wolfe Tone. France supported the Irish rebellion and, in December 1796, sent its Expédition d'Irlande of 12,000 soldiers to Bantry Bay, County Cork; however, the soldiers were not able to land as there were 40,000 British troops in the area waiting for them. In August 1798, a French fleet landed in Killala Bay, County Mayo with 1,060 soldiers under the command of General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert. Irish rebels joined the French against the British but lost at the Battle of Ballinamuck in September 1798. The Irish rebels were executed while the surviving French soldiers were repatriated back to France. The aftermath of the fight became known as Bliain na bhFrancach (The Year of the French). In 1803, Napoléon Bonaparte created the Irish Legion which fought for France in the Walcheren Campaign and Peninsular War. The legion was disbanded in 1815. In 1873, Patrice de MacMahon became the first French President of Irish descent. As part of the British Empire, Irish soldiers fought in France during World War I (1914-1918) and Irish troops fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1922, the Irish Free State obtained its independence from the United Kingdom. In 1929, Ireland opened a diplomatic legation in Paris and appointed Gerald Edward O'Kelly de Gallagh et Tycooly as the first Irish Minister to France. In 1930, France opened its first diplomatic legation in Dublin. During World War II (1939-1945) Ireland remained officially neutral. Approximately 50 Irish men and women joined the French Resistance, such as Irish writer Samuel Beckett. After the war, both nations upgraded their diplomatic legations to embassies. In 1969, French President Charles de Gaulle paid an official visit to Ireland and met with Irish President Éamon de Valera. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, relations between France and Ireland have been close and both nations have worked together within the European Union. France is Ireland's fourth largest tourism market. 9,000 French citizens reside in Ireland and 15,000 Irish citizens reside in France. Ireland is an observer member of La Francophonie. ==High-level visits== Presidential visits from France to Ireland * President Charles de Gaulle (1969) * President François Mitterrand (1984, 1988) * President Jacques Chirac (2000) * President Nicolas Sarkozy (2008) * President François Hollande (2016) Presidential and Prime Ministerial (Taoiseach) visits from Ireland to France * President Patrick Hillery (1985, 1986, 1988) * President Mary Robinson (1996) * President Mary McAleese (2005) * President Michael D.

France's main exports to Ireland include chemical based products and pharmaceuticals products. Ireland's main exports to France are pharmaceuticals products. In 2015, French investments in Ireland totaled 17 billion Euros with 350 French companies operating in Ireland.

It is sometimes called kali. ==Etymology== The word \\"sherbet\\" is from Turkish ', which is from Persian , which in turn comes from \\"sharbat\\", Arabic sharbah, a drink, from \\"shariba\\" to drink. Also called \\"sorbet\\", which comes from French \\"sorbet\\", from Italian \\"sorbetto\\" and in turn from Turkish \\"şerbet\\". The word is cognate to syrup in English. Historically it was a cool effervescent or iced fruit soft drink. The meaning, spelling and pronunciation have fractured between different countries. It is usually spelled \\"sherbet\\", but a common south of England pronunciation, using the intrusive 'r' changes this to \\"sherbert\\". It is not to be confused with the North American \\"sherbet\\", which is a variant of the iced dessert sorbet. ==History== Brausepulver is similar, usually mixed in water. Beginning with the 19th century sherbet powder (soda powder) became popular.Brausepulver in Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1895) \\"Put a spoonful of the powder in a cup of water, mix it and drink it as soon as possible, during the time of sparkling. ... Because this way the most of acid of air is lost ... it is more practicable to put the powder into the mouth and flush it with some water.\\" 2 g of sodium bicarbonate and 1.5 g of tartaric acid were separately packed in little coloured paper bags. Sherbet used to be stirred into various beverages to make effervescing drinks, in a similar way to making lemonade from lemonade powders, before canned carbonated drinks became ubiquitous. Sherbet is now used to mean this powder sold as a sweet. (In the United States, it would be somewhat comparable to the powder in Pixy Stix or Fun Dip, though having the fizzy quality of effervescing candy, such as Pop Rocks.) ==Ingredients== Sherbet in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries is a fizzy powder, containing sugar and flavouring, and an edible acid and base. The acid may be tartaric, citric or malic acid, and the base may be sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, or a mixture of these and/or other similar carbonates . To mask the unappetising flavour of the reactive powders, a large amount of sugar is added, as well as icing sugar and fruit or cream soda flavouring. The acid-carbonate reaction occurs upon presence of moisture (juice/saliva), becoming \\"fizzy\\". ==Products== Sherbet can be sold by itself or used as a decorative agent on other sweets. The measured qualities of sherbet include granularity, colour, \\"zing\\" (acidity) and flavouring (normally a citrus fruit). Sherbet lemon The sherbet lemon is a popular sweet in the UK, and is included in many sweet shops. It is the main flavour of boiled sweets with powdered sherbet centres – such as sherbet fruits, where sherbet limes, strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and orange are popular flavours. The sherbet lemon has a citrus taste and is sour and tangy. The sherbet in the middle explodes, making the sweet suddenly more sour.Slater, Nigel: Eating for England: the delights and curiosities of the British at table, London: Fourth Estate 2007, , p. 124. In the Harry Potter series, the character, Albus Dumbledore has a particular fondness for sherbet lemons, and the name of the sweet was used as a passphrase to access his office. Sherbet Fountain Traditional version of Barratt's Sherbet Fountain Barratt's \\"Sherbet Fountain\\" consists of sherbet and a stick made from liquorice, and has been sold since 1925. The original concept of the Sherbert Fountain was sold to Barratt's by Henry Edward Brunt and was rebranded under their name. In the traditional paper packaging, the top of the stick was intended to be bitten off to form a straw and the sherbet sucked through it, where it fizzes and dissolves on the tongue. The \\"new\\" format only includes a solid liquorice stick, so the sherbet must be licked off that, or eaten directly. This method of consumption was also considered acceptable with the original packaging. This is advertised on the packet as \\"Sherbet with a liquorice dip\\". Fruit flavoured with lollipop Sherbet dips or Sherbet Dabs are also popular, such as the Dip Dab by Barratt. They consist of a small packet of sherbet, with a lollipop sealed into the bag. Once the lollipop has been licked, it can be dipped into the sherbet and then sucked clean, alternatively it can simply be used to shovel the sherbet into the mouth. Flying saucers Invented by the Antwerp-based company Belgica, Flying saucers are small dimpled discs of edible coloured paper (rice paper), typically filled with white unflavoured sherbet (the same form as in Sherbet Fountains). The first flying saucers were produced in the 1950s. ==Slang== Sherbet has been used in parts of both the UK and Australia as slang for an alcoholic drink, especially beer. This use is noted in a slang dictionary as early as 1890, and still appears in list of slang terms written today (especially lists of Australian slang). \\"We're heading to the pub for a few sherbets.\\" – ... pints of beer.\\" ==See also== * Sharbat (Middle Eastern drink) * Italian ice * Sorbet * Pixy Stix – a popular brand of dextrose-rich sherbet powder manufactured by The Willy Wonka Candy Company * Fun Dip - another Wonka powder, in a different format * Swizzels Matlow – notable manufacturer of sherbet products ==References * Of the Street Sale of Ginger-Beer, Sherbet, Lemonade,&C.;, from London Labour and the London Poor, Volume 1, Henry Mayhew, 1851; subsequent pages cover the costs and income of street sherbet sellers. * Tangerine Confectionery homepage * Instructions to make sherbet Category:Candy Category:British confectionery ","title":"Sherbet (powder)"},{"id":"20222181","text":"The German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (Deutsche Stiftung für Internationale Rechtliche Zusammenarbeit e.V. or IRZ) was set up in 1992 on the initiative of the German Federal Minister of Justice, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, as a registered non-profit association. Its headquarters are in Bonn, with an additional office in Berlin. == Tasks == The IRZ works with institutions involved in legal and judicial reform in almost 30 partner states. This cooperation covers the states of Eastern and South-East Europe, the MENA region and the South Caucasus, central Asia and Vietnam. Within the framework of providing advice on legislation, the IRZ organises expert discussions, helps with the development of draft legislation and promotes the continued training and education of law professionals from all kinds of disciplines. To this end, seminars, workshops and conferences are organised in the relevant partner states. The main focus here is on national legal reforms and German and European law. Working visits, work placements and job shadowing are also made available in Germany for training and education purposes, allowing a direct, practice-oriented exchange of experiences with German experts. The IRZ also does everything it can to support law students by working with universities, providing supplementary studies, seminars and lectures. The IRZ is supported and assisted by its members and the board of trustees. These include personalities from the worlds of politics, business, management, academia and legal associations and companies. The IRZ can also rely on support from numerous other experienced experts from a wide variety of specialist areas of the law. This means that the IRZ can guarantee specialist expert advice and non-bureaucratic, fast, flexible and coordinated support over the long term for its partner states. == Objectives == Together with its partners, the IRZ develops and consolidates: * Rule-of-law, democratic constitutional structures within the framework of the European approach to human rights * An independent, operational judiciary including all the foundations for procedural law * The private and commercial legal foundations for private law activities and business transactions * The public law framework conditions for corporate activities * The harmonisation of national legal systems with European law * International legal assistance and cooperation in civil and criminal cases * European standards, in particular for protecting human rights in criminal law, criminal procedural law and penitentiary law == Contracting authority == The IRZ is commissioned by the German Federal Government and is therefore primarily financed by the budget of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection and by project funding from the German Federal Foreign Office.

It has applications including as compact antennas, particularly in cellular phones. Variant 6 steps of a Sierpinski carpet Self-affine fractal built from a grid Box fractal also refers to various iterated fractals created by a square or rectangular grid with various boxes removed or absent and, at each iteration, those present and/or those absent have the previous image scaled down and drawn within them. The Sierpinski triangle may be approximated by a box fractal with one corner removed. The Sierpinski carpet is a box fractal with the middle square removed. ==Construction== The basic square is decomposed into nine smaller squares in the 3-by-3 grid. The four squares at the corners and the middle square are left, the other squares being removed. The process is repeated recursively for each of the five remaining subsquares. The Vicsek fractal is the set obtained at the limit of this procedure. The Hausdorff dimension of this fractal is \\\\textstyle{\\\\frac {\\\\log(5)} {\\\\log(3)}} ≈ 1.46497. An alternative construction (shown below in the left image) is to remove the four corner squares and leave the middle square and the squares above, below, left and right of it. The two constructions produce identical limiting curves, but one is rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the other. File:Box fractal2.pngSelf-similarities I -- removing corner squares.

Anticross-stitch curve, iterations 0-4 Cross-stitch island Approximation by the chaos game where the jump=2/3 randomly towards either the center or one of the vertices of a square ==Properties== The Vicsek fractal has the surprising property that it has zero area yet an infinite perimeter, due to its non-integer dimension. At each iteration, four squares are removed for every five retained, meaning that at iteration n the area is \\\\textstyle{(\\\\frac{5}{9})^n} (assuming an initial square of side length 1). When n approached infinity, the area approaches zero. The perimeter however is \\\\textstyle{4(\\\\frac{5}{3})^n}, because each side is divided into three parts and the center one is replaced with three sides, yielding an increase of three to five. The perimeter approaches infinity as n increases. The boundary of the Vicsek fractal is the Type 1 quadratic Koch curve. ==Analogues in higher dimensions== Animation of the 3D analogue of the Vicsek fractal (third iteration) There is a three-dimensional analogue of the Vicsek fractal. It is constructed by subdividing each cube into 27 smaller ones, and removing all but the \\"center cross\\", the central cube and the six cubes touching the center of each face. Its Hausdorff dimension is \\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{\\\\log(7)}{\\\\log(3)}} ≈ 1.7712. Similarly to the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal, this figure has zero volume. Each iteration removes retains 7 cubes for every 27, meaning a volume of \\\\textstyle{(\\\\frac{7}{27})^n} at iteration n, which approaches zero as n approaches infinity.

The first Finnish immigrants arrived to Argentina in 1906 and founded Colonia Finlandes in the vicinity of the town of Oberá, Misiones Province. In May 1918, Finland regained its Independence from Russia after the Finnish Civil War. Argentina recognized the independence of Finland on 11 May 1918, becoming the first nation outside of Europe to do so. Soon afterwards, both nations established diplomatic relations and Finland opened a consulate in Buenos Aires. In 1923, Argentina accredited an ambassador to Finland from its embassy in Warsaw, Poland while Finland accredited an ambassador to Argentina from its embassy in Madrid, Spain. In 1929, Finland opened a resident embassy in Buenos Aires, becoming its first embassy in Latin America. During World War II, Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union which triggered the Winter War. Argentina supported Finland diplomatically during the war and asked the League of Nations to expel the Soviet Union from the group for its aggression against Finland. During the war, Finland continued to maintain a resident embassy in Buenos Aires. Soon after the war, in January 1946, Finnish ships began arriving again to Argentina with Finnish made products. In 1997, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari paid an official visit to Argentina, becoming the first high-level Finnish politician to visit the country. In 1998, Argentine President Carlos Menem paid an official visit to Finland. In 2007, UPM, a Finnish pulp company, opened a mill in Fray Bentos, Uruguay just across the river from Argentina. During the construction of the mill, Argentina filed a complaint against the company and the Uruguayan government stating possible pollution of the river by the mill. The Uruguay River is shared by the two countries and is protected by a treaty, which requires both parties to inform the other of any project that might affect the river. Besides the issue of pollution, Argentina claimed that the Uruguayan government had not asked for permission to build the mill. This diplomatic incident became known as the Uruguay River pulp mill dispute. The dispute was brought before the International Court of Justice which said that Uruguay had breached its procedural obligations to inform Argentina of its plans but had not violated its environmental obligations under the treaty and therefore the Finnish mill could continue operations.Argentina and Uruguay settle seven-year pulp mill row In October 2016, Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipilä paid a visit to Argentina.

The station was formerly the terminus of a branch line from Aberdeen.British Railways Atlas.1947. p.38 It was the nearest station to Balmoral Castle, a personal residence of the British monarch. ==History== Opened on 17 October 1866 by the Aboyne and Braemar Railway this was the third of a series of openings (Aboyne to Ballater), by three different companies to connect Ballater with Aberdeen, the others were Aboyne to Banchory by the Deeside Extension Railway and Banchory to Aberdeen by the Deeside Railway. All three sections of the branch were operated by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) and in 1876 they were all acquired by it. The GNSR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the Scottish Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1937 to 1939. The station closed for passengers on 28 February 1966 and for goods on 18 July 1966. ==Royal events== In August 1912, Ballater railway station played an important role when the body of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, the son-in-law of King Edward VII, was transferred to Mar Lodge, Braemar, from St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. On 9 August 1912 the Glasgow Herald reported on the funeral: Ballater Station was the location of an infamous event on 23 September 1936. On this day, King Edward VIII was due to open a new hospital in Aberdeen; however, he sent the then Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) in his place, citing that he was unable to attend as the Court was still in mourning. This was a foil. Edward VIII was seen at precisely the same time as the Yorks' opened the hospital, meeting Mrs Wallis Simpson off a train at Ballater Station. Mrs Simpson at the time was the mistress of Edward VIII though this fact was relatively unknown to the British public at this time owing to a 'silence' in the British press. Mrs Simpson was the King's special guest at Balmoral.King Edward VIII, by Philip Ziegler, Kindle Edition, retrieved 2015. ==ServicesUse following closure== The old station, containing Queen Victoria's waiting room, was a visitor centre with a replica royal carriage. The former station site is the western trailhead of the Deeside Way, a long-distance footpath that follows the length of the former railway to Aberdeen. ==Fire== In the early hours of 12 May 2015, fire crews were called out to a major blaze at the station. The fire was fought for around three hours but reports say the building was \\"around 90 percent destroyed\\". The fire is believed to have started in the Station Restaurant, one of several businesses at the station. The building has subsequently been restored and reopened. ==See also== *Royal Deeside Line ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== *Film of the station and the Deeside line. * Station on navigable O.S. map Category:Disused railway stations in Aberdeenshire Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1866 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Beeching closures in Scotland Category:Former Great North of Scotland Railway stations Category:1966 disestablishments in Scotland Category:1866 establishments in Scotland Category:Ballater ","title":"Ballater railway station"},{"id":"20222285","text":"Cymbiola magnifica, common name the magnificent volute, is a species of large sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Volutidae, the volutes. ==References External links == * Cymbiola magnifica (Gebauer, 1802) Category:Volutidae Category:Gastropods described in 1802 ","title":"Cymbiola magnifica"},{"id":"20222289","text":"The drug combination clindamycin/tretinoin is a topical acne treatment.

Both nations were host to great indigenous cultures; the Aztecs and Mayas in Mexico and the Muiscas and Incas in Colombia.

Colombia has for many years been known as one of the biggest producers of drugs and for having notorious cartels. Mexico was traditionally a transit country for Colombia drugs to pass through en route to the United States (the largest demand market for drug consumption). However, Mexico has also become increasingly involved in drug production itself and many Mexican drug cartels have increasingly partnered with Colombian cartels in transiting drugs to other markets globally. Both the Colombian and Mexican government have increasingly worked together to combat the cartels and have hired advisers from each other nations to practice successful tactics in each other's nations respectively.Oscar Naranjo, Legendary Colombia Police Chief, Heads To Mexico As Advisor On Fighting Drug Trafficking Colombia and Mexico are two of the four founding members of the Pacific Alliance (the others being Chile and Peru).

Set in Kenya just after independence, the story follows four characters – Munira, Abdulla, Wanja, and Karega – whose lives are intertwined due to the Mau Mau rebellion. In order to escape city life, each retreats to the small, pastoral village of Ilmorog. As the novel progresses, the characters deal with the repercussions of the Mau Mau rebellion as well as with a new, rapidly westernizing Kenya. The novel largely deals with the scepticism of change after Kenya's liberation from the British Empire, questioning to what extent free Kenya merely emulates, and subsequently perpetuates, the oppression found during its time as a colony. Other themes include the challenges of capitalism, politics, and the effects of westernization. Education, schools, and the Mau Mau rebellion are also used to unite the characters, who share a common history with one another. ==Background== Petals of Blood was Ngugi's first novel written whilst not in full-time education, instead written over a five-year period. Initially begun whilst teaching at Northwestern University in 1970, the writer continued to work on the novel after his return to Kenya, finally finishing the novel in Yalta as a guest of the Soviet Writers' Union. Ngugi was inspired to write the novel as a way of synthesizing the notion of a postcolonial nation, and a willingness to portray the agents of social change present in Kenya's change from British East Africa. Petals of Blood was the last of Ngugi's novels to be written first in English. On 30 December 1977, shortly after the release of his play \\"I Will Marry When I Want,\\" Ngugi was taken into custody by law enforcement officials and held without charges for questioning. According to Patrick Williams, Ngugi was often criticized by detractors for \\"dragging politics into art.\\" Despite the political tone to his novels, including Petals of Blood, Ngugi had avoided government interference until deciding to write in his native Gikuyu. After the release of Petals of Blood, Ngugi wrote and began work on a Gikuyu language play called 'Ngaahika Ndeenda' (I Will Marry When I Want). He was then arrested and detained on 30 December 1977, for crimes relating to his \\"literary-political\\" background. After this period, all of his novels would be written first in Gikuyu and later translated into English, a move understood to be a conscious decision to focus more strongly on the peasant workers of Kenya as inspiration for his novels. ==Plot summary== Modern day map of Kenya The book begins by describing the four main characters – Munira, Karega, Wanja, and Abdulla – just after the revelation that three prominent Kenyans, two businessmen and one educator, have been killed in a fire. The next chapter moves back in the novel's timeline, focusing on Munira's move to Ilmorog, to begin work as a teacher. He is initially met with suspicion and poor classroom attendance, as the villagers think he will give up on the village soon, in much the same way previous teachers have done. However, Munira stays and, with the friendship of Abdulla, another immigrant to Ilmorog who owns a small shop and bar, carves out life as a teacher. Soon Wanja arrives, the granddaughter of the town's oldest and most revered lady. She is attractive, experienced barmaid whom Munira begins to fall in love with, despite the fact he is already married. She too is escaping the city and begins to work for Abdullah, quickly reshaping his shop, and expanding its bar. Karega arrives in Ilmorog to seek Munira to question him about their old school Syriana. After a brief relationship with Munira, Wanja once again grows disillusioned and leaves Ilmorog. The year of her departure is not good for the village as the weather is harsh and no rain comes, making for a poor harvest. In an attempt to enact changes, the villagers are inspired by Karega to journey to Nairobi in order to talk to their Member of Parliament. The journey is very arduous and Joseph, a boy that Abdullah had taken in as his brother and who had worked in his shop, becomes ill. When they arrive in Nairobi, the villagers seek help from every quarter. They are turned away by a reverend who thinks they are merely beggars, despite their pleas of help for the sick child. Trying at another house, some of the villagers are rounded up and forced into the building where they are questioned by Kimeria, a ruthless businessman who reveals that he and their MP are in league with one another. He blackmails Wanja and subsequently rapes her. Upon arriving in Nairobi and speaking to their MP, the villagers realise that nothing will change, as he is little more than a demagogue. However, they do meet a lawyer who wishes to help them and others in the same predicament and through a court case highlights Ilmorog's plight. This draws attention from national press and donations and charities pour into Ilmorog. Finally, the rains come, and the villagers celebrate with ancient rituals and dances. During this time, Karega starts a correspondence with the lawyer that he met in Nairobi, wishing to educate himself further. To celebrate the rain's coming, Nyakinyua brews a drink from the Thang'eta plant, which all of the villagers drink. Karega tells the story of the love between him and Mukami, the older sister of Munira. Mukami's father looked down on Karega because of his brother's involvement with the Mau Mau. Forced to separate, Mariamu and Karega do not see each other again, and Mukami later commits suicide by jumping into a quarry. This is the first time Munira hears the story. Later, an unknown plane crashes in the village; the only victim is Abdulla's donkey. Wanja notices that there are several large groups of people who come to survey the wreckage, and suggests to Abdulla that they begin to sell the Thang'eta drink in Abdulla's bar. The drink attracts notoriety, and many people come to the bar in order to sample it. Out of fury for Karega's connection to his family and jealousy of his relationship with Wanja, Munira schemes to have Karega fired from his teaching post with the school. Karega then leaves Ilmorog. Development arrives in Ilmorog as the government begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages change into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it to ensure that they own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her attempt to rekindle their romance but is met with only demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi. Explanation of the novel's title The title Petals of Blood is derived from a line of Derek Walcott's poem 'The Swamp'. The poem suggests that there is a deadly power within nature that must be respected despite attempts to suggest by humans that they live harmoniously with it. Originally called 'Ballad of a Barmaid', it is unclear why Ngugi changed the title before release. The phrase \\"petals of blood\\" appears several times throughout the novel, with varying associations and meanings. Initially, \\"petals of blood\\" is first used by a pupil in Munira's class to describe a flower. Munira quickly chastises the boy, saying that 'there is no colour called blood'. Later, the phrase is used to describe flames, as well relating to virginity during one of Munira's sexual fantasies. ==Characters== *Munira – schoolteacher who goes to Ilmorog in order to teach in its dilapidated school. He falls in love with Wanja and is the arsonist the police seek. *Wanja – Granddaughter of Nyakinyua. As experienced barmaid who flees her past in the city. She falls in love with Karega, although she is still coveted by Munira. She also sleeps with Abdulla because of her reverence for his actions in the Mau Mau rebellion. An industrious barmaid, she helps Abdulla's shop to become successful, and also sells Theng'eta. She later becomes a prostitute and runs her own brothel before being injured in Munira's arson attack. *Abdulla – A shopkeeper who lost his leg in the Mau Mau rebellion. His main assets in life are his shop and his donkey, as well as a boy Joseph, who he had taken in and cares for as a brother. He is the only major character to have worked with the Mau Mau during the rebellion. *Karega – Young man who works as a teaching assistant at Munira's school before becoming disillusioned and heading for the city. After the trip to Nairobi, he becomes enamoured with socialism, and starts to educate himself on its principles and on the law. However, he later becomes disillusioned with the effects of education, and how apt it is in the struggle for liberation. As a youth, he dated Munira's sister who subsequently committed suicide; this was unknown to Munira until Karega reveals it to him and to others after having drunk Theng'eta. *Nyakinyua – The village's most revered woman, and the grandmother of Wanja. She performs all of the traditional ceremonies in the village. At first she is highly sceptical of Munira's arrival, believing that he will flee the village like his predecessors. After her death, Wanja sells her business to save Nyakinyua's land from the banks and also uses the proceeds to start a brothel. *Kimeria – Ruthless businessman who is part of the new Kenya elite. Has an interest in Ilmorog for business purposes, and had a previous relationship with Wanja. As the villagers travel to Nairobi to meet with their politician, Kimeria holds Wanja hostage and rapes her. *Chui – a schoolboy at the prestigious, previously European Siriana school, he leads a student revolt. However, when he returns to lead the school, he enacts an oppression far greater than was present during colonial rule. He later become one of the new Kenya elite, and is involved in business dealings with both Kimeria and Nderi wa Riera. *Nderi wa Riera – the local politician for Ilmorog's district, he lives and works in Nairobi. He is a demagogue who does not listen to the appeals of the villagers when they meet him. Rather, he is interested in Ilmorog merely for business, and is in league with Kimeria. With Kimeria and Chui, he is a director of the widely successful Theng'eta Breweries. ==Major Themes== Corruption One primary underlining theme in Petals of Blood is the failure of the ruling Kenyan elite to adequately meet the needs of the people. After the new postcolonial governments come to power, the leaders maintain their connections with the outgoing colonizers, thus marginalizing the everyman. In the novel, the elite are portrayed as both government officials and businessmen who violate the villagers of Ilmorog in both passive and aggressive ways. The corrupt system acts like a chain—in the novel, when the government's lawyers declare that they have solved the murder cases, the people of Ilmorog realize that as long as the corrupt system stays in place and continues churning out corrupt individuals, there will be no change. Ngugi makes the dichotomy between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most visible in the speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them to make the trip to Nairobi. She says, \\"I think we should go. It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share\\" (pp. 115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja. Capitalism Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, with the new Kenyan elite portrayed as controlled by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked to the success of their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'. Cities are portrayed as places where capitalism flourishes and are contrasted strongly with the village of Ilmorog. In its pursuit for the modern, Kenya adopts capitalism at the expense of tradition as the city begins 'to encroach upon and finally swallow the traditional and the rural.' As time progresses, Ilmorog changes vastly, as do its inhabitants. With its modernization, influenced greatly by capitalism and the chance to increase trade, Munira reflects on these changes and how they link with capitalism, saying that 'it was New Kenya. It was New Ilmorog. Nothing was free.' Land Agriculture is an important theme in Petals of Blood, most notably in the town of Ilmorog, an isolated, pastoral community. After modernization, the farmers lands are fenced off and ultimately seized when they cannot repay their loans. Although none of the main characters lose their land in this way (Wanja, however, sells her family's plot), it is significant in that Kenya recreates what happened during colonial rule: the loss of land and subsequent desire to reclaim it was \\"the central claim\\" for those who rebelled against the settlers. The notion of land and fertilisation is often linked to Wanja, who is seen as the embodiment of these concepts. As she is portrayed as \\"the symbol of the nation\\", the loss of her land to the new Kenyan elite is an important parallel with Ngugi's depiction of Kenya. Land is also linked to Kenya itself, with Ngugi suggesting that anyone who sells their land is a traitor. Education Education is often depicted cynically in Petals of Blood. Munira is a teacher, but lacks strong abilities to guide his pupils, instead preferring to stand back and not to assert any of his own beliefs. He rejects the claims of others that the children should be taught more about being African, instead preferring that they be taught politics, and things which are \\"fact\\". Two of the three \\"betrayers of the people\\", those who are ultimately murdered, are also educators; they are untrustworthy, and depict the education system as a \\"problematic institution\\" in independent Kenya. Although there is a brief suggestion that education does provide hope, as Joseph succeeds academically at Siriana, it the education system as a whole which is criticized. The notion of education as self- liberating is critiqued, as Joseph's success is still within the Siriana school, previously a bastion of \\"European\\" education. In a more political sense, Karega's self-education causes him to doubt his initial belief that education was a tool to gain liberation; originally taken in by the lawyer's socialist rhetoric, Karega's dealings with education ultimately leave him disillusioned. ==Style== Petals of Blood relies heavily on flashbacks, using the points of view of the four major characters to piece together previous events. As each character is questioned by the police, the novel takes on certain characteristics of the detective novel, with a police officer trying to ascertain details of their pasts in order to find the murderer of Chui, Kimeria, and Mzigo. The flashbacks also encompass several different timeframes. The present day action takes place over the course of 10 days; the past events take places over 12 years. Ngugi also discusses Kenya's past, going as far back as 1896, when Kenya was \\"annexed\\" by the British. The narrative voice shifts between Munira and the other characters describing the events of their lives, and an omniscient narrator. There is also a suggestion of a communal narrative voice, as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial. This communal voice is at work through the various Gikuyu songs with which Ngugi intersperses the novel; there is a great reliance placed on such songs, which help tell, through the oral tradition of linking of proverbs and fables, the history of Ilmorog and Kenya before colonial intervention. ==Reception== Petals of Blood caused a stronger critical reaction than Ngugi's previous novels. The use of the past and historical memory is far more widespread in the novel due largely to the use of flashbacks, and questions relating to the past \\"from the central concerns\\" of the novel. The strong political motif that runs throughout the novel has also been discussed, focusing on the relation of political ideas to the Petals of Blood's wider framework: Ngugi was lauded for his \\"successful marriage\\" of political content and artistic form. During the 1980s the novel was adapted by Mary Benson into a two-hour-long radio play starring Joe Marcel by BBC Radio 3. Ngugi was criticised however for his stylistic form in Petals of Blood. It was suggested that the social realism of the novel did not accurately represent or complement the socialist ideals put forth. John Updike suggested that Ngugi's desire to permeate the plot with political ideas detracts from his writing.

It was Shaw's last completed dramatic work. The play runs for 10 minutes in performance and comprises a comic argument between Shaw and Shakespeare, with the two playwrights bickering about who is the better writer as a form of intellectual equivalent of Punch and Judy. ==Origin== The play was written by Shaw for the Lanchester Marionettes who were based in their own theatre in Foley House, Malvern, Worcestershire, England. The company's founders, Waldo and Muriel Lanchester, performed regularly in the Malvern Festival. Shaw, having seen their performances over the years, wrote Shakes versus Shav for the company in 1949. The play was the last expression of Shaw's long-standing \\"debate\\" with Shakespeare and critique of what he called bardolatry. He had earlier portrayed Shakespeare in his skit The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.O Sullivan, Maurice J., Shakespeare's Other Lives, Mcfarland, 2005, p.92. Archibald Henderson points out that the play draws on a long tradition of satirical sketches comparing Shaw to Shakespeare, dating back to 1905, when a play by J. B. Fagan with the very similar title Shakespeare vs. Shaw was produced at the Haymarket Theatre. This sketch was in the form of a court case in which Shakespeare sues Shaw following a lecture Shaw had given earlier in the year in which he had said that Shakespeare was a \\"narrow minded middle class man\\" with \\"no religion, no politics, no great concerns\\". Shaw often participated in these skits, by lending costumes, or even writing dialogue for one entitled His Wild Oat (1926). The ghosts of Shakespeare and Shaw also appear in Back to G.B.S.; or A Midsummer Nightmare (1932), a fantasia set in the year 2156, when the two playwrights have become confused with each other. Another, Bernard Shaw Arrives: A Fantasy in One Act was a parody of Don Juan in Hell in which Shaw, Shakespeare and Mephistopheles engage in a debate.Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century, Appleton- Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.720ff. ==Characters== *William Shakespeare *George Bernard Shaw *Macbeth *Rob Roy *Captain Shotover *Miss Ellie Dunn ==Plot summary== Millais' The North-West Passage William Shakespeare arrives in Malvern, seeking the upstart Shaw, quoting lines from his own plays. Shaw appears and Shakespeare punches him to the ground. He starts to count him out, but Shaw leaps up and punches Shakespeare to the ground. Shakespeare bounds back too. They start to argue. Shaw claims that Macbeth has been bettered by Scott's novel Rob Roy, and \\"proves\\" the point by staging a fight between the ghosts of the two Scots, which Rob Roy wins. Shaw then asserts that Adam Lindsay Gordon has outdone Shakespeare's verse, quoting the lines \\"The beetle booms adown the glooms/And bumps among the clumps\\" (in fact a garbled version of lines by James Whitcomb Riley). Shakespeare laughs at this. He tells Shaw that he could never have written Hamlet or King Lear. Shaw replies that Shakespeare could not have written Heartbreak House, and creates a pastiche of his own play with the characters posed in imitation of John Everett Millais' painting The North-West Passage. Shakespeare defends the emotional power of his work. Shaw defends the practical value of his. Shaw ends by quoting Shakespeare's own words and bringing into being a small light to symbolise his own reputation. Shakespeare puts out the light and the play ends. == Puppets == Waldo Lanchester carved the six marionettes (heads were carved by Jack Whitehead) and Muriel costumed them, having sought advice from Scotland on the correct tartans for Macbeth and Rob Roy. The Shaw puppet is now housed in the George Bernard Shaw Museum, Shaw's Corner, at Ayot St Lawrence, the Shakespeare puppet is in the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and the other four puppets - Macbeth, Rob Roy, Captain Shotover and Ellie Dunn - are in the Staffordshire County MuseumAccession numbers: 2007.022.0178 (MacBeth); 2007.22.0179 (Rob Roy); 2007.22.0180 (Captain Shotover); 2007.22.0181 (Ellie Dunn) at Shugborough Hall. ==Productions== In the original production the dialogue was pre-recorded by actors, and broadcast during the performance. The Lanchesters had to synchronise the puppetry with the recording. Lewis Casson voiced Shakespeare, and Ernest Thesiger was Shaw. Russell Thorndike and Archie Duncan voiced Macbeth and Rob Roy respectively. Cecil Trouncer and Isabel Dean voiced Shotover and Ellie. In 2007 the play was revived by Henry Bell at the Orange Tree Theatre with Dudley Hinton and John Paul Connelly playing the two principal parts written for puppets.

While the business was bought out and then collapsed in the second half of the twentieth century, the brand has been revived by a contemporary distribution network. == Biography == Jean- Louis-Félix Potin was born in 1820 in Arpajon, in what is today the Île-de- France region surrounding Paris. He died in 1871. == The business ==  History  Félix Potin opened his first shop at 28 rue Coquenard in Paris in 1844, at the age of just 24. This was followed by numerous other branches operating under the same name. In 1860, he opened the first two-level, large- area retailer on the Boulevard de Sébastopol in Paris. The following year he constructed a Félix Potin factory in La Villette, in the northern outskirts of Paris. The Félix Potin network experienced remarkable success during the late Second Empire and early Third Republic. In 1864 he expanded the Villette factory and opened a boutique on the Boulevard Malesherbes. In 1870 he started a home-delivery service. The business continued to grow after its founder's death, with a second factory in 1880 and a second large shop on Rue de Rennes in 1904. Félix Potin factories employed 1,800 workers in 1906, growing to 8,000 by 1927. By 1923, the Félix Potin name counted 70 branches, 10 factories, 5 wine stores and 650 horses. The business survived in more or less the same form until 1956, when the 1,200 shops became minimarkets, which were bought out by Greek-French entrepreneur André Mentzelopoulos in 1958. After a period of poor management, this business collapsed and was liquidated in 1996, with the Promodès chain buying a few of the points of sale. In 2003, the Société Philippe Potin acquired the right to use the Félix Potin name for its distribution network in South-East France.  Business model  When Félix Potin founded his business, a standard business model was to receive loads of goods from a manufacturer, then label and package them in store. By contrast, Félix Potin shops sold products produced and prepackaged at the chain's own factories, then sold them at standardised, publicised prices. Potin aimed to sell large volumes at reduced profit margins. Potin was thus a pioneer of the chain-and-branch, bulk-buying model of retail, unifying distribution and sales under the same brand. Frank Winfield Woolworth's eponymous five-and-dime chain in the US was, to some extent, a revival and development of Potin's model.  Architecture  The architect Paul Auscher (1866–1932) designed several buildings for Félix Potin. The distinctive turrets bearing Félix Potin's name can still be seen on the Boulevard de Sébastopol (now a Monoprix) and Rue de Rennes (now a Zara). == External links == * Official site of the modern-day business * History * History Category:1820 births Category:1871 deaths Category:People from Arpajon Category:Shops in Paris Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery ","title":"Félix Potin"},{"id":"20222379","text":"George Bemis (October 13, 1816 – January 5, 1878) was an American lawyer and legal scholar. He was involved with many unique cases and was an advocate of international law and the reform of the treatment of criminals. ==Early life and education== George was born at Watertown, Massachusetts, the youngest son of Seth and Sarah (Wheeler) Bemis.Hoar, Ebenerer Rockwood. Memoir of Georg Bemis. Boston, MA: John Wilson and Son, 1878. A conscientious and diligent student, at the age of 13, he passed the entrance exam to Harvard College in 1829. Instead of enrolling at such a young age, he continued with his studies for three more years. He matriculated into the sophomore class in 1832 and graduated in 1835. He continued his studies by enrolling in Harvard Law School. He completed his formal education in 1839 and was admitted into the Massachusetts Bar in July 1839. ==Career== Bemis was one of the most esteemed lawyers in Boston during the 1850s and developed a profitable law practice while being involved in many famous legal proceedings. Bemis was a crusader for reform of the penal code in Massachusetts, especially laws that allowed a defendant's previous convictions to extend his current sentence.Sullivan, Robert. The Disappearance of Dr. Parkman,Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1971, pp. 57-59 In 1843 he was involved with the case of Abner Rodgers, an inmate at the Massachusetts State Penitentiary accused of killing the warden of that prison. During his defense of Rodgers, Bemis argued that the man was insane and not responsible for his actions. Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw issued an opinion that became the American authority on insanity pleas during criminal prosecution.Warren, Charles. History of the Harvard Law School and of Early Legal Conditions in America, The Lawbook Exchange, LTD, 1999 The second major case that Bemis was involved in was the Parkman-Webster murder case. Bemis acted as co-counsel to Massachusetts Attorney General John H. Clifford in prosecuting Harvard professor John White Webster for the death of George Parkman. Bemis was selected and paid $1,500 by the Parkman family to represent their interests in the case against Webster. This case was one of the first to use forensic dentistry and circumstantial evidence to prove a defendant's guilt.Bowers, Forensic Dentistry Evidence: An Investigator's Handbook, Amsterdam: Elsevier (2011), p. 22Rogers, Murder and the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press (2008), pp. 95–97 In addition to serving as a lawyer for these landmark cases, he also acted as a court reporter during each trial. He eventually published his notes on each trial as the official transcription of the cases. The author Robert Sullivan, in his book on the case, characterized the published transcripts from the Webster trial were considered to be heavily edited and \\"slanted\\" to justify the execution of Dr. Webster. In 1858 Bemis suffered a hemorrhage in his lungs while arguing a case regarding railroads. Subsequently he moved to southern France for the remainder of his life. During this time in Europe, he focused on the study of public law; he published many pamphlets about neutrality in response to British positions on these topics.

As the leader of the Soviet Union, he constructed a state whose policies have been blamed for millions of deaths. A campaign of political repression, including arrests, deportations, and executions of people proclaimed traitors engaged in sabotaging collectivism, often targeted for belonging to specific demographic groups rather than as individuals, occurred from 1929 to 1932. The bourgeois were labeled kulaks and were class enemies. More than 1.8 million peasants were deported in 1930–1931.Robert Conquest (1986) The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine. Oxford University Press. .Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, Stéphane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, Lynne Viola, The Unknown Gulag. The Lost World of Stalin's Special Settlements Oxford University Press 2007, hardback, 320 pages The stated purpose of the campaign was to fight the counter-revolution and build socialism in the countryside. This policy was accomplished simultaneously with collectivization in the Soviet Union and effectively brought all agriculture in the Soviet Union under state control. May 1926 illustration to the Soviet categories of peasants: bednyaks, or poor peasants; serednyaks, or mid-income peasants; and kulaks, the those that possessed capital and significant wealth those who had much larger farms than most Russian peasants The \\"liquidation of the kulaks as a class\\" was announced by Stalin on December 27, 1929. The decision was formalized in a resolution, \\"On measures for the elimination of kulak households in districts of comprehensive collectivization\\", on January 30, 1930. The kulaks were divided into three categories: those to be executed for treason or imprisoned as decided by the local secret political police; those to be exiled for treason to Siberia, North, the Urals, or Kazakhstan, after determined to be traitors the government confiscation of their property occurred ; and those considered traitors or where guilty of terrorism to be evicted from their houses and used in labour colonies within their own districts. The combination of the elimination of kulaks, collectivization, and other repressive policies contributed to mass starvation in many parts of the Soviet Ukraine and the death of at least 7 to 10 million peasants in 1930–1937.  Targeting of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  Although famine, allegedly caused by collectivization, raged in many parts of the Soviet Union in 1932, special and particularly lethal policies, according to Yale historian Timothy Snyder in his book Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin (2010), were adopted in and largely limited to Ukraine at the end of 1932 and 1933. Snyder lists seven crucial policies that applied only, or mainly, to Soviet Ukraine. He states: \\"Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill\\": # From 18 November 1932 peasants from Ukraine were required to return extra grain they had previously earned for meeting their targets. State police and party brigades were sent into these regions to root out any food they could find. # Two days later, a law was passed forcing peasants who could not meet their grain quotas to surrender any livestock they had. # Eight days later, collective farms that failed to meet their quotas were placed on \\"blacklists\\" in which they were forced to surrender 15 times their quota. These farms were picked apart for any possible food by party activists. Blacklisted communes had no right to trade or to receive deliveries of any kind, and became death zones. # On 5 December 1932, Stalin's security chief presented the justification for terrorizing Ukrainian party officials to collect the grain. It was considered treason if anyone refused to do their part in grain requisitions for the state. # In November 1932 Ukraine was required to provide 1/3 of the grain collection of the entire Soviet Union. As Lazar Kaganovich put it, the Soviet state would fight \\"ferociously\\" to fulfill the plan. # In January 1933 Ukraine's borders were sealed in order to prevent Ukrainian peasants from fleeing to other republics. By the end of February 1933 approximately 190,000 Ukrainian peasants had been caught trying to flee Ukraine and were forced to return to their villages to starve. # The collection of grain continued even after the annual requisition target for 1932 was met in late January 1933.  Requisition quotas  Komsomol members seize \\"grain hidden by kulaks\\" In the summer of 1930, the Soviet government had instituted a program of food requisitioning, ostensibly to increase grain exports. The same year Ukraine produced 27% of the Soviet harvest but provided 38% of the deliveries, and in 1931 it made 42% of the deliveries. Yet the Ukrainian harvest fell from 23.9 million tons to 18.3 million tons in 1931, but the previous year's quota of 7.7 million tons remained. Authorities were able to procure only 7.2 million tons, and in 1932 just 4.3 million tons of a reduced quota of 6.6 million tons. Sources such as Encyclopædia Britannica say there was no physical basis for famine in Ukraine, and that Soviet authorities set quotas for Ukraine at exceedingly high levels. However Soviet archive data suggests the grain harvest was not as large as has been assumed, and the Ukrainian historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, who lived through the period in question and was himself a victim of a Stalinist purge, described the famine as preceded by \\"a year of drought coincid[ing] with chaotic agricultural conditions.\\" This suggests that the famine was caused by a combination of a severe drought, chaotic implementation of forced collectivization of farms, and the food requisition program carried out by the Soviet authorities.  Criminalization of gleaning  Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested or from fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. Some ancient cultures promoted gleaning as an early form of a welfare system. In the Soviet Union, people who gleaned and distributed food brought themselves under legal risk. The Law of Spikelets criminalised gleaning under penalty of death, or ten years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances. Some sources claim there were several legislative acts adopted in order to force starvation in the Ukrainian SSR. On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, \\"On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property\\",Konchalovsky and Lipkov, The Inner Circle, Newmarket Press, New York: 1991, p.54 that imposed penalties starting at a ten-year prison sentence and up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property.Potocki, p. 320.Serczyk, p. 311.Andrew Gregorovich, \\"Genocide in Ukraine 1933\\", part 4: \\"How Did Stalin Organize the Genocide?\\" , Ukrainian Canadian Research & Documentation Centre, Toronto 1998. Stalin personally appended the stipulation: \\"People who encroach on socialist property should be considered enemies of the people.\\" Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, \\"On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932, led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 rubles or three months of correctional labor. The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the \\"law of the wheat ears\\", included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. A little over a month later, the law was revised, as Politburo protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932. The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that \\"organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial\\", and listed a number of cases in which \\"kulaks, former traders, and other socially-alien persons\\" would be subject to the death penalty. \\"Working individual peasants and collective farmers\\" who stole kolkhoz property and grain would be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty would be imposed only for \\"systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc.\\"Davies and Wheatcroft, pp.167-168, 198-203 Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was first blamed on the kulaks, and later on agents and spies of foreign intelligence services, \\"nationalists\\", \\"Petlurovites\\", and from 1937 on, Trotskyists. According to a report from the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933 as many as 103,000 people (more than 14 thousand in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years of imprisonment, and 48,094 to other punishments. On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating, \\"from today the dispatch of goods for the villages of all regions of Ukraine shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain.\\"Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 174. On November 24, the Politburo ordered that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the OGPU.Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 175.  Blacklist system  A \\"Blackboard\\" published in the newspaper \\"Under the Flag of Lenin\\" in January 1933 — a \\"blacklist\\" identifying specific kolhozes and their punishment in the Bashtanka Raion, Mykolayiv oblast, Ukraine. Some researchers claim that in December 1932, Soviets imposed special sanctions and blockade by NKVD units which led to complete extermination by starvation of certain villages and areas. The blacklist was applied with harsher methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be \\"underperforming\\" in the grain collection procurement: \\"Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.\\"Rajca, p. 321.Memorandum on Grain Problem, Addendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93. Resolution on blacklisting villages. December 1932 Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants, who were not kolkhoz members and who were \\"underperforming\\" in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To reach the grain procurement quota amongst peasants, 1,100 brigades were organized, which consisted of activists, often from neighboring villages, who had either already accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it. In the end at least 400 collective farms where put on the \\"Blackboard,\\" more than half of them in Dnepropetrovsk alone. Since most of the goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighboring cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained thus for a long period--as an example mentioned in the December 6 decree, the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist on October 17, 1933, when they completed their plan for grain collection early. After January 1933, the blacklist regime was modified, with 100% plan execution no longer required. As mentioned in the December 6 Decree, the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after 88% and 70% plan completion, respectively. Measures were taken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was done frequently by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and regardless of whether or not the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves or enough seed left to plant the next harvest.  Restrictions on freedom of movement  Some sources state that Ukrainian SSR borders were sealed by the NKVD and the army in order to prevent starving peasants from travelling into territories where food was more available. Some researchers believe these measures extended to urban areas inside Ukrainian SSR. During the first five-year plan, urban population growth brought more than 10 million people from villages to cities; the number receiving food rations increased from 25 million in 1930 to 40 million in 1932. Food production declined and urban food supplies fell drastically. Reserves did not keep pace with ration requirements. Desertion of factories, combined with peasants' flight from collective farms, resulted in millions of people moving around the country. In response, the government revived the tsarist institution of internal passports at the end of 1932. The requisition of grains from wealthy peasants (kulaks) during the forced collectivization. 1933 Special barricades were set up by GPU units throughout the Soviet Union to prevent an exodus of peasants from hunger-stricken regions. During a single month in 1933, 219,460 people were either intercepted and escorted back or arrested and sentenced.Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, Stéphane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999. In Ukraine, these measures had the following results, according to the declassified documents:http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52383http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52384http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52385http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52386 During the 11 days (January 23–February 2) after the January 22, 1933 decree, 3,861 people were intercepted, of which 340 were arrested \\"for further recognition\\". During the same period, there were 16,773 people intercepted (907 of those not living in Ukraine) in trains and at railway stations on the whole Ukrainian territory; out of those, 1,610 people were arrested. These figures also included criminals. In the same document, the GPU states that 94,433 peasants had already left the Ukrainian territory during the period from December 15, 1932 to January 2, 1933 (data for 215 districts out of 484, and Moldavian ASRR). It has been estimated that there were some 150,000 excess deaths as a result of this policy, and one historian asserts that these deaths constitute a crime against humanity.Michael Ellman , Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932-33 Revisited Europe-Asia Studies, Routledge. Vol. 59, No. 4, June 2007, 663-693. PDF file In contrast historian Stephen Kotkin argues that the sealing of the Ukrainian borders caused by the internal passport system was in order to prevent the spread of famine related diseases. The government introduced new identity papers and obligatory registration for citizens in December 1932. Initially, the area of new identity papers and obligatory registration implementation was limited to Moscow, Leningrad (encircling 100 km), and Kharkiv (encircling 50 km), and the new measures were planned for implementation by June 1933. In Ukraine, introduction of the passport system was to be carried out by the end of 1933, with top priority given to its enforcement in Kharkiv, Kiev, and Odessa.On establishment of uniform system of internal passports in URSR, Visti VUTsVK, January 1, 1933, p. 4., cited through genocidecurriculum.org Travel from Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus Kuban kray region was specifically forbidden by the directives of January 22, 1933 (signed by Molotov and Stalin) and of January 23, 1933 (joint directive Central Committee of the Communist Party and Sovnarkom). February 16, 1933, the same measures were applied to the Lower-Volga region.Politburo Decision http://media.mid.ru/golod/072_17-3-916-17.jpg After February, the directives stated that travel \\"for bread\\" from these areas was organized by enemies of the Soviet Union, with the purpose of agitation in northern areas of the Soviet Union against kolkhozes, but was not prevented. Therefore, railway tickets were to be sold only by ispolkom permits, and those who had already reached the north should be arrested.Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939., Ithaca. N.I., 2001, p. 306  Information blockade  Some sources say that the Soviet regime, by preventing news of the famine from reaching the outside world, prevented foreign sources from providing aid to alleviate the famine and associated hardships. Some claim the same thing happened during the earlier 1921-23 famine in the Soviet Union. With regard to the earlier famine, some researchers say initial Soviet pleas for aid in early autumn 1921 were refused by European countries, and what aid was eventually provided didn't come for four or five months, so the Soviet government may not have expected the outside world to be very helpful in this instance either. On February 23, 1933, the Politburo of Central Committee adopted a decree requiring foreign journalists to seek travel permits from the General Directorate of Militia before entering the affected areas. Also, the Soviet government denied initial reports of the famine (but agreed with information about malnutrition), while preventing foreign journalists from traveling in the region. At the same time, there was no credible evidence of information blockade arrangements on a considerable number of foreign specialists (engineers, workers, etc.) who worked at construction sites at Ukrainian territory. For example, Gareth Jones, one of David Lloyd George's private secretaries, spent several days in mid-March travelling to \\"all twenty villages, not only in Ukraine, but also in the black earth district, and in the Moscow region, and... I slept in peasants' cottages, and did not immediately leave for the next village.\\" He reached the neighboring rural area of Kharkiv (the capital of Soviet Ukraine), spent some days there, and despite seeing no dead people or animals himself, reported \\"that there was famine in the Soviet Union.\\" On August 23, 1933, foreign correspondents were warned individually by the press section of the Foreign Office of the Soviet Union not to attempt to travel to the provinces or elsewhere in the Soviet Union without first obtaining formal permission. The Foreign Office of the Soviet Union, without explanation, refused permission to William H. Chamberlain, The Christian Science Monitor correspondent, to visit and observe the harvest in the principal agricultural regions of the North Caucasus and Ukraine. From May-July 1933, two other American correspondents were forbidden to make a trip to Ukraine. Such restrictions were softened in September 1933. Scholars who have conducted research in declassified archives have reported \\"the Politburo and regional Party committees insisted that immediate and decisive action be taken in response to the famine such that 'conscientious farmers' not suffer, while district Party committees were instructed to supply every child with milk and decreed that those who failed to mobilize resources to feed the hungry or denied hospitalization to famine victims be prosecuted.\\"Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 424 By the end of 1933, based on data collected by undercover investigation and photos, the Bohemian-Austrian Cardinal Theodor Innitzer began an awareness-raising campaign in the West about the massive deaths by hunger and occasional cases of cannibalism that were occurring in Ukraine and the North Caucasus at that time.Starvation & Surplus, Time Magazine, January 22, 1934  Refusal to provide aid for starving  Street in Kharkiv, 1932 Some sources claim that, despite the pleas for assistance and the acknowledged famine situation, the Moscow authorities refused to provide aid. For example, Snyder claims that \\"Stalin\\" had privately admitted \\"that there was 'famine' in Soviet Ukraine', he did not grant a \\"Ukrainian party leadership\\" request for \\"food aid\\". Some researchers state that aid was provided only during the summer. The first reports regarding malnutrition and hunger in rural areas and towns (which were undersupplied through the recently introduced rationing system) to the Ukrainian GPU and oblast authorities are dated to mid-January 1933. However, the first food aid sent by Central Soviet authorities for the Odessa and Dnepropetrovsk regions 400 thousand poods (6600 tonnes, 200 thousand poods or 3300 tonnes for each) appeared as early as February 7, 1933.http://www.mid.ru/ns- arch.nsf/932b471b7dc29104c32572ba00560533/22fa7cb39af8e09ec32574bb003a7f8c? Documents 69 and 70. Also traces of such decisions (at least for Dnipropetrovsk region) can be found at Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php Measures were introduced to localize these cases using locally available resources. While the numbers of such reports increased, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine issued a decree on February 8, 1933, that urged every \\"hunger case\\" to be treated without delay and with a maximum mobilization of resources by kolkhozes, raions, towns, and oblasts. The decree set a seven-day term for food aid which was to be provided from \\"central sources\\". On February 20, 1933, the Dnipropetrovsk oblast received 1.2 million poods of food aid, Odessa received 800 thousand, and Kharkiv received 300 thousand. The Kiev oblast was allocated 6 million poods by March 18. The Ukrainian authorities also provided aid, but it was limited by available resources. In order to assist orphaned children, the Ukrainian GPU and People's Commissariat for Health created a special commission, which established a network of kindergartens where children could get food. Urban areas affected by food shortage adhered to a rationing system. On March 20, 1933, Stalin signed a decree which lowered the monthly milling levy in Ukraine by 14 thousand tons, which was to be redistributed as an additional bread supply \\"for students, small towns and small enterprises in large cities and specially in Kiev.\\" However, food aid distribution was not managed effectively and was poorly redistributed by regional and local authorities. After the first wave of hunger in February and March, Ukrainian authorities met with a second wave of hunger and starvation in April and May, specifically in the Kiev and Kharkiv oblasts. The situation was aggravated by the extended winter. Between February and June 1933, thirty-five Politburo decisions and Sovnarkom decrees authorized the issue of a total of 35.19 million poods (576,400 tonnes), or more than half of total aid to Soviet agriculture as a whole. 1.1 million tonnes were provided by Central Soviet authorities in winter and spring 1933 -- grain and seeds for Ukrainian SSR peasants, kolhozes and sovhozes. Such figures did not include grain and flour aid provided for the urban population and children, or aid from local sources. In Russia, Stalin personally authorized distribution of aid in answer to a request by Sholokhov, whose own district was stricken.On April 6, 1933, Sholokhov, who lived in the Vesenskii district (Kuban, Russian Federation), wrote at length to Stalin, describing the famine conditions and urging him to provide grain. Stalin received the letter on April 15, and on April 16 the Politburo granted 700 tons of grain to that district. Stalin sent a telegram to Sholokhov stating \\"We will do everything required. Inform size of necessary help. State a figure.\\" Sholokhov replied on the same day, and on April 22, the day on which Stalin received the second letter, Stalin scolded him, \\"You should have sent your answer not by letter but by telegram. Time was wasted\\". Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 217 However, Stalin also later reprimanded Sholokhov for failing to recognize \\"sabotage\\" within his district. This was the only instance that a specific amount of aid was given to a specific district. Other appeals were not successful, and many desperate pleas were cut back or rejected.Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 218 Documents from Soviet archives indicate that the aid distribution was made selectively to the most affected areas, and during the spring months, such assistance was the goal of the relief effort. A special resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine for the Kiev Oblast, from March 31, 1933, ordered peasants to be hospitalized with either ailing or recovering patients. The resolution ordered improved nutrition within the limits of available resources so that they could be sent out into the fields to sow the new crop as soon as possible.CC C(b)PU resolution cited through Stanislav Kulchytsky, \\"Why did Stalin exterminate the Ukrainians? \\", Den, November 29, 2005 doc # 204 The food was dispensed according to special resolutions from government bodies, and additional food was given in the field where the laborers worked. The last CPSU Politburo decision about food aid to the whole of the Ukrainian SSR was issued on June 13, 1933. Separate orders about food aid for regions of Ukraine appeared by the end of June through early July 1933 for the Dnipropetrovsk, Vinnytsia and Kiev regions. For the kolkhozes of the Kharkiv region, assistance was provided by end of July 1933 (Politburo decision dated July 20, 1933).  Export of grain and other food  Some publications claim that after recognition of the famine situation in Ukraine during the drought and poor harvests, the Soviet government in Moscow continued to export grain rather than retain its crop to feed the people,Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - Page 1056 though at a significantly lower rate than in previous years. In 1930-31, there had been 5,832,000 metric tons of grains exported. In 1931–1932, grain exports declined to 4,786,000 metric tons. In 1932–1933, grain exports were just 1,607,000 metric tons, and in 1933-34, this further declined to 1,441,000 metric tons.Davies and Wheatcroft, p.471 Officially published data СССР в цифрах ЦУНХУ Госплана СССР.

In 1933, the totals were: 809,600 tons of grains, 2,600 tons of other cereals, 3,500 tons of meat, 400 tons of butter, and 2,500 tons of fish. Those same ports imported the following amounts: less than 67,200 tons of grains and cereals in 1932, and 8,600 tons of grains in 1933. The following amounts were received from other Soviet ports: in 1932, 164,000 tons of grains, 7,300 tons of other cereals, 31,500 tons of , and no more than 177,000 tons of meat and butter; in 1933, 230,000 tons of grains, 15,300 tons if other cereals, 100 tons of meat, 900 tons of butter, and 34,300 tons of fish. Michael Ellman states that the 1932–1933 grain exports amounted to 1.8 million tonnes, which would have been enough to feed 5 million people for one year.  Elimination of Ukrainian cultural elite  Some researchers found that the famine of 1932-1933 followed the assault on Ukrainian national culture that started in 1928. The events of 1932-1933 in Ukraine were seen by the Soviet Communist leaders as an instrument against Ukrainian self-determination. At the 12th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CP(b)U), Moscow-appointed leader Pavel Postyshev declared that \\"1933 was the year of the defeat of Ukrainian nationalist counter-revolution.\\"\\"12th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, Stenograph Record\\", Kharkiv 1934. This \\"defeat\\" encompassed not just the physical extermination of a significant portion of the Ukrainian peasantry, but also the mass imprisonment or execution of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers, and artists. By the end of the 1930s, approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite had been eliminated.E.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"History of Ukraine\\" article. Some, like Ukrainian writer Mykola Khvylovy, committed suicide. One of the leading Ukrainian Bolsheviks, Mykola Skrypnyk, who was in charge of the decade-long Ukrainization program that had been decisively brought to an end, shot himself in the summer of 1933 at the height of the purge of the CP(b)U. Whole academic organizations, such as the Bahaliy Institute of History and Culture, were shut down following the arrests. Repression of the intelligentsia occurred in virtually all parts of the Soviet Union.Roy Medvedev writes \\"Instead, Stalin once again looked for a scapegoat and found it in the form of the specialists from among the pre-revolutionary Russian (and Ukrainian) intelligentsia\\" Roy Medvedev, \\"Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism\\", Columbia University Press, 1989, , p. 256-258. Despite the assault, education and publishing in the republic remained Ukrainianized for years afterward. In 1935-36, 83% of all school children in the Ukrainian SSR were taught in Ukrainian, with Ukrainians making up about 80% of the population.Ronald Grigor Suny, The Soviet Experiment In 1936, of 1830 newspapers, 1402 were in Ukrainian, as were 177 magazines, and in 1936, 69 thousand Ukrainian books were printed.\\"Soviet Ukraine for 20 years\\" p.102 Ukrainian SRR Academy of Science 1938 Kiev, also same data in Statistical Compendium 1936 The recent award-winning documentary Genocide Revealed (2011),Film “Genocide Revealed” wins multiple awards.

This documentary reinforces the view that the Holodomor was indeed an act of genocide. == Consequence of collectivization == While a complex task, it is possible to group some of the causes that contributed to the Holodomor. They have to be understood in the larger context of Stalin's \\"social revolution from above\\" that took place in the Soviet Union at the time.С. Кульчицький, Проблема колективізації сільського господарства в сталінській \\"революції зверху\\", 2004. (S.

(Problems of the History of Ukraine: Facts, Judgments, Quests, #12, 2004, p. 21–69.)  Collectivization  Approaches to changing from individual farming to a collective type of agricultural production had existed since 1917, but for various reasons (lack of agricultural equipment, agronomy resources, etc.) were not implemented widely until 1925, when there was a more intensive effort by the agricultural sector to increase the number of agricultural cooperatives and bolster the effectiveness of already existing sovkhozes. In late 1927, after the XV Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, then known as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), a significant impetus was given to the collectivization effort. In 1927, a drought shortened the harvest in southern areas of the Ukrainian SSR and North Caucasus. In 1927–1928, the winter tillage area was badly affected due to low snow levels. Despite seed aid from the State, many affected areas were not re-sown. The 1928 harvest was affected by drought in most of the grain producing areas of the Ukrainian SSR. Shortages in the harvest and difficulties with the supply system created difficulties with the food supply in urban areas and destabilized the food supply situation in the USSR in general. In order to alleviate the situation, a system of food rationing was initially implemented in Odessa in the second quarter of 1928, and later spread to Mariupol, Kherson, Kiev, Dniprelstan (Dnipropetrovsk), and Kharkiv. At the beginning of 1929, a similar system was implemented throughout the Soviet Union. Despite the aid from the Soviet Ukrainian and the Central governments, many southern rural areas registered occurrences of malnutrition and in some cases hunger and starvation (the affected areas and thus the amount of required food aid was under-counted by authorities). There was also a shortage of forage livestock. Most of Kolkhozes and recently refurnished sovkhozes went through these years with few losses, and some were even able to provide assistance to peasants in the more affected areas (seed and grain for food). Despite the intense state campaign, the collectivization, which was initially voluntary, was not popular amongst peasants: as of early 1929, only 5.6% of Ukrainian peasant households and 3.8% of arable land were collectivized. In early 1929, the methods employed by the specially empowered authority UkrKolhozcenter changed from a voluntary enrollment to an administrative one. By October 1, 1929, a plan for the creation of kolkhozes was \\"outperformed\\" by 239%. As a result, 8.8% of arable land was collectivized. The next major step toward \\"all-over collectivization\\" took place after an article was published by Stalin in Pravda in early November 1929. While initiated by a November 10-17 meeting of Communist Party Central Committee Twenty-Five Thousanders only trained at special short courses, the main driving force of collectivization and dekulakization in Ukraine became a \\"poor peasants committee\\" (komnezamy) and local village councils (silrady) where komnezams members had a voting majority. The USSR Kolhozcenter issued the December 10, 1929, decree on collectivization of livestock within a three-month period (draft animals 100%, cattle 100%, pigs 80%, sheep and goats 60%). This drove many peasants to slaughter their livestock. By January 1, 1930, the percentage of collectivized households almost doubled to 16.4%. Despite the infamous January 5, 1930 decree, in which the deadline for the complete collectivization of the Ukrainian SSR was set for the period from the end of 1931 to spring 1932, the authorities decided to accelerate the completion of the campaign in autumn 1930. The high expectations of the plan were outperformed by local authorities even without the assistance of the 7,500 Twenty-Five Thousanders, and by March, 70.9% of arable land and 62.8% of peasant households were collectivized. The dekulakization plan also \\"over-performed\\". The first stage of dekulakization lasted from second half of January until the beginning of March 1930. Such measures were applied to 309 out of 581 total districts of Ukrainian SSR, which accounted for 2,524,000 of 5,054,000 peasant households. As of March 10, 61,897 peasants households (2.5%) were dekulakized, while in 1929, the percentage of dekulakized households was 1.4%.Н.

Many arrested kulaks and \\"well-to-do\\" farmers resettled their families to the Urals and Central Asia.Wheatcroft and Davies The term kulak was ultimately applied to anybody resisting collectivization as many of the so-called kulaks were no more well-off than other peasants. The fast-track to collectivization incited numerous peasant revolts in Ukraine and in other parts of the Soviet Union. In response to the situation, Pravda published Stalin's article \\"Dizzy with success\\", which blamed overeager Party members and declared that \\"collective farms must not be established by force\\". Republished from Pravda No. 60, March 2, 1930. Soon, numerous orders and decrees were issued banning the use of force and administrative methods. Some of those dekulakized were declared to have been labeled mistakenly and received their property back, and some returned home. As a result, the collectivization process was rolled back. On May 1, 1933, 38.2% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 41.1% of arable land had been collectivized—by the end of August these numbers declined to 29.2% and 35.6% respectively. A second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign was initiated in the winter of 1931, with significant assistance of the so-called tug-brigades composed of kolkhoz udarniks. Many kulaks, along with their families, were deported from the Ukrainian SSR. According to declassified data, around 300,000 peasants in Ukraine were affected by these policies in 1930–1931. Ukrainians composed 15% of the total 1.8 million kulaks relocated Soviet-wide.Davies and Wheatcroft, p.490 Beginning in summer 1931, all further deportations were recommended to be administered only to individuals.Ivnitskyy \\"Tragedy of Soviet Village\\" This second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign also caused a delay in sowing. During winter and spring 1930–1931, the Ukrainian agricultural authority Narkomzem issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock caused by poor treatment, the absence of forage, stables, and farms, and \\"kulak sabotage\\". According to the first five-year plan, Ukrainian agriculture was to switch from an exclusive orientation of grain to a more diverse output. This included not only an increase in sugar beet crops; other types of agricultural production were expected to be utilized by industry, including cotton, which was established in 1931. This plan anticipated a decrease in grain area and an increase of yield and area for other crops. By July 1, 1931, 65.7% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 67.2% of arable land were reported as collectivized, while the main grain and sugar beet production areas were collectivized at levels of 80-90%. The decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party on August 2, 1931 clarified the all-over collectivization term—in order to be considered complete, the all-over collectivization did not have to reach 100%, but could not be less than 68-70% of peasants households and 75-80% of arable lands. According to the same decree, all-over collectivization was accomplished in the following areas: Northern Caucasus (Kuban), with 88% of households and 92% of arable lands collectivized; Ukraine (South), with 85% and 94% respectively; Ukraine (Right Bank), with 69% and 80%; and Moldavian ASRR (part of Ukrainian SRR), with 68% and 75%.Compendium of Soviet Law for 1931. Moscow, 1932 As of the beginning of October 1931, the collectivization of 68% of peasant households, and 72% of arable land was complete.С.В. Кульчицький, Опір селянства суцільній колективізації (pdf), Ukrainian Historical Journal, 2004, № 2, 31-50. Article from a Soviet newspaper with the first version of a plan for grain collections in 1932 for kolkhozes and peasants—5,831.3 thousand tons + sovkhozes 475,034 tons The plan for the state grain collection in the Ukrainian SSR adopted for 1931 was over- optimistic--510 million poods (8.4 Tg). Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, and the lack of relevant general management destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total winter sowing area shrunk by ~2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and wages awarded to kolhoz members. Grain collection continued until May 1932, but reached only 90% of the planned amounts. By the end of December 1931, the collection plan was 79% accomplished. Many kolkhozes from December 1931 onwards suffered from lack of food, resulting in an increased number of deaths caused by malnutrition, which were registered by OGPU in some areas (Moldavian SSR as a whole and several central rayons of Vinnytsia, Kiev, and North-East rayons of Odessa oblasts) in winter, spring and early summer 1932. By 1932, the sowing campaign of the Ukrainian SSR was implemented with minimal drafht power, as most of the remaining horses were incapable of working, while the number of available agricultural tractors was too small to fill the gap. The Government of the Ukrainian SSR tried to remedy the situation, but it had little success. Administrative and territorial reform (oblast creation) in February 1932 also added to the mismanagement. As a result, Moscow had more details about the seed situation than the Ukrainian authorities. In May 1932, in an effort to change the situation, the central Soviet Government provided 7.1 million poods of grain for food for Ukraine and dispatched an additional 700 agricultural tractors originally intended for other regions of the Soviet Union. By July, the total amount of aid provided from Central Soviet Authorities for food, sowing and forage for the agricultural sector totaled more than 17 million poods. Speculative prices of food in the cooperative network (5–10 times more compared to neighboring Soviet republics) brought significant peasant \\"travel for bread\\", while attempts to handle the situation had very limited success. The quota on carried-on foods provision was lifted by Stalin (at Kosior's request) at the end of May 1932. The July GPU reports for the first half of 1932 mentioned the \\"difficulties with food\\" in 127 out of 484 rayons and acknowledged the incompleteness of the information for the regions. The decree of Sovnarkom on \\"Kolkhoz Trade\\" issued in May fostered rumors amongst peasants that collectivization was rolled back again, as it had been in spring 1930. The number of peasants who abandoned kolkhozes significantly increased. As a result, the government plans for the central grain collection in Ukraine was lowered by 18.1% compared to the 1931 plan. Collective farms were still expected to return 132,750 tons of grain, which had been provided in spring 1932 as aid. The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million poods. The actual state of collection was disastrous, and by July 31, only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. As of July 20, the harvested area was half the 1931 amount. The sovhozes had only sowed 16% of the defined area. Beginning in July 1932, the Ukrainian SSR met with difficulty in supplying the planned amount of food to the rationing system (implemented in early 1928) to supply extensively growing urban areas with food. This system almost became the sole source of food delivery to cities, while the alternatives, cooperative trade and black market trading, became too expensive and undersupplied to provide long-range assistance. By December 1932, due to faulty grain procurement, daily rationing for the rural population was limited to 100-600 grams of bread, with some group of rural citizens completely withdrawn from the rationing supply. This disparity between agricultural goals and actual production grew later in the year. An expected 190 thousand tons of grain were to be exported, but by August 27, 1932, only 20 thousand tons were ready. Taking into account the situation with the harvest at right bank Ukraine, Stalin lowered procurement plan for the Ukrainian SSR by 40 million poods at the end of August 1932.\\"Stalin and Kaganovitch. The letters\\". Moscow 2001 p.287 By October 25, the plan for grain collection was lowered once again. Nevertheless, collection reached only 39% of the annually planned total.С. Кульчицький, Голодомор-33: сталінський задум та його виконання (pdf ), Проблеми Історіїї України факти, судження, пошуки, №15, 2006, сс. 190-264 A second lowering of goals subtracted 70 million poods but still demanded plan completion and 100% efficiency. Attempts to reach the new goals of production proved futile in late 1932. On November 29, in order to complete the plan, Ukraine was to collect 94 million poods, 4.8 million of them from sovkhozes. On January 2, targets were again lowered to 62.5 million poods. On January 14, the targets were lowered even further to 33.1 million. At the same time, GPU of Ukraine reported hunger and starvation in the Kiev and Vinnytsia oblasts, and began implementing measures to remedy the situation. The total amount of grain collected by February 5 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931), while the numbers of \\"hunger and malnutrition cases\\" as registered by the GPU of Ukrainian SSR increased every day. Whilst the long-lasting effect of overall collectivization had an adverse effect on agricultural output everywhere, Ukraine had long been the most agriculturally productive area, providing over 50% of exported grain and 25% of total production of grain in the Russian Empire in 1913. Over , were used for grain production, or 90.5% of total arable land. This degree of dependency on agriculture meant that the effects of a bad harvest could be almost unlimited. This had been long recognized, and while projections for agricultural production were adjusted, the shock of limited production could not be easily managed. While collections by the state were in turn limited, there were already clear stresses. The 1932 total Soviet harvest was to be 29.5 million tons in state collections of grain out of 90.7 million tons in production. But the actual result was a disastrous 55–60 million tons in production. The state ended up collecting only 18.5 million tons in grain.Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 448 The total Soviet collections by the state were virtually the same in 1930 and 1931 at about 22.8 million tons. For 1932, they had been reduced significantly to 18.5 million tons, with even lower figure in Ukraine. These were the total estimated outcomes of the grain harvests:  Peasants' reaction  Another potential factor contributing to the situation in spring 1933 was that the peasants' \\"incentive to work disappeared\\" when they worked at \\"large collective farms.\\" Soviet archival data for 1930-32 also support that conclusion. This is one of the factors for reducing the sowing area in 1932 and for significant losses during harvesting.Mark B. Tauger, Natural Disaster and Human Actions in the Soviet Famine of 1931-33,The Carl Beck Papers in Russian & East European Studies, # 1506, 2001, , (PDF ) By December 1932, 725,000 hectares of grain in areas of Ukrainian SRR affected by famine remained uncollected in spring 1933.Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів. Document number № 118 A second significant factor was \\"the massacre of cattle by peasants not wishing to sacrifice their property for nothing to the collective farm.\\" During winter and spring 1930–1931, the Ukrainian agricultural authority Narkomzem issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock and especially draft power caused by poor treatment, absence of forage, stables, and farms, and \\"kulak sabotage\\".  Legislation provisions  Law \\"On the safekeeping of Socialist property\\" text 12 of August 1932 On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, \\"On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property\\", that imposed penalties from a ten-year prison sentence up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property. Stalin personally appended the stipulation: \\"People who encroach on socialist property should be considered enemies of the people.\\" Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, \\"On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932 led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 rubles or three months of correctional labor. The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the \\"law of the wheat ears\\", included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. In little over a month, the law was revised, as Politburo protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932. The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that \\"organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial\\", and listed a number of cases in which \\"kulaks, former traders and other socially-alien persons\\" would be subject to the death penalty. \\"Working individual peasants and collective farmers\\" who stole kolkhoz property and grain should be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty should be imposed only for \\"systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc.\\" Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was blamed on the kulaks, and later to agents and spies of foreign Intelligence Services--\\"nationalists\\", \\"Petlurovites\\", and from 1937 on, Trotskyists. According to a report by the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933, as many as 103,000 people (more than 14,000 in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years' imprisonment, and 48,094 to other sentences. On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating \\"from today the dispatch of goods for the villages of all regions of Ukraine shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain.\\" On November 24, the Politburo instructed that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the OGPU. The existing practice of administrative punishment known as black board (blacklist) by the November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine was applied to a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be underperforming in the grain collection procurement: \\"Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.\\" Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants who were not kolkhoz members and who were underperforming in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To \\"reach the grain procurement quota\\" amongst peasants, 1,100 brigades, consisting of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it, were organized. Since most of goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighbored cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained so for a long period. As an example mentioned in the December 6 Decree, the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist only on October 17, 1933, when they completed their plan for grain collection early. Beginning in January 1933, the black list regime was softened when 100% of plan execution was no longer demanded. The December 6 Decree stated that the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after reaching 88% and 70% plan completion respectively. Measures were undertaken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was frequently done by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and was done regardless of whether the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves, or whether they had enough seed left to plant the next harvest.  Procurement practice  In 1928, a by contract policy of procurement (contracts for the delivery of agricultural products) was implemented for kolkhozes and ordinary peasants alike (kulaks had a \\"firm\\" plan for procurement). Accordingly, from 1928 through January 1933, \\"grain production areas\\" were required to submit 1/3 to 1/4 of their estimated yield, while areas designated as grain were required to submit no more than 1/8 of their estimated yield. However, between autumn 1930 and spring 1932, local authorities tended to collect products from kolkhozes in amounts greater than the minimum required, in order to exceed the contracted target, in some cases by more than 200%. Especially harmful methods utilized in the by contract policy were counter-plan actions, which were additional collection plans implemented in already fulfilled contracts. Such counter-plan measures were strictly forbidden after the Spring of 1933 as \\"extremely harmful for kolkhoz development.\\" In 1932, a \\"1/4 of yield\\" procurement quota for \\"grain production areas\\" of the Ukrainian SSR was planned for implementation. On September 23, 1932, a telegram signed by Molotov and Stalin noted that the harvest of 1932 was \\"satisfactory\\", according to estimates provided by the agricultural planning authorities, and therefore requests for seed for winter crops were refused, while total winter tillage acreage demands were increased. Later, Stalin blamed the statistical and planning authorities for inaccurately estimating potential yields and thus a \\"Commissions for yield estimation\\" was created on December 17, 1932, by his order. The 1932 harvest figures provided at the time were largely overestimated, and the actual difference between estimated and actual harvest was significant. Such unrealistic figures resulted in demand that was impossible to fulfill and greater grain procurement than was possible from late 1932 through February 5, 1933.Кульчицький С.В., \\"До оцінки становища в сільському господарстві УСРР у 1931-1933 рр.\\" Ukrainian Historical Journal, №3, 1988, ст-ст.15-27; and also a S. Kulchytskyy letter to the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine. The 1932 grain procurement quota and the amount of grain actually collected were much smaller than those of any other year in the 1930s. In 1932, some 5.8 million tons of procured grain were returned to the rural sector, more than had been in 1930 or 1931.Mark B. Tauger, The 1932 Harvest and the Famine of 1933, Slavic Review, Volume 50, Issue 1 (Spring, 1991), 70-89, (PDF ) == Natural reasons == Drought has been mentioned as the major reason for the Holodomor by Soviet sources since 1983.Robert Conquest, The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine Oxford University Press New York (1986) A News Release Communique from the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa dated April 28, 1983; see also Harvest of Sorrow by Conquest, page 346. This explanation has been modified by the Western historian Dr. Mark Tauger, who concluded that the famine was not fundamentally \\"man-made\\".See collection of papers by Mark D. TaugerDavies and Wheatcroft, pp 51, 53, 61-63, 66, 68, 70, 73-76, 109, 119-23, 131, 231, 239, 260, 269, 271n, 400, 439, 458-9 He says that rustic plant disease, rather than drought, was the cause of the famine. The most that can be said of the contribution of human actions is that draft shortages, lack of labor, systemic economic problems, mismanagement, and peasant resistance exacerbated the crop failures already created by natural disasters. In 1932, extremely dry weather reduced crops in some regions, and unusually wet and humid weather in most others fostered unprecedented infestations. These conditions reduced the potential yield, as drought had in 1931. Drought, rain, and infestations destroyed at least 20% of the harvest, and this would have been sufficient on its own to cause serious food shortages or even famine. The historian Mark Tauger believes that if these factors had not developed in 1931 and 1932, agricultural production would have been considerably larger. The drought was not as bad as that of the non-famine year of 1936, and the earlier drought was centered outside Ukraine, according to the leading Soviet authority on drought.A.I. Rudenko. Zasukhi v USSR, see also Harvest of sorrow, p. 222 The prime cause of the major crop failure of 1932–1933 was plant rust rather than drought. Nevertheless, there was a significant drought in 1931, which caused a considerable decrease in the harvest, while in 1936 the decrease in the harvest was not as catastrophic. Historian James Mace wrote that Mark Tauger's argument \\"is not taken seriously by either Russians or Ukrainians who have studied the topic.\\"James Mace, Intellectual Europe on Ukrainian Genocide , The Day, October 21, 2003 In addition, Stephen Wheatcroft, author of The Years of Hunger, claims Tauger's view represents the opposite extreme in arguing the famine was totally accidental.Wheatcroft, S. G. TOWARDS EXPLAINING SOVIET FAMINE OF 1931-3: POLITICAL AND NATURAL FACTORS IN PERSPECTIVE, Food and Foodways, 2004, 12:2, 107—136.  Sovkhozes general fault of 1932  After grain collection difficulties in 1927 and 1928, Stalin ordered the creation of state grain and meat enterprises--sovkhozes--which according to his initial vision should deliver more than 100 million poods of grain in 1932. However, in 1932 their production results were disastrous due to poor general and agricultural management and planning, despite the significant (as compared to kolkhozes) amount of modern agricultural mechanisms (agricultural tractors, harvesters, etc.) employed.Development of the Ukrainian SRR Economy. Kiev-1949 Ukrainian Academy of Science publishing The main reason for low output was that wheat was continually sown, beginning in 1929, on the same areas without fertilizers. Sovkhozes also suffered from a lack of manpower and infrastructure (roads, elevators etc.). Losses during harvesting were extremely high.Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia 2nd ed. (1939), Moscow Thus, instead of the expected 290 millions of poods (more than 5 million tons) in 1932, sovkhozes produced 5 time less, while the situation with livestock was even worse.Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia 1st ed. (1932-35), Moscow As of 20 July 1932, sovhozes of the Ukrainian SRR had logged 16% of the defined sowing area.  Primitive agriculture  Another factor in the decline of the harvests was that the shortage of draft power for plowing and reaping was even more acute in 1932 than in the previous year. The number of working horses declined from 19.5 million on July 1, 1931 to 16.2 million on July 1, 1932. The efforts to replace horses by tractors failed to compensate for this loss. In 1931, the total supply of tractors for agriculture amounted to , with produced at home and imported. But in 1932, because of the foreign trade crisis and home producing establishing, no tractors were imported.Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 111. In the whole of 1932, tractors supplied to agriculture, considerably less than in 1931. Only about half became available in time for the harvest, and even less in time for the spring sowing. Animal draft power deteriorated in quality. Horses were fed and maintained even more inadequately than in the previous year. The acute shortage of horses led to the decision to employ cows as working animals. According to the speech of one Soviet official at one of the most affected by famine region, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, \\"in 1932 we employ only 9000 cows, but in 1933 we involve at least 3/4 of their total number; 57000 employed at sowing.\\" On February 23, the Lower Volga party bureau decided to use 200,000 cows for special field work. == References == Category:Holodomor Holodomor ","title":"Causes of the Holodomor"},{"id":"20222401","text":"Fajzë is a village and a former municipality in the Kukës County, northeastern Albania.

Matthews starred on the James Madison Memorial High School basketball and soccer teams. He was named Wisconsin Mr. Basketball in 2005. ==College career== Matthews chose to attend Marquette University despite being pressured to play for the University of Wisconsin–Madison like his father. Wesley was the biggest of the \\"three amigos\\", the three guards in the starting lineup for Marquette. This trio, Dominic James, Jerel McNeal, and Matthews, started nearly every game together from their first year onwards. With the lack of height in the 2008–09 season at Marquette, Matthews learned to play against bigger opponents and became one of the most dominant players in the nation driving to the basket.

In September 2009, he signed a one-year deal with the Jazz. In February 2010, after the team's trade of Ronnie Brewer, head coach Jerry Sloan made Matthews the team's starting shooting guard. On June 29, 2010, the Jazz extended Matthews the league-specified qualifying offer, thereby making him a restricted free agent and giving the Jazz the opportunity to match any other free agent offer. Portland Trail Blazers (2010–2015) On July 10, 2010, the Trail Blazers signed Matthews to a five-year, $34 million offer sheet. On July 21, 2010, following the Jazz's decision not to match the Trail Blazers' offer sheet, Matthews officially signed the five-year, $34 million contract. In his first season with Portland, Matthews averaged 15.9 points per game, and his three- point shot improved from 38 percent to 41 percent. After Brandon Roy began missing time due to knee problems, Matthews gained a spot in the Blazers' starting lineup.

On November 23, 2013, in a game against the Golden State Warriors, Matthews was involved in an altercation and was ejected along with teammate, Mo Williams. He scored 23 points in 25 minutes of action before leaving the game. On November 25 it was announced that he was fined $20,000. On January 17, 2015, Matthews became the Trail Blazers all-time career leader in three-point field goals made, surpassing Terry Porter's franchise record of 773. On March 5, 2015, in a game against the Dallas Mavericks, Matthews tore his left achilles tendon and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season. Dallas Mavericks (2015–2019) On July 9, 2015, Matthews signed a four-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks. On December 6, 2015, he scored 28 of his season-high 36 points in the second half of the Mavericks' 116–104 win over the Washington Wizards. He hit 10 three-pointers in the game, with eight of them coming in the second half. On November 30, 2016, Matthews scored a season-high 26 points in a 94–87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He tied that mark three times in early December. Matthews set a new season high on February 3, 2017, scoring 27 points in a 108–104 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On November 18, 2017, Matthews scored a season-high 22 points in a 111–79 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 8, 2017, he set a new season high with 29 points in a 109–102 loss to Milwaukee. On January 24, 2018, he matched a pair of season highs with 29 points and seven 3-pointers in a 104–97 loss to the Houston Rockets. On February 13, 2018, in a 114–109 loss to Sacramento Kings, Matthews became the seventh Dallas player to hit 500 3-pointers with the team. On April 30, 2018, Matthews exercised his player option for the 2018–19 season. In January 2019, Matthews became the sixth player in Mavericks history to make 600 3-pointers, and the first undrafted player in NBA history (and 31st overall) to make 1,500 3-pointers. New York Knicks (2019) On January 31, 2019, Matthews was traded to the New York Knicks in a multiplayer trade.

Because the abdominal muscles are used isometrically to stabilize the body during the motion, leg raises are also often used to strengthen the rectus abdominis muscle and the internal and external oblique muscles. ==Angles== Lying The lying leg raise is done by lying on the floor on the back. It is done without apparatus except possibly cushions or weights for added resistance. Practitioners generally caution to keep the lower back in contact with the floor and place hands to sides or under lower back for support.Spark People Due to leverage, the hardest portion of a supine (lying) leg raise is generally the first part when the legs are on the floor, as this is when the femur is parallel with the earth and perpendicular to the pull of gravity. Side-lying Side-lying leg raises target the hip adductors within the inner thigh. They are performed by lying on the side with support coming from one hand placed on the ground and the opposite foot placed on the ground in front of the lower leg. With the top leg slightly flexed and resting, the bottom leg is adducted upwards against gravity and relaxed down to the ground. Seated A \\"knee raise\\" type of seated leg raise, with flexed knee joint. A seated leg raise is halfway between a lying raise and a hanging/suspended/tractioned one. They are done seated on an elevated surface. Usually the hands are placed on the surface (or arm rests)Seated leg raise and bear some of the body's weight to lessen the weight borne on the buttocks and increase abdominal recruitment. Tractioned Leg raises can also be performed hanging onto an overhead bar. These are known as hanging leg raises and are more challenging than lying leg raises. They can also be performed on other apparatuses such as dip bars and captain's chairs, which also involve the torso being suspended in the air, except that the stress through the arms is different. This variation of leg raise allows the pelvis to freely rotate. It is generally the more difficult variation for the abdominal muscles due to having to support the pelvic weight as opposed to simply stabilizing its alignment. Alongside this however, it is also potentially the easiest to use bad form on, because users may use a swinging motion to 'cheat' by building up momentum. If the abs are not properly engaged, the spine can easily hyperextend and go into anterior pelvic tilt. It should be going into posterior pelvic tilt if the movement is being done to target the rectus abdominis. This movement can also be done with \\"ab slings\\" which hold the humeri in ~90 degrees of shoulder flexion. This allows one to do a more traditional crunch by bringing the knees up to touch the elbows. It is however possible to assist in this movement by using the lats and other muscles to perform shoulder extension. ==Force== The demands of force on the muscles can be increased through altered posture or apparatus.  Joints  Extending the knee joint (often called a straight leg raise)Hanging straight leg raise increases the demands of leverage on both hip and spine flexors. It also allows the rectus femoris muscle to contribute, for both the supine straight leg raise and the hanging straight leg raise versions, although the muscle will be in active insufficiency in the latter case. The generic term \\"leg raise\\" usually indicates a bended knee, though the term \\"knee raise\\" is used to distinguish it from the category which includes both variations. Weights The exercise can also be done weighted, such as wearing ankle weights or weighted boots, holding a dumbbell between the feet, or slipping one's feet through kettlebells. These weights are also affected by the increased leverage of a straightened knee. ==Form== Range Some prefer to lift as high as possibly through a full range of motion for each repetition. Others do partial range repetitions to focus on more difficult portions of the exercise (generally when the leg is parallel with the ground). \\"Leg raise\\" usually indicates that the mobilization only occurs in the joints of the leg. Both ab muscles (rectus and transversus abdominis) are used to isometrically stabilize the spine to resist extension and posterior pelvic tilt that would otherwise occur with the legs lifted in front. When the lumbar spine flexes, the rectus abdominis is worked dynamically instead of isometrically, increasing its activity, but lessening the stabilizing effect of the TA. This variation is called a leg-hip raise.Leg-hip raise details Leg-hip raises are usually done suspended as the pelvis is more free to rotate. With lying/seated leg raises, the friction between the posterior of the pelvis with the surface it is in contact with impedes rotation. Tempo Some advise to lower down to starting position slowly and with control. Others do the exercise more dynamically and with speed. ==Weighted variations== Leg raises may also be performed with the addition of a weight. This is usually held between the feet and may be a small dumbbell or medicine ball. A large amount of weight can be lifted if the \\"knee raise\\" style is used in a standing position. This exercise is also known as a thigh raise and involves the holding of a barbell, dumbbell or sandbag upon the thigh. The exerciser raises their thigh and lifts the weight before placing their foot on the ground again. A similar range of movement against resistance can be achieved with a multi-hip machine. As it engages and strengthens the hip flexors it is a useful exercise for sprinters and jumpers. ==References== Category:Weight training exercises Category:Bodyweight exercise ","title":"Leg raise"},{"id":"20222518","text":"In telecommunications, a proprietary protocol is a communications protocol owned by a single organization or individual.Proprietary protocol Definition — PC Magazine Encyclopedia ==Intellectual property rights and enforcement== Ownership by a single organization gives the owner the ability to place restrictions on the use of the protocol and to change the protocol unilaterally.

The population of Laquin at one time approached 2,000. (The nearby ghost town of Barclay was a coal mining town.) Laquin was home to five companies, all of which processed wood in one way or another. The Laquin Lumber Company (later the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company) started out under the leadership of Watson L. Barclay, after whom Barclay Mountain was named. Laquin Lumber was under contract with the Union Tanning Company, a subsidiary of the United States Leather Company, one of the largest companies in the United States at that time. Four additional companies in operation in Laquin were Schrader Wood Company, Pennsylvania Hub & Veneer Company, Pennsylvania Stave Company, and Barclay Chemical Company. In 1933, after the Barclay Mountain was clear cut and the lumber companies pulled out, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp was established. The CCC was one of President Roosevelt's New Deal programs. The CCC in Laquin was responsible for replanting trees on the mountain, building access roads, feeding game, and restoring the ecology. By 1941, after the CCC pulled out, Laquin was a ghost town. There are a few traces of the town today, though the last building disappeared sometime in the 1960s. The main street, which once sported a hotel, two churches, a school, a boarding house, store, depot, town building and several homes still exists in the form of the major access road. The ghost towns of Laquin and Barclay are in close proximity to one another, but Laquin came into existence after Barclay, Pennsylvania. Both towns were served by the also long defunct Susquehanna and New York Railroad, which operated between Towanda, Pennsylvania and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Most of the trackbed and bridges of the Susquehanna and New York are still in evidence throughout the valley of the Schrader Creek. The LeRoy Heritage Museum, off Rt. 414 in LeRoy, preserves the history of Laquin and Barclay Mountain through exhibits and walking tours.

Baby P's real first name was revealed as \\"Peter\\" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of Peter's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009. The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and partly because Peter had lived in the London Borough of Haringey, North London, under the same child welfare authorities that had already failed seven years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié, leading to a public inquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening. Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker, and Jason Owen (later revealed to be the brother of Barker) were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge. A court order issued by the High Court in England had prevented the publication of the identity of Baby P; this was lifted on 1 May 2009 by Justice Coleridge. An order sought by Haringey Council to stop publication of the identities of his mother and her boyfriend was granted, but expired on 10 August 2009. The child protection services of Haringey and other agencies were widely criticised. Following the conviction, three inquiries and a nationwide review of social service care were launched, and the Head of Children's Services at Haringey was removed at the direction of the government minister. Another nationwide review was conducted by Lord Laming into his own recommendations concerning Victoria Climbié's killing in 2000. The death was also the subject of debate in the House of Commons. ==Biography== Peter Connelly was born to Tracey Connelly on 1 March 2006. In November, Connelly's new boyfriend, Steven Barker, moved in with her. In December, a general practitioner physician noticed bruises on Peter's face and chest. His mother was arrested and Peter was put into the care of a family friend, but returned home to his mother's care in January 2007. Over the next few months, Peter was admitted to hospital on two occasions suffering from injuries including bruising, scratches and swelling on the side of the head. Connelly was arrested again in May 2007. In June 2007, a social worker observed marks on Peter and informed the police. A medical examination concluded that the bruising was the result of abuse. On 4 June, the baby was placed with a friend for safeguarding. On 25 July, Haringey Council's Children & Young People's Service obtained legal advice which indicated that the \\"threshold for initiating Care Proceedings...was not met\\". On 1 August 2007, Peter was seen at St. Ann's Hospital in North London by locum paediatrician Dr Sabah Al- Zayyat. Serious injuries, including a broken back and broken ribs, very likely went undetected, as the autopsy report believed these to have pre-dated Al- Zayyat's examination. A day later, Connelly was informed that she would not be prosecuted. The next day, an ambulance was called and Peter was found in his cot, blue and clad only in a nappy. After attempts at resuscitation, he was taken to North Middlesex Hospital with his mother but was pronounced dead at 12:20 pm. A post-mortem revealed he had swallowed a tooth after being punched. Other injuries included a broken back, broken ribs, mutilated fingertips and missing fingernails. The police immediately began a murder investigation and Peter's mother was arrested. ==Trials== On 11 November 2008, Owen, 36, and his brother Barker, 32, were found guilty of \\"causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person\\". Connelly, 27, had already pleaded guilty to this charge. Earlier in the trial, Owen and Connelly had been cleared of murder because of insufficient evidence. Barker was found not guilty of murder by a jury. A second trial took place in April 2009, when Connelly and Barker, under aliases, faced charges related to the rape of a two-year-old girl. The girl was also on Haringey's child protection register. Barker was found guilty of rape, while Connelly was found not guilty of child cruelty charges. Their defence lawyers argued that this second trial was nearly undermined by bloggers publishing information linking them to the death of Peter, which could have prejudiced the jury. Sentencing for both trials together took place on 22 May 2009 at the Old Bailey. Connelly received a sentence of \\"imprisonment for public protection\\", and ordered to be indefinitely imprisoned until \\"deemed no longer to be a risk to the public and in particular to small children,\\" with a minimum term of five years. Barker was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, with a minimum sentence of ten years, and a 12-year sentence for his role in the death of Peter, to run concurrently. Owen was also jailed indefinitely, with a minimum term of three years. The sentences were criticised as too lenient by the NSPCC's chief executive, and the Attorney General considered referring them to the Court of Appeal for review, concluding that there was \\"no realistic prospect\\" of the Court of Appeal increasing the sentences. The three appealed against their sentences, Barker against both convictions and sentences. Owen's sentence was changed on appeal to a fixed six-year term. He was released in August 2011, but later recalled to prison. Connelly was released on licence in 2013, but returned to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole; she became ineligible for review for two years. Barker had an application for parole turned down in August 2017. Connelly was refused parole for a third time in December 2019.Baby P Peter Connelly's mother Tracey denied parole for third time BBC News, 6 December 2019. Retrieved 7 December 2019. ==Aftermath== Haringey Council initiated an internal audit serious case review (SCR) after Peter's death. After completion of the court case, only an executive summary was released to the public. The full report was kept confidential, with only some employees of Haringey Council and Haringey councillors allowed access. The two local MPs whose constituencies cover Haringey (Lynne Featherstone and David Lammy), leader of the opposition Robert Gorrie, and opposition spokesperson for Children's Services, were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements to view the document. Ed Balls condemned the serious case review and called for a second report with an independent adjudicator. The Mail on Sunday on 15 March 2009 reported that details of the SCR had come into its possession. The article claimed that the executive summary of the SCR either conflicted or omitted details about how the case had been handled and the extent of the injuries suffered by Peter. Furthermore, there were instances of mishandling by officials, missed and delayed meetings, miscommunication among officials, and a failure to follow through with decisions related to the child's safety. It also noted among other issues that officials had not followed through with obtaining an interim care order that would have removed Peter from his home when they had agreed that legal grounds had existed for doing so six months before he died; key officials also failed to attend a 25 July 2007 meeting intended to decide if it would be necessary to remove Peter from his mother's home at that time. External reports and inquiries Lynne Featherstone MP was critical of Haringey Council, writing, \\"I personally met with George Meehan and Ita O'Donovan – Haringey Council's leader and chief executive – to raise with them three different cases, where the pattern was in each case Haringey seeming to want to blame anyone who complained rather than to look at the complaint seriously. I was promised action – but despite repeated subsequent requests for news on progress – I was just stonewalled.\\" Three council workers, including one senior lawyer, were given written warnings about their actions. The General Medical Council (GMC) separately examined the roles of two doctors: Dr. Jerome Ikwueke, a GP, and Dr. Sabah Al-Zayyat, a paediatrician who examined Peter two days before his death. Although Dr. Ikwueke had twice referred Peter to hospital specialists, the GMC's Interim Orders Panel suspended Dr. Ikwueke for 18 months. Dr. Al-Zayyat, who has been accused of failing to spot his injuries, was suspended pending an inquiry. Her contract with Great Ormond Street Hospital, responsible for child services in Haringey, was also terminated. Ed Balls, Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, ordered an external inquiry into Haringey Council Social Services. The inquiry was not to examine the 'Baby P' case explicitly, but to look into whether Haringey Social Services were following correct procedures in general. This report was presented to ministers on 1 December 2008. During a press conference that day, the Minister announced that, in an unusual move, he had used special powers to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her post as head of children's services at Haringey Council. She rejected calls for her resignation, saying that she wanted to continue to support her staff during the investigations, but was dismissed on 8 December 2008 by Haringey Council, without any compensation package. Shoesmith later brought legal proceedings against Ed Balls, Ofsted, and Haringey Council, claiming that the decisions which led to her dismissal were unfair. The High Court dismissed this claim in April 2010, although Shoesmith was still entitled to pursue an action for unfair dismissal in an employment tribunal. In May 2011, Shoesmith's appeal against her dismissal succeeded in the Court of Appeal; the Department of Education and Haringey Council said they intended to appeal to the Supreme Court against this decision. Their applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court were refused on 1 August 2011. It was reported by BBC News on 29 October 2013 that Sharon Shoesmith agreed to a six-figure payout for unfair dismissal.Baby Peter case: Sharon Shoesmith agrees six-figure payout BBC News, 29 October 2013. Retrieved 29 October 2013. Also announced on 1 December 2008 were the resignations of Labour Council leader George Meehan and councillor Liz Santry, cabinet member for Children and Young People. These councillors had previously refused calls for their resignation during a 24 November council meeting. In April 2009, the council announced that its deputy director of children's services, two other managers, and a social worker, who had been suspended pending an enquiry, had also all been dismissed. Three further inquires were also ordered: *The role of all agencies involved in Peter Connelly's case, including the health authority, police and Haringey Council, would be reviewed. *The General Social Care Council would look into potential breaches of its code of practice. *Lord Laming would conduct a nationwide review of his own recommendations after the Victoria Climbié inquiry. Through a lawyer acting on her behalf, a former social worker for Haringey, Nevres Kemal, sent a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health, Patricia Hewitt, in February 2007, six months before Peter's death. The letter contained an allegation that child protection procedures were not being followed in Haringey. Hewitt took no action, except to forward the letter to the DES, now the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). Haringey Council then took out an injunction against Kemal, banning her from speaking about child care in Haringey. Kemal's lawyer stated, \\"Hewitt bounced us onto the DES... the DES then advised us to write to the Commission for Social Care Inspection whom we had written to on the same day as we had written to Hewitt, copying in the letter to Hewitt and the relevant material. By that time of course they had an injunction against us so we couldn't go back to the inspectorate. The inspectorate had been properly advised at the time and had done nothing.\\" Kim Holt, a consultant paediatrician, who worked in a clinic run by Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital at St Ann's Hospital in Haringey, north London, said she and three colleagues wrote an open letter detailing problems at the clinic in 2006. She claimed Peter could have been saved if managers had listened to fears raised by senior doctors. ==Report by Lord Laming== Lord Laming published his report, \\"The Protection of Children in England: A Progress Report\\" on 12 March 2009.

The Fugu Plan. New York: Weatherhill Inc., 1979. pp53-55. Simon Kaspé was the son of Joseph Kaspé, owner of Harbin's Hôtel Moderne along with most of the city's cinemas and theaters. Joseph Kaspé fled persecution in Russia, moving to Harbin in 1907. Originally stateless, he obtained French citizenship both for himself and his family. Simon grew up in Harbin, but studied for a time at the Paris Conservatory and was an accomplished pianist. == Kidnap and murder == Simon was home in Harbin for summer vacation from the Conservatory in August 1933 when, returning from an outing with his girlfriend, he was kidnapped. His attackers came up behind him, and took him to a site some 36 miles west of the city. The following day, his father received a ransom note demanding $100,000. Joseph Kaspé contacted the French consul in Harbin, who delayed the paying of the ransom, promising to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in finding Simon. A month later, half a bloody ear was sent to Kaspé. Again he was advised to not pay the ransom. However, the body of his son was found by the police on December 3, 1933. Simon Kaspé had been starved and beaten by his kidnappers, who cut off his ears, ripped off his fingernails, and forced him to keep his head in a dark, cold hole in the ground as temperatures dropped to 20 and 30 degrees below zero. His captors had killed him with a gunshot to the head. Thousands of individuals from many communities attended the funeral protesting. While it has been said that Harbin was a \\"paradise in the twenties,\\" the Japanese occupation, and the presence of between 100,000 and 200,000 Russian White émigrés fleeing from Russia involved in the White movement brought civilian crime lords, some of whom practised kidnapping for ransoms. Protests by the Jewish communities of Harbin and Shanghai to Japanese vice-foreign minister Shigemitsu Mamoru had no effect. The kidnappers were arrested and released the following day, but after their conviction in court, the Chinese judge was brought up on charges of treason. The kidnappers were retried, and sentenced to 15–20 years in prison, then released several weeks later on amnesty, due to Rodzaevsky's pleas that a \\"patriotic\\" anti-Communist agenda had been the only premise for the plot, which was thought up by of one of his top lieutenants, named Martinoff, who along with his gang was responsible for kidnappings, targeted Jews and terrorized the city of Harbin. == Aftermath == By the mid-1930s, the Jewish population halved in response to economic depression and events relating to the murder of Simon Kaspé going to Shanghai, Chinese cities not under Japanese control, or even back to the Soviet Union, despite the fact that many had come to China originally fleeing persecution there. == References == Category:1933 deaths Category:People murdered in China Category:Chinese Jews Category:French Jews Category:Jewish Japanese history Category:Musicians from Harbin Category:People of Manchukuo Category:Year of birth missing Category:Chinese pianists Category:Republic of China musicians Category:Chinese people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:French people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Jews and Judaism in Harbin ","title":"Simon Kaspé"},{"id":"20222642","text":"Ujmisht is a village and a former municipality in Kukës County, northeastern Albania.

He began his club career with Sunderland, though appeared only once for the first team, and spent time on loan at Carlisle United, Leyton Orient, Gateshead and Accrington Stanley, before joining the latter club on a permanent basis in 2012. He then moved into non-league football with Dunston UTS, Blyth Spartans and most recently Darlington. He has played for Ireland at under-18, under-19 and under-21 level. ==Club career== Sunderland Liddle started his footballing career with Haydon Bridge and Sunderland, whom he joined as a youth player. At Sunderland he progressed through the youth side and was given a professional contract ahead of the 2008–09 season. It took until January 2010 for him to make his first-team debut, in a FA Cup third-round match at home to Barrow; he came on as a substitute late in the game which Sunderland won 3–0. Loan spells On 14 November 2008, Liddle joined League One club Carlisle United on two months' loan; he joined up with fellow Sunderland loanee Graham Kavanagh. His debut came the following day, in the starting eleven for Carlisle's 3–1 win against Brighton & Hove Albion. The loan was first extended until 14 February 2009, and then to the end of the season; he went on to make 22 appearances. Liddle signed a four-month youth loan with another League One club, Leyton Orient, on 5 August 2010, but returned to Sunderland after only a month because of a groin injury. His only appearance was in the starting eleven against Yeovil Town. On 6 January 2011, Liddle joined Gateshead on a 28-day loan. He made his debut two days later in a 2–2 draw with Kidderminster Harriers, and \\"curl[ed] a beauty into the far corner with the outside of his boot\\" for his first senior goal, which was voted Gateshead's goal of the season. His loan was extended to the end of the 2010–11 season, which he finished with 22 Conference Premier appearances. Accrington Stanley Liddle joined League Two club Accrington Stanley on loan for an initial month on 24 February 2012, and made his debut the next day in a 2–0 loss against Swindon Town. He was sent off against Southend United on 10 March, and after he served his suspension, his loan was extended to the end of the season. He made 12 appearances, all in league competition. He signed a one-year permanent deal with Stanley in July 2012; the fee was undisclosed. He began the season as a regular in the starting eleven until 18 September, when the second sending-off of his Stanley career, just before Chesterfield scored a winning goal, resulted in a three-match ban. He finished the season with 36 appearances in all competitions. Liddle signed a new one-year contract with the club ahead of the 2013–14 season. He appeared in the first five matches of the season before an ankle injury was to keep him out for two months; he returned to the first team as a late substitute against Wycombe Wanderers. He lost his place to short-term signing Lee Naylor, and the rest of Liddle's season was disrupted by hamstring trouble and competition from Laurence Wilson. After signing on for a third year, Liddle started the opening game of the season, but a \\"succession of niggling injuries\\" were to keep him out for three months. He made his first-team return in the FA Cup first round, a goalless draw with Notts County in which manager John Coleman thought he was the best player. He finished the season with 15 league appearances, more than half as a substitute, and was released when his contract expired. Later career Liddle went on trial at Scottish Championship club Hibernian, However, he suffered a knee injury during a development match and the club offered hin support during his recovery period. After a spell with Northern League club Dunston UTS towards the end of the 2015–16 season, Liddle joined Blyth Spartans of the Northern Premier League in June 2016. He made his debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3-1 win over Coalville Town. He spent three seasons with Spartans and then signed for National League North club Darlington in May 2019. ==International career== Liddle, although born in England, qualifies to play for Ireland due to his Irish mother. After playing in the under-18s and under-19s for his country, Liddle was called up to Ireland's under-21 squad for a friendly against Austria under-21 on 19 August 2008. At this stage he had not made an appearance for his club after being signed on a professional contract in the 2008–09 season. Sunderland manager, Roy Keane, commented that \\"The young players have done well. It's a real plus for us and I have no doubts that some of them will be able to handle it at the top level\\". He started against Austria, in a 1–1 draw, Liddle expressed his surprise after the call up, saying \\"The call-up came as a big surprise. I didn't expect it. When I was named in the starting eleven buzzing!\\" He made further appearances against Bulgaria, Portugal, Lithuania and Germany. ==Career statistics== {   center;\\" +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Sunderland 2008–09 Premier League 00colspan=2—00colspan=2—00 - 2009–10 Premier League 001000colspan=2—10 - 2010–11 Premier League 00colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—00 - 2011–12 Premier League 000000colspan=2—00 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !001000colspan=2—10 - Carlisle United (loan) 2008–09 League One 22010colspan=2—colspan=2—230 - Leyton Orient (loan) 2010–11 League One 10colspan=2—000010 - Gateshead (loan) 2010–11 Conference Premier 232colspan=2—colspan=2—50282 - Accrington Stanley (loan) 2011–12 League Two 120colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—120 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Accrington Stanley 2012–13 League Two320301000360 - 2013–14 League Two190002010220 - 2014–15 League Two150400000190 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !780703010890 - Dunston UTS 2015–16 Northern League Div One100colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—100 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Blyth Spartans 2016–17 Northern Premier League         390 - 2017–18 National League North 33200colspan=2—10342 - 2018–19 National League North 32130colspan=2—41392 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !65330  511124 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Darlington 2019–20For FA Cup qualifying rounds: For FA Trophy third qualifying round: National League North 21140colspan=2—40291 - 2020–21For FA Cup qualifying rounds: National League North 2021colspan=2—0041 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !23161colspan=2—40332 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !2226181301512978 } ==References * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Hounslow Category:English footballers Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland under-21 international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Gateshead F.C. players Category:Accrington Stanley F.C. players Category:Dunston UTS F.C. players Category:Blyth Spartans A.F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Northern Premier League players ","title":"Michael Liddle"},{"id":"20222654","text":"Calliostoma gloriosum, common name the glorious topsnail, is a species of small sea snail with gills and an operculum, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calliostomatidae, the calliostoma top snails.

It is a major mixed-use regeneration scheme, with a total area of as of 2018. The development has generated controversy since its inception in 2003. Over the years, opposition has been levelled against its lack of care towards existing important built heritage, lack of integration with local small businesses and arts organisations and even its brand name, and much of its existence so far has been in the context of an arson attack on one of the existing buildings in 2004, while under the ownership of the developers. == Concept and scope == The Northern Ireland Department for Social Development (DSD) first coined the name \\"North East Quarter\\" in their masterplan for the area published in 2005. During the project's life so far it has been proposed and redesigned a number of times, while under the ownership of different companies. In 2006 Royal Exchange (Ltd), a consortium made up of Leaside Investments Ltd (itself a partnership of Ewart Properties and Snoddon Ltd) and Dutch firm ING Real Estate, were initially chosen by the DSD as preferred developer for the site.  Ewart Properties  Under Ewart Properties, the Royal Exchange development was announced as a £360 million retail-led mixed use regeneration scheme, which was to include premium brand shopping, living and complementary amenities. The concept was based on the development of a new department store alongside two further major stores, complementary high quality retail, restaurants, bars, cafes, apartments and offices (at upper levels). A hotel was to be located between Lower North Street and Church Street, with frontages onto Lower North Street, Church Street and Writers' Square. It was proposed that a 700-space, two-level basement car park would be located between Lower North Street and Donegall Street, also providing a service area for the hotel and department store. The car park was to be accessed and exited from Lower North Street. Cultural accommodation was proposed within the former Northern Bank building, which was identified for a small theatre, studios, community art gallery with a small amount of speciality retail. The total floor area of the scheme was in the region of which included approximately of retail. The development later grew to a total size of .  Castlebrooke Investments  Under Castlebrooke Investments, the project grew further, to a total of 1.4, and later . The scope of the project was now to focus more on residential and office space than the retail-led proposals previously submitted, while adding a second hotel to the plan. As of May 2018, two proposals are currently in effect: * Phase 1b comprises office (), retail (), cafe/restaurant (), residential (6 units) and community use () and associated public realm and landscaping. The proposed location covers lands bounded by Royal Avenue, Rosemary Street, North Street and Lower Garfield Street. * An overall planning application named the Former Royal Exchange, covering lands bounded by Royal Avenue – York Street and Church Street to the north, Royal Avenue to the west, Rosemary Street and High Street to the south and Donegall Street to the east. A triangle of land bounded by Royal Avenue, Lower Garfield Street and North Street lies outside the application site boundary. The application calls for demolition and redevelopment of a large number of structures in the area. ==Development history== Ewart Properties, 1999–2015 In 1999, Ewart Properties and John Laing/MECP proposed the \\"Gateway Project\\" which would combine land owned by Ewart in the North East Quarter of Belfast City Centre with John Laing/MEPC's proposed extension of CastleCourt into Smithfield. The joint project was dropped when the DSD chose Victoria Square as its preferred comprehensive regeneration project. In July 2003 the DSD published their Belfast City Centre Regeneration Policy Statement. It was adopted by the DSD in April 2004. In April 2004, a major segment of the existing buildings in the area, the North Street Arcade, was subjected to an arson attack which destroyed the businesses and decor inside the building, while leaving the structure and its two façades intact. A number of suspects were questioned by police in relation to the incident, but no one was prosecuted. In June 2004 the DSD reviewed developer proposals for the North East Quarter and performed an appraisal against the newly-adopted RPS. It found that none of the proposals fulfilled the objectives of the RPS, however having reviewed a proposal by Leaside Investments Ltd and ING Real Estate, in autumn 2004 the DSD gave the consortium first refusal as to future development of the area. In August 2005 the DSD published a masterplan for the North East Quarter. In September 2005 the DSD reviewed projects submitted to them for the Royal Exchange and redevelopment of nearby CastleCourt shopping centre. On 28 March 2006 the Royal Exchange development was chosen as the preferred development, and Royal Exchange Ltd (a consortium of Leaside Investments Ltd and ING Real Estate) was chosen by the DSD as preferred developer for the site. The scheme was announced by the government on 28 March 2006 and was expected to be completed by 2011. In February 2008 the DSD announced that they had agreed heads of terms with the developers. In November 2008 Belfast City Council gave William Ewart properties and Snoddons Construction 9 months to bring forward plans. The council said that it had yet to hear any proposals. In December 2009 a development agreement was signed to develop the North East Quarter as a mixed- use project called Royal Exchange. Leaside Investments commented on the agreement, to say that \\"the company has been acquiring properties in the area for almost 20 years and to date has invested £40m to get to this stage\\". Leaside Investments submitted the Royal Exchange planning application to the Department of the Environment's Planning Service in October 2010. In September 2012 the scheme was approved by Environment Minister Alex Attwood. ING Real Estate had withdrawn from the Royal Exchange Ltd consortium some time beforehand. In an announcement regarding the approval being granted, the minister stopped short of providing a timescale for the project, due to the economic climate at the time. Under this approval, redevelopment of properties on Garfield Street began. Cerberus Capital Management, 2015–2016 In May 2015 a portfolio of property loans, including loans associated with Royal Exchange, were purchased from RBS Capital Resolution (Ulster Bank) by an entity affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management. The development agreement between the DSD and Leaside Investments Ltd was terminated in November 2015. The Department for Social Development admitted that the project had been abandoned, and that in the meantime it had commissioned a study to \\"examine the relationship between retail, leisure and commercial office investment in the continuing regeneration of Belfast\\". Castlebrooke Investments, 2016–present In January 2016, the scheme and all associated properties were bought from Cerberus Capital Management by London-based Castlebrooke Investments, who appointed architects Chapman Taylor to draw up new plans for the development. In October 2016, two companies associated with Castlebrooke Investments, PG Ltd and Savills, submitted a planning application to vary the conditions of the originally granted Royal Exchange planning permission. Permission was granted by the Department for Infrastructure in January 2017. In February and June 2017, Castlebrooke Investments held public consultation events on a proposed scheme bound by Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Lower Garfield Street and High Street. In September 2017 PG Ltd and Savills submitted a planning application proposing redevelopment of the area known as Phase 1b (lands bound by Royal Avenue, Rosemary Street, North Street and Lower Garfield Street). In October 2017 a further application was submitted encompassing the full area as far as Donegall Street to the west, Rosemary Street and High Street to the south and Royal Avenue – York Street and Church Lane to the north. On 17 March 2018, Belfast City Council approved the Phase 1b development almost in its entirety. The only application not approved at the time was for partial demolition of the boundary wall to the First Presbyterian Church on Rosemary Street. Tribeca Belfast re- launch In November 2018, Castlebrooke Investments announced that it was re-branding the development \\"Tribeca Belfast\\", mirroring developments of the same name in New York and Liverpool, and based on an acronym of a description of the area; the \\"triangle beside the cathedral\\". The announcement was met with widespread criticism, including from Belfast Lord Mayor, Deirdre Hargey, and from Amnesty International NI, that it was not representative of the heritage of the city, nor its people. The director of Castlebrooke Investments, Estelle Hunt, defended the name, saying that a project of this scale in Belfast in an important location will \\"always attract a lot of debate\\". She said, \\"we believe (Tribeca Belfast) reflects the aspirations of the city and feel this will place Belfast in the strongest position for a sustainable and successful future.\\" On re-launching the scheme, Hunt stated that \\"we have refocused... and increased the office and residential offering, placing the emphasis on Belfast as one of the most desirable places in the world to live and work... In due course we will be engaging with the people of Belfast to discuss our detailed proposals for the site.\\" In January 2019 an official motion against the name was passed by Belfast City Council as it was felt that it was \\"not suitable for Belfast\\". The motion was supported by cross-party representatives including the DUP and Sinn Féin. == Opposition to the project == Although efforts to revitalise the area have been welcomed, the plans lodged by William Ewart in 2003 were widely criticised by arts groups and residents, who feared it would do little to regenerate the area. Highlighted concerns included the substantial loss of listed heritage buildings and the demolition of buildings within the Cathedral Conservation Area and City Centre Conservation Area.  North Street Arcade  As of 2017 the scheme includes the demolition of the listed 1936 North Street Arcade by Cowser and Smyth (with retention only of its façades). This building, with a distinctive curved plan form, is the only example of a 1930s shopping arcade in Northern Ireland, and is one of only a handful left in the whole of the UK. The North Street Arcade was badly damaged as a result of an arson attack in April 2004, while under the ownership of the developers at the time when it housed 23 arts organisations and independent traders; and the Cathedral Quarter area was seen as the traditional home of arts organisations in the city. Criticism has also been placed on the planned retail scheme because of its supposed conflict with public policy in terms of traffic in the city centre, urban living, conservation of buildings and public consultation.  Save the Cathedral Quarter  A new organisation named \\"Save the Cathedral Quarter\\" was created in opposition to the proposed plans. The Cathedral Quarter Steering Group also raised opposition, as did the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society (UAHS), which has been prominent in pushing for better restoration-based approaches and in particular the retention of the North Street Arcade. In 2005 the UAHS placed the arcade on its first Buildings At Risk Register for Northern Ireland (BARNI), where it remains as of 2018. Despite numerous versions of plans and applications being produced since 2003, and changes in hands of the owners and developers, the views of the campaign groups have not been fully addressed, and Save the Cathedral Quarter continues to fight against the proposals. In 2017 after new plans were drawn up by Chapman Taylor for current owners Castlebrooke Investments, traders raised fears of being pushed out of the area, and Belfast playwright Martin Lynch also added his voice to the campaign. When Castlebrooke Investments' plans were approved in March 2018, the campaign groups vowed to continue to fight against the development. In November 2018, when the project was re-launched as \\"Tribeca Belfast\\", Save the Cathedral Quarter added their criticism to widespread derision of the new name, stating that it was \\"nothing more than a superficial branding exercise\\". Rebekah McCabe, chair of the organisation, stated that despite the rebrand, the content of the proposed redevelopment plans hadn't changed, including plans to demolish a \\"series of non-listed heritage buildings\\" as well as its concerns over the \\"displacement of a thriving community of local artists and traders\\" and therefore the organisation maintained the objections it had been raising since its formation. == See also == * North Street Arcade * Victoria Square == References  Further reading == * * == External links == * Royal Exchange page on Future Belfast * Save the Cathedral Quarter * Castlebrooke Investments – Belfast * Communities NI (formerly the Department for Social Development) Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Shopping centres in Northern Ireland Category:Planned developments ","title":"Tribeca Belfast"},{"id":"20222679","text":"Bushtricë is a village and a former municipality in Kukës County, Albania.

The surface is encircled by numerous spiral smooth riblets, their interstices closely finely obliquely striate. There are usually seven to nine riblets on the penultimate whorl, about nine on the base. The spire is conic. The apex is acute. The sutures are impressed. There are about seven, convex whorls. The body whorl is rounded (or a trifle angled) around the lower part, slightly convex beneath. The oblique aperture is rounded. The outer lip is fluted within, with a beveled opaque white submargin. The throat is pearly and iridescent;. The simple columella is arcuate. The base color is chocolate brown to mauve with light tan raised cords, and the aperture is pearly white. The apex is darked and usually purple. The shell is relatively heavy for its size, and its length and width are roughly equal. Length and width up to 24 mm.American Seashells (Second Edition, 1974), R. Tucker Abbott, p. 48, Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Calliostoma costatum) ==Distribution== Found from Alaska to San Diego, California. ==Reproduction and development== Calliostoma ligatum is a broadcast spawner. Snails spawned in the laboratory in the San Juan Islands, WA, USA, during the months of February, March, and April, but only in water that was at least 10 °C. Females release eggs in delicate strands of mucus that break down soon after release. These strands are 1-3mm wide and contain 1-4 eggs across the strand. Ten to ninety eggs are released per pulse, with multiple pulses of eggs released during each spawning event. Males release sperm as a milky white cloud. Fertilization occurs in the water. Eggs are just over 200 um in diameter, and an egg with its protective gelatinous chorion is about 750 um in diameter. Early development proceeds as the zygote undergoes cleavage in the spiral pattern typical of molluscs and other protostomes. Embryos in culture at 7-9 °C reach the trochophore larval stage in 3 days, undergo torsion in 4.5–5 days, and hatch 6 days after fertilization. Veliger larvae stop swimming and begin crawling 9.5 days after fertilization and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile snails about 12 days after fertilization. ==Ecology and behavior== This snail is found frequently on rocks in the low intertidal zone and in the shallow subtidal zone on large kelp, especially the giant kelp Macrocystis. Calliostoma eats a variety of items including the kelp it lives on as well as small sessile organisms and other material that live on rocks or kelp surfaces, including bryozoans, hydroids, diatoms, and detritus. This snail shows a remarkable range of behavioral reactions to other animals. Snails displayed a flight response with movement rates up to 10 cm/min, often accompanied by shell twisting, between 70% and 100% of the time after contact with the following predatory seastars: Leptasterias hexactis, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceus, and Evasterias troscheli. Snails either withdrew into their shells, turned away, or fled after contact with the subtidal crab Cancer oregonensis. C. ligatum showed only a weak response to contact with predatory snails, but Fusitriton oregonensis elicited the strongest response of any snail tested. Contact with F. oregonensis caused about half of the test subjects to exhibit a flight response while others either bit the predator with their radula, simply turned away, or showed no response. C. ligatum frequently uses its radula to rasp on, i.e., bite, its non-predators. C.ligatum bit the non-predatory seastar Henricia leviuscula every time they came into contact with each other. After making initial contact the snail reared up, extended its head forward and visibly rasped the upper body wall of H. leviuscula with its radula. This caused the sea star to move off. C. ligatum similarly uses its radula to bite, i.e., rasp, on the seastars Solaster stimpsoni about 60% of the time, and Dermasterias imbricata about 40% of the time. C. ligatum also routinely bit (rasped) the snails Ceratostoma foliatum, Searlesia dira and Amphissa columbiana which caused these snails to move away from C. ligatum. ==References * https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/6867/Lane.PDF?sequence=1 * Calliostoma ligatum (Gould, 1849).

He won five caps for Wales. After retiring from play, he became the longest serving president of the Welsh Rugby Union, and was one of six representatives that formed the International Rugby Board. == Playing career == Lyne played most of his club rugby with Newport, spending 8 seasons there between 1878 and 1885. He captained Newport in his final full season in 1883/1884. Lyne was first selected for Wales during the 1883 Home Nations Championship in an away match at Raeburn Park to Scotland. It was the first time the two teams had played each other, and Wales, under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, lost by three goals to one. Lyne played in the next four Welsh games, including all three games of the 1884 Championship, and the opening game of the 1885 Championship against England at St Helens in Swansea. He retired from playing in 1885, but continued his association with the game when he refereed the match between England and Ireland in 1885. International matches played WalesSmith (1980), pg 469. * 1884, 1885 * 1883, 1884 * 1884 ==Administrative career== While still a player, Lyne took a clear interest in the affairs of Welsh rugby; and on his retirement from play, began applying for administrative posts. In 1887, Lyne and WRU secretary Richard Mullock became the Welsh representatives to the International Board, the body set up to regulate the sport in Britain.Smith (1980), pg 50. Lyne served on the board of the IB, which later became the International Rugby Board, from 1887 to 1938. He was in demand as an administrator, and was known to be very fair- minded.Smith (1980), pg 51. He was also a progressive thinker, and voiced concerns about the North of England breaking away from the IRB years before the formation of rugby league. As the chair of the Welsh Football Union, he met with Neath secretary Walter E. Rees, with whom he later ran the WRU for near four decades. In 1892, Lyne was elected one of four vice-presidents of the WRU, with joint responsibilities for Cardiff and the East area. During the same meeting, Mullock, who was extremely unpopular with the Welsh rugby clubs, was replaced as secretary by William Gwynn.Smith (1980), pg 78. In 1906, Lyne replaced Sir John T. Llewellyn as the President of the Welsh Rugby Union—a role he held until 1947, making him the longest serving president. He was succeeded by Sir David Rocyn-Jones. Lyne was also the Chairman of Newport Athletic Club from 1894 to 1949. == Bibliography == * * == References == Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Rugby union forwards Category:Rugby union players from Newport, Wales Category:Newport RFC players Category:1860 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Welsh rugby union referees Category:Wales Rugby Union officials ","title":"Horace Lyne"},{"id":"20222698","text":"Fortescue Leo Ash was the fourth Anglican Bishop of Rockhampton in Australia from 1928 until 1946.The Times, 3 November 1927; pg. 17; Issue 44729; col D Ecclesiastical News- New Bishop of Rockhampton Ash was born in Singleton, New South Wales on 26 August 1882\\"Who was Who\\" 1897-1990 London, A & C Black, 1991 educated at St. Paul's College, Sydney and ordained in 1910.

In his teenage years he had trials for clubs as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan, and England. He was under contract at Birmingham City, Barnet and Japanese side Machida Zelvia. He joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain in summer 2009. From there he was sent out to Worcester City, Jerez Industrial, Doncaster Rovers, and Oxford United to gain first team experience. In June 2011 he signed with Port Vale via Hyde (partners of the Hoddle Academy). He left Port Vale in April 2013 after falling out with the club's management, and signed with Newport County for the 2013–14 season. After over 18 months out of the game, he signed with Sutton United in February 2016, and was an influential presence in midfield, helping the club to win promotion as champions of National League South at the end of the 2015–16 season, he left the club in December 2016 and joined Eastleigh for a brief spell four months later. ==Career== Early career Born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Burge scored 60 goals in a single season for Cheltenham YMCA as a child. He later spent a year at West Bromwich Albion, before playing alongside Daniel Sturridge at Cadbury Athletic. He also had a spell with Coventry City, and trialled for Ajax in the Netherlands, before trialling with Manchester United. Birmingham City After being tracked by both Manchester United and Manchester City, he began his professional career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract at the age of 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge was released by Birmingham in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford United and League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009. Searching for a new club In February 2009, Burge travelled to Japan, the birthplace of his step-mother, in the hope of securing a contract with a J-League club. He spent a week trialling with Division Two side Avispa Fukuoka, followed by a trial period at Division One outfit Oita Trinita. Top-flight sides F.C. Tokyo and Sagan Tosu also expressed an interest in Burge, as he was tested at Kokushikan University against players such as Hidetoshi Nakata. He later joined third-tier side Machida Zelvia, where he made a handful of appearances. Burge said that the clubs in Japan appreciate inexperienced but technical players and \\"they don't just go for big lumps that head it and kick people\\". Glenn Hoddle Academy In July 2009, Burge was forced to return to England in order to renew his visa to stay in Japan. He participated in a pre-season friendly against Malmesbury Victoria for Conference Premier side Forest Green Rovers. He was offered a contract, but rejected it and joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain on a two-year deal, stating he felt it would help to improve his technical skill. Burge scored the quickest goal in the academy's history, netting against Spanish side San Fernando after just 12 seconds. In March 2010, Burge played once for Conference South club Worcester City, by arrangement with the Academy. In the 2010–11 season, Burge played for Jerez Industrial, the Spanish Tercera División club connected with the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He became established in central midfield after he recovered from numerous injury problems. He was sent off twice in 13 games and won the club's Player of the Month award for October 2010. They were in contention for promotion to the Segunda División B when a November 2010 article on the BBC Sport website described Burge as \\"the current star of the side\\". Doncaster Rovers Burge moved to Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a short-term deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February 2011. That was to be his only appearance for the club. On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan for the rest of the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal. Hyde to Port Vale In June 2011 he signed a two-year deal with Micky Adams' Port Vale. The League Two club had to pay Hyde a small undisclosed fee, as the Conference North side secured his contract from their partnership with the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He missed the start of the 2011–12 season with a knee injury, and in November 2011 it was revealed that he would have to undergo surgery to correct the problem. He did not feature in matchday squads for the rest of the season, and was transfer listed in May 2012. The door to the first team remained open though, after Burge had an encouraging and injury-free pre-season. He came off the bench on 14 August 2012 – his first competitive game for twelve months – and \\"pulled the strings to help Vale control the second half\\" in a League Cup defeat to Championship side Burnley. He made his long-awaited league debut at Vale Park four days later, replacing Chris Shuker 79 minutes into a 3–0 win over Barnet. Despite some impressive cameo appearances from the bench, a streak of wins kept Burge out of the first eleven until 29 September 2012, when he made his first league start for the club at Valley Parade, in a 1–0 win over Bradford City. He scored his first goal for the club in the Football League Trophy at the Bescot Stadium; his 20-yard left-footed strike helped Vale to battle to a 2–2 draw with Walsall, though he missed his penalty in the shoot-out victory. He opened the scoring in a 2–2 home draw with York City on 17 November 2012, and was selected on the League Two Team of the Week for his performance. He established himself in central midfield over the New Year with \\"a string of impressive performances\\". However, on 12 March 2013 he missed a pre-match team meal, but claimed he made his own way for the match against Bristol Rovers, only to be informed that he was not in the matchday squad when he was just five minutes away from Bristol. He took to Twitter to put his side of the story across, and an angry Micky Adams responded by saying Burge's tweets were \\"absolute nonsense and he's going to be disciplined\\". Burge was suspended for two weeks for breaking the club's \\"social media guidelines\\" after club management claimed he refused to apologise for the incident. On 12 April 2013, with three games left of the season, Burge left the club by mutual consent. Club chairman Paul Wildes stated that \\"this has been a difficult decision for both parties\\". Vale secured promotion into League One at the end of the 2012–13 season, and users of fan site One Vale Fan voted him one of their three Players of the Season. Newport County Burge was linked with a move to Peterborough United in May 2013, though also stated that \\"I am confident I could do a job at Championship level\\". He also had a trial spell with Burnley. He eventually signed a contract with League Two side Newport County on 30 August 2013. Illness and injuries limited his contribution at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. He impressed in central midfield during the second half of the campaign and manager Justin Edinburgh was reported to have opened talks to extend Burge's stay at Rodney Parade beyond the summer. Despite these reports, Burge left the club in May 2014. In June 2014 he was reported to have agreed terms with South African side Bidvest Wits of the Premier Soccer League, but the move was never completed. He had a trial with Cheltenham Town in March 2015, and impressed in a reserve game against Plymouth Argyle after being out injured for the season, but the club was unable to offer him a contract. Sutton United In February 2016, Burge signed with National League South club Sutton United on a contract running until summer 2017. He contributed three goals in five games as the U's won promotion into the National League as champions of the Southern Division in 2015–16. He was forced to miss the rest of the season after his ankle ligaments were damaged from a heavy challenge he received during a 2–0 win at Wealdstone on 22 March. Burge made his National League debut in a 1–1 draw with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 9 August. On 9 December 2016, Burge was released by Sutton United as he looked to continue his career nearer to his Cheltenham home. Eastleigh Burge signed with National League side Eastleigh on 13 March 2017; caretaker-manager Richard Hill said that \\"he likes to pass the ball and move well\\". He played five games for the \\"Spitfires\\" before being sidelined with an ankle injury. At the age of 28, Burge applied for the vacant managerial post at Port Vale following the dismissal of Michael Brown in September 2017. ==Style of play== Keith Downing described Burge as \\"aggressive\\" and that he is \\"technically good and has a good frame\\". After arriving at Port Vale in June 2011, Vale manager Micky Adams stated, \\"Ryan is a creative central midfielder and will bring plenty of quality on the ball, but he is also a very hard-working individual\\". Neil Duncanson, the Glenn Hoddle Academy's commercial director said: \\"Ryan is very strong, powerful and suited to the front of a diamond in central midfield. He's a creative player who can take an excellent dead ball\\". Burge has said of himself that \\"I'm a midfield player who likes to put my foot in, as well as to get on the ball and create things. I try to be an all-round midfield player and do a bit of everything\\". ==Business career== Burge set up his own fashion label, Ten Club London, and sold the naming rights to American rock band Pearl Jam in 2018. ==Personal life== His grandfather, Rod Burge, was a member of Cheltenham Town's board of directors for over 25 years before his death in April 2014. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Birmingham City2005–06Premier League0000000000 - 2006–07Championship0000000000 - 2007–08Premier League0000000000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 - Barnet2008–09League Two1000000010 - Worcester City2009–10Conference South1000000010 - Jerez Industrial2010–11Tercera División Group X132000000132 - Doncaster Rovers2010–11Championship1000000010 - Oxford United (loan)2010–11League Two5000000050 - Hyde2011–12Conference North0000000000 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Port Vale2011–12League Two0000101020 - 2012–13League Two302201021353 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !30!!2!!2!!0!!2!!0!!3!!1!!37!!3 - Newport County2013–14League Two172000000172 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Sutton United2015–16National League South5300000053 - 2016–17National League120100000130 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !17!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!18!!3 - Eastleigh2016–17National League5000000050 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !90!!9!!3!!0!!2!!0!!3!!1!!98!!10 } ==Honours== Port Vale *League Two third-place promotion: 2012–13 Sutton United *National League South: 2015–16 ==Notes== ::a.

The Company undertakes a wide variety of maintenance and repair work on commercial and military ships with projects ranging from a two-day alongside repair period through to multimillion UK pound conversion projects lasting for a year or more. ==History== The Company was established in 1971 as A&P-Appledore; International Ltd (APA), a joint venture technology transfer consultancy between British shipbuilding companies Austin & Pickersgill and Appledore Shipbuilders, and focused on ship design and construction. Initially the business was directed towards the growing Far East market, as well as the Americas and Europe. Based on the production engineering solutions developed for the innovative 'ship factory' at Appledore in the late 1960s, and subsequently at Pallion, Sunderland, APA developed the formal Build Strategy approach. This was taken up by Hyundai when they developed the first modern shipyard in South Korea at Ulsanin the 1970s. The Build Strategy template was subsequently adopted in British Shipbuilders' other shipyards, and in the USA. Following sale of Appledore Shipbuilders to the Government at the time of the collapse of its parent Court Line in 1974, and the subsequent nationalisation of Austin & Pickersgill in 1977, the shareholding of APA was purchased by its management. APA acquired the shiprepair facilities of Falmouth Docks & Engineering Company in 1984 and they remain one of the Company's two major centres. The Company subsequently focused on shiprepairs rather than shipbuilding,A&P; Group: Home page becoming A&P; Group in 1995The Manufacturer and being acquired by Royal Bank Development Capital in 1997. Over the years the Company has operated shiprepair facilities in many parts of the world. From the mid-1970s until privatisation in 1994, the Neorion shiprepair yard on Syros was managed for the Greek Government. Dubai Drydocks opened in 1983 under APA management. The takeover of the former naval dockyard at Gibraltar as \\"Gibrepair\\" in 1985 was short-lived, a victim of local social politics. In 2001 the A&P; acquired Cammell Laird's shipyards at Birkenhead, Teesside and TynesideA&P; Holdings acquires Cammell Laird Holdings In 2005 A&P; sold the Birkenhead yard to Northwestern Shiprepairers & Shipbuilders and closed its facilities in Southampton (King George V Dock) and the four dock complex in Wallsend, near Newcastle upon Tyne, in order to focus all ship repair activity in its newer facilities in Hebburn (A&P; Tyne), A&P; Tees at Middlesbrough was also retained to support the important Southern North Sea offshore oil and gas operations and dredging contractors; the strategically situated Falmouth operation (A&P; Falmouth) was also retained. In 2009 A&P; was fully acquired by Cardiff property developer Bailey Group; that company had previously acquired a 50% stake in 2006. In 2011 APA was acquired by Atlantic & Peninsula Marine Services, which also has an interest in Cammell Laird. ==Current operations== As one of only two remaining significant commercial ship repair companies in the United Kingdom, along with Cammell Laird, A&P; Group has become a centre of excellence for ship owners and managers operating in North West Europe and continues to grow a profitable and successful business employing over 1,000 skilled staff (678 employees in 2013 plus agency workersCompany Check) in the North East and South West of England.

His trial was successful and he signed for Wimbledon, where he stayed until the club went into administration and the youth team disbanded due to the club's move to Milton Keynes. He was spotted as a fourteen-year-old by Arsenal playing for Fulham and joined after successfully completing a six-week trial, along with former Wimbledon teammates Kieran Gibbs and James Dunne. He started a scholarship with the club in the summer of 2006, and came to prominence in the 2006–07 FA Youth Cup run, where Arsenal were seconds away from reaching the final. It was during this period that Arsenal converted Ogogo from a central midfielder to a right back. In September 2007, he signed his first professional contract with the club on a two-year deal. It was the first time that all the second-year scholars had received professional contracts. He remained a regular in the reserves and also featured twice on the bench in League Cup games. In October 2008, Ogogo joined Championship side Nottingham Forest on a two-week trial from Arsenal along with James Dunne and Paul Rodgers, with the view to a permanent deal. He featured in a reserve game victory over Shrewsbury Town but failed to earn a deal with Forest. In November 2008 he joined League Two side Barnet on a one-month loan. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. He scored his first goal in senior football when he slotted home a Kenny Gillet cross in a 3–1 defeat to bottom of the table Luton Town. He then went on to receive a second booking and a subsequent red card. Later on in the month, his loan was extended for a further month until January, and then later extended until the end of the season. His Barnet career ended in disastrous fashion as he was sent off for handball in the final game of the season against Port Vale. He made a total of nine appearances for the club scoring once. In May 2009, it was announced that he would be released by Arsenal, after failing to make a breakthrough at the club. Dagenham & Redbridge In June 2009, he signed for League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge on a two-year contract, as a direct replacement for Danny Foster who had recently departed to Brentford. His Daggers career got off to an indifferent start with Ogogo gaining a reputation for getting sent off. When Ogogo was sent off against Macclesfield Town in October 2009, he was consigned to a spell on the bench after the Daggers replaced him with loan signing Seth Nana Twumasi. He made his debut for the club in August 2009, in a 2–1 win at Crewe Alexandra, replacing Jon Nurse as a substitute on the right wing. When he returned to the side in a match against Shrewsbury Town, he came close to another red card following another reckless challenge. Ogogo admitted he learned the hard way, waiting for his chance and slowly cemented his place at right back in the Daggers side as they pushed for the play-offs. He featured for the side in the 2010 League Two play-off Final win over Rotherham United at Wembley Stadium. In August 2010, he signed a new two-year contract extension with the Daggers. He took his impressive form into the club's maiden season in League One, showing his ability to play at a higher level during the 2010–11 season. However, he could not save the Daggers from relegation on the final game of the season in a 5–0 defeat to Peterborough United. He continued to be a first team regular as the Daggers struggled on their return to League Two finishing in the bottom half of the table. In July 2012, he committed to another three- year contract with the club, after impressive for a third successive campaign. He was also appointed captain, succeeding from departing skipper Mark Arber. It was during the 2012–13 season that he was moved from right back to central midfield under new manager Wayne Burnett, after he convinced the manager for the opportunity to switch. However, the club struggled and had to battle for Football League survival, which came as a surprise to Ogogo. He went on to make his 200th appearance for the Daggers in February 2014, in a 1–1 draw with Burton Albion. In April 2014, Ogogo claimed the supporters' and club Player of the Year awards, after scoring nine goals during the campaign. In his final season for the club he made 39 appearances, with an injury set-back preventing him from making more appearances. In May 2015, it was announced that Ogogo would leave Dagenham & Redbridge in June 2015 when his contract expired as he wished to move on from the club. Shrewsbury Town On 1 June 2015 Ogogo signed a two-year deal with Shrewsbury Town, stepping back up to League One. He became a first-team regular, making his Shrewsbury debut on the opening day against Millwall, and scoring his first goal for the club in a 2–0 home win over Bury. His second goal of the season, an injury time effort against Grimsby Town in an FA Cup second-round replay, finally broke the deadlock after the preceding 180 goalless minutes in the tie, to set up a third-round trip to Cardiff City. With Shrewsbury successfully avoiding relegation with one match to spare in their first season back in League One, Ogogo made more appearances for the club than any other player, and won both the Players' Player of the Year and overall Player of the Year awards for his consistent displays in midfield during 2015–16. The following season, Ogogo became more of a peripheral figure in the final weeks of Micky Mellon's management at the club, but was almost ever-present in the first few months under new manager Paul Hurst, who praised him for his infectious good attitude. He suffered a knee injury in February 2017 likely to keep him out for the remainder of the season, although despite this the club opted to extend his contract until summer 2018, during his rehabilitation period. Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Ogogo was appointed team captain, alongside club captain Mat Sadler. Coventry City After rejecting a contract offer to stay at Shrewsbury Town, Abu Ogogo agreed a three-year contract to join newly-promoted League One side Coventry City on 26 June 2018. Bristol Rovers On 31 January 2019, Ogogo joined League One rivals Bristol Rovers on a free transfer, and made his debut two days later in a 2–1 away win at Southend United, playing the whole match.

It was founded in 1883 and was named after S.R. Peale of Lock Haven.http://www.peale.org/ An excerpt from The Raftman's Journal, published on August 20, 1885, describes more in-depth what the town was like: :The town of Peale is located on the line of the Beech Creek Railroad 75 miles west of Williamsport. It was named after S.R. Peale of Lock Haven and is owned, and everything in it too, by the coal company. Two years ago the ground was a wilderness; today there are nearly 300 buildings and a population of 2,500 souls in the place, every one of whom is employed or dependent upon those employed by the coal or railroad company. :The town was built on a hill above Moravian Run. It is divided in two by a small tributary stream. The place is laid out with all the regularity of a city. Down in the ravine, at the foot of town are the slaughter houses, while all the stables drain into the little stream running through the center. A reservoir in back of town distributes pure water into every street and to every house in the place. The houses are 2 story frame buildings painted brick red; wainscoted to 4 ft. and plastered throughout; three rooms on the first floor, 2 or 3 on the second. They rent for $4.25 - $6.75 per month including water. Altogether they are the most comfortable miners' cabins seen throughout the county and the rent is not high for a man earning $9 – $12 per week. The site of the Oakwood Cemetery is one of the few distinguishable sites left in what was once a thriving coal mining town—and \\"distinguishable\\" is a very loose term. The cemetery only has one marked grave remaining, belonging to Martha Renfrew, aged 14yrs, 11mos at the time of her death. == References == Category:Geography of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania Category:Ghost towns in Pennsylvania Category:Company towns in Pennsylvania ","title":"Peale, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"20222875","text":"Kolsh may refer to two villages in Albania: *Kolsh, Kukës, in the Kukës municipality *Kolsh, Lezhë, in the Lezhë municipality ","title":"Kolsh"},{"id":"20222877","text":"François Guillaume (born 19 October 1932 in Ville-en-Vermois) is a French politician.

It is also known as the Moluccan babirusa, golden babirusa or hairy babirusa. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the Buru Babirusa has relatively long thick, gold-brown body- hair – a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas. In absence of detailed data on the Buru babirusa, it is generally assumed that its habitat and ecology are similar to that of North Sulawesi babirusa (B. celebensis). Furthermore, as all babirusas were considered conspecific under the scientific name B. babyrussa until 2001, data collected before that is consistently listed under the name B. babyrussa, though the vast majority actually refers to B. celebensis (by far the best known species of babirusa). Babirusas tend to occupy tropical rainforests, river banks and various natural ponds rich in water plants. They are omnivorous and feed on various leaves, roots, fruits, invertebrates and small vertebrates. Their jaws and teeth are strong enough to crack any kind of nuts. Babirusas lack the rostral bone in their nose, which is a tool used by other wild pigs for digging. Therefore, they prefer feeding on roots in soft muddy or sandy soils. Cannibalism was reported among babirusas, feeding on the young of their own species or other mammals. North Sulawesi babirusas form groups with up to a dozen of individuals, especially when raising their young. Older males might live individually. The north Sulawesi babirusa reach sexual maturity when they are 5–10 months old. Their estrous cycle is 28–42 days, and the gestation period lasts 150–157 days. The females have two rows of teats and will give birth to 1–2 piglets weighing 380–1050 grams and measuring 15–20 cm, which they will nurse until the age of 6–8 months. The lifespan is about 24 years. The Buru babirusa has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as its habitat is restricted a total area of , and its gradual loss due to logging. Hunting by the local population is another cause of concern. Whereas it is unpopular among Muslim communities for religious reasons, it is widely hunted by the indigenous people of Buru, which are predominantly Christian. The meat of the Buru babirusa has low fat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy. It is also preferred by the locals to the meat of other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavor. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km²) and Waeapo (50 km²), partly aim at preserving the habitat of the Buru babirusa. This species also enjoys full protection under Indonesian law since 1931. ==References== Category:Pigs Category:Mammals of Indonesia Category:Mammals described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Endemic fauna of Indonesia ","title":"Buru babirusa"},{"id":"20222881","text":"Funny Face is a 1957 musical film.

Gold in London, specializing in entirely British fare, painstakingly renovating the historic building in the process. They ran this business for several years before moving to live close to Casablanca in Morocco. ==Early life and work== Safia Nafisa Shah is the daughter of the well-known author and teacher in the Sufi mystical tradition, Idries Shah; the twin sister of writer, journalist and documentary maker, Tahir Shah, and the younger sister of the writer, reporter and documentary filmmaker, Saira Shah. Her mother is of Indian Parsi ethnicity. Educated at Bryanston School in Dorset, England, Shah went on to study at the Sorbonne and University of Grenoble in France. She has worked for the London-based Institute for Cultural Research as a research assistant and editor and worked with Afghan refugees in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, as well as reporting on social issues there. She is also a freelance writer and has edited for the Institute of Health Sciences.Biographical detail from Amazon Retrieved on 2008-11-14.For further biography, see: The World's Who's Who of Women, 1993, under Safia Shah. Safia Shah's sister, Saira Shah, worked with Safia's future husband, Ian Thomas, and the couple met through her and eventually married at Marylebone Road register office in London. Safia Shah and Ian Thomas have both worked for the American news agency, Associated Press Television, as journalists and producers. ==A. Gold== Safia Shah (now Safia Thomas) and her husband Ian Thomas left the world of television journalism in April 2000 to found and run the traditional delicatessen and grocer A. Gold selling traditional British fare, in Brushfield Street, opposite Spitalfields Market, not far from Brick Lane, famous for its curries, in London E1. Selling the likes of Banbury cakes, Campbell's Perfect Tea and elderflower wine, it was their desire to prove that British food was something we should be proud of. The business has received local, specialist and national press coverage. According to London food writer and critic Sejal Sukhadwala, the shop is located inside what used to be Henry VIII's artillery ground, where soldiers once practised archery and musketry, and is close to Nicholas Hawksmoor's impressive 18th-century Christ Church, Spitalfields. The area is infamous for Jack the Ripper's serial murders, and the Great Fire of London. Built in 1780, the four-storey Grade II-listed house has been home in the past to diamond-cutters, furriers, boot makers, drapers and Amelia Gold, a Hungarian who ran a French millinery (hat making) business. Her 1880s shop sign is still emblazoned across the frontage and Safia and Ian Thomas have kept the name and painstakingly restored the historic building. As a result, A. Gold is handsome and old-fashioned looking, while keeping the modern efficiencies of a deli. A. Gold, which is described as \\"the village shop in the heart of London\\", has a lengthy feature in 'The Good Old Days' section of Jane Payton's book, Fabulous Food Shops (2006).Peyton, Jane, Fabulous Food Shops (Interior Angles), p46, John Wiley & Sons, 2006. . The shop was among The Independent's \\"50 Best Food Shops\\" with Lulu Grimes, food director of olive magazine and Good Food magazine recommending its sausages, cheeses, sweets and Somerset brandy. In an article picturing Safia Thomas standing outside her shop, and written a few months prior to the Economic crisis of 2008, the London Evening Standard stated that it was championing the capital's independent shops. With the world increasingly dominated by vast supermarkets and chain stores, London had lost over 7,000 individual or family-owned shops between 2002 and 2008 and small businesses were struggling to survive. ==Later life and work== Later leaving London, Safia Shah, her husband Ian Thomas, and their two children emigrated to Morocco to live close to Casablanca, where Safia's brother, the author Tahir Shah already lived. Shah currently divides her time between Morocco and England, where she and her family live on a Dutch grain barge in Surrey.

In his Introduction to the book, Idries Shah writes: : Shah's latest work, Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited, a children's book, was released on 23 October 2013. It is a children's picture book and was illustrated by Mark Reeve, known for his work on Spitting Image. The book features what Shah calls \\"endangered words,\\" or words that used to be commonly used in the English language but which have slipped from regular use. Along with the Carnaby Street book, Shah created a series of ebooks that focus on numerous endangered words. These books include: As Clear As Mud Volumes 1 and 2: The Brabbler's Guide to Idioms, and A is For Anonymuncle: The Brabbler's Endangered ABC. Short stories ‘Brown Bag’ is a short story included in the Bristol Short Story Prize Anthology 4, and has been regarded as \\"A short and sharp and very English story from Casablanca-based Safia Shah, that captures something of the zeitgeist of our modern, Internet-focused age. The storytelling is adequate throughout, but the real triumph comes right at the end, where it’s sudden and completely unexpected.\\" It describes the main character's reflections on her mother's passing, as well as on incidental memories from the past. The 20 stories collected in the Bristol Short Story Prize Anthology 4 were selected from more than 2,000 entries for the 2011 Bristol Short Story Prize. In November 2013, she released Twice Sifted, a collection of six short stories, which focus on stress-induced anxiety and the many ways in which it is manifested in the characters' lives. Twice Sifted is the first of three volumes of short stories to be released by Shah. The Knitted Taxi Safia felt that something out of the ordinary had to be done in order to launch her first picture book, Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited. This is how the Knitted Taxi came to life, thanks to the communal efforts and love for knitting which were offered by the Materialistics. Using her own London cab, this group of dexterous knitters created the designed which covered the taxi using themes taken from her Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited.

It is a book to be dipped into, excellent bedside reading.\\" Talking about both Afghan Caravan and Tahir Shah's The Middle East Bedside Book, Lessing writes in The Sufis and Idries Shah: \\"Both are full of delights; there is a great deal that is surprising; and, as with all books from that source, we are reminded of a generosity and largeness of mind in a culture that once, long ago, gave us the concept of chivalry.\\" ==Media coverage== * * * ==External links== * Octagon Press * Institute for Cultural Research * Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge * What's On at VisitSpitalfields.com ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at Bryanston School Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Grenoble Alpes University alumni Category:English editors Category:English women writers Safia Shah Category:English people of Afghan descent Category:English people of Indian descent Category:Television people from London Category:Twin people from the United Kingdom Category:English people of Parsi descent Category:People associated with The Institute for Cultural Research Category:Writers from London ","title":"Safia Shah"},{"id":"20222962","text":"Donnington Brewery The Donnington Brewery is a small brewery near the village of Donnington near Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, England. There are ten workers at the brewery and with the help of one lorry and a van they deliver 2,000 gallons of beer a week throughout the winter, rising to 3,500 in the summer. This includes three bottled beers – Light, Brown and Double D – that are non-pasteurised and sit working in the bottle for up to five weeks. Thomas Arkell began brewing at this site in 1865. The cotswold stone building, with an attached overshot waterwheel, is now a Grade II listed building. The brewery was later run by a descendant, Claude Arkell, until his death in 2007 when it passed to Claude's cousins, Peter and James from Arkell's Brewery. Donnington Brewery brews two draught beers, SBA and BB, having stopped making its Mild XXX a couple of years ago. These are sold through its 18 tied pubs around the Cotswolds.

Order of Witness Halford resigned his bishopric in Rockhampton in 1920 to establish the Order of Witness, which was a radical experiment within the Anglican church extension movement of the interwar period. Seeking to reach the men in the railway construction camps and mining camps, and the struggling families in the new soldier and immigrant settlements, Bishop Halford established an order of priests who lived very simply and were prepared to be sent anywhere a parish priest could not normally minister, living in the mining and construction camps, and bearing personal witness to their faith. To support their work, the Order obtained in 1922–1923 a small farm adjoining Christ Church, Tingalpa. The farmhouse became their Priory, and the ancient and historic little Tingalpa Church became their chapel. The priory, grounds and chapel of the Order of Witness were blessed by the Archbishop of Brisbane on 22 February 1923. The Church Chronicle of 1 March 1923:53 reported: The old church has been restored and enriched by additional ornaments and furniture. A painted figure of out Lord on the Cross hangs from the roof, and the altar is backed by dorsals and flanked by riddels of blue material. The cross and candlesticks are of silver. The whole effect is beautiful and devotional, and shows how even a little plain wooden church can be transformed into a thing of beauty and joy. Local parishioners were encouraged to attend the chapel services, and a call was made for funds to restore the building and cemetery. Early in 1927 Bishop Halford left the Diocese of Brisbane, where he had been working in the Eidsvold and Burnett River districts, to carry out similar missionary work in the Diocese of Rockhampton. It appears that the Tingalpa priory closed soon after. ==Later life== He died after a long retirement on 27 August 1948. ==Legacy== George Halford is commemorated by a memorial at St Alban's Church, Wilston. ==References==  Attribution  Category:1865 births Category:People educated at Felsted School Category:Alumni of Keble College, Oxford Category:Anglican archdeacons in Australia Category:Anglican bishops of Rockhampton Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:1948 deaths Category:Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register Category:Bush Brotherhood priests ","title":"George Halford (bishop)"},{"id":"20223060","text":"Oberst is a surname of Germanic origin, having originated as a topographic name for someone who lived in the highest part of a village or on a hillside, from Middle High German obrist, meaning ‘uppermost’ (later oberst), the superlative form of ober. == See also == * Oberst (disambiguation) == References == Category:Occupational surnames Category:Surnames ","title":"Oberst (surname)"},{"id":"20223075","text":"Asanbayev () is a Russian surname.

Munsey in 1889 and edited by John Kendrick Bangs. Frank Munsey aimed to publish \\"a magazine of the people and for the people, with pictures and art and good cheer and human interest throughout\\". Soon after its inception, the magazine was selling 40,000 copies a week. In 1891, Munsey's Weekly adopted a monthly schedule and was renamed Munsey's Magazine. In October 1893, Munsey reduced the price of the magazine from 25 cents to 10 cents, which was greatly successful. By 1895, the magazine had a circulation of 500,000 a month. It included numerous illustrations (including many by the illustrator Charles Howard Johnson) and was attacked for its \\"half-dressed women and undressed statuary\\". Some outlets refused to stock the magazine as a result, but circulation continued to grow and by 1897 had reached 700,000 per month. Circulation began to fall in 1906 and by the 1920s was down to 60,000. In October 1929, Munsey's was merged with Argosy. It immediately thereafter demerged with Argosy All-Story to form All-Story, which continued on a monthly schedule under a variety of similar titles until May 1955. == Contributors == Charles M. Relyea was among the illustrators whose work appeared in Munsey's. Tod Robbins' short story \\"Spurs\\" was published by Munsey's in 1923. It was loosely adapted into the film Freaks (1932). Mazo de la Roche, the author of the popular Jalna series, had her first story published in 1902 in Munsey's Magazine.

Whilst shooting the second season, David performed a cameo in the sequel to The Pillars of the Earth, World Without End (2012). Continuing a career on television playing morally dubious characters, Oakes had a role in The White Queen for BBC One and Starz playing George, Duke of Clarence. It was broadcast in mid-2013. In an attempt to distance himself from his \\"TV Period Bad Boy\\" image, in 2013 David played Mr Darcy in an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice at Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. He said, \\"I've been playing bad guys back to back, so Darcy's a bit of an antidote!\\" He followed this by more stage work, appearing in the world premiere of Shakespeare in Love at the Noël Coward Theatre as Christopher Marlowe. In a return to TV period dramas in 2015, Oakes guest-starred in both the third season of Endeavour with Shaun Evans and in BBC's limited series The Living and the Dead with Colin Morgan. The role of Prince Ernest, brother of Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert, went to Oakes in 2016 in the ITV series Victoria. The role reunited Oakes with his Trinity co-star Tom Hughes, and Pillars of the Earth co-star Rufus Sewell. In 2017, Oakes starred in the film adaptation of Albert Sánchez Piñol's novel Cold Skin, directed by Xavier Gens and co-starring Ray Stevenson and Aura Garrido. He also starred as Thomas Novachek in the London West End premiere of David Ives's play Venus in Fur at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. This production was directed by Patrick Marber and co-starred Natalie Dormer as Vanda.\\"Natalie Dormer will star in erotically charged West End production of Venus in Fur\\" by Alistair Foster, The Evening Standard, 12 May 2017 In 2019, Oakes continued his love for playing in open air venues by playing Hamlet at Shakespeare’s Rose Theatre, York. Critics were united in their praise of his Hamlet, saying that he “plays Hamlet with natural ease: he is clearly comfortable with the cadences of the language and he conveys meaning well.” “David Oakes’s interpretation of the Danish Prince is charming, clever and quick-witted...”, “...establishes an excellent rapport with the audience... and his final rising to the role of hero-avenger is splendidly done...” and that his performance was ”...elegant in movement, golden tongued, sometimes still, yet as likely to surprise as quicksand, witty, bright yet brittle.” Television {  - ccc; text-align:center;\\"  Year  Title  Role  Director  Channel  Notes -  rowspan=2  2008 Bonekickers  Alfred, Lord Tennyson  Iain B.

He alternated between playing Claudio and Verges alongside fellow graduate Matt Barber. * Since appearing at Shakespeare's Globe at the outset of his career, David has frequently performed in numerous rehearsed readings as part of their \\"Read Not Dead\\" initiative, including their landmark 200th reading of Philip Massinger's A New Way To Pay Old Debts; David played Wellborn alongside a cast including Benjamin Whitrow, Alan Cox, and Nicholas Rowe. * Other performances between 2008 and 2013 for \\"Read Not Dead\\" include an early quarto edition of Henry IV: Part One as Prince Hal opposite Benjamin Whitrow's Falstaff, Calderon's Life is a Dream (La Vida Es Sueno) as Segismundo, Taming Of A Shrew as Aurelias, The Spanish Tragedy as Lorenzo, The Return from Parnassus as Ingenioso, Bassianus as Geta, Gorboduc as a \\"smooth, almost oily\\" Arostus, John Lyly's Love's Metamorphosis as Montanus, and Thomas Middleton's Your Five Gallants as Tailby. * Oakes set up a theatre company called Dog Ate Cake with a long-term theatrical collaborator, Henry Bell * David was nominated for both WhatsOnStage and Broadway World awards for his performance in Shakespeare in Love in 2015. The production was also nominated for an Olivier Award. * In 2015 David starred as Banquo in a charity fundraiser for the Shakespeare Schools Festival. The event was largely improvised by the actors and lawyers involved, but based on a framework written by Jonathan Myerson. The cast also included Christopher Eccleston as Macbeth, Haydn Gwynne as Lady Macbeth, Paterson Joseph as MacDuff, and Pippa Bennett-Warner as one of the Weird Sisters. The event interrupted the events of the original play following the death of Duncan, placing Macbeth on trial for murder. David, Patterson, and Haydn appeared as witnesses for the prosecution and Christopher and Pippa as witnesses for the defence. The event was overseen by High Court Judge, Sir Michael Burton; the QCs were John Kelsey-Fry, Jonathan Laidlaw, Dinah Rose, and Ian Winter, and the foreman of the jury was Jeremy Paxman. Theatre direction Oakes has directed a number of theatre pieces alongside his acting career. In 2003 he took a stage adaptation of The Wicker Man to the Epping Forest Theatre Festival. Rehearsing in and around his hometown of Salisbury, Oakes \\"got kicked out of the [Cathedral] Close for rehearsing pagan rituals for [his] open-air production of The Wicker Man.\\" At University he directed numerous plays including Martin McDonagh's Beauty Queen of Leenane, Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter and Anthony Minghella's Whale Music. Also whilst at University in 2005, Oakes assisted director Natalie Wilson on a production of Smilin' Through that was co-produced by the Truant Company, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, and Contact Theatre, Manchester. Later that year, Oakes once again turned to literary adaptation, taking a production of Stephen King's The Boogeyman to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With his and Bell's theatre company, Dog Ate Cake, in 2009 Oakes directed a small tour revival of John Maddison Morton's Box and Cox. Oakes frequently directs at Shakespeare's Globe extending their \\"Read Not Dead\\" series, a study devoted to performing fully staged readings of the entirety of the Early Modern Canon of Drama. Most recently Oakes directed Robert Greene's The Honourable History of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay and Lewis Theobald's \\"Happy Ending\\" version of John Webster's Duchess of Malfi, \\"The Fatal Secret\\". David recently directed an extract of Robert Daborne's A Christian Turn'd Turk as part of a special \\"Read Not Dead\\" event at Shakespeare's Globe. Four directors with four scholars were teamed up with actors and presented their arguments and selected scenes at a special hustings event on Thursday 29 May 2014. Winning the event, teamed with Dr Emma Smith of Oxford University, Oakes directed the full play on Sunday 5 October 2014 in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.

His podcast Trees A Crowd is a series of informal conversations with artists, scientists and enthusiasts; a mutual celebration of the beauty of the environment and the way it inspires them as human beings. Each episode explores how the countryside has inspired their careers as they reflect on how growing up within the natural world became working for the natural world. Growing up in the New Forest and the Purbeck Jurassic Coast, David Oakes launched this podcast as a passion project to explore his lifelong fascination with the wild people and the wildlife that makes our planet its home. Oakes plays both the clarinet and bass clarinet, and is a strong bass singer. He is an avid follower of folk music, and continues to support the Bristol folk group Sheelanagig. He has an extensive collection of canoes and is currently developing a comedy pilot based on this interest. His preferred canoe method is kayak but he also enjoys Canadian canoeing. Art Oakes is an avid fine line sketcher. He is increasingly known for sketching on-set animals upon coloured pages of script reissues and giving them to production members. In May 2015 he exhibited as part of the Dulwich Artists Open House Festival alongside artist and designer Sarah Hamilton. He has also contributed a chapter on Charity Cards for Ms Hamilton's book, House of Cards. In 2016, Oakes was commissioned by Michael Howells to draw a portrait of actress Margaret Clunie, in character as Duchess Harriet Sutherland, to be used in the TV show Victoria. ==Charity Work and Advocacies== British Lung Foundation David, following his infant niece being diagnosed with a lung condition, has been heavily involved with raising awareness for and fundraising on behalf of the British Lung Foundation. In 2013, Oakes collaborated with his Borgias castmate Holliday Grainger to make the short comedy film \\"Goblin\\". Directed by Christian James, the film was screened at the 2014 Film 4 Fright Fest in their Shorts Showcase, and all profits from the sale of this film were donated to the British Lung Foundation. Later in 2014, Oakes ran the length of the country to raise awareness for infant lung diseases for both the British Lung Foundation and ChILD Lung Foundation UK. More recently he joined with the BLF to promote their new Children's Hub to provide families with information and support. Alongside this, in 2016, 2017 & 2018 he created the charity's Christmas card. Arts charities: Anno's Africa & Shakespeare Schools Festival Since 2014, Oakes has also been a friend of Anno's Africa, an arts-based charity working with Kenyan orphans and slum children, and has supported the UK based Shakespeare Schools Festival, most notably with and surrounding their \\"Trial of Macbeth\\" and \\"Trial of Richard III\\". In 2019, David helped organise, and alongside Michael Palin, Twiggy and others, appeared in the ‘Just A Book’ poster campaign on the London Underground. The campaign was created to support independent businesses and bookshops on British highstreets and also to raise funds for Anno’s Africa. The Woodland Trust and Environmental Activism Since 2019, David has been an Ambassador for the Woodland Trust. On October the 9th, 2019, David hosted a discussion at the 70th Cheltenham Literature Festival on the subject of \\"The Art of Trees\\". In the press release for the event, David said: Writing in an editorial for the Sunday Times on the 2nd of November, 2019, David said: On Thursday the 30th of January 2020, David was a co-signatory, with the CEOs of The Wildlife Trusts, the National Trust, the Woodland Trust, the RSPB, the World Wide Fund for Nature, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Buglife and Butterfly Conservation, and other notable environmental ambassadors and activist, on a letter written to Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and published in The Times, to get the UK government to rethink its stance on the second UK High Speed Rail Link along environmental and biodiversical lines. On the 21st June, 2020, David co-hosted the live-stream event, The Big Wild Quiz, for The Wildlife Trusts as part of their “30 Days Wild” campaign. And 9 days later, on the 30th of June, alongside environmentalists and activists, including Chris Packham and Ellie Goulding, David took part in the Climate Coalition's mass virtual lobby to focus the MPs to put people, climate and nature at the heart of the British nation’s recovery. ==See also== *List of British actors and actresses ==References * davidoakes.co.uk, Oakes's official website * * Dog Ate Cake Official Website * David Oakes Prints * David Oakes at the London Theatre Database Category:20th-century English male actors Category:21st-century English male actors Category:Alumni of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:English environmentalists Category:English male film actors Category:English male musical theatre actors Category:English male stage actors Category:English male television actors Category:English male voice actors Category:Living people Category:People educated at Bishop Wordsworth's School Category:People from Fordingbridge Category:English male Shakespearean actors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David Oakes"},{"id":"20223179","text":"The Broome County Sheriff's Office (BCSO), is the primary law enforcement agency for unincorporated areas of Broome County, New York, United States.

Life reconstruction of Yawunik kootenayi Megacheira (\\"great hands\\") is an extinct class of predatory arthropods that possessed a pair of great appendages, hence the class' name as well as the common name \\"great appendage arthropods\\". Their neural structures and deutocerebral appendages resemble those of chelicerates. Most of them were found in marine environments throughout the world from the lower to middle Cambrian. Megacheirans were important components of several faunas, including the Burgess, Wheeler and Maotianshan Shales Lagerstatten. == Homology of great appendages == The homology between megacheiran great appendages and cephalic appendages of other arthropods had been discussed for decades. There is controversy over whether they are homologous to both dinocaridid (radiodonts and gilled lobopodians) frontal appendages, the frontalmost appendages of Isoxys and chelicerates' chelicerae. Based on neuroanatomical evidences, many studies support their homology to chelicerae and first antennae of other arthropods (which are deutocerebral), but not dinocaridid frontal appendages (protocerebral), A 2020 study suggests that the great appendages of megacheirans and radiodonts are homologous and casts doubt on the validity of suspected neuroanatomical evidences. == Taxonomy == The monophyly of Megacheira is uncertain, and megacheirans are either suggested to be stem- group chelicerates or stem-group arthropods, with the former hypothesis based on the chelicerae-like morphology of great appendages alongside neuroanatomy and reduced labrum resembled to those of a modern chelicerate. As an example of the latter hypothesis, A study in 2020 found that Megacheria was paraphyletic, forming a grade of arthropods more derived than Dinocaridids and Isoxys, but less than crown arthropods (chelicerates + mandibulates), with Jianfengiids being more basal and the Haikoucaris + Yohoia + Leancholiids clade (Cheiromorpha) closer to crown athropods. Genera referred to the class include Yohoia, Haikoucaris, Leanchoilia, Alalcomenaeus, Yawunik, Oestokerkus, Jiangfengia, Fortiforceps, Tanglangia, Actaeus, Kootenichela, Worthenella and Sklerolibyon. Parapeytoia, which formerly misinterpreted as a radiodont was later reveal to be a member of this group. The class might also contain Enalikter aphson described from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte of the United Kingdom, and Bundenbachiellus giganteus known from the Early Devonian of Germany; although the interpretation of these taxa as megacheirans was challenged by Struck et al. (2015). The claim that Enalikter was an annelid was subsequently rebutted by some of the original authors in 2017. Kootenichela has been suggested to be a chimera of various arthropod taxa. Previous inclusion of some \\"bivalved\\" genus such as Forfexicaris, Ovalicephalus, and Occacaris to Megacheira was questioned by later investigations. ==External links== Category:Arthropod classes Category:Prehistoric protostome classes ","title":"Megacheira"},{"id":"20223240","text":"High Grass Circus is a 1976 National Film Board of Canada documentary film co- directed by Tony Ianzelo and Torben Schioler, exploring life in the Royal Brothers' traveling circus.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The manor of Stanton was owned for some two centuries by the Bache family, but passed to Thornhill by the 1696 marriage of Mary Pegge, heiress of the estate, to John Thornhill of Thornhill. The Thornhill family and their direct descendants are still in residence. The house has three principal building phases. The oldest part dates from the replacement of the medieval manor house in 1693. Only one single gabled bay at the north of the house now remains of this period. In the 18th century the 1693 house was largely replaced with a two-storey mansion with a seven bayed east front. In 1799/1800 Bache Thornhill, (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1776) added a substantial southern facing extension, doubling the size of the house. The new two-storey, five-by-five-bay addition was designed in a Palladian style by architect Lindley of Doncaster. The entrance front to the south has the three central bays projecting, with a semicircular Doric porch with balcony over, and all covered by a pediment. Bache Thornhill also created a deer park on the estate and ornamental gardens. His descendant William Pole Thornhill, High Sheriff 1836, died in 1876 and the estate passed to McCreagh- Thornhill relations. In the 1950s it passed to the Davie-Thornhill family. ==References== * English Heritage: architectural description of listed building Stanton Hall * Magna Britannia Vol 5 (1817) Stanton in Youlgreave, Derbyshire ==External links== * Photograph from Wishful-Thinking Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Derbyshire Category:Country houses in Derbyshire Category:History of Derbyshire ","title":"Stanton Hall, Stanton in Peak"},{"id":"20223334","text":"Stephen Goodwin Howard Stephen Goodwin Howard CBE (1867 – 13 November 1934) was a British Liberal politician. ==Family== Howard was the son of Stephen Howard of Kirtling in Cambridgeshire.

After being educated at the Lawrence College in Murree, Shariff was commissioned in the 3rd infantry battalion of the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army in 1942. 2nd-Lt. Shariff saw actions in the Burma front during World War II with the British Indian Army. After the partition of India in 1947, Captain Shariff moved to join the newly formed Pakistan Army where his career progressed extremely well, having attended and graduated from the Imperial Defence College. In 1952, Major Shariff was promoted as a lieutenant-colonel and qualified as psc from the Command and Staff College in Quetta; he later achieved promotion to the one- star rank in the army in 1959. In 1960, Brig. Shariff played a crucial role when he commanded the tactical strike brigade to remove the Nawab of Dir and Khan of Jandol to prevent secession from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. In 1964–66, Brig. Shariff moved to the staff assignment at the Army GHQ, serving in the Corps of Education where he served on the army board to select the potential candidates to be educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In 1966, Major-General Shariff was appointed as the Inspector General Training and Evaluation (IGT&E;) at the Army GHQ, and later appointed as the Commandant of the Command and Staff College in Quetta, which he served until 1970. In 1970, Maj-Gen. Shariff was promoted to the three-star rank in the army, and took over the diplomatic assignment as opposed to the command assignment. Lieutenant-General Shariff was posted as the permanent representative at the CENTO's HQ in Ankara, Turkey, which he remained until 1971. On 12 December 1971, Lt-Gen. Shariff returned to Pakistan and partially took over the command of the 33rd Infantry Division, stationed in Quetta, from its GOC, Maj-Gen. Naseer Ahmad, who was wounded in action against the Indian Army. After inspecting the infantry division, Lt-Gen. Shariff eventually handed over the command of the 33rd Infantry Division to then Maj-Gen. Iqbal Khan and departed to Turkey. In 1972, Lt-Gen. Shariff was appointed as field commander of the II Corps, stationed in Multan. During this time, Lt-Gen. Shariff played a crucial role in his role as a secondment when he led his II Corps to provide the military aid to the civil power to maintain law and order in Karachi, amid the labour unrest. In 1974, Lt-Gen, Shariff was appointed as an honorary Colonel commandant of the Punjab Regiment. ==Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee== Gen. Shariff (second left) along with Gen. Zia (third left) in the passing out parade of the 55th PMA Long Course, 16 April 1977. In 1976, General Tikka Khan's retirement as a chief of army staff was due, and Lt-Gen. Shariff was the most senior army general in the Pakistani military. Initially, Lt-Gen, Shariff was in the race for the promotion to four-star rank alongside six other army generals. Eventually, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto promoted and elevated the junior-most Lt-Gen, Zia-ul-Haq, to the four-star appointment and appointed him as nation's second army chief in 1976. Prime Minister Bhutto moved to create the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and promoted Lt-Gen. Shariff to the four-star rank, posting him as first Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee on 1 March 1976. His relations with Gen. Zia were limited but he seemed to dislike General Zia personally. In 1974–75, Lt- Gen. Shariff had submitted a report to the then-army chief General Tikka Khan that detailed Maj-Gen. Zia's actions of bypassing the chain of command in the military but the report was overshadowed due to Zia's dedication towards promoting the professionalism in the military. His duties as Chairman Joint Chiefs had been largely ineffective, and his deputy Admiral M.S. Khan had led the delegation to meet with Vice Chairman Li Xiannian when he paid a state visit to Pakistan on 22 January 1977. His relations with Gen. Zia soured and he was not supportive towards the actions by General Zia of military takeover of the civilian government, and regretted that this ultimate step had become inevitable. In July 1977, General Shariff prematurely sought retirement and he submitted his resignation to the President of Pakistan, asking him to relieve him of his duty. In public circles, General Shariff privately made it clear that the martial law was in fact unconstitutional. Furthermore, General Shariff was of the view of strengthening the Chairman joint chiefs' role to be more assertive and with more power than the army chief, but before the system could evolve itself, the July 1977 coup disturbed the power balance, and tilted it heavily in favor of the army chief.Brig (retd) Yasub Ali Dogar. \\"Pakistan's Higher Defence Reorganisation\\" Defence Journal January 1999 In 1977, General Shariff left the chairmanship of the joint chiefs to his deputy Admiral Mohammad Shariff but it was not until 1979 when his resignation actually became effective.

One of the early findings in the Experimental Mine demonstrated that coal dust by itself was capable of propagating an explosion even in the absence of any methane gas. This demonstration was contrary to the old belief widely held at the time that coal dust could not explode without gas. This view had led to the very dangerous and widespread practice of using loose coal dust in mines to pack explosives in boreholes, which had cost many thousands of lives.

A female infirmary block was added in 1898 and two new medical blocks were completed in 1929. A new wing was added in 1936 at which time the facility became the Farnborough County Hospital. It joined the National Health Service as Farnborough General Hospital in 1948 and new operating theatres on the site were opened by Robin Turton, Minister of Health, in November 1956. A new hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the Bromley Hospital and Farnborough General Hospital in 1998. It was built by Taylor Woodrow at a cost of £118 million and opened in April 2003. The construction cost was funded partly by the sale of the land occupied by Bromley Hospital, and partly by the private finance initiative project. Taxpayers will end up paying £1.2 billion to the PFI owners in a deal which lasts for 60 years. The new hospital was initially administered by the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust, until a merger with Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust and Queen Mary's Sidcup NHS Trust created the South London Healthcare NHS Trust in April 2009, which took over the running of several other hospitals in the local area.South London Healthcare NHS Trust homepage A Hyper Acute Stroke Unit for South East London opened at the hospital in May 2011. ==2013 Takeover== The South London Healthcare NHS Trust was dissolved on 1 October 2013, following a decision by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, acting on advice from the Trust Special Administrator.

It is a designated historic monument (monument historique).Ministère de la culture - Mérimée Valmagne Abbey was founded as a Benedictine abbey in 1138 but only twenty years later was attached to the Cistercian Order by decree of Pope Hadrian IV, where it remained until the French Revolution when monasteries in France were confiscated by the state and either sold or destroyed. Valmagne escaped demolition and was sold intact to a Monsieur Granier-Joyeuse in 1791 who converted the abbey church into a wine cave for the maturing of wine in large barrels, a function it continues to serve today. ==History== Church viewed from the cloister The cloister Lavabo Valmagne Abbey was founded in 1138 by Raymond Trencavel, Vicomte de Béziers, with monks from the Benedictine monastery of Sainte-Marie d'Ardorel near Albi. In 1145 the second abbot, Pierre, requested that the abbey be placed under the authority of the Cistercian movement. Trencavel opposed the request but in 1159 Pope Hadrian IV affirmed the affiliation and the abbey took on the law of Saint Bernard, as a daughter house of Bonnevaux Abbey. Valmagne then experienced a time of rapid growth as local landowners bestowed both land and money on the monastery. The buildings were extended and a vineyard of was established by the monks. From the twelfth century to the beginning of the fourteenth century, Valmagne was one of the richest monasteries in southern France and at its peak was home to nearly 300 monks. As the monastery expanded the original Romanesque chapel became cramped so in 1257 permission was granted to build a new church. The new church was constructed over the next forty years in the Gothic style and aside from the removal of the stained glass has changed little since completion. The Black Death devastated the region in 1348, causing many monks to die and others to flee the abbey. The decline was compounded during the Hundred Years' War when Valmagne suffered attacks and looting by passing mercenaries. As successive abbots were unable to balance the books, many of the abbey's lands and possessions were sold. From 1477 the abbots were appointed from outside the community and this led to a relaxation of the laws of religious life and a decline in the loyalty of the abbot for his abbey. During the French Wars of Religion of the sixteenth century, the abbey was almost abandoned and in 1575, an attack by Huguenots broke all the windows of the church and caused considerable damage to other buildings, particularly the cloister. Preservation work was undertaken in the seventeenth century, and parts of the church were sealed to prevent falls. At the same time the cloister was repaired, but the abbey had fallen into debt and lacked the finance to restore the structures properly, hence many windows in the church were bricked up instead of being re-glazed. By the eighteenth century, the community was very small and during the French Revolution the abbey was sacked again and furniture, paintings and archives were burned. In 1790, the last three monks left Valmagne taking the few remaining valuable items and the abbey was confiscated. It was sold in 1791 to Monsieur Granier- Joyeuse who converted the church into a wine cave, installing large barrels in the apse and side chapels of the church. On Granier-Joyeuse's death in 1838 Valmagne was acquired by Count Henri-Amédée-Mercure de Turenne and has remained in the same family ever since. ==Buildings== Abbey church The present Gothic church was rebuilt in 1257 on the foundations of a smaller Romanesque chapel to a traditional plan with a nave and transept, and nine radiating chapels off the semi-circular ambulatory. The nave is preceded by a narthex flanked by two defensive towers. The main structure measures long, wide and high. Cloister The groin vaulted cloister of Valmagne surrounds a large garden courtyard, with five large arches on each of the four sides. The chapter house is on the east side of the cloister and is one of the oldest parts of the abbey. It is unusual in that it has a single-span vaulted roof and therefore does not need the internal columns which are typical of chapter houses in other monasteries. On the south side of the cloister is an open octagonal structure containing a lavabo fed by a spring. The lavabo is opposite the refectory so that the monks could cleanse their hands before meals. ==Vineyard== The vineyard was originally established by the Cistercian monks in the twelfth century and vines have been continually cultivated on the land ever since.

The United States Constitution (Article I, Section 5, Clause 2) provides that \\"Each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\\" The processes for expulsion differ somewhat between the House of Representatives and the Senate. Censure, a less severe form of disciplinary action, is an official sanction of a member. It does not remove a member from office. ==Process leading to expulsion== Presently, the disciplinary process begins when a resolution to expel or censure a Member is referred to the appropriate committee. In the House, this is the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (House Ethics Committee); in the Senate, this is the Select Committee on Ethics (Senate Ethics Committee). The committee may then ask other Representatives or Senators to come forward with complaints about the Member under consideration or may initiate an investigation into the Member's actions. Sometimes Members may refer a resolution calling for an investigation into a particular Member or matter that may lead to the recommendation of expulsion or censure. Rule XI (Procedures of committees and unfinished business) of the Rules of the House of Representatives states that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct can investigate allegations that a Member violated \\"any law, rule, regulation, or other standard of conduct applicable to the conduct of such Member ... in the performance of his duties or the discharge of his responsibilities\\". The Senate Select Committee on Ethics has the same jurisdiction. The committee may then report back to their whole chamber as to its findings and recommendations for further actions. When an investigation is launched by either committee, an investigatory subcommittee will be formed. Once the investigatory subcommittee has collected evidence, talked to witnesses, and held an adjudicatory hearing, it will vote on whether the Member is found to have committed the specific actions and then will vote on recommendations. If expulsion is the recommendation then the subcommittee's report will be referred to the full House of Representatives or Senate where Members may vote to accept, reject, or alter the report's recommendation. Voting to expel requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members. This is set out in Article 1, Section 5, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution. ==Expulsions from Congress== In the entire history of the United States Congress, 20 Members have been expelled: 15 from the Senate and 5 from the House of Representatives (of those, one member's expulsion, William K. Sebastian of Arkansas, was posthumously reversed). Censure has been a much more common form of disciplinary action in Congress over the years, as it requires a much lower threshold of votes to impose. The great majority of those expelled — 17 members — were removed from office for their support of the Confederacy in the immediate aftermath of secession: * In 1861, after the Civil War had broken out, eleven senators (including former Vice President and Kentucky Senator John C. Breckinridge) and three representatives (John Bullock Clark and John William Reid of Missouri and Henry Cornelius Burnett of Kentucky) were expelled for supporting the Confederacy. * Senators Trusten Polk, Waldo P. Johnson and Jesse D. Bright were expelled in 1862 for the same reason. There have only been three other expulsions: * In 1797, Senator William Blount, Democratic-Republican of Tennessee, was expelled for treason, with charges centering on a plan to incite the Creek and Cherokee to aid the British in conquering the Spanish territory of West Florida. * In 1980, Representative Michael Myers, Democrat of Pennsylvania, was expelled after being convicted of bribery in connection with the Abscam scandal. * In 2002, Representative Jim Traficant, Democrat of Ohio, was expelled after he was convicted on ten counts of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. == Other initiations of actions to expel == There have been numerous other attempts to expel members of Congress. In many of those instances members under serious threat of expulsion resigned, including: * 1862: Senator James F. Simmons, Republican of Rhode Island. On July 14, 1862, the Judiciary Committee reported that the charges of corruption against Simmons were \\"essentially correct\\"; The Senate adjourned three days later, and Simmons resigned on August 15 before the Senate could take action. * 1906: Senator Joseph R. Burton, Republican of Kansas. Resigned after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction on charges of receiving compensation for intervening with a federal agency. * 1922: Senator Truman H. Newberry, Republican of Michigan. On March 20, 1920, Newberry was convicted on charges of violating campaign finance laws by spending $3,750 to secure his Senate election. The Supreme Court overturned this decision on May 2, 1921 on the grounds that the Senate exceeded its powers in attempting to regulate primary elections. On January 12, 1922, the Senate voted 46-41 that Newberry was duly elected in 1918. However, after certain members resumed their efforts to unseat him, Newberry resigned on November 18, 1922, two days before the start of the third session of the 67th Congress. * 1981: Representative Raymond F. Lederer, Democrat of Pennsylvania, was the only member of the ABSCAM scandal to win re-election. However he resigned due to \\"personal legal problems\\" a week after the House Ethics Committee recommended his expulsion for accepting a $50,000 bribe. * 1982: Senator Harrison A. Williams, Democrat of New Jersey, resigned after the Committee on Ethics recommended his expulsion due to his \\"ethically repugnant\\" actions in the Abscam scandal. * 1995: Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, resigned after the Committee of Ethics recommended his expulsion due to his gross sexual misconduct and his attempts to enrich himself through his official position. * 2006: Representative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio, resigned after being convicted in connection with the Jack Abramoff scandals. * 2019: Representative Katie Hill, Democrat of California, resigned after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into Hill for having improper sexual relationships with members of her congressional staff and campaign staff. There were other instances in which investigations were brought, but the defendants were exonerated, expulsion was rejected, insufficient evidence was found, or the member's term expired: * 1808: Senator John Smith, Democratic-Republican of Ohio, was implicated in the Aaron Burr-led conspiracy to invade Mexico and create a new country in the west. Senator John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts led the attempt to expel Smith from the Senate while Francis Scott Key defended Smith before the Senate. Expulsion failed 19 to 10, less than the two-thirds majority needed. At request of the Ohio Legislature, Smith resigned two weeks after the vote. * 1856: Congressman Preston Brooks, Democrat of South Carolina, beat Senator Charles Sumner with a cane. For this incident, he avoided expulsion but resigned; he was then re-elected by the people of South Carolina, who considered him a hero. * 1862: The expulsion of Senator Lazarus W. Powell, Democrat of Kentucky, was sought for support for Confederate rebellion. Unlike the three Senators expelled for that reason the same year and the eleven Senators the previous year, Powell was not expelled. * 1873: Senator James W. Patterson, Republican of New Hampshire, was accused of corruption, and a Senate select committee recommended expulsion on February 27. On March 1, a Republican caucus decided that there was insufficient time remaining in the session to deliberate the matter. Patterson's term expired March 3, and no further action was taken. * 1893: Senator William N. Roach, Democrat of North Dakota, was accused of embezzlement that had allegedly occurred 13 years earlier. After extensive deliberation, the Senate took no action, assuming that it lacked jurisdiction over members' behavior before their election to the Senate. * 1905: Senator John H. Mitchell, Republican of Oregon, was indicted on corruption charges on January 1, 1905, and was convicted on July 5 of that year, during a Senate recess. He died on December 8, while his case was still on appeal and before the Senate, which had convened on December 4, could take any action against him. * 1907: Senator Reed Smoot, Republican of Utah, a leader in the LDS Church, was the subject of a two-year investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Elections, which found that Smoot was not due his seat in the Senate because he was \\"a leader in a religion that advocated polygamy and a union of church and state, contrary to the U.S. Constitution.\\" Smoot's expulsion failed by a vote of 27-43 after the Senate decided that he fit the constitutional requirements to be a Senator. * 1919: Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr., Republican of Wisconsin, was accused of disloyalty after a 1917 speech he gave in opposition to U.S. entry into World War I. The Committee on Privileges and Elections recommended that La Follette not be expelled and the Senate concurred in a 50–21 vote. * 1924: Senator Burton K. Wheeler, Democrat of Montana, was indicted for conflict of interest, specifically acting as a lawyer, while a senator, in cases in which the U.S. was a party. A Senate committee, however, found that his dealings related to litigation before state courts and that he received no compensation for any service before federal departments. The Senate exonerated him by a vote of 56–5. * 1934: The Committee on Privileges and Elections, jointly considering the case of Senators John H. Overton, Democrat, and Huey P. Long, Democrat, both of Louisiana, determined that the evidence to support charges of election fraud were insufficient to warrant further consideration. ==See also== *Impeachment in the United States *List of United States senators expelled or censured *List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded *Resignation from the United States Senate (lists several senators who resigned under an ethical cloud) *Resignation from the United States House of Representatives *List of federal political scandals in the United States ==References Further reading == *Maskell, Jack. \\"Expulsion, Censure, Reprimand, and Fine: Legislative Discipline in the House of Representatives\\", Congressional Research Service, April 16, 2002. *Maskell, Jack. \\"Recall of Legislators and the Removal of Members of Congress from Office\\", Congressional Research Service, March 20, 2003. *\\"Senate History on Expulsion and Censure.\\" *Sorokin, Ellen. \\"In Congress' 213-year history, expulsion 'exceedingly rare'\\", The Washington Times, July 25, 2002.

These ranks are equivalent to that of Admiral in the Navy. A marshal is distinguished by using five stars, which for a marshal of the air are in the approximate position of Southern Cross and for a marshal in the army, in the form of \\"X\\". The five stars of Admiral are in the shape of a pentagon. Until the structural reform of 1967 in the Brazilian Army, army generals (bearing four stars), when moving to the reserve, were awarded the fifth star automatically. With the reform, it was established that there would be only the promotion of a general to marshal in the event of war, thus extinguishing the rank of marshal within the army in times of peace. Those dubbed as marshals prior to such reform, however, would still bear such titles for the remainder of their lives. The last living Brazilian Army marshal, Marshal Waldemar Levy Cardoso, died in May 2009. During the days of the Imperial Period (between 1822 and 1889), the patent, regarding the Army, was named \\"marshal of the army\\" (Portuguese: Marechal-do-Exército), having been renamed to its shorter current counterpart with the advent of the Republic after 1889. Although a large number of marshals existed within Brazilian ranks in the second half of the 20th century as mentioned above, the last active marshal in the Brazilian Army (i.e., that to hold office in the command of active troops) was Marshal Mascarenhas de Morais, holding the position of commander of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, a special Corps assembled to fight alongside the Allied forces in the Mediterranean theatre of World War II. Marshal Mascarenhas de Morais would bear said position and title for the remainder of his life (thus, until 1968, when he perished) as a result of a decree by the National Congress which dubbed the position and title honorary lifetime in the form of active troops. Some Marshals became President of Brazil, notably in the years following the establishment of the Republic in 1889 and also between the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état and the re-establishment of democracy in 1984/1985. Worthy mentions would be Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto (for the earlier aforementioned period) and Marshals Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco and Artur da Costa e Silva (for the latter). ==List of Brazilian Marshals== Brazilian Air Force Air Marshal or Marshal of the Air (Marechal-do-ar) This category comprises articles about marshal of the Armed Forces of Brazil (patent virtually extinct in 1967 when, from then, can only be attributed to 4-star generals - generais de exército - who had participated actively during wartime). There have been 66 Marshals; 63 in the Army and three in the Air Force Marshals of the Empire of Brazil During the monarchic regime, there were four General ranks (from lowest to highest): Brigadier (Brigadeiro), Field Marshal (Marechal de campo), Lieutenant-General (Tenente-general) and Marshal of the Army (Marechal do Exército). Although almost all international conflicts that Brazil participated occurred during the Imperial Era (Brazilian War of Independence (1822–25), Cisplatine War (1825–28), Platine War (1851–52), Uruguayan War (1864–65) and Paraguayan War (1864–70)), very few military officers achieved the highly distinct rank:Lyra, Heitor.

He was a college standout for Marquette University. ==High school career== Hayward went to Buffalo Traditional High School where he was an outstanding basketball player. After graduating from Buffalo Traditional in 2004, Hayward enrolled in Notre Dame Prep School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, as only the NCAA Division III college SUNY Fredonia expressed any interest in Hayward. Hayward attended Notre Dame Prep School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and while he attended he played with many other notable players, like Michael Beasley , Syracuse University standout Paul Harris and UTEP player Derrick Caracter. Hayward started both freshman and sophomore seasons. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Hayward was listed as the No. 18 small forward and the No. 73 player in the nation in 2006. ==College career== At Marquette University, Hayward received the nickname \\"Money Man\\".

In 2011, his college teammate Jimmy Butler was taken with the same pick in the NBA draft. It was the first time Marquette players went back-to-back in the first round since Bo Ellis was drafted by Washington in 1977 and Butch Lee was taken by Atlanta in 1978. In his first season in the NBA, he averaged 3.8 points in 10 minutes per game for the Timberwolves. On December 13, 2011, before the start of another season, Hayward was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for two second-round draft picks and Robert Vaden. The Thunder assigned Hayward to the Tulsa 66ers of the D-League on March 2, 2012. The Thunder recalled him on March 4, 2012 after he averaged 28 ppg in 2 games with the Tulsa 66ers. With the Thunder that season, he averaged 1.4 points per game, shooting 34% from the field. Hayward reached the 2012 NBA Finals with the Thunder, but the team lost to the Miami Heat. On October 27, 2012, Hayward was traded to the Houston Rockets and subsequently waived. On December 31, 2012, Hayward re-signed with the Timberwolves. He was waived by the Timberwolves on January 6, 2013, but re-signed two days later on a 10-day contract. After the 10-day contract expired, he joined the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League. He was waived by the D-Fenders on April 4, 2013 after sustaining an injury. In September 2013, Hayward signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. He was later waived by the Pelicans on October 13, 2013. On January 29, 2016, Hayward was reacquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders.

Ingestre Hall, Staffordshire Chetwynd was the eldest son of John Chetwynd of Ingestre and his wife Lucy Roane, daughter of Robert Roane of Tullesworth, Chaldon, Surrey, and was baptized on 3 June 1678.

Their second studio album, it was Horslip's first attempt at making a concept album, an idea they would return to in 1976 with The Book of Invasions: A Celtic Symphony. The Táin was based on the Táin Bó Cúailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), one of the most infamous legends of Early Irish literature, dealing with the war between Ulster and Connacht over a prize bull. The songs tell the story from the points of view of Cúchulainn, Queen Maeve of Connacht and Ferdia, among others. Horslips continued their Celtic Rock style of fusing traditional Irish music and rock, using traditional jigs and reels and incorporating them into their songs. For example, Dearg Doom is based on O'Neill's March, while The March of the King of Laois forms part of \\"More Than You Can Chew\\".

While applicable to all natural resources, the RPR is most commonly applied to fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and natural gas. The reserve portion (numerator) of the ratio is the amount of a resource known to exist in an area and to be economically recoverable (proven reserves). The production portion (denominator) of the ratio is the amount of resource produced in one year at the current rate. RPR = (amount of known resource) / (amount used per year) This ratio is used by companies and government agencies in forecasting the future availability of a resource to determine project life, future income, employment, etc., and to determine whether more exploration must be undertaken to ensure continued supply of the resource. Annual production of a resource can usually be calculated to quite an accurate number. However, reserve quantities can only be estimated to varying degrees of accuracy, depending on the availability of information and on the methods used to evaluate them. A simplistic interpretation of the ratio has led to many false predictions of imminent \\"running out of oil\\" since the early years of the oil industry in the 1800s. This has been especially true in the United States, where the ratio of proved reserves-to-production has been between 8 years and 17 years since 1920. Many have mistakenly interpreted the result as the number of years before the oil supply is exhausted. Such analyses do not take into account future reserve growth. ==Significance and interpretation== Decline curve generated by Decline curve analysis software, used to project future oil and gas production: red line is the gas decline curve; lower Blue line is the oil decline curve. Ratio of world proved oil reserves to production, 1980-2011 (US EIA) Ratio of world proved gas reserves to production, 1980-2011 The reserves-to-production ratio is the most widely quoted of the key indicators used in the oil and gas industry. It has a certain strategic significance for companies, which try to keep the value reasonably constant at approximately 10 years. A ratio which falls too low indicates a company in poor health. For a country or region, a value which falls too low can be a warning of impending scarcity. Globally, the RPR for petroleum varies from 8 years in the North Sea to 80 years in the Middle East. The former is typical of a region undergoing a steep production decline, the latter a region which will be continuing to produce oil well into the future. The reserves-to-production ratio can be misleading to the average person, particularly since it is expressed in years. The fact that a region has a RPR of 40 years does not mean that it will continue to produce the resource for 40 years, at which point it will suddenly run out, and then production will decline to zero. More commonly, a resource will show an increase in production until it reaches a peak, and then production will plateau and enter a declining phase. In theoretical terms, this is more accurately described by the Hubbert curve, a bell-shaped curve which is the mathematical derivative of the logistics function. The magnitude of the RPR is inversely related to the annual rate of production, which may depend on geological features. For example, a highly fractured oil reserve with water drive may have a RPR as low as 6 years. By contrast, a low permeability oil reserve may have a RPR as high as 50 or 100 years. Government policies may deliberately slow production, thereby increasing the RPR in the interests of prolonging reserve life, whereas a company may inject water and/or gases into a reservoir to increase production, thereby decreasing the RPR—the increased production comes at the expense of decreased reserve life. The RPR depends significantly on the stage of resource development. Typically, there is a high initial RPR during the early phases of development, then the RPR sharply declines toward the maximum level of production. Following to the production decline, the magnitude of the P/R ratio can either continue to decline, remain stable for some period of time, or increase, especially when a production slump occurs. New discoveries, changes in technology, or changes in economic conditions, can significantly alter the ratio in a short period of time, while misevaluation by involved parties can produce inaccurate and/or misleading results. Optimism or pessimism can influence reserve estimates. Further, reserves are resources that are economically recoverable under existing conditions. Reserves may change as a result of political change, or by manipulation. Consumption of many resources is not constant, but typically increases as the population grows and becomes more prosperous. Non-constant values for both the numerator and denominator of the ratio implies it may either overestimate or underestimate the remaining life of the resource. == Fossil fuel reserve-to-production ratios == Ratio of United States proved oil reserves to annual production Ratio of proved reserves to production for dry natural gas in the United States (US Energy Information Administration data). Reserve-to-production ratios may be calculated for individual countries or globally for specific resources. Oil, coal, and gas are the three most important fuels for powering the modern world. These resources are not uniformly distributed over the earth, so some countries have larger reserves than others. Due to the uncertainty of the reserves numbers, estimates of RPR vary widely.

It was a significant change in direction for Darin considering his previous album (In a Broadway Bag) was a collection of show tunes. ==History== Having previously built his career recording mainstream pop music, Darin's musical output became more \\"folky\\" as the 1960s progressed. In 1966, he charted with folksinger Tim Hardin's \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\". It was Darin's return to the Top 10 after a four-year absence (the single peaked at No. 8 in the US and No. 9 in the UK in 1966). The tracks leaned heavily towards songs by Hardin and John Sebastian — seven of the songs were written by these two songwriters and Darin's next album would follow a similar process. The song \\"Red Balloon\\" had not yet been released by Hardin. It would appear on his album 1967 album Tim Hardin 2. In his Allmusic review, Richie Unterberger, stated \\"Hardin himself was convinced that Darin had copied his vocal style by listening to his yet-to-be-issued version and the album as a whole boasts a production similar to the orchestrated folk-rock heard on the debut (sic) album in question, though it sounds like an inferior copy.\\" Both Darin's If I Were a Carpenter and Hardin's Tim Hardin 2 were produced by Charles Koppelman and Don Rubin and Koppelman had originally signed Sebastian's band, The Lovin' Spoonful.Cigar aficionado interview.

Prime Minister Călin Popescu Tăriceanu said the explosion that killed the miners in the coal-rich Jiu Valley occurred Saturday afternoon at a depth of 800 feet (250 meters). Later, a second explosion killed the four rescue workers, said Ilie Păducel, mayor of the town of Petrila where the mine is located. Hundreds of relatives gathered at the mine after the first explosion, Realitatea TV reported. Romanian President Traian Băsescu said he would travel to the site later Saturday. Mine officials said the explosions were believed to have been caused by an accumulation of methane gas. Officials have banned anyone from going down the mine for the next 48 hours. Eight injured miners are being treated for burns. Officials said about 100 miners were working at the time of the first explosion. ==Relates== \\"We don't know anything, he is down there in the mine, that's all we know, we know absolutely nothing of him,\\" one relative said.

He served as general manager of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves from July 9, 2004 to September 26, 2009. Prior to joining the Timberwolves' organization, Stack worked as a scout and executive for the Chicago Bulls, an assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers and an advance scout for the New York Knicks. ==Early life== Stack attended St. Laurence High School in Burbank, Illinois. He was a member of the school's basketball team, the Vikings, which won or tied for the Chicago Catholic League championship for four consecutive years from 1975 to 1978. The Vikings finished in fourth place in the 1977 IHSA Class AA Boys Basketball tournament. Stack, however, was unable to play in the Vikings' semi-final and third-place games, which were both losses, in that year's tournament due to an ankle injury he suffered during the team's quarterfinal victory. In the 19771978 season, the Vikings won their first 27 games before losing 4241 in the sectional round of the 1978 IHSA Class AA tournament to the also 27-0 and eventual state champions Lockport Township High School. Stack was named to the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association's All-State second team as a senior in 1978. After graduating from high school, Stack played for Northwestern University. During his four years, he averaged 14.1 points-per- game and finished his career as the school's second all-time leading scorer with 1,583 points scored. Stack was selected as the team's MVP for his junior and senior years and helped the team advance to the second round of the 1983 National Invitation Tournament. ==Professional career== Europe Stack was a sixth-round selection of the Houston Rockets in 1983, but ended up being one of the last cuts by the team that year. Stack then played overseas for a number of teams, including in Belgium where he played for GSG Aarschot in 19841985, averaging 27 points-per-game to finish third in the league in scoring, and RAS Maccabi Brussels in 19851986. Chicago Bulls In 1988, Stack was offered a position as scout with the Chicago Bulls by then General Manager Jerry Krause, also serving as a special assistant to Krause. Stack's contract as a scout with the Bulls was extended by the team in 1989 after Phil Jackson was named the team's new head coach. Stack was promoted to Assistant Vice President of Basketball operations in 1996. Stack played a significant part in the formation of the Bulls as a powerhouse in the 1990s when the team won six NBA championships in eight seasons. Indiana Pacers In August 2000, Stack was hired by the Indiana Pacers to serve as an assistant to head coach Isiah Thomas. Stack served as assistant coach for three seasons until Thomas was fired by the team in August 2003. New York Knicks Stack served as an advance scout for the New York Knicks during the 20032004 season. Minnesota Timberwolves Stack was hired to be the general manager of the Minnesota Timberwolves in July 2004. Stack's was given a contract extension by the team in 2005, but was demoted to scout in September 2009. ==Personal life== Stack is the uncle of Frank Kaminsky who currently plays for the NBA's Phoenix Suns. Stack's sister Karen Stack Umlauf, who also played college basketball at Northwestern, began working for the Chicago Bulls in 1985 as an assistant for Jerry Krause and later the Senior Director of Basketball Administration for the team. She served as an assistant coach for the Bulls. In September 2004, Stack was convicted of misdemeanor battery for his involvement in altercation with another man at a youth baseball game in Schaumburg, Illinois on July 4, 2004. Stack was sentenced to one-year court supervision and ordered to visit terminally ill children at a local hospital in December 2004 when the Timberwolves were scheduled to play the Bulls in Chicago. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Belgium Category:American basketball scouts Category:Chicago Bulls scouts Category:Houston Rockets draft picks Category:Indiana Pacers assistant coaches Category:Minnesota Timberwolves executives Category:National Basketball Association executives Category:National Basketball Association general managers Category:New York Knicks scouts Category:Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American men's basketball players Category:Forwards (basketball) ","title":"Jim Stack"},{"id":"20223840","text":"Kallmet is a former municipality in the Lezhë County, northwestern Albania.

If produced, it would have been one of the first British pressurised airliners. ==Development== In 1938 the British Air Ministry issued two specifications (14/38 and 15/38) for large transport aircraft comparable in size with the Junkers Ju 90 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200, with Specification 14/38 being for use on Empire routes and 15/38 for European routes.Barnes 1967, p. 341.Brookes Flight 9 May 1958, p. 632. The Ministry placed a contract with Shorts for three prototypes designated the Short S.32 against specification 14/38 and a production order for 14 Fairey FC1s against specification 15/38. The S.32 was a four-engined mid-wing monoplane powered by Bristol Hercules radials. The S.32 had a tailwheel landing gear to overcome problems with a nose wheel retracting into a pressurised fuselage. The build of three prototypes for the Air Ministry was started at Rochester but due to the urgent need for the factory to build the Short Stirling construction was abandoned. ==SpecificationsSee alsoReferences== * * * Category:1930s British airliners S.32 Category:Abandoned civil aircraft projects Category:Mid-wing aircraft ","title":"Short S.32"},{"id":"20223854","text":"Alteon may refer to: *Alteon Inc., initial developers of Alagebrium *Alteon Training an aircraft training school owned by The Boeing Company *Alteon WebSystems a network products manufacturer ","title":"Alteon"},{"id":"20223862","text":"Gilda de Abreu (23 September 1904 – 4 June 1979) was a Brazilian actress, singer, writer and film director. == Biography == Born to a wealthy family, Gilda de Abreu began her career as a singer, performing in stage musicals and operettas. She first started appearing in theater productions in 1936, when she starred in the romantic comedy Bonequinha de Seda, produced by Adhemar Gonzaga. The film acted as a break-out role for Abreu, allowing for a transition from her previous stage-based career to one in the Brazilian film industry. She was one of the first women to direct films in Brazil, coming to renown for her directorial debut, O Ébrio (The Drunkard) in 1946. The film, in addition to being the first sound film directed by a woman, was a commercial and critical success, with approximately 4 million viewings between 1946 and 1950. It is still regarded as \\"one of the great successes of Brazilian Cinema\\", according to film historian João Luiz Vieira. After O Ébrio, Abreu directed Pinguinho de gente (Tiny Tot) in 1949 and Coração materno (Mother's Heart) in 1951. Neither achieved the same critical or commercial success as O Ébrio. These were her final films as director until 1977, when she directed the short film Canção de Amor (Love Song). ==Personal life== Abreu married Vicente Celestino, a fellow singer and actor, in 1933. He was cast as the lead in all three of her feature-length productions. Two of the films (O Ébrio and Coração materno) were based upon songs he had written. Celestino died in 1968, and then Abreu died on June 4, 1979, in Rio de Janeiro. ==References * Category:1904 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Film directors from Paris Category:Actresses from Paris Category:Brazilian film directors Category:Brazilian film actresses Category:Brazilian women film directors Category:20th-century Brazilian actresses Category:Women film pioneers ","title":"Gilda de Abreu"},{"id":"20223894","text":"Dajç is a village and a former municipality in the Lezhë County, northwestern Albania. At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision of the municipality Lezhë. The population at the 2011 census was 3,834. Dajç is located in the midspan between the city of Lezhë to the south and Shkodër to the north, from each. It has an agricultural-based economy, with many producing fields, but in need of better mechanics and organized market. Dajç has all important institutions for a small commune like: Schools from kindergarten to High level, Municipality buildings, Health Center with an onsite family doctor- full-time five days a week, Catholic Church and Sisters Residence, many shops and a cafeteria. Population is about 7000, for the whole commune. The town of Dajç comprises several quarters such as: Gazullore, Milot, Mazrekë, Zeznjane, Laskare, Suka, and peripherals. ==History== People of this region are called Zadrimorë, from its field name 'Zadrima' stretching from Shkodër to Lezhë cities. This region has a very rich cultural tradition. It has withstood the 500 years of Ottoman invasion, saving its Christian religion of Catholicism; area is all of this religion, (thought to be established directly by St Paul in the 1st century, while he passed through Albanian lands). On October 7 is the town's holiday of the St. Rosary, celebrated vigorously with many visits, church mass, prayers, and numerous activities. Zadrimë is well known for its fine cheese, yogurt, milk, buttermilk and butter. ==Economy== Livelihoods of the people are mainly field work, growing crops including grain and vegetables, foraging, arboriculture (figs, plums, and pears), and some vineyards. With the new main highway, SH1 / E762 running by the village South-North from Tirana to the Montenegro border, trade and economical development is expected to thrive in the coming years.

The show is broadcast each weekday afternoon (originally broadcasting from 9:00am–12:00 midday between the late 1990s and 2014). The original mid-morning radio show competed with RTÉ 2fm's Gerry Ryan (and his successor Ryan Tubridy), RTÉ Radio 1's Pat Kenny (and his successor Sean O'Rourke) and Newstalk's Tom Dunne (and his successor Pat Kenny). During the 2000s, D'Arcy won three consecutive \\"Best National DJ\\" Meteor Awards while presenting that incarnation of the show. The production team of Jenny Kelly, Will Hanafin and Mairead Farrell featured prominently, with Kelly known for her weekly Fix-it Friday slot and Farrell for her daily \\"Odd-One-Out Quiz\\". Other contributors to The Ray D'Arcy Show (morning edition) included Maeve Higgins, Quentin Fottrell, Conor Pope, Pixie McKenna and Arthur Murphy. D'Arcy announced his departure from Today FM in December 2014 with his vacant position subsequently being filled albeit temporarily by Alison Curtis and then on a permanent basis by Anton Savage; D'Arcy's Radio 1 debut came on 2 February 2015. After rejoining RTÉ, D'Arcy was given his own Saturday night chat show, also called The Ray D'Arcy Show. ==History== 1990s-2014 In the late 1990s, D'Arcy transferred to Today FM. There he took over the mid-morning show from Tim Kelly which went out from 10:00 to 12:45. This slot was later changed to 9:00 to 12:00, entering direct competition with RTÉ 2fm's The Gerry Ryan Show. The Ray D'Arcy Show is responsible for launching the professional career of the comedian Maeve Higgins, who auditioned for a nationwide competition organised by the show in February 2004. Guests during the show's heyday included Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson,Colin and Brendan on The Ray D'Arcy Show Myleene Klass, Dylan Moran, Trinny and SusannahTrinny and Susannah! Dermot O'Leary, Anne DoyleAnne Doyle on The Ray D'Arcy Show and Miriam O'Callaghan. D'Arcy and his production team of Jenny Kelly, Mairéad Farrell and Will Hanafin once performed a spoof version of the OK Go hit \\"Here It Goes Again\\" in D'Arcy's back garden in frozen conditions. In 2007, the show featured a petition for Amhrán na bhFiann to be sung after Ireland's Call in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In 2008, D'Arcy stripped naked to participate in a Spencer Tunick art project and later spoke of it on the air. Later, live on his radio show, he criticised Orla McAdam of The Apprentice, a former follower of D'Arcy in his days with children's television, and upset her. On the week of 24–28 November 2008 a Dublin caller named Huberta explained she had located someone else's shopping in the boot of her car. It includes some meat (which she has since refrigerated), some bottles of wine and some Mexican sauce. D'Arcy spent the week following her attempts to track down the mystery owner, with dramatic daily updates that involved the scanning of Tesco customer records and the hiring of a private detective. The mystery is still ongoing. In 2008, Russell Brand, alongside his co-host Matt Morgan alleged that Ray D'Arcy had stolen items, guests and jokes from The Russell Brand Show. Appearing on the show as a guest, Darcy disputed this although noted that fans of both shows noticed similarities. The show embarked on a Discover Ireland Feel Good tour of the country in early 2009. In February 2009, D'Arcy interviewed the British game show host Chris Tarrant of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? through a phoneline, in an incident which later gained media attention. Overhearing the show's team criticising the England national rugby union team beforehand, Tarrant opened the interview by saying: \\"There's something very depressing about sitting here listening to you talk about how rubbish the English team is.\\" Tarrant was then asked what he thought of the multiple Academy Award-winning film Slumdog Millionaire which mimics his game show. Tarrant responded by saying: \\"I can't relate to it. He's a sleazy host with an earring. The game show is the cornerstone to my life and I just can't relate to the movie.\\" Tarrant then attempted to promote his new show The Colour of Money. D'Arcy asked him to explain the format of the show, saying: \\"The key to a good format is you can explain it in one or two sentences. Like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? is, in effect, 'you answer 15 questions and you win a million'. That's it. So, with The Colour of Money can you do that?\\" Tarrant replied with: \\"The Colour of Money. . . . .there are 20 cash machines, all with different amounts in them ranging up to a total of more than £25,000. You choose 10 colours and they have different amounts in them. If all 10 add up to the total of money you want, then you win. If the money is not enough, then you lose out and there's no in between. It's either £80,000 or £90,000 or whatever, or you go home with el zippo.\\" D'Arcy responded to this failure to keep to his limits by laughing and saying: \\"That is a real test of the format!\\" On the weekend of 21–22 March 2009, a then unidentified person placed nude portraits of the Taoiseach in the National Gallery of Ireland and the gallery of the Royal Hibernian Academy. The artist anonymously emailed the show, claiming responsibility for the creation of the paintings, but not their hanging. Gardaí subsequently raided the Today FM studios and producer Will Hanafin was asked to hand over the emails claiming that the placing of the paintings constituted indecency, incitement and criminal damage. Hanafin declined to provide the emails without a warrant. An interview conducted with British chef Gordon Ramsay by Ryan Tubridy on The Late Late Show in late 2009 led to comment in the Irish media when Ramsay engaged in personal criticism of Tubridy over his appearance. Ramsay compared Tubridy's ears to Dumbo, saying: \\"Look at those things, you must take off coming down the stairs. I'm surprised you can get through the door\\". The chef also spoke of his desire to bring Tubridy to one of his restaurants, commenting \\"You look like you haven't eaten in years. You're too thin. You're like a little windy piece of asparagus\\". The Evening Herald said Tubridy had been \\"ridiculed and humiliated [...] in front of a squirming television audience\\". A spokesperson for Tubridy said he understood the comments as a joke. While appearing on The Ray D'Arcy Show to promote The Late Late Toy Show some weeks later, Tubridy responded to the incident: \\"I thought he was a bit, em, British for my liking. I won’t be buying the books [Ramsay was promoting]. In fact, I didn't take the free one\\". Sharon Corr and Joe Echo performed a duet of \\"Fairytale of New York\\" on the show in December 2009. After musician Jim Corr appeared on the first episode of The Saturday Night Show in 2010, D'Arcy said it was \\"irresponsible\\" for Corr to have discussed his views on the 2009 flu pandemic. Corr rang the radio show and the two engaged in what the Dundalk Democrats Gary McLaughlin described as \\"the mother of all radio battles\\", with D'Arcy at one point saying \\"I think we need to get down to this level with you\\" over the possibility of the government purposefully providing dangerous vaccines and Corr saying D'Arcy was \\"very patronising\\" and urging him, \\"Just be careful not to misquote me in the future\\". In 2010, Mairead Farrell said she would never leave the show. In 2011, D'Arcy wept on air while reading an email from Nuala Doyle, whose son Carl developed luekaemia and died aged 16. On 8 April 2011, Jenny's father, Michael, died in his sleep. Jenny learned of the death from Today FM chief executive Willie O'Reilly while on air. The Ray D'Arcy Show was abruptly taken off the air, prompting thousands of texts and calls from worried listeners. Ray and Jenny were scheduled to lead 800 people on a run in Ringsend as part of the Run With Ray campaign, but athlete Sonia O'Sullivan replaced them when tragedy struck. Today FM breakfast show host Ian Dempsey took over the airwaves immediately. In July 2014, D'Arcy incurred the wrath of mixed martial arts fans by inviting Cathal Pendred onto his show then grilling him on his part in the \\"violent and disturbing\\" sport. ;The Den radio reunion On 14 November 2008, a special edition of The Ray D'Arcy Show was broadcast live from Vicar Street, Dublin. It reflected on the formative years of The Den (formerly presented by D'Arcy who himself had succeeded Today FM breakfast host, Ian Dempsey) from 1986–94 in front of a live audience who shared their memories.Ray Re-unites with Zig and Zag! Listeners were also invited to contribute, after which D'Arcy would dip into his O'Byrne's World of Wonder sack which contained toy prizes. The show was even video-streamed live online. D'Arcy was not the only original member of the team present; Zig and Zag featured heavily as they were promoting their new DVD Best Bitz From Back Den, Don Conroy put in an appearance to instruct D'Arcy how to draw a barn owl, Ian Dempsey turned up later (he had been presenting his breakfast show from the Today FM studios directly beforehand), a 4 ft Ted attacked D'Arcy at 10:10 as Zig and Zag cheered him on with the audience, and, to Zig and Zag's disgust, Dustin made a cameo appearance toward the end. The show opened with D'Arcy counting down the Top 5 Theme Tunes from programmes broadcast on The Den. He revealed that #3 (The Littlest Hobo) was purchased by RTÉ in Cannes as part of a buy-one-get-one-free deal and was given to The Den to broadcast - such deals were typical of The Den's budget. {  ! width=\\"15\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" # ! width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Theme - align=\\"center\\" 5 align=\\"center\\" Dastardly and Muttley - align=\\"center\\" 4 align=\\"center\\" Bosco - align=\\"center\\" 3 align=\\"center\\" The Littlest Hobo - align=\\"center\\" 2 align=\\"center\\" Mighty Mouse - align=\\"center\\" 1 align=\\"center\\" Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles/ Captain Planet - } There were reminders of Don Conroy's special hugs, D'Arcy's walking upon invisible stairs and \\"Ray's Rave\\" where children sent their parents from the room, turned off the lights, pulled the curtains and raved. A repeat of this was carried out at 11:45. There were catch-ups with old members of the team such as Ciara Carroll, who is now a PA for Dublin Airport. D'Arcy played music from these years throughout the show, beginning with Europe's \\"The Final Countdown\\" from 1986. There were also live performances from Irish musicians, accompanied by Ronan Johnson and the Boogie Woogie Band, who had appeared on The Den. Steve and Joe Wall performed \\"Brewing Up a Storm\\" from their years with The Stunning (they claimed beforehand to have been high on magic mushrooms on The Den) Cadbury's gorilla, Johnny Donnelly from The Saw Doctors appeared to remind of their ten-plus appearances and invited D'Arcy to run the Dublin Marathon. Liam Ó Maonlaí performed \\"Don't Go\\", whilst Jerry Fish performed \\"Celebrate\\" to close the show. ==Regular features== ;Emailbag A reference to Arthur Murphy's Mailbag, Murphy read out emails from the listeners on a weekly basis.\\"Emailbag \\".

Retrieved 15 November 2008. ;Odd-One-Out Quiz The \\"Odd- One-Out Quiz\\" took place on the half hour of every hour every day the show was on the air, i.e. three times per day and fifteen times per week. D'Arcy asked a phone-in contestant a series of questions over thirty seconds, each involving three items, one of which would be the odd one out. A regular example would be two consonants and a vowel. The fast-paced delivery was usually enough to unhinge the contestant, although D'Arcy was usually generous in his delivery and would often repeat questions after the allotted time had passed. Listeners were asked to enter if they fitted a specific and topical theme which changed daily, i.e. owning an interesting pet, being members of the hairless population, or shoppers who have had an accident in the supermarket. ;What Would Maeve Do...

Each year, for some time, the show released a charity album containing covers performed by Irish musicians on the show. The latest was titled Even Better Than the Disco Thing and was released in December 2008. The name comes from the U2 song, \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\", and the early compilations were named thus. ;Shave Or Dye D'Arcy played a prominent role in Today FM's Shave Or Dye Campaign. The Ray D'Arcy Show featured in the Guinness Book of Records after it broke the world record for most heads shaved in an hour by a team of 10 barbers, total heads shaved 315. ==Ratings== In 2008, The Ray D'Arcy Show had 245,000 listeners, a decrease of 9,000 from the previous year. However, D'Arcy started stealing listeners from Tubridy since the unexpected death of Gerry Ryan in 2010, and in February 2011 he dislodged Ryan Tubridy as Ireland's \\"King of the Mid- Morning Airwaves\\". JNLR figures in early 2011 put him at 3,000 more listeners than RTÉ, a first for a Today FM show. ==Awards== In 2005, 2006 and 2007 Ray won the Best Irish Radio DJ award at the Meteor Music Awards, cementing his position as one of Ireland's most popular radio presenters. D'Arcy always maintains that this should be seen as a group award, and that credit should be shared with Jenny Kelly, Mairead Farrell and producer Will Hanafin, who also contributes to presenting the show. Despite this, it was only ever awarded to himself so he can claim the credit here. In 2008 D'Arcy was beaten by his namesake Ray Foley who launched a daily campaign to dethrone him. In 2006, The Ray D'Arcy Show won the Community/Social Action award at the PPI Irish Radio Awards for their work on highlighting road safety problems and deaths on the roads in Ireland. This was due in part, to their \\"Don't be a Fucking Eejit\\" radio adverts, which contained real-life stories. In 2007, The Ray D'Arcy Show won the Best Light Entertainment Programme award at the PPI Irish Radio Awards. -  2005  Ray D'Arcy  Best Irish DJ at the Meteor Awards  -  2006  Ray D'Arcy  Best Irish DJ at the Meteor Awards  -  2006  The Ray D'Arcy Show  Community/Social Action award at the PPI Irish Radio Awards  -  2007  Ray D'Arcy  Best Irish DJ at the Meteor Awards  -  2007  The Ray D'Arcy Show  Best Light Entertainment Programme award at the PPI Irish Radio Awards  -  2008  Ray D'Arcy  Best Irish DJ at the Meteor Awards  - ==Footnotes== * Dunne was a former colleague who sometimes filled in for him on The Ray D'Arcy Show ==ReferencesSources== * Today FM's Ray D'Arcy and Mairead Farrell pay tribute to Homeland in new video, independent.ie; accessed 25 August 2017.

D. Baker, first published in 2002. The 2009 Disney animated musical feature film, The Princess and the Frog, is loosely based on this novel. ==Plot summary== Emeralda, a.k.a. Emma is the princess and heir of Greater Greensward. One of her most distinct traits is her unique laugh, which sounds like a donkey's bray. The only person that appreciates her is her aunt Grassina, the current Green Witch. When her mother, Queen Chartreuse, says she has to marry the stuck-up Prince Jorge from East Aradia, her worst enemy, she runs off to the swamp where she meets Prince Eadric of Upper Montevista. The only problem is that he has been turned into a frog by the witch Mudine. Emma reluctantly kisses him, trying to reverse the spell; instead, she turns into a frog herself. Annoyed and confused by this outcome, Emma and Eadric set off to find the witch that turned him into a frog and ask her to change them back. A dog persistently chases them throughout the journey. Upon reaching the site where Eadric insulted (and was cursed by) the witch that transformed him, they find an ugly woman searching there. The two assume she's the witch Mudine, but she turns out to be Vannabe, a vain witch wannabe who has taken Mudine's house, pets, and possessions and plans to use the frogs for a potion she thinks will make her eternally beautiful. With the aid of Mudine's former pets, the two frogs escape and free all the prisoners. The animals confirm that Mudine has disappeared, so Emma suggests they go to Grassina for help. L'il the bat and Fang the snake accompany them as protection during the journey, though Fang leaves after reuniting with his lover Clarise. At the castle Grassina confirms their true identity and explains why they're both stuck as frogs: while Emma kissed Eadric, she had been wearing the curse-reversal bracelet Grassina had given her in case an evil witch had attacked Emma. And to transform back Emma and Eadric will have to kiss again while wearing the bracelet. Emma recalls that it was stolen by an otter, so the three head to the swamp to retrieve it. Grassina is unable to progress further into the swamp due to a hereditary curse placed on Green Witches involving flowers (which until now she had passed off as an allergy) and Eadric is chased again by the pursuing dog, so Emma has to confront the otter alone. She passes herself off as a powerful fairy and performs some magic to convince the otter to turn over the bracelet, and narrowly manages to kiss Eadric before the dog catches up to them both. The two transform back into humans, and the dog transforms as well. It turns out to be Eadric's horse that he had been riding on when he met Mudine, who had also cursed his steed. Returning to Grassina, she finds her aunt with the otter, who is actually Grassina's old beau Haywood, cursed by Grassina's witch mother. The two couples make plans to convince their respective parents that they've found their own true loves. ==Characters== Principal Characters *Emeralda \\"Emma\\" The princess and heir of Greater Greensward; a young witch who has not yet acquired full control over her magic *Eadric – A prince turned frog, and the heir of Upper Montevista *Grassina – The younger sister of Greater Greensward's queen, as well as the Green Witch.

Unfortunately, the plot doesn't make much of the magical elements (for example, the characters' encounters with a dragon and a nymph seem inconsequential), resulting in a disappointingly flat fantasy.\\" Todd Morning was positive in his review for Booklist saying \\"the ending in this fairy tale–twisting first novel is rather like a Shakespearean comedy, with lots of disguises revealed. Unlike some takeoffs that revolve around one joke, this manages to be entertaining throughout, helped along by Emeralda’s amusing first person narration and the many witty lines.\\" Nancy Menaldi-Scanlon in her review for School Library Journal thought that the vocabulary did not match the book's intended audience saying \\"The tale moves at a good pace, and, though the happy ending is predictable, the trials and tribulations that precede it are interesting. However, it's difficult to determine the book's audience. While the story would appeal to primary to intermediate grade girls, the vocabulary is rather sophisticated and seems to be more suited to young adults.\\" ==Sequels== E.D. Baker followed The Frog Princess with more books in the series chronicling Emma and Eadric's adventures: Dragon's Breath (2005), Once Upon a Curse (2006), and No Place for Magic (2008), as well as a prequel, The Salamander Spell (2008). There is also an epilogue series of the books about Emma and Eadrics' daughter, Millie.

This results in the faces of the arch not being perpendicular to its abutments and its plan view being a parallelogram, rather than the rectangle that is the plan view of a regular, or \\"square\\" arch. In the case of a masonry skew arch, the construction requires precise stonecutting, as the cuts do not form right angles, but once the principles were fully understood in the early 19th century, it became considerably easier and cheaper to build a skew arch of brick. The problem of building skew arch masonry bridges was addressed by a number of early civil engineers and mathematicians, including Giovanni Barbara (1726), William Chapman (1787), Benjamin Outram (1798), Peter Nicholson (1828), George Stephenson (1830), Edward Sang (1835), Charles Fox (1836), George W. Buck (1839) and William Froude (c. 1844). ==History== Benjamin Outram and Store Street Aqueduct Store Street Aqueduct from Store Street Swin Bridge over the River Gaunless A contemporary engraving of Bridge Skew bridges are not a recent invention, having been built on exceptional occasions since Roman times, but they were little understood and rarely used before the advent of the railway. An early example of the skew arch is the Arco Barbara in the Floriana Lines fortifications in Malta, which was designed by the Maltese architect and military engineer Giovanni Barbara in 1726. Another notable exception is an aqueduct, designed by British engineer Benjamin Outram, constructed in masonry and completed in 1798, which still carries the Ashton Canal at an angle of 45° over Store Street in Manchester. Outram's design is believed to be based on work done on the Kildare Canal in Ireland in 1787, in which William Chapman introduced the segmental oblique arch to the design of Finlay Bridge at Naas, employing an arch barrel based on a circular segment that is smaller than a semicircle and which was repeated by Thomas Storey in 1830 in the bridge carrying the Haggerleases branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless near Cockfield, County Durham with a skew angle of 63° and a skew span of , resulting in a clear span of and a rise of . The common method they all used was to clad the timber centring (also known as falsework) with planks, known as \\"laggings\\", laid parallel with the abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses in the vicinity of the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required. Contemporary designs by rival engineers were less successful and for a time skew bridges were considered weak in comparison with the regular, or \\"square\\" arch bridge and so were avoided if at all possible, the alternatives being to construct the road or canal with a double bend, so as to allow it to cross the obstacle at right angles, or to build a regular arch bridge with the extra width or span necessary to clear the obstacle \\"on the square\\". An example of the latter type of construction is Denbigh Hall Bridge, built in 1837 to carry the London and Birmingham Railway across Watling Street at an acute angle of only 25°. Now a Grade II listed structure, the bridge is still in use today, carrying the busy West Coast Main Line. It was constructed in the form of a long gallery, some long and wide, consisting of iron girders resting on walls built parallel with the road; the girders, and consequently the faces of the bridge, being perpendicular to the roadway and the railway line being laid out obliquely across the top, the need to build a highly skewed bridge of span was therefore avoided. The eminent canal engineer James Brindley never succeeding in working out a solution to the problem of constructing a strong skew arch and as a consequence all his overbridges were built at right angles to the waterway, with double bends in the roadway, where necessary, and to this day many of them cause inconvenience to their users. However, it was the coming of the railway, with its need to cross existing obstacles, such as rivers, roads, canals and other railways, in as straight a line as possible, that rekindled the civil engineer's interest in the skew arch bridge. The false skew arch Colorado Street Bridge, an example of a false skew arch The strength of a regular arch (also known as a \\"square\\" or \\"right\\" arch) comes from the fact that the mass of the structure and its superincumbent load cause lines of force that are carried by the stones into the ground and the abutments without producing any tendency for the stones to slide with respect to one another. This is due to the fact that the courses of stone are laid parallel to the abutments, which in a regular arch causes them also to lie perpendicular to its faces. For only slightly oblique bridges, where the skew angle is less than approximately 15° it is possible to use the same construction method, laying the stones in courses parallel to the abutments. The result is known as a \\"false\\" skew arch and analysis of the forces within it shows that in each corner where the face forms an acute angle with an abutment there are resultant forces that are not perpendicular to the planes of the stone courses whose tendency is to push the stones out of the face, the only resistance to this being provided by friction and the adhesion of the mortar between the stones. An example of such a false skew arch is the Colorado Street Bridge in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Before starting work on Store Street Aqueduct, Outram built a number of false skew arches, one of them with a skew angle as great as 19°, as accommodation bridges across the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. The fact that these inherently weak structures are still standing today is attributed to their light loading. Schofield, 2000, op. cit., p. 96. A more rigorous approach When considering the balance of forces within a regular arch, in which all courses of masonry that make up the barrel are parallel with its abutments and perpendicular to its faces, it is convenient to consider it as a two-dimensional object by taking a vertical section through the body of the arch and parallel with its faces, thereby ignoring any variation in loading along the length of its barrel. In an oblique or skew arch the axis of the barrel is deliberately not perpendicular to the faces, the deviation from perpendicularity being known as the skew angle or the \\"obliquity\\" of the arch. For this reason a skew arch needs to be thought of as a three-dimensional object and by considering the direction of the lines of force within the barrel the optimum orientation for the courses of stonework that make the barrel can be decided. The helicoidal skew arch A characteristic of the regular arch is that the courses of stones run parallel to the abutments and perpendicular to the faces. Rankine, 1867, op. cit., p. 414. In an oblique arch these two conditions cannot both be met because the faces and the abutments are deliberately not perpendicular. Since skew angles greater than about 15° are required for many applications, mathematicians and engineers such as Chapman abandoned the idea of laying the courses of stones parallel to the abutments and considered the alternative of laying the courses perpendicular to the faces of the arch, and accepting the fact that they would then no longer run parallel to the abutments. Though Outram's Store Street Aqueduct was constructed with this principle in mind, it was done so empirically, with the masons cutting each voussoir stone as it was required, and it was not until 1828 that details of the technique were published in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons. Peter Nicholson's helicoidal method in stone Peter Nicholson (1765–1844) Kielder Viaduct, built to Nicholson's pattern A helicoidal skew arch under construction, showing the placing of the voussoirs on the laggings of the centring A plate from Nicholson's Guide to Railway Masonry showing the development (left) and the plan view of the intrados of a helicoidal skew arch In his book A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (1828), Scottish architect, mathematician, cabinet-maker and engineer Peter Nicholson first set out in clear and understandable terms a workable method for determining the shape and position of the stones required for the construction of a strong skew arch that enabled them to be prepared in advance of the actual construction process. Nicholson approached the problem by constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up the barrel of the skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face. Nicholson never pretended to have invented the skew arch but in his later work The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch (1839), he does claim to have invented the method for producing the templates that enabled the accurate cutting of the voussoir stones used in all skew bridges built between the years 1828 and 1836, citing testimonials from the builders of major works, such as the Croft Viaduct Rennison, 1996, op. cit., pp. 135–136. at Croft-on-Tees near Darlington. However, by 1836 a young engineer called Charles Fox had improved on Nicholson's helicoidal method and other writers were proposing alternative approaches to the problem. Charles Fox's English method in brick Charles Fox (1810–1874) A brick segmental arch skew bridge with six rings and brick quoins A plate from Fox's paper showing skew courses as sections of a square threaded screw In performing his calculations Nicholson considered the arch barrel to be made from one ring of stones and of negligible thickness and therefore he developed only the intrados. The idea was expanded in Charles Fox's 1836 publication On the Construction of Skew Arches, in which he considered the intrados of the barrel and the extrados as separate surfaces mapped onto concentric cylinders by drawing a separate development for each. This approach had two advantages. Firstly, he was able to develop a theoretical third, intermediate surface midway between the intrados and the extrados, which allowed him to align the centre of each voussoir, rather than its inner surface, along the desired line, thereby better approximating the ideal placement than Nicholson was able to achieve. Secondly, it enabled him to develop an arbitrary number of concentric intermediate surfaces so as to plan the courses in multi-ring skew arch barrels, allowing them for the first time to be constructed in brick, and therefore much more economically than was previously possible. In order to explain how he visualised the courses of voussoirs in a stone skew arch, Fox wrote, \\"The principle which I have adopted is, to work the stones in the form of a spiral quadrilateral solid, wrapped round a cylinder, or, in plainer language, the principle of a square threaded screw: hence it becomes quite evident, that the transverse sections of all these spiral stones are the same throughout the whole arch. It will be obvious, that the beds of the stones should be worked into true spiral [helicoidal] planes.\\" So, a stone skew arch built to Fox's plan would have its voussoirs cut with a slight twist, in order to follow the shape of a square threaded screw. While claiming a superior method, Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but in 1837 he felt the need to reply to a published letter written in support of Nicholson by fellow engineer Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for Northumberland. Unfortunately the three men became involved in a paper war that, following a number of earlier altercations in which the originality of his writings was questioned, left the 71-year-old Nicholson feeling bitter and unappreciated. The following year Fox, still aged only 28 and employed by Robert Stephenson as an engineer on the London and Birmingham Railway, presented his paper encapsulating these principles to the Royal Institution and from this was born the English or helicoidal method of constructing brick skew arches. Using this method many thousands of skew bridges were built either entirely of brick or of brick with stone quoins by railway companies in the United Kingdom, a substantial number of which survive and are still in use today.

Barlow Boxmoor Skew Bridge in 2011, looking in a SSW direction from London Road Boxmoor Skew Bridge detail, showing the chamfered acute quoins and stepped extrados In 1839, George Watson Buck, having also worked on the London and Birmingham Railway under Stephenson before moving to the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, published a work entitled A Practical and Theoretical Essay on Oblique Bridges in which he also acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but, finding it lacking in detail, applied his own original trigonometrical approach and considerable practical experience to the problem. This book was acknowledged as the definitive work on the subject of the helicoidal skew arch and remained a standard text book for railway engineers until the end of the 19th century. Buck's trigonometrical approach allowed every dimension of a skew arch to be calculated without recourse to taking measurements from scale drawings and it allowed him to calculate the theoretical minimum angle of obliquity to which a practical semicircular helicoidal skew bridge could be designed and safely built. Buck, 1839, op. cit., p. 40. The \\"Buck Limit\\", as it is known, has a value of 25°40′ or, when quoted in terms of the maximum angle of skew, a value of 64°20′. Buck paid particular attention to the design of bridges of extreme obliquity, addressing two potential problems he had identified. Firstly, he noted that the acutely angled quoins at the obtuse corners of the plan view were very susceptible to damage during construction, settlement or by accidental blows in subsequent use so he devised a method of chamfering the edge, removing the single acute angle and replacing it with two obtuse angles and, in his own words, \\"the quantity thus cut off from the acute quoin, is gradually diminished to the opposite or obtuse quoin, where the cutting vanishes; by this contrivance no angle less than a right angle is any where presented on the exterior of the work […] the effect produced is elegant and pleasing to the eye.\\" Buck, 1839, op. cit., p. 28. Secondly, he recommended that the extrados of the barrel of an arch of great obliquity be formed into rusticated steps so as to provide a horizontal bed for the spandrel walls in order to overcome their tendency to slide off the arch barrel. Buck, 1839, op. cit., p. 29. The bridge carrying the London and Birmingham Railway over the London Road at Boxmoor in Hertfordshire, adjacent to what is now Hemel Hempstead station on the West Coast Main Line, is an example of a segmental arch of extreme obliquity that was designed by Buck and incorporates both of these features. Constructed in masonry, with a brick barrel, stone quoins and a 58° angle of skew, it was completed in 1837. Shortly before the railway opened the bridge was the subject of an ink and wash drawing dated 12 June 1837, one of a series of works by artist John Cooke Bourne illustrating the construction of the line. Buck's Essay, containing its criticism of Nicholson's work, was published in July 1839, just a few months before Nicholson's Guide to Railway Masonry, causing the ongoing paper war in The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal to continue acrimoniously as Nicholson accused Buck of stealing his ideas and Buck issued a counter-claim. In 1840, Buck's assistant, the young engineer William Henry Barlow, entered the fray, initially signing himself cryptically W.H.B., but eventually declaring publicly his strong support for Buck. Nicholson, by this time aged 75 and his health failing, had been struggling financially since the bankruptcy of one of his publishers in 1827 and he was in desperate need of the revenue he hoped to receive from sales of his Guide. T., 1844, (Laxton, ed.), op. cit., p. 425. While both Fox and Buck had been happy to acknowledge Nicholson's work and had fought a mostly intellectual battle, Barlow's attacks became less gentlemanly and more personal causing Nicholson, who later received anonymous public support from the mysterious M.Q., considerable distress. Alternatives to the helicoidal method The helicoidal method of laying down the stone or brick courses championed by Nicholson, Fox and Buck is only an approximation to the ideal. Since the courses are only square to the faces of the arch at the crown and deviate more from perpendicularity the closer they are to the springing line, thereby over- correcting the deficiencies of the false skew arch and weakening the obtuse angle, the mathematical purists recommend that helicoidal construction be restricted to segmental arches and not be used in full-centred (semicircular) designs. Despite this there were many full-centred skew bridges built to the helicoidal pattern and many still stand, Kielder Viaduct and Neidpath Viaduct being just two examples. Edward Sang's logarithmic method Edward Sang (1805–1890) Bridge number 74A carrying the Bolton and Preston Railway over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal The development of the intrados of a skew arch built to the logarithmic pattern Detailed view of the intrados of bridge 74A The search for a technically pure orthogonal method of constructing a skew arch led to the proposal of the logarithmic method by Edward Sang, a mathematician living in Edinburgh, in his presentation in three parts to the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts between 18 November 1835 and 27 January 1836, during which time he was elected vice-president of the Society, though his work was not published until 1840. The logarithmic method is based on the principle of laying the voussoirs in \\"equilibrated\\" courses in which they follow lines that run truly perpendicular to the arch faces at all elevations, while the header joints between the stones within each course are truly parallel with the arch face. Hyde, 1899, op. cit., pp. 40–41. While a helix is produced by projecting a straight line onto the surface of a cylinder, Sang's method requires that a series of logarithmic curves be projected onto a cylindrical surface, hence its name. French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., p. 100. In terms of strength and stability, a skew bridge built to the logarithmic pattern has advantages over one built to the helicoidal pattern, especially so in the case of full-centred designs. However, the courses are not parallel, being thinner towards the most acutely angled quoin (located where the face of the arch makes an obtuse angle with the abutment in the plan view, at S and Q in the development to the left, and at the left hand side of the photograph of the intrados on the right) and thicker towards the most obtusely angled quoin (at O and G in the development and just off the right hand side of the photograph), requiring specially cut stones, no two of which in a given course being the same, which precludes the use of mass-produced bricks. Nevertheless, two courses beginning at opposite ends of the barrel at the same height above the springing line are exactly alike, halving the number of templates required. French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., p. 101. In 1838, Alexander James Adie, son of the famous optical instrument manufacturer of the same name, as resident engineer on the Bolton and Preston Railway was the first to put the theory into practice,Bashforth, 1855, op. cit., Preface p. iii. building several skew bridges to the logarithmic pattern on that route, including the semi-elliptical Grade II listed bridge number 74A that carries the line over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which was formerly known as the southern section of the Lancaster Canal with the intention of connecting it to the northern section, though this was never achieved as the necessary aqueduct over the River Ribble proved too expensive to build. He presented a paper on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers the following year and in 1841, academic William Whewell of Trinity College, Cambridge published his book The Mechanics of Engineering in which he expounded the virtues of building skew bridges with equilibrated courses, but due to the poor complexity to benefit ratio, there have been few other adopters. The French corne de vache method William Froude (1810–1879) Skew arch at Cowley Bridge Junction showing the complex brickwork The corne de vache or \\"cow's horn\\" method is another way of laying courses such that they meet the face of the arch orthogonally at all elevations. Hyde, 1899, op. cit., pp. 74–101. Unlike the helicoidal and logarithmic methods, in which the intrados of the arch barrel is cylindrical, the corne de vache method results in a warped hyperbolic paraboloid surface that dips in the middle, rather like a saddle. French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., p. 99. Despite being known as the French method of skew arch building, it was actually introduced by English engineer William Froude whilst working under Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, which opened in 1844. Although no details of Froude's work in this area survive and despite being better remembered for his work on hydrodynamics, he is known to have built at least two overbridges in red brick with stone quoins using this principle on the line just north of Exeter, at Cowley Bridge Junction where the A377 Exeter–Barnstaple road crosses at an oblique angle and, about to the northeast, at Rewe, on the A396, both of which survive and are in daily use. Brown, 2006, op. cit., p. 26. The brickwork is considerably more complex than in a helicoidal design and, in order to ensure that the courses of bricks meet the faces of the arch at right angles, many had to be cut to produce tapers. The corne de vache approach tends to result in a structure that is almost as strong as one built to the logarithmic pattern and considerably stronger than one built to the helicoidal pattern but, again, the extra complexity has meant that the method has not seen widespread adoption, especially since the simpler helicoidal structure can be built much stronger if a segmental design is chosen, rather than a full-centred one. The ribbed skew arch Southdown Road Skew Bridge, an example of a ribbed skew arch made of brick Hereford Road Bridge, Ledbury, a ribbed skew arch made of stone with ribs of blue brick The ribbed skew arch is a form of the false skew arch in which several narrow regular arches or ribs, offset laterally with respect to one another, are used to approximate a true skew arch. French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., pp. 105–106. Motivated by the lack of skilled stonemasons in the 18th century United States, the design was first proposed in 1802 for a crossing of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia by British-born American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and later championed by French civil engineer A. Boucher. Because the series of arch ribs are all regular arches this method of construction has the advantage of being less demanding of unskilled artisans but it has received considerable criticism as being weak, susceptible to frost damage, ugly and wasteful of materials. Culley, 1886, op. cit., pp. 115–116. \\"This method is very faulty, and cannot be too severely condemned. There is no bond between the several ribs, as each rib is separate and distinct in its construction and its position; the load above the arch is never uniform throughout the whole length of the arch, and on account of this lack of bond in the arch, it will be distorted by its unequal settlement. Again, the outer ribs are constantly being forced outwards by the action of frost upon the material that finds lodgement between their heading surfaces.\\" Although Latrobe's bridge was never built as proposed, his method of construction was later to be used extensively by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad throughout the Philadelphia area, including an ambitious viaduct designed by Gustavus A. Nicolls with six skewed spans of across the river and six more land-based skew arches, which was built close to the site of Latrobe's proposed bridge and completed in 1856. Thanks to the reinforcing of the spandrel walls in 1935, the bridge continues to carry rail traffic to this day. The Midland Railway in the United Kingdom suffered from no such shortage of skilled workers but as part of its southern extension towards its London terminus at St Pancras, it was faced with the need to cross Southdown Road in Harpenden at an extremely acute angle of approximately 25°, a figure more acute than the theoretical limit of 25°40′ proposed by Buck, and requiring a bridge with a skew angle of 65°, a situation not unlike that faced by the London and Birmingham railway 30 years earlier at Denbigh Hall. This time the chosen solution was to build Southdown Road bridge as a ribbed skew arch, which opened for traffic in 1868 and was successfully widened in 1893 when the line was converted to quadruple track. Despite the aforementioned criticisms of the design, the bridge is still standing and in daily use by express and commuter trains. A smaller and less extremely skewed example is Hereford Road bridge in Ledbury, Herefordshire, which was built in 1881 to carry the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway at an angle of approximately 45° across the Hereford Road, now a section of the A438. The railway having closed in 1959, it is now used as part of a footpath. Notice that the two bridges in the photographs skew in opposite directions. Southdown Road bridge is said to have a left-hand skew due to the near face being offset to the left of the far face, while Hereford Road bridge has a right-hand skew. Buck, 1839, op. cit., p. 13. ==Construction== Rainhill Skew Bridge from Rainhill Station A close-up of the stonework of Rainhill Bridge Early skew arch bridges were painstakingly built from masonry blocks, each individually and expensively cut to its own unique shape, with no two edges either parallel or perpendicular. A fine example of such construction is the famous Rainhill Skew Bridge, which was designed with a skew span of , in order to give a clear span across the railway of at a skew angle of 56° by George Stephenson and built as a full- sized wooden model in an adjacent field before being completed in 1830. A contemporary skew bridge built to carry the Haggerleazes branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless in County Durham proved too difficult for the original contractors, Thomas Worth and John Batie, who, after piling the foundations for the abutments and laying the lower courses of masonry, abandoned the work. The contract was re-let to James Wilson of Pontefract on 28 May 1830 for £420, an increase of £93 over the original tender. As the principles were not completely understood, the work continued to prove difficult and its imminent collapse was solemnly predicted right up until the time, a few days before the opening of the branch, the centring was removed and the crown of the arch settled by less than half an inch (13 mm). ==Examples of skew arch bridges== Puente de los Franceses, Madrid Rochdale Canal Bridge, Manchester The two skew arches of Yarm Viaduct, North Yorkshire Stanford Viaduct crossing the River Soar, Leicestershire Bradenham Road Bridge, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire Skew Arch Bridge in Reading, Pennsylvania Thirty-third Street Bridge in Philadelphia Ireland * Finlay Bridge, Naas, County Kildare by William Chapman (Kildare Canal, 1787).

As guitarist, she was a founding member of the band 4 Non Blondes and is currently a member of George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. ==Early life== Hall played trumpet in school, studying under Jon Simms, the founder of the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corps, at Benjamin Franklin Intermediate School in Daly City, California. She started taking the guitar seriously as a teenager at Serramonte High School, and studied songwriting at the Blue Bear School of Music in San Francisco with Bonnie Hayes.S. Hall (interview and personal communication, Fall, 2008). ==1980s== Hall joined her first band, The Crash Puppies, in the early 1980s. In the late eighties, she and bassist Christa Hillhouse formed Cool and Unusual Punishment, a new wave duo. Later, they joined, along with drummer Wanda Day, The Lesbian Snake Charmers, led by singer Jai Jai Noire. Hall met vocalist Linda Perry, and when The Lesbian Snake Charmers broke up, they co-founded the alternative rock group 4 Non Blondes with Linda Perry, Christa Hillhouse, and Wanda Day in 1989. ==1990s== In 1990, 4 Non Blondes won the SF Weekly Award (Wammies) for Best Rock Band. Bigger, Better, Faster, More! by Interscope Records was released in 1992 and was the only studio album released by the band. It includes performances and five compositions by Hall (\\"Morphine & Chocolate\\", \\"Spaceman\\", and others). The album peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Top 200. \\"Spaceman\\" was released as a single in 1993 and peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Hall left the band in 1992 during the recording of Bigger, Better, Faster, More! over musical differences with the band as well as with the producer. The album was completed with session guitarist Louis Metoyer. Hall and Pat Wilder subsequently founded Bad Dog Play Dead in 1992. The all-female ensemble played funk, rock, country and pop songs written largely by Hall and Wilder, and the group reunited Hall and 4 Non Blondes drummer Wanda Day. They recorded a demo, engineered and mixed by Garry Crieman at Hyde Street Studios, San Francisco. Janis Tanaka played bass on the demo but did not join the group. The band played live in San Francisco for several months until the permanent disability of Day in December 1992. Hall played as a part of the agro-core hard rock band The Alcohol of Fame (named by studio engineer Garry Crieman) from 1993-1995. The group began as an ensemble Hall put together to perform a benefit for Day at the I-Beam in San Francisco in early 1993. The band changed line-ups, with the core trio of Hall, Crash and Spingola finally teaming with drummer Becky Wreck from the Lunachicks later that year. Their first official performance was at Female Trouble's 'The Dykemare Before Christmas' in December 1993. With the addition of bassist Erica Liss of MDC in early 1994, the lineup made a six-song demo, Mendocino Demo 1994, and played the New Music Seminar in New York, NY followed by an east coast summer tour in 1994. Though Wreck remained on the east Coast, the core trio of Crash, Hall and Spingola returned to San Francisco. Drummer Peter French and a series of bass players including Dennis Dismore and the late Warner Harrison joined The Alcohol of Fame in 1995. The group recorded a second demo in the spring of 1995 at Gush Studios in Oakland, CA. Warner announced his departure from the band only weeks after finishing the demo, and the group disbanded. In 1996, Hall and Tribe 8, Bay Area queercore pioneers, joined Nirvana, Soundgarden, Joan Jett, The Gits, and others on the Home Alive! Compilation. The project raised funds and awareness for self-defense education for women in honor of Mia Zapata, the singer of The Gits who was beaten and murdered while walking home. Hall appears on Frat Pig and another song from the Tribe 8 CD Fist City on Alternative Tenticles Records. She co- produced Tribe 8's Role Models for America released in 1998 on Alternative Tentacles. Hall co-produced Demo, IPO, and Secondary by The Flying Other Bros. in 1999. Throughout the 1990s, Hall played with the theatrical six-piece group The Eric McFadden Experience. In 1998, the group received the SF Weekly Award (Wammies) for Best Americana Band and released Our Revels Now are Ended. The CD includes one Hall composition, Macaroon, which also appeared on an early 4 Non Blondes demo. ==2000s== Alien Lovestock's 2000 CD Planet of Fish includes the composition \\"Alien Love\\" co-written by Hall, Eric McFadden and George Clinton. Hall composed eight tracks with Storm, Inc. for the independent release The Calm Years in April 2001. Storm, Inc. started in the summer of 1999 when Hall sat in with singer Storm Large as a support guitarist for acoustic gigs. Hall and Storm, Inc. wrote and created The Calm Years. and toured the US west coast following its release. As a sound designer, Hall helped create the first online video game developed by Shockwave in 2000. Tamale Loco is now available in the Shockwave Favorites Vol. 1 game bundle or as a standalone download at Shockwave.com. In the summer of 2001, she played with Dog Ass, a trio with Los Angeles drummer Becky Wreck and bassist Christy Michel. Formed specifically to play a Breast Cancer Awareness Benefit presented by Loudithfaire, a festival celebrating lesser-known women in rock, the trio gave a few shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles before Hall moved to Barcelona, Spain in 2002. Hall wrote, produced, and directed a short film called The Beauty of Betrayal in May 2002. Brick Seriously and Hall recorded the video in San Francisco. It features her composition Beauty Sleeps recorded in San Francisco and Los Angeles with drummer Kevin Carnes, EricMcFadden Experience members Sam Bass, Ben Barnes and Paula O'Rourke. Janis Tanaka plays the saw on the instrumental. Hall appears in the film along with actress Natalie Richie. In July 2002, Hall began touring with George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic. Since then, she has played on several US, Canadian and European tours as well as dates abroad. She was the monitor engineer from 2002–2004, and the P-Funk Live at the 2004 Montreaux Jazz Festival DVD credits her engineering work. She became the first official female guitarist of P-Funk in 2007. Hall and Dutch artist Margot van Ham shared an art/music studio in Barcelona, Spain from 2004 to 2006. In 2004, Hall released a video called The Third Eye. Van Ham produced the video in 2004 with a song Hall wrote with Paul Hill and Clip Payne of P-Funk in 2002. The video was released in 2006 as a part of Hall's multimedia project, Electrofunkadelica: e3+FUNKnth = music for the body, mind & soul. In 2007, Hall appeared on the BBC program The 100 Most Annoying Pop Songs We Hate To Love, which featured the 4 Non Blondes song \\"What's Up? at number 91 on the list. Hall joined a number of artists for former artist liaison and backstage manager Tiffany Travalent's benefit at 12 Galaxies in San Francisco in 2007. Led by Eric McFadden, a large group of musicians including Bernie Worrell (Parliament-Funkadelic), Dawn Silva (Brides of Funkenstein/Sly and the Family Stone), Jerry Harrison (Talking Heads), Pete Sears, Carol Hernandez, and The Meters' drummer Ziggy Modeliste gave their time to benefit Travalent, who suffers from severe chronic pain, is unable to work, and had large outstanding medical bills. A DVD of the event was released with footage from the show and related content. Hall earned two engineering credits in 2008—the first for Clinton's vocals on the song Heads Will Roll, for Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's Return of the Super Ape. The second, George Clinton and his Gangsters of Love, charted on both the Billboard R&B; and Independent Charts. ==Current projects== Hall returned to the United States in 2005, and continues to tour the world as a guitarist with George Clinton and Parliament- Funkadelic in The P-Funk Allstars. She became an official band member in 2007 after five years of touring as a part-time player, monitor engineer, and crew member. She released a solo project, Electrofunkadelica, in 2006. She wrote, produced, and recorded most of the project on a Macintosh laptop with a portable studio while touring the world with P-Funk on the road between 2002 and 2005, and the tracks feature many P-Funk members and musician friends. The 2006 release Electrofunkadelica: e3+FUNKnth = music for the body, mind & soul, is a collection of audio recordings and three videos. It consists of contemporary music and projected visual imagery performances described as \\"containing some social and political messages, some emotional and inspirational, and some are just plain fun\\". The Electrofunkadelica live performances feature Hall on guitar, electronic sources including looping samplers, Kevin Carnes on drums, Stephan G. as VJ, and occasional guest vocalists or instrumentalists. Projected visual imagery plays a large part in the show, with VJ mixing, animation and film. She is currently creating the next Electrofunkadelica collection, which will again feature many musical guests and the recording debut of drag king character BB Kink. Hall created BB Kink as an Electro-GoGo-Love-Blues guitar player. She introduced the character in late 2008 with performances in Barcelona at Sala Monasterio and San Francisco at Anon Salon. ==Interests and affiliations== Hall was a panelist for the 2000 and 2005 ROCKRGRL Music Conference, and has been a volunteer performer for Bread and Roses since 1997. She is a member of ASCAP. ==Discography== George Clinton George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love Shanachie - 2008 Engineer Billboard R&B; and Independent Charts Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry Return of the Super Ape Goldenlane Records - 2008 Engineer Electrofunkadelica e3+FUNKnth=music for the body, mind & soul Make Music, Not War Records - 2006 Guitar, producer, songwriter and more Eric McFadden Dementia Bad Reputation Records - 2006 Guitar 420 Funk Mob Alive in Spain wefunk 2kAD - 2004 Guitar wefunkFM.com, wefunk records, and thefunkstore.com Eric McFadden Eric McFadden 2002 Guitar Alien Lovestock Planet of Fish NMX Records - 2001 Songwriter Storm, Inc.

The two schools are strong rivals due to several factors, including similar recruiting areas and the relatively short distance between each other, approximately apart. The two teams first played in 1919 and the series ran uninterrupted from 1980 to 2007. West Virginia leads the series 28–22–2. The two teams met for the Gator Bowl for a rematch at the end of the 2003 season. Until the series lapsed in 2007, the game was the longest continuously running non- conference game for both schools. After the 2015 edition in Morgantown, WV, the two teams will not meet again until 2021 in College Park. ==Background== The rivalry is arguably more competitive than Maryland's other two historically important games: Virginia and Penn State. For West Virginia, it may not be as emotional as the Backyard Brawl, but it is still an important game. Due to the game traditionally being played early in the season, both teams have historically viewed the game as a good measuring stick for the rest of the season. ESPN personality and former Maryland assistant coach, Lee Corso said, that during the 1960s, the rivalry \\"was really competitive because of the fact that they would sometimes come to Maryland and recruit our players, and we would try to go to West Virginia and recruit some of them ... That adds to the rivalry.\\"Marc Carig, One for the Border, Washington Post, 13 September 2007. This practice of poaching the opponent's areas of interest remains to this day. In recent history, Terps fullback Cory Jackson was a Morgantown native, while former quarterback Scott McBrien transferred from West Virginia after frustration over not starting. In McBrien's last college game, the 2004 Gator Bowl, he passed for a school bowl record 381 yards and three touchdowns during a 41–7 thrashing of the Mountaineers. Conversely, Heisman finalist Steve Slaton was originally offered a scholarship to Maryland but chose West Virginia when the offer was ultimately revoked. In the 2007 game Slaton exacted his revenge, running for 137 yards and three touchdowns against the Terps. Likewise, fullback Owen Schmitt from northern Virginia originally wished to play for Maryland, but when the school was uninterested, he walked onto the Mountaineers, from where he was since drafted into the NFL.Slaton scores 3 TDs to lead West Virginia past Maryland, ESPN, 13 September 2007. Schmitt had his \\"coming out\\" party in WVU's 31–19 triumph over the Terrapins in 2005, gaining 80 yards on just six carries and contributing substantially to two Mountaineer touchdown drives which broke the game open early in the fourth quarter.West Virginia 31, Maryland 19, ESPN, 17 September 2005. There was a two-year hiatus during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, in which Maryland played California and West Virginia played Colorado. The schools agreed to resume the series, scheduling games for each year from 2010 to 2013.Maryland- West Virginia football added in 2012 and 2013 , The Washington Times, May 20, 2009. West Virginia won the first game after the hiatus, 31–17 in Morgantown. On September 13, 2010, the two schools announced a deal to extend the series through 2017. The 2013 game, designated a Maryland home game, was played at M&T; Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Maryland dominated with a 37–0 shutout victory, the first since 1999. The following season, in 2014, West Virginia and Maryland combined for over 1,000 yards of total offense as the Mountaineers beat the Terrapins 40–37 on a last-second Josh Lambert field goal. ==Notable games== 1949 #15 Maryland 47, West Virginia 7 In the first game with one of the two ranked, #15 Maryland routed West Virginia 47–7. In the first half, head coach Jim Tatum guided the Terrapins to a 21–0 lead, and kept the Mountaineers offense from advancing past midfield all but once. In the third quarter, Maryland scored three touchdowns in quick succession. Six Maryland players scored, including two different centers, and back Ed Modzelewski twice. With the win, Maryland improved to 8–1 to help its case for an eventual berth in the 1950 Gator Bowl. The Terrapins extended their season scoring total to 233 points, the most in school history.Maryland Tips West Virginia, Daytona Beach Morning Journal, November 25, 1949. 1951 #5 Maryland 54, West Virginia 7 In Maryland's season finale before an already- secured berth in the 1952 Sugar Bowl, at halftime Maryland led 35–7. In the second half, coach Tatum fielded mostly reserve players to prevent running up the score. Back Ed Modzelewski had 14 carries for 131 yards and two touchdowns, which outgained the combined mark for the opposing team for the sixth time of the season. The Maryland defense stifled the West Virginia ground attack, which rushed only eight times for a net loss of 21 yards. The win preserved Maryland's perfect record, which made it the first undefeated Terrapins team in 57 years.Maryland Whips West Virginia; Mo Modzelewski Outgains Opponent, Toledo Blade, November 24, 1951. 1977 West Virginia 24, #11 Maryland 16 West Virginia snapped #11 Maryland's 15-game regular season winning streak, and ended their hopes for a second undefeated season. The Mountaineers dominated the first half behind an efficient effort by quarterback Dan Kendra who completed six consecutive passes and led the team to a 24–0 halftime advantage. The third touchdown came on a 54-yard Kendra pass to wide receiver Cedric Thomas, who was open because of blown coverage by cornerback Jonathan Claiborne, Maryland coach Jerry Claiborne's son. The West Virginia defense stifled Maryland's comeback bid in the final minutes with a stop on the two-yard line.West Virginia Surprises Maryland, Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, September 19, 1977. 1982 #17 West Virginia 19, Maryland 18 In a clash of eventual AP top twenty-finishing teams, the Mountaineers outlasted the Terrapins in a nail-biter when Maryland’s all-or-nothing bid for a game- winning two-point conversion attempt failed late in the game. Jeff Hostetler and Boomer Esiason each threw TD passes for their respective teams, and WVU kicker Paul Woodside boomed four field goals, three over forty yards. Mountaineer coach Don Nehlen later cited the victory as being more important than his team’s stunning upset of traditional power Oklahoma the previous weekend.Hoss Outduels Boomer, MSNSportsNET.com, July 26, 2000. 1983 #20 West Virginia 31, #17 Maryland 21 West Virginia quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw interceptions which resulted in Maryland taking an early 10–0 lead. A touchdown by Mountaineers running back Ron Wolfley and field goal by kicker Paul Woodside tied it before halftime. In the second half, Hostetler threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Bennett to make it 24–10, which put the game out of reach.'Dogs tie one on against Clemson, The Times-News, September 19, 1983.

The Terrapins scored the first by capitalizing on Anthony Browns' fumble on the first play of the game on the West Virginia 11-yard line. The Mountaineers then rallied to score 17 unanswered points in the first half, and their defense limited the Terrapins to just five first downs in the remainder of the opening half. In the second half, West Virginia expanded its lead to a rout, and beat Maryland for the first time since 1983.COLLEGE FOOTBALL: East; Pitt Overwhelms Ohio State, 42-10, The New York Times, September 18, 1988. 2004 Gator Bowl #23 Maryland 41, #20 West Virginia 7 At the end of the 2003 season, #20 West Virginia and #23 Maryland met at a bowl game for the first time.

Explosive specialist and wide receiver Steve Suter returned a WV punt 76 yards for a touchdown, and all-time ACC scoring leader Nick Novak hit two field goals.

The book is a portrayal of everyday life in Rome from the end of World War II to the student movements of the 1960s. Levi skilfully and lovingly sketches a portrait of the Capital city and of its inhabitants through changing seasons and changing times. The author revels in the riotous celebrations for New Year and the many festivals through the year, and rejoices in the beauty of the city in the early morning mist. He introduces a civil servant who spends his days collecting wild asparagus (a perfect employee who takes up no room in his office and causes no scandals), a peasant who wishes to be a writer, a writer who prefers football to talking about literature and thieves who masquerade as policemen. Rome for Levi is a constant joyous adventure that at every encounter and every street presents the casual stroller with a new and hidden delight. The book has an introduction by Italian critic Giulio Ferroni and quotes as its epigraph a sonnet about Rome written by the baroque writer Francisco de Quevedo: {  border=\\"0\\" - ! A Roma sepultada en sus ruinasF. de Quevedo, 'A Roma sepultada en sus ruinas', from 'Parnaso español: Clio', in Poesía varia, edited by J.O. Crosby, Ediciones Cátedra, Madrid, 1997. ! To Rome Buried in Its Ruins -  Buscas en Roma a Roma oh peregrino! y en Roma misma a Roma no la hallas: cadáver son las que ostentó murallas y tumba de sí proprio el Aventino. Yace donde reinaba el Palatino y limadas del tiempo, las medallas más se muestran destrozo a las batallas de las edades que Blasón Latino. Sólo el Tibre quedó, cuya corriente, si ciudad la regó, ya sepultura la llora con funesto son doliente. Oh Roma en tu grandeza, en tu hermosura, huyó lo que era firme y solamente lo fugitivo permanece y dura!  You seek Rome in Rome, o pilgrim! and in Rome itself you do not find Rome: the proud walls are a corpse and the Aventine Hill is its own tomb. Where the Palatine once held sway it now lies full length and, honed by time, medals show themselves to the battle of the ages more as damage than as the Latin Escutcheon. Only the Tiber remained, and its stream, if once it irrigated Rome as a city, now weeps for it as a supulchre, with a grim and grieving sound. Oh Rome, in your grandeur and beauty, that which was solid vanished, and all that endures and lasts is the fleeting moment. } Although this volume of essays was published posthumously, edited by Gigliola De Donato and Luisa Montevecchi, Levi himself intended to gather and publish them with the title Roma fuggitiva (Fleeting Rome), a name that had been inspired by the example of the above verses Quevedo dedicated to Rome.Mistakenly attributed to Luis de Góngora, cf. Fleeting Rome, p. xvi. 'Roma fuggitiva' is also the title of a short note among Levi's papers, dated 6 March 1963 from the addition or preamble to the article 'Il popolo di Roma' (The People of Rome). From this note, one learns that Levi took that reference as something like a metaphor for the endurance of that which history in any case had condemned to disappear, that is, that provisional 'restoration' that he had witnessed in the wake of the hopes of the Italian Resistance.

Before a motion picture is actually released, it consists of several components, one containing the visual image, one containing the sound as recorded on-set, another containing the musical score, another containing sound effects, etc. All of these are eventually blended and printed together into a composite print. During the 1950s and 1960s, some movie spectacles, especially those in Cinerama, would have the sound and picture perfectly synchronized, but running on separate machines. This was necessary in three-strip Cinerama because the image consisted of three films each forming a part of a gigantic picture, projected on a huge, deeply curved screen. The seven-track sound was recorded on magnetic tape, which ran simultaneously with the three projectors. In the case of some films, such as the world premiere engagement of Carousel, which was made in CinemaScope 55, a six-track soundtrack could not be accommodated on the film, so the sound was played on an interlocking tape machine.

Wrapper functions are used to make writing computer programs easier by abstracting away the details of a subroutine's underlying implementation. == Purpose == Wrapper functions are a means of delegation and can be used for a number of purposes.  Programming convenience  Wrapper functions can be used to make writing computer programs easier. An example of this is the \`MouseAdapter\` and similar classes in the Java AWT library.The Java Tutorials Wrapper functions are useful in the development of applications that use third-party library functions. A wrapper can be written for each of the third party functions and used in the native application. In case the third party functions change or are updated, only the wrappers in the native application need to be modified as opposed to changing all instances of third party functions in the native application. Adapting class/object interfaces Wrapper functions can be used to adapt an existing class or object to have a different interface. This is especially useful when using existing library code. Code testing Wrapper functions can be used to write error checking routines for pre-existing system functions without increasing the length of a code by a large amount by repeating the same error check for each call to the function. All calls to the original function can be replaced with calls to the wrapper, allowing the programmer to forget about error checking once the wrapper is written. A test driver is a kind of wrapper function that exercises a code module, typically calling it repeatedly, with different settings or parameters, in order to rigorously pursue each possible path. It is not deliverable code, but is not throwaway code either, being typically retained for use in regression testing. An interface adaptor is a kind of wrapper function that simplifies, tailors, or amplifies the interface to a code module, with the intent of making it more intelligible or relevant to the user. It may rename parameters, combine parameters, set defaults for parameters, and the like. Multiple inheritance In a programming language that does not support multiple inheritance of base classes, wrapper functions can be used to simulate it. Below is an example of part of a Java class that \\"inherits\\" from LinkedList and HashSet. See Method for further implementation details. public class Test implements LinkedList, HashSet{ @Override //contains data members and data methods //covariant return } ==Library functions and system calls== Many library functions, such as those in the C Standard Library, act as interfaces for abstraction of system calls. The fork and execve functions in glibc are examples of this. They call the lower-level fork and execve system calls, respectively. This may lead to incorrectly using the terms \\"system call\\" and \\"syscall\\" to refer to higher-level library calls rather than the similarly named system calls, which they wrap. ==See also== *Wrapper library *Driver wrapper *Adapter pattern *Decorator pattern *Delegation (programming) *Forwarding (object-oriented programming) *Language binding wrapper to another language *SWIG automatic wrapper generator *Nested function *Partial application ==References== Category:Articles with example Java code Category:Subroutines ","title":"Wrapper function"},{"id":"20224427","text":"Mustalevria (), or Moustokouloura (when cookies), is a traditional Greek kind of pudding made of grape must mixed with flour and boiled until thick. ==Historical information and names== Moustalevria originated in ancient Greece where it was known under the name oinouta ().Le bulletin «Les Nouvelles» est édité par l’Institut d'Etudes Néo-Helléniques de Paris During the Byzantine era it was called mustopita () or pastellos ().

Tegula pulligo ==Description== The size of the shell varies between 19 mm and 41 mm. The solid shell is deeply and widely umbilicate. It has a conical shape with an elevated spire. Its color is dull purplish or brown, when worn often orange, obliquely streaked with white or unicolored. The seven whorls are flattened, the upper ones finely spirally striate and sometimes very obsoletely plicate. The remainder is smooth, obliquely finely striate. The base of the shell is flattened, slightly convex, obliquely streaked, concave and white around the umbilicus. The body whorl is bluntly angled at the periphery. The aperture is very oblique, smaller than usual in this genus. The thin columella is obtusely dentate, ending above in a white callus which partly covers the umbilicus. There is no spiral ridge within the umbilicus.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Chlorostoma pulligo) ==Distribution== This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.

One of the bands was Kajuku. Some members from that band are currently in Opeth and Anekdoten. 1986 Stefan Dimle started the rock club Mellotronen in Borlänge. The company existed on a parallel basis in Stockholm and Borlänge. The shop had a huge section of rare and hard to find CDs & LPs in the field of progressive rock. Mellotronen became an important headquarters for musicians and fans of progressive rock during the 1990s. The shop Mellotronen was located on the fashionable street Kåkbrinken in Gamla Stan in the center of Stockholm. Nowadays one can find Dimle and his company in the city of Gustavsberg. Stefan Dimle was a member of the band Landberk between 1990-1997. They recorded three albums and two EPs on various record labels like Record Heaven, Mega Rock and the American label Laser's Edge. The progressive rock groups Landberk, Änglagård and Anekdoten co-operated a lot, and all three of them used the instrument Mellotron as a main instrument. These three groups led the way for many new bands in the progressive genre. All three of them were famous on an international level.Leonardo Nahoum, Enciclopédia Do Rock Progressivo (1994), uppslagsord \\"Landberk\\". The label Mellotronen started 1991 with a CD reissue of Solid Grounds debut album from 1976. Since then has Dimle released around 50 different CD and vinyl albums. The latest ones are a double-CD with Trettioåriga Kriget and two albums with Sabu Martinez. Dimle and Mellotronen has co-operated a lot with labels like Universal, The National Swedish Radio, MNW, Sony and EMI. Together with members from Landberk and Anekdoten, Dimle started the project Morte Macabre, who has made a career in film circuits with their repertoire of new versions of old soundtracks from mainly Italian horror movies. The band Paatos started in 1999 and Dimle performed with them til 2008. Paatos has released four albums and 7\\" inch vinyl single. Dimle has also performed with Emma Nordenstam, And the machine said behold, Turid and Onkel Kånkel and his kånkelbär. In January 2007 organised Dimle a rock festival on board the ship Silja Festival to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Mellotronen company. Among the many artists that performed on board can the following ones be mentioned, Fläsket Brinner, November, Asoka, Morte Macabre, Solid Ground and Emma Nordenstam. In March 2008 was it time for a 2nd rock cruise on the ship Silja Symphony. Many people came to see bands like Opeth, Katatonia and Comus. In April 2009 the third rock cruise was supposed to take place with the destination Finland, this time on board the M/S Galaxy. However, a few months before the date Dimle announced that Melloboat 2009 had been cancelled. Among the many artist that was supposed to perform on the cruise was Meshuggah, May Blitz and Steven Wilson.P3 Rock 2007-01-18 Hans Kronbrink, \\"Till sjöss\\" i Dagens Nyheter 2007-01-25Nils Hansson, \\"Proggbåten är lastad\\" i Dagens Nyheter 2007-01-31 == References  *Dimle på MySpace *Mellotronen *Landberk i Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock *Paatos Category:Swedish bass guitarists Category:1967 births Category:Living people ","title":"Stefan Dimle"},{"id":"20224466","text":"150px British Grove Studios is a recording studio located at 20 British Grove in Chiswick, West London, owned by musician Mark Knopfler. British Grove Studios was built by David Stewart, the studio's former manager, commissioned by Knopfler as \\"a monument to past and future technology\\". It has two studios. Alongside modern technology, the equipment includes two old EMI mixing consoles: a very rare tube desk from the 1960s like the ones used by George Martin and The Beatles and a later console on which the album Band on the Run was recorded. The large console in studio one is a custom-made Neve 88R, while the console in studio two is an API Legacy. The main speakers are ATC monitors in a 5.1 configuration. Specifically, the full-range models are ATC SCM 300ASL (300A) mounted in standard left-center-right configuration, with two more 300As on a unique track system for surround. Dual ATC SCM0.1/15ASL PRO (Sub 1/15) subwoofers alongside the left and right mains provide the LFE monitoring. In February 2009, British Grove Studio was the winner of the Music Producers Guild Award for 'Best Studio'. Before Richard Wright died in 2008, he went to British Grove Studios to record a missing piano part from \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" by Pink Floyd. This was found to be missing by James Guthrie, who was remixing the Wish You Were Here album for an SACD release.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxO34OyJ-WE ==Recordings== The following albums were recorded at British Grove Studios: *On an Island by David Gilmour (2006) (sections of the album) *Razorlight by Razorlight (2006) *The Boy with No Name by Travis (2007)travisonline.com The Boy with No Name *Kill to Get Crimson by Mark Knopfler, (2007) *Footsteps by Chris de Burgh (2008) *The Age of the Understatement by The Last Shadow Puppets (2008) *Hayley Sings Japanese Songs by Hayley Westenra (2008) *Beautiful You by Greg Pearle and John Illsley (2008) *Songs for My Mother by Ronan Keating (2009) *Get Lucky by Mark Knopfler (2009) *Endlessly by Duffy (2010) *Serotonin by Mystery Jets (2010) *The Sailor's Revenge by Bap Kennedy (2012) *Privateering by Mark Knopfler (2012) *Heart of Nowhere by Noah and the Whale (2013) *Tierra by Vicente Amigo (2013) *The Breeze: An Appreciation of JJ Cale by Eric Clapton & Friends (2014) *The New Classic by Iggy Azalea (2014) *Kablammo! by ASH (2015) *Tracker by Mark Knopfler (2015) *I Still Do by Eric Clapton (2016) *Believe by Jonathan Antoine (2016) *Blue & Lonesome by The Rolling Stones (2016) *Down the Road Wherever by Mark Knopfler (2018) *Coming up for Air by John Illsley (2019) *Who by The Who (2019) *Taller by Jamie Cullum (2019) == David Stewart & Dave Harries == Together, David Stewart and Dave Harries set up 'British Grove Studios' in the early 2000's for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. As cited in 'The Chiswick Calendar', 'David Stewart knew Mark through his wife Robyn, who was Mark’s PA. He introduced Mark to Dave Harries with whom he had been working for ten years already at that point, and the two of them set about scouring west London in 2000 – 2001 looking for suitable properties'. They decided upon the property in Chiswick largely because of its size and proximity to Heathrow airport, convenient for the numerous American artists travelling to record at the studio. Upon its completion, Stewart made the natural progression (having overseen the project from the outset) of becoming 'Studio Manager'. On the 9th of April 2020, Stewart tragically died of complications from Covid-19. In a statement from Knopfler he said, \\"I am very sad to announce the loss of our dear friend David Stewart, our studio Manager. David will be sorely missed, not only by everyone at British Grove but also by everybody who knew him.

(born January 19, 1955) is a Northern Mariana Islander politician and former election commissioner. Elected in 2008, Sablan became the first delegate to the United States House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Elected as an independent, Sablan caucuses with the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives. In February 2009, Sablan became a Democrat. Sablan is the only Chamorro member of Congress. He was re-elected as a Democrat in the 2010 and 2012 elections and was re-elected as an independent in 2014, 2016, and 2018. ==Early life and education== Sablan was born on Saipan, capital of the CNMI, on January 19, 1955. He was the only son of seven children. He grew up in an extended family, spending much time with his grandparents. His father was an employee of Bank of America. His uncle was the mayor of Saipan. At the age of eleven, Sablan began boarding at Xavier High School, a Jesuit school in Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, then administered by the United States. He then returned to Saipan, where he graduated from Marianas High School. At the age of sixteen, Sablan began attending the University of Guam before transferring to the University of California at Berkeley. However, he dropped out of college when his father lost his job. Upon returning to Saipan, Sablan married and had three children. He later attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa from 1989 until 1990, but did not graduate. Sablan is married to Andrea, a Filipino American, and has six children and five grandchildren. ==Early political career== Sablan served two terms in the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature from 1982 until 1986 as a Democrat. During his time in the legislature, he was selected as a special representative to hold talks with the United States Assistant Secretary of the Interior to negotiate federal assistance for the CNMI. He retired from the Commonwealth Legislature to become Special Assistant to Daniel Inouye, a U.S. Senator from Hawaii, during the late 1980s. After this, he briefly returned to college before returning to the CNMI to serve as Special Assistant for Management and Budget in the administration of Froilan Tenorio (1994–98). He later served as a Special Assistant in the administration of Pedro P. Tenorio (1998–2002) before being appointed Executive Director of the Commonwealth Election Commission, a position in which he served until he filed to run for delegate. ==Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives== Background For 30 years, beginning in 1978, citizens of the CNMI elected a Resident Representative, commonly known as Washington representative, an office established by Article V of the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands for the purpose of representing the CNMI in the United States capital and performing related official duties established by CNMI law. In 2008, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, signed into law by President George W. Bush, replaced the position of resident representative with a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives. The other United States insular areas, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, as well as the District of Columbia, already had nonvoting delegates to Congress. The new position received the power to serve in congressional committees, to introduce bills, and to vote on proposed legislation in committee, but still had limited powers on the House floor, lacking the right to vote on legislation on the House floor. The election of the first delegate was set for November 4, 2008. It was the only contest on the ballot, as local elections in the CNMI occurred in odd-numbered years through 2009 and residents of the CNMI do not have the right to vote in United States presidential elections. Elections 2008 Sitting Resident Representative Pedro A. Tenorio, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the new office. David Cing, a former member of the Northern Mariana Islands Senate, received the nomination of the Democratic Party of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is not officially affiliated with the national Democratic Party. Seven independents also ran for the office, including Sablan. Although Sablan was traditionally affiliated with the Democratic Party, he chose to run as an independent. In the CNMI's first federal election, fewer than 13,000 people registered to vote in the election, and 79 percent of those who registered voted in the election. During the campaign, Sablan stated that as delegate, he would seek to bring more federal funding for education, more federal funding for health care, and federal funding for a more productive search for effective alternative energy sources to the CNMI. He also said that as delegate he will introduce and pursue passage of submerged lands legislation that would give the CNMI economic rights and regulation for submerged lands and waters out 200 miles from the islands. He also supports federal funding for a United States Coast Guard station in the CNMI, although one already exists in neighboring Guam. Sablan was elected the CNMI's first delegate to the House of Representatives on November 4, 2008, receiving 2,474 votes, or 23% of the vote. He defeated Tenorio, who received 20%, by only 357 votes. Other close competitors included fellow independents John Gonzales, who received 18.73% of the vote, and Juan Lizama, who received 17.34%.Official election results, 2008 2010 In a four-way race, Sablan received 4,896 votes (43%) defeating the Covenant Party's Joe Camacho (2,744), the Republican Party's former Governor Juan Babauta (1,978) and Democrat former Lieutenant Governor Jesus Borja (1,707) in the 2010 general election. 2012 Sablan received 9,829 votes (80%) of the votes to Republican Ignacia T. Demapan's 2,503 votes in the November 2012 general election. Sablan is the first political candidate to record such a high winning total over an opponent. 2014 Sablan won the November 2014 election with 65.3% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Andrew Sablan Salas. 2016 Sablan successfully ran unopposed in the November 2016 election. 2018 Sablan won the November 2018 election, which was delayed for a week due to the impact of Typhoon Yutu, with 64.6% of the vote, defeating Republican candidate Angel Demapan. Tenure Sablan assumed office on January 3, 2009, and was sworn in on January 6. Sablan decided to caucus with the Democratic Party. Several dignitaries from the Northern Mariana Islands attended Sablan's swearing-in-ceremony by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, including Governor Benigno Fitial and his wife, First Lady Josie Fitial, as well as the outgoing CNMI Resident Representative in Washington, Pete Tenorio, whom Sablan defeated in the 2008 election. On February 10, 2009, Sablan introduced submerged lands legislation which would give the CNMI \\"the same benefits in its submerged lands as Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa have in their submerged lands.\\" The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416–0 on July 15, 2009http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll541.xml but stalled in the Senate. Sablan has also introduced a bill which would provide for the establishment of Job Corps centers in U.S. territories and a bill which would authorize college tuition grants of up to $15,000 per year to graduates of CNMI high schools. The latter bill would also allow CNMI students to pay \\"in-state tuition\\" at any public college or university in the United States. Both bills stalled in the House. As of September 2018, Sablan had sponsored two bills and cosponsored 37 that ultimately became law. As delegate, Sablan has sought and often secured earmarks, energy grants, and other federal funding for projects in the CNMI. Much of this funding came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The ARRA did not include the CNMI in a 13.86% across-the-board increase in food stamp benefits nationally, but Sablan successfully lobbied Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to reprogram $1.459 million to give the Northern Marianas the same 13.86% increase as the rest of the country. According to a report released by AOL News in July 2010, by the end of June 2010 (nine months into the US Government's fiscal year), Sablan had spent more money from his Members Representational Allowances on food than any other congressman with $23,457. Sablan claimed that the amount was used to refund staffers for various travel costs.

Bombus suckleyi. NatureServe Explorer Version 7.1. Accessed 10 March 2016.BugGuide Suckley's bumble bee is a generalist pollinator and represents a rare group of obligate, parasitic bumble bees (cuckoo bumble bees). Suckley's bumble bee is a social-parasite because it invades the nests of the host bumble bees, including the western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis), and relies on host species workers to provision its larvae. It is native to northwestern North America, including Alaska and parts of western and central Canada and the western United States. ==Taxonomy== Bumble bees are members of the genus Bombus within the insect order Hymenoptera and family Apidae. Bombus suckleyi was first described by John Greene Green JW. 1860. Review of the American Bombidae, together with a Description of several Species heretofe undescribed, being a Synopsis of the species of this family of Hymenopterous Insects thus far known to inhabit North America. Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York 7:168–176. and named after George Suckley. Suckley's bumble bee and all cuckoo bumble bees are classified under the subgenus Psithyrus.Williams PH, Cameron SA, Hines HM, Cederberg B, Rasmont P. 2008. A simplified subgeneric classification of the bumblebees (genus Bombus). Apidologie 39:46–74. Bombus suckleyi is recognized as a valid species in the United States under the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).ITIS. 2019. ITIS Standard Report Page: Bombus suckleyi. Available from https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search;_value=714839#null. ==Description and Identification== Suckley's bumble bee is a member of the subgenus Psithyrus which contains all cuckoo bumble bees. This subgenus differs morphologically from other Bombus subgenera primarily because its members do not have corbicula (pollen-carrying baskets) on the tibia of their hind legs. Cuckoo bees do not gather nectar or pollen for their own brood and have lost the ability to carry large amounts of pollen and nectar on their body. Suckley's bumble bee can be distinguished from other bees based on physical characteristics and coloration. It is most similar to the Ashton cuckoo bumble bee (Bombus bohemicus), the indiscriminate bumble bee (Bombus insularis), and the Fernald cuckoo bumble bee (Bombus flavidus). Suckley's bumble bee females are 0.72–0.92 in (18–23 mm) in length and covered in short hair of even length that is black, yellow, or white. The hind tibia has a round, convex shape with dense hairs and no pollen carrying basket. Suckley's bumble bee females have variable coloration with black faces and predominately yellow thorax. The abdomen consists of seven tergal segments: T1 and T2 are black, T3 has some yellow laterally and posterially with no yellow centrally, T4 is predominately yellow with a black patch centrally and anteriorally (contrast Aston cuckoo bumble bee), T5 is usually black, but can have some yellow laterally, and T6 and T7 are black. Males are slightly smaller than females at 0.51–0.61 in (13–16 mm) in length and their hind legs are convex with few hairs. The male coloration is highly variable with consistently T1 and T4 yellow, some yellow on T2, T3, T5, T6, and T7 is black. ==Natural History== Life Cycle and Behavior Suckley's bumble bee is a cuckoo bumble bee or social parasite of other Bombus species. Its life cycle is directly linked to a host species for survival because they have lost the ability to collect sufficient pollen and nectar to produce colonies. All individual Suckey's bumble bees are able to reproduce and there is no sterile worker caste, differing from eusocial Bombus species. Suckley's bumble bee females emerge later in the season than host species and invade a host colony by killing or subduing the resident queen. A Suckley's bumble bee female is not strictly speaking a queen because she does not produce any worker bees of her own, and instead controls the host workers to continue collecting pollen and nectar to provision her offspring. Once developed, individuals leave the nest to mate; mated females feed on nectar and pollen prior to overwintering and males die after mating. Females emerge in the spring and forage until they find a suitable host colony to invade. Suckley's bumble bee has been documented breeding in colonies of B. occidentallis and has been recorded in colonies of B. terricola, B. rufocinctus, B. fervidus, and B. nevadensis, and B. appositus. Suckley's bumble bee females in California are active from late May to late October, with their greatest activity in June. Males in California are active from early July to late September, with peaks in late July and early September. Habitat Suckley's bumble bee inhabits western meadows at a wide range of elevations. Like all bumble bees, Suckley's bumble bee requires suitable nesting sites for colonies, nectar and pollen resources during the colony period (spring, summer, and fall), and suitable overwintering sites for mated females. Suckley's bumble bee has historically been widespread across the western United States in a variety of meadow ecosystems. Historic observations have been most often made at higher elevations meadows within forest or subalpine zones. Meadows often exist within patchy meadow-complexes and bumble bees are able to exploit scattered resources because they are mobile compared to other insects. Quality and quantity of bumble bee habitat varies at a landscape scale and bumble bees routinely forage over relatively large distances of > 1.25 miles (> 2 km) and require approximately 815–2,500 acres (3.3–10 km) of suitable habitat to sustain viable populations. The quantity and quality of floral resources within Suckley's range varies greatly, and floral-rich meadows are often interspersed within forests or exist in field margins and hedgerows within a matrix of flower-poor agricultural land. Suckley's bumble bee and its host species rely on flowers through the entire growing season to produce large colonies. Suckley's bumble bee is a generalist forager and has been reported on a wide range of flowers mostly in the Asteraceae family and some in the Fabaceae family, with Aster, Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, and Solidago as example food plants. DiscoverLife lists the following as Suckley's floral associations (with number of observations): Cirsium (15), Aster sp. (11), Centaurea repens (10), and Trifolium sp. (4). Suckley's bumble bee depends on the success of its host species and its primary host, the western bumble bee, which feeds similarly on Ceanothus, Centaurea, Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, Geranium, Grindellia, Lupinus, Melilotus, Monardella, Rubus, Solidago, and Trifolum. The temporal distribution of flowering plants is important, as the amount of nectar and pollen during the early spring and late summer impact the growth of the host colony and for the production of Suckley's bumble bee individuals. The nests that host Suckley's bumble bee are primarily underground cavities that have been created naturally or by other animals such as abandoned rodent nests. Suckley's bumble bee females also require sites where they hibernate during the winter after mating. Bumble bees are generally known to hibernate close to the ground surface or down an inch or two in loose soil, or under leaf litter or other debris, in sites that are undisturbed and have adequate organic material to provide shelter. ==Historic and Current Distribution== There are historic records of Suckley's bumble bee in 11 western states as well as 11 Canadian provinces. In Canada, the species was historically spread across the southern portions of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan with a disjunct population in Newfoundland. Suckley's bumble bee recent observations have greatly diminished from historic abundance and range. Suckley's bumble bee has experienced an overall decline of 77%, losing more than 50% of its range and with relative abundance records at less than 10% of historic observations. ==Conservation== Suckley's bumble bee has been recognized as imperiled or needing protection by international and state entities. It has a NatureServe ranking of G1 or critically imperiled from 2018 and is considered critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has experienced rapid, significant, recent declines, averaging over 77% during the last few decades. Its declines are associated with those of its host species. Other possible reasons for its declines include pesticides, loss of habitat, competition from introduced species of bees, climate change, and the parasite Nosema bombi. Multiple threats produce synergistic impacts to this species which make it more vulnerable to decline and extinction. Suckley's bumble bee and other cuckoo bumble bees are especially at risk of extinction because of their dependence on the success of host species. Suckley's bumble bee is a species of ‘great conservation need’ in Washington, Idaho, Colorado, and California. Suckley's bumble bee was petitioned for federal Endangered Species Act protection in 2020. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1860 Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:NatureServe imperiled species ","title":"Bombus suckleyi"},{"id":"20224626","text":"Bombus tibetanus is a species of cuckoo bumblebee. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1887 ","title":"Bombus tibetanus"},{"id":"20224628","text":"Jacob Semer, better known by the anglicized name \\"Jake Seymour\\" on the baseball field, was an American professional baseball player, who played in with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, of the American Association. Born around 1854 to German immigrant parents, he lived in what was then known as Allegheny City, in the Deutschtown district, before the area was annexed by the City of Pittsburgh in 1907. As a teenager, he did not attend school and helped to provide for his family by selling novelty jokes and, later, as a laborer.

In the 1870s and 1880s, he was widely regarded as one of the area's strongest pitchers. It is reported that \\"he pitched for various local top-notched teams in the old days, but he did his best work for the Bon Tons.\\" On September 23, 1882, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, then belonging to the American Association, gave Seymour a trial in what was to be his only major league game. He lived blocks from the original Exposition Park and played its last game there, before it was torn down after only one season due to a fire and flooding from the nearby Allegheny River. He was brought in to pitch the final championship game against the Louisville Eclipse in the last day of the season, pitching eight innings and giving up seven earned runs, with the Louisvilles winning the game 13-3. However, Seymour was undeterred. The game against Louisville was played in the morning, and in the afternoon, he went to Sewickley to pitch a game for the local club there. Following his baseball years, he worked as a bartender and served on both the local police force and fire department (as a Horseman with Engine Co. 1). On August 1, 1897, he died at 43 years of age from Bright's Disease. The staff of the Pittsburgh Post ran an obituary praising his contributions to local baseball and stating that his death would be deeply regretted by all who knew him. They also called him \\"one of the best bartenders in Allegheny [City].\\" He left behind a wife, Mary (née Dooney), and three young daughters—Anna, Isla, and Catherine—who continued to use his baseball name \\"Seymour\\" as their own.Year: 1880; Census Place: Allegheny, Allegheny, Pennsylvania; Roll: 1086; Family History Film: 1255086; Page: 59D; Enumeration District: 003; Image: 0122 After his death, they supported themselves by running a small grocery store in Deutschtown.

Shimkus grew up in the High Works neighborhood of Scranton. He graduated from the University of Scranton in 1973 with a degree in English. He then went into broadcasting, despite the misgivings of his father (who thought broadcasters were carnies). After working as an announcer at WEJL in Scranton and WCAU in Philadelphia, he went into television. He served as an anchor and reporter at WNEP-TV in Scranton from 1980 to 1998, doubling for much of that time as news director. After a brief two-year hiatus, he moved to WYOU as anchor and assistant news director. During his broadcasting career, he was known on-air as \\"Frank Andrews.\\"Krawczeniuk, Borys. Frank Andrews Shimkus The Times-Tribune, 2006-05-07. While still at WNEP, Shimkus earned a master's degree in theology from Antietam Bible College in 1993 and a doctorate in biblical studies from the same institution two years later. He currently serves as the part-time pastor of Trinity Congregational United Church of Christ in Scranton. Shimkus resigned from WYOU in March 2006 to run for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, winning a 5-way Democratic primary to succeed the retiring Gaynor Cawley in a district that included almost 60 percent of Scranton. He went on to easily win the general election. His bid for a second term was derailed by disputes over his residency. He'd lived in South Abington Township, a suburb of Scranton, for many years. Midway through his term, he moved in with his fiancee in Throop on the advice of his doctors, who suggested he shouldn't live alone after suffering several concussions. He listed a house in Scranton owned by his daughter and son-in-law as his primary residence when he filed for the Democratic primary. Shimkus' primary opponent, former Scranton city councilman Kevin Murphy, and two others filed a petition to have Shimkus thrown off the ballot citing the residency issue. The Scranton and Throop houses are in the district. Nevertheless, a Commonwealth Court judge granted the petition on March 14, 2008; finding that Shimkus intentionally misrepresented his address.Brogadir, Josh. Representative Frank Shimkus Off April Ballot. WNEP- TV, 2008-03-14First-term rep kicked off primary ballot Since no Republican even filed in this heavily Democratic district, this appeared to hand the nomination—and the seat—to Murphy. In an unusual move, Shimkus then mounted a write-in bid for both the Democratic and Republican nominations. He lost the Democratic primary to Murphy by only 107 votes, but easily won the Republican primary. However, he stated that he intended to remain a Democrat. In the November election, Shimkus lost to Murphy by 1,300 votes. In early 2017 Throop Borough Council elected Shimkus to mayor when then mayor Wayne Williams stepped down to take a seat on council. On May 16, 2017, Shimkus was re- elected mayor of Throop by town residents on the democratic ticket. He won 400 to 307 over challenger Joe Tropiak.

Key figures who changed and influenced the course of Abercrombie & Fitch's history include co-founders David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Limited Brands and Michael Jeffries, the former Chairman and CEO. David Abercrombie founded A&F; in 1892 as an upscale sporting goods store. Forming a partnership with Ezra Fitch, the company continued to expand in the new 20th century. After Abercrombie left the company, Fitch became sole owner and ushered in the \\"Fitch Years\\" of continued success. Shortly after his retirement, the company continued to develop under a succession of other leaders until its financial fall and closing in 1977. Limited Brands purchased the ailing brand in 1988 and brought in Mike Jeffries, who revolutionized the image of Abercrombie & Fitch to become an upscale youthful fashion retailer. Today, the company is a multibillion-dollar entity continuing to experience economic expansion through the business continuance of three offshoot growing concepts and cautious international expansion into key luxury markets. Prominent figures who patronized the company in its excursion goods days of the early 20th century include Teddy Roosevelt, Amelia Earhart,Purdue University. Earhart suede jacket, 1932 Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, Clark Gable, John Steinbeck, John F. Kennedy, Ernest Shackleton, Cole Porter, and Dwight Eisenhower. ==Founding== The company was originally established as Abercrombie Co. by David Abercrombie on June 4, 1892, in a small waterfront shop at 36 South Street in downtown Manhattan, New York. Wealthy New York businessman Ezra Fitch became one of the store's regular customers. In 1900, Fitch bought a major share in the growing Abercrombie Company and thus joined as co-founder. Aberr 2010}} The partnership between Abercrombie and Fitch did not end happily. The two men, with different visions for the future of A&F;, quarreled frequently, although the company continued to prosper. Fitch wished to expand the company's appeal to the general public, while Abercrombie wanted to continue selling professional gear to professional outdoorsmen.The History of Abercrombie and Fitch As a result of the disagreement, Abercrombie sold his share in the company to Fitch in 1907 and returned to manufacturing outdoor goods. Fitch continued the business with other partners and directed the company as he pleased. ==The Fitch years== Cover of A&F; catalog from 1909. Inside the 1909 catalog. Inside the historical A&F; 1909 catalog. In 1909, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. mailed over 50,000 copies of its 456-page catalog worldwide (a staggering and costly amount of publication at that time, since each cost a dollar to produce). The catalog featured outdoor clothing, camping gear, articles, and advice columns. The cost of the catalog nearly bankrupted the company, but the catalog proved to be a profitable marketing device. Within the store, the catalog was available to customers for free. By 1910, the company began selling women's clothing, and became the first store in New York to supply clothing to women as well as men. In 1913, after moving into Reade Street, which was not a convenient shopping location for women, the store relocated to a more fashionable and easily accessible midtown address near Fifth Avenue at 55/57 West 36th Street, expanding its inventory to include sportswear. In 1917, the store moved again into a twelve-story building at the corner of Madison Avenue and East 45th Street. The store occupied the entire available space (12 stories). The Madison Avenue store included many different amenities. The basement housed a shooting range while on the mezzanine (main floor) paraphernalia for skiing, archery, free diving, and lawn games were sold. The second through fifth floors were reserved for clothing that was suitable for different climate or terrains. On the sixth floor were a picture gallery, a bookstore (focused on sporting themes), a watch repair facility and a golf school (fully equipped with a resident professional). The seventh floor included a gun room with hundreds of shotguns and rifles, decorated with stuffed game heads, as well as a kennel for dogs and cats . The eighth floor contained fishing, camping, and boating equipment and included a desk for a fly- and bait-casting instructor who gave lessons at the pool, which was located on the roof. The fishing section alone was stocked with over 48,000 flies and over 18,000 fishing lures. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. became the first American store to import Mahjong.Newspaper & Magazine Articles and Advertisements Ezra Fitch imported the game after a female customer looked for the game that she had played in China. He went to China for the game and translated the instructions into English. Mahjong became a fast selling product, and Abercrombie & Fitch became the epicenter of the Mahjong craze. The company sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy as many Mahjong sets as possible and eventually sold over 12,000 sets. In 1927, Abercrombie & Fitch outfitted Charles Lindbergh for his historic flight across the Atlantic Ocean. It also attracted the business of other prominent figures. ==Post-Fitch era== In 1928, Fitch retired from the company and sold to his brother-in-law, James S. Cobb. Under Cobb, A&F; acquired Von Lengerke & Detmold, a well-respected New York dealer of fine European-made sporting guns and fishing tackle, as well as that company's Chicago branch, Von Lengerke & Antoine. Cobb also acquired Griffin & Howe, another gunsmith company. Merchandise from both Von Lengerke & Detmold and Griffin & Howe was carried at A&F;'s Madison Avenue store. By this time, A&F; was also selling equipment for polo, golf, and tennis. By 1929, sales of US $6.3 million were reported with net profits of US $548,000. During the Great Depression, the company's revenue decreased and it stopped paying dividends. Sales plunged to $2,598,925 in 1933. A&F; recovered in the following years and resumed paying dividends in 1938. During that year, guns accounted for 40% of sales at the Madison Avenue store. Clothing, shoes, and furnishings accounted for 45%, while inventory was valued at about 40% of annual sales (reflecting A&F;'s readiness to meet customer demands). Ten percent of the business was attributed to mail orders from the catalog. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. continued to expand. As early as 1913, A&F; had adopted the slogan, \\"The Greatest Sporting Goods Store in the World\\". A&F;'s record net profit was $682,894 in 1947. The company opened a large branch in San Francisco in 1958. It soon added small winter-only shops open from November through May each season in Palm Beach and Sarasota, Florida and summer-only shops in Bay Head, New Jersey, and Southampton, New York. to complement a shop in Hyannis, Massachusetts it had operated since the end of World War II. Guernsey succeeded Cobb as president. He remarked, \\"The Abercrombie & Fitch type does not care about the cost; he wants the finest quality.\\" With so many locations now under the control of Abercrombie & Fitch, the Madison Avenue store remained the flagship store. In the 1950s, the main floor of the flagship was remodeled to include heads of buffalo, caribou, moose, elk, and other big game, stuffed fish of spectacular size, and elephant's-foot wastebaskets. In 1960, net sales rose to $16.5 million, but net profit fell for the fourth straight year to $185,649. By 1961, net sales dropped to $15.5 million, and net profit to $124,097. Guernsey's successor as president, John H. Ewing, paid little attention to the decline in sales. In 1961, he told an interviewer of Business Week that Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed a special niche \\"by sticking to our knitting; by not trying to be all things to all people.\\" A&F; would open a year-round resort shop at The Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs (1962) and its first suburban store at the Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey (1963). Under the leadership of Earle K. Angstadt, Jr., Abercrombie's continued to expand in upscale locations such as the Bal Harbour Shops near Miami Beach, Florida (1966), the Somerset Mall in Troy, Michigan, outside Detroit (1969) and in boutique-style shops in other department stores. In 1964, Abercrombie and Fitch achieved a notable early example of the \\"brand integration\\" form of product placement by providing the venue for part of the Rock Hudson / Paula Prentiss romantic comedy film Man's Favorite Sport?. Abercrombie and Fitch held a warehouse sale in 1968 and early 1970 and presented offbeat newspaper advertisements that reflected a measure of desperation. The company's revenue continued decline, with a loss of about $500,000 in its previous fiscal year. Noticing the effect that the ads and sale-days had upon the Abercrombie & Fitch customer base, the next president William Humphreys, a former Lord & Taylor executive, halted the measures. He focused on improving A&F;'s inventory control and credit practices and cutting the company's expenses.; changed the store design to present a different image, focused on expansion into the suburbs in 1972 with a location in Oak Brook, Illinois 1972 in hopes of recapturing customers who no longer patronized its store in downtown Chicago's Loop. Noticing that the offbeat advertisements were bringing in customers that management considered \\"not of classic Abercrombie & Fitch material,\\" A&F; ceased its mis-directing ads and sale-days in October 1970. Presentation within the flagship changed as well to provide a newer look. Expensive sailboats were moved from the main floor to an upper floor, a discount clothing section was introduced on the tenth floor, sportswear lines were expanded, and new buyers for woman's apparel were hired. However, the changes did not improve sales and the company continued to decline financially under Humphreys and his successor Hal Haskell, who was a major stockholder of the company. After losing $1 million in 1975, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1976 and finally closed its doors in November 1977. Oshman's, a sporting goods retailer, acquired Abercrombie & Fitch Co. in 1978 for $1.5 million\\"Why Abercrombie Is Losing Its Shirt\\". New York. Retrieved February 12, 2014.

Stores continued to open in South Street Seaport and Trump Tower and catered towards contemporary interests of golf, exercise, and tennis. Clothing collections for men and women carried business and casual dress, and sportswear. Forbes described the merchandise as \\"a hodgepodge of unrelated items\\" and that \\"sometimes it is better to bury the dead than to try reviving them.\\" Abercrombie & Fitch continued to struggle as Oshman's struggled itself to develop a strong identity for the company. ==Modern image== 1988 through 1999: rebranding into fashion retail In 1988, Limited Brands acquired the ailing company for $47 million after having success in popularizing Express and Victoria's Secret. Headquarters was moved to Columbus, Ohio, and all inventory was cleared out. The new president of Abercrombie & Fitch, Sally Frame-Kasaks, placed a strong emphasis on apparel. Michael S. Jeffries, a clothing executive, took over as president in 1992. He popularized the brand to a teen apparel merchandiser from an ailing sports brand. He believed that focusing the A&F; brand towards the American teen market would be financially beneficial as that sector of retail economy was said to be growing at a record rate at the time. The Chain store prototype (front) Side view The new Abercrombie & Fitch reopened shortly afterwards with a preppy outdoors theme reminiscent of the company's original roots. Jeffries desired to have Bruce Weber, known for his sexual beefcake photography, as the photographer for the brand, but could not do so until the company gained financial success. The apparel consisted of woven shirts, denim, miniskirts, cargo shorts, wool sweaters, polo shirts, and t-shirts. Its prices were unprecedentedly high in the teen apparel industry. Sales rose $85 million in 1992, $111 million in 1993, and to $165 million in 1994.Elliot, Stuart. \\"Abercrombie & Fitch Extends a Print Campaign to TV.\\" The New York Times, August 6, 1999 49 stores were opened by 1994, and a 102 store count was aimed by the end of 1995. In 1994, new records for merchandise margin rate and profitability were established by Abercrombie & Fitch for its parent, The Limited. To maintain popularity and to keep up with teen trends, Jeffries hired executives to keep up on popular teenage clothing, music, and entertainment. By the mid-1990s, there were dozens of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the United States.Givhan, Robin. \\"The Fetching Men of Abercrombie & Fitch Aren't the Only Appeal Of New Marketing Campaign.\\" The Washington Post, August 7, 1998. On September 26, 1996, The Limited, Inc. took Abercrombie & Fitch public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol \\"ANF\\" and with the per share offering as $16. In late 1990s, the company began to opt building stores only averaging between 8,000 and 20,000 square feet (700 to 2,000 m²) in high-volume retail centers around the country. It also launched the canoe store prototype of white facade and interior gray walls to accommodate the growth of its brand. In 1997, Abercrombie & Fitch launched A&F; Quarterly. The publication included photography, interviews and articles about sex, pop culture, and other teen interests. In 1998, the company introduced its first subsidiary, abercrombie. The concept was designed as the Abercrombie & Fitch for a younger clientele between the ages on 7-14. In 1999 began a 3-year-long class action lawsuit in which Abercrombie & Fitch was one of several American retailers involved for its sweatshops in Saipan. Revenue recorded for Abercrombie & Fitch at the end of fiscal 1998 was at $805.2 million USD. By 1998, Abercrombie & Fitch became an independent company, and Mike Jeffries assumed the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As the brand regained its prominence, industry analysts began to speculate how long Abercrombie and Fitch would be able to retain its popularity. Analysts predicted that A&F; would fall from popularity, but sales continued escalating after a provocative Christmas 1999 in which the A&F; Quarterly issue of the season featured sexually explicit content that drew angry complaints. In 1999, the A&F; also launched \\"A&F; TV\\", which featured young people engaged in sports and leisure activities. A&F; TV was originally developed to run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie & Fitch stores. It was soon removed. Revenue for fiscal 1999 was at $1.030 billion USD. The overall approach of Abercrombie & Fitch, by the end of the decade, to its customers seemed to please male shoppers more than females, who shopped more frequently at competitor shops. Throughout the 1990s, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. enjoyed sales of over $400/ft2 ($4300/m2). By December 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch operated a total of 212 stores nationwide. From 2000 on Entering into the 21st century, Abercrombie & Fitch was rated as the sixth most popular brand before Nintendo and Levi's by teenagers. The company introduced its third brand, Hollister Co., in July 2000. The third concept was based on Southern California surf lifestyle, and was targeted towards high school students. After Hollister lowered the revenue of Abercrombie & Fitch, the company launched the Ezra Fitch collection, and began producing A&F; clothing with higher grade materials, increasing the prices.

On 22 March 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch opened its first European flagship in London at 7 Burlington Gardens in Savile Row. The store generated a volume of $280,000 (around £140,000 GBP) in its first 6 hours of operation. The flagship remains one of the most profitable A&F; locations. Revenue reached record heights in 2007 with an overall sales of $3.749 billion. On 21 January 2008, Abercrombie & Fitch introduced its fifth concept, the intimate apparel brand Gilly Hicks. Inspired by \\"Down Under\\", it is officially labeled as the \\"Cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch.\\" In April 2008, A&F; relaunched A&F; Quarterly for release in the UK flagship. On August 31, 2008, the \\"bright and insightful\\" company director Allan A. Tuttle died. By December 22, corporate announced that it had produced a new employment agreement with Mike Jeffries set to expire in 2014. For the first time in its recent history, A&F; suffered a financial decrease to $3.540 billion revenue for fiscal 2008. The blame was to the current economic recession, and also to the fact that the company refused to lower price points and offer sales citing brand image- protection that doing so would \\"cheapen\\" its near-luxury image.

By the end of the month, 50 employees lost their jobs and many positions were still unoccupied. 170 more employees were dismissed in May. A&F; announced on 17 June 2009 the closure of its ailing Ruehl No.925 brand by January 2010.Abercrombie & Fitch to Close Ruehl Operations; Company Amends Credit Agreement By October, A&F; launched its official Facebook page. Despite financial downturns, A&F; opened its second European location, a flagship store, in Milan on October 29. On its official Facebook page, A&F; called it the biggest consumer reception for a flagship opening in A&F; history: \\"like nothing the world has seen before\\". On December 15, another flagship store opened in Tokyo, Japan. Marking the first ever A&F; location in Asia, the opening became the biggest retail event in history, was noted as a \\"spectacle of consumerism\\" by the Japanese, and made around JP¥50 million (US$550,000) that day alone. In January 2010, A&F; launched its A&F; Cares feature highlighting its philanthropic efforts. Keeping to its commitment, the company shut down ruehl.com on January 22, and closed doors to all final Ruehl stores by the end of the month. Analysts began noting encouraging signs of financial progress, in March, for the company, citing A&F;'s successful international expansion and better inventory management. Also around that time, a historical fishing line dryer, made by A&F; in the early 1900s, was sold to an A&F; model for $590 USD. As a marketing move, A&F; announced the relaunch of the A&F; Quarterly on 17 July 2010 as a part of its \\"Screen Test\\" Back-to-School marketing campaign designed to attract more consumer attention and sales. In August, CEO Mike Jeffries announced that Abercrombie & Fitch would close roughly 60 stores in 2010.http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company- news/10-big-retailers-closing-stores/19597754/ Later that month, CFO Jonathan Ramsden said another 50 stores could close in 2011. Profits began to pick up by September 2010 to larger than predicted results (attributed to the result of the major \\"Screen Test\\" campaign and numerous sales held throughout the season). By October, the company was stated as being well ahead its competitors (a first since the economic turndown). The brand opened a flagship in Copenhagen and Fukuoka in November 2010, and another one in Paris by May 2011. On February 15, 2012, A&F; announced plans to close 180 more underperforming U.S. stores by 2015 while continuing to expand in Europe and Asia. In 2013, the company's trendy, upscale image took a hit when comments made by Jeffries in 2006 that disparaged customers with body types that do not resemble Abercrombie & Fitch models resurfaced. The resulting backlash launched a viral internet campaign called \\"Fitch the Homeless\\", which aimed to subvert and mock the company's carefully manicured image of \\"exclusionary\\" style by distributing used Abercrombie & Fitch clothes to homeless and needy persons.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-story-behind-fitch- the-homeless ==References== Notes ==External links== * Category:Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie and Fitch ","title":"History of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch"},{"id":"20224734","text":"Jane Eyre is a 1934 American romantic drama film directed by Christy Cabanne, starring Virginia Bruce and Colin Clive.

At the same time, Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.Raines, John. 2002. \\"Introduction\\". Marx on Religion (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Page 5-6. In the Marxist–Leninist interpretation, all modern religions and churches are considered as \\"organs of bourgeois reaction\\" used for \\"the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class\\". A number of Marxist–Leninist governments in the 20th century such as the Soviet Union after Vladimir Lenin and the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong implemented rules introducing state atheism. == Marxist political theorists and revolutionaries on religion ==  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels on religion  Karl Marx's religious views have been the subject of much interpretation. In the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx famously stated: According to Howard Zinn, \\"[t]his helps us understand the mass appeal of the religious charlatans of the television screen, as well as the work of Liberation Theology in joining the soulfulness of religion to the energy of revolutionary movements in miserably poor countries\\". Some recent scholarship has suggested that \\"opium of the people\\" is itself a dialectical metaphor, a \\"protest\\" and an \\"expression\\" of suffering.McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading 'Opium of the People': Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15-38 \\"Opium as Dialectics of Religion: Metaphor, Expression and Protest\\".Roland Boer in International Socialism. Issue 123 \\"The full story: on Marxism and religion\\". Marx did not object to a spiritual life and thought it was necessary. In the \\"Wages of Labour\\" of the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, Marx wrote: \\"To develop in greater spiritual freedom, a people must break their bondage to their bodily needs—they must cease to be the slaves of the body. They must, above all, have time at their disposal for spiritual creative activity and spiritual enjoyment.\\"Shippen, Nichole Marie (2014). Decolonizing Time: Work, Leisure, and Freedom (illustrated ed.). New York: Springer. . There are those who view that the early Christian Church such as that one described in the Acts of the Apostles was an early form of communism and religious socialism. The view is that communism was just Christianity in practice and Jesus as the first communist. This link was highlighted in one of Marx's early writings which stated that \\"[a]s Christ is the intermediary unto whom man unburdens all his divinity, all his religious bonds, so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers all his Godlessness, all his human liberty\\". Furthermore, Thomas Müntzer led a large Anabaptist communist movement during the German Peasants' War which Friedrich Engels analysed in The Peasant War in Germany. The Marxist ethos that aims for unity reflects the Christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people. Tristram Hunt attributes a religious persuasion to Engels.  Vladimir Lenin on religion  In his book Religion, Vladimir Lenin was highly critical of religion, stating: > Atheism is a natural and inseparable part of Marxism, of the theory and > practice of scientific socialism. In The Attitude of the Workers’ Party to Religion, Lenin wrote: > Religion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone > of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and > churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always > considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the > protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class. Nonetheless, Lenin allowed Christians and other religious people in the Bolshevik Party. While critical of religion, Lenin also specifically made a point to not include it in Our Programme or his ideological goals, arguing: > But under no circumstances ought we to fall into the error of posing the > religious question in an abstract, idealistic fashion, as an \\"intellectual\\" > question unconnected with the class struggle, as is not infrequently done by > the radical-democrats from among the bourgeoisie. It would be stupid to > think that, in a society based on the endless oppression and coarsening of > the worker masses, religious prejudices could be dispelled by purely > propaganda methods. It would be bourgeois narrow-mindedness to forget that > the yoke of religion that weighs upon mankind is merely a product and > reflection of the economic yoke within society. No number of pamphlets and > no amount of preaching can enlighten the proletariat, if it is not > enlightened by its own struggle against the dark forces of capitalism. Unity > in this really revolutionary struggle of the oppressed class for the > creation of a paradise on earth is more important to us than unity of > proletarian opinion on paradise in heaven.  Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky on religion  In their influential book The ABC of Communism, Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky spoke out strongly against religion, writing that \\"Communism is incompatible with religious faith\\". However, importance was placed on secularism and non-violence towards the religious: > But the campaign against the backwardness of the masses in this matter of > religion, must be conducted with patience and considerateness, as well as > with energy and perseverance. The credulous crowd is extremely sensitive to > anything which hurts its feelings. To thrust atheism upon the masses, and in > conjunction therewith to interfere forcibly with religious practices and to > make mock of the objects of popular reverence, would not assist but would > hinder the campaign against religion. If the church were to be persecuted, > it would win sympathy among the masses, for persecution would remind them of > the almost forgotten days when there was an association between religion and > the defence of national freedom; it would strengthen the antisemitic > movement; and in general it would mobilize all the vestiges of an ideology > which is already beginning to die out.  Anatoly Lunacharsky on religion  God-Building was an idea proposed by some prominent early Marxists of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Inspired by Ludwig Feuerbach's \\"religion of humanity\\", it had some precedent in the French Revolution with the \\"cult of reason\\". The idea proposed that in place of the abolition of religion, there should be a meta-religious context in which religions were viewed primarily in terms of the psychological and social effect of ritual, myth and symbolism in an attempt to harness this force for pro-communist aims, both by creating new ritual and symbolism and by re-interpreting existing ritual and symbolism in a socialist context. In contrast to the atheism of Lenin, the God-Builders took an official position of agnosticism.Anatoly Lunacharsky (1908). Religion and Socialism. Moscow. p. 20. == In Marxist–Leninist states ==  Religion in the Soviet Union  The Soviet Union was an atheist stateSabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 4John Anderson, Religion, State and Politics in the Soviet Union and Successor States, Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 3 in which religion was largely discouraged and at times heavily persecuted.\\"Anti-religious Campaigns\\". According to various Soviet and Western sources, over one-third of the country's people still professed religious belief (Christianity and Islam had the most believers). Christians belonged to various churches: Orthodox, which had the largest number of followers; Catholic; and Baptist and other Protestant denominations. The majority of the Islamic faithful were Sunni (with a notable Shia minority, mainly in Azerbaijan), while Judaism also had many followers. Other religions, which were practiced by a relatively small number of believers, included Buddhism and Shamanism. After 1941 in the Stalin era, religious persecution was greatly reduced. To gather support from the masses during World War II, the Stalin government re-opened thousands of temples and extinguished the league of militant atheists. Atheist propaganda returned to a lesser extent during the Khrushchev government and continued in a less strict way during the Brezhnev years. The role of religion in the daily lives of Soviet citizens varied greatly, but two-thirds of the Soviet population were irreligious. About half the people, including members of the ruling Communist Party and high-level government officials, professed atheism. For the majority of Soviet citizens, religion seemed irrelevant. Prior to its collapse in late 1991, official figures on religion in the Soviet Union were not available. State atheism in the Soviet Union was known as gosateizm.Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences, David Kowalewski, Russian Review, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 426-441, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Editors and Board of Trustees of the Russian Review  Religion in the Socialist People's Republic of Albania  Albania was declared an atheist state by Enver Hoxha.Sang M. Lee writes that Albania was \\"[o]fficially an atheist state under Hoxha...\\" Restructuring Albanian Business Education Infrastructure August 2000 (Accessed 6 June 2007) Religion in Albania was subordinated in the interest of nationalism during periods of national revival, when it was identified as foreign predation to Albanian culture. During the late 19th century and also when Albania became a state, religions were suppressed in order to better unify Albanians. This nationalism was also used to justify the communist stance of state atheism between 1967 and 1991.Representations of Place: Albania, Derek R. Hall, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 165, No. 2, The Changing Meaning of Place in Post-Socialist Eastern Europe: Commodification, Perception and Environment (Jul., 1999), pp. 161-172, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) This policy was mainly applied and felt within the borders of the present Albanian state, producing a nonreligious majority in the population.  Religion in the People's Republic of China  The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 and for much of its early history maintained a hostile attitude toward religion which was seen as emblematic of feudalism and foreign colonialism. Houses of worship, including temples, mosques and churches, were converted into non-religious buildings for secular use. However, this attitude relaxed considerably in the late 1970s with the end of the Cultural Revolution. The 1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China guaranteed \\"freedom of religion\\" with a number of restrictions. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. However, the Communist Party of China still remains explicitly atheist and religion is heavily regulated, with only specific state-operated churches, mosques and temples being allowed for worship.  Religion in Cambodia   Democratic Kampuchea  Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge regime, suppressed Cambodia’s Buddhist religion as monks were defrocked; temples and artifacts, including statues of the Buddha, were destroyed; and people praying or expressing other religious sentiments were often killed. The Christian and Muslim communities were among the most persecuted as well. The Roman Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh was razed. The Khmer Rouge forced Muslims to eat pork, which they regard as an abomination. Many of those who refused were killed. Christian clergy and Muslim imams were executed.Cambodia - Society under the Angkar  People's Republic of Kampuchea  After the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, a socialist state more reflective of the values shared by Vietnam and allies of the Soviet Union was established. Oppression of religious groups was nearly totally ended and relations between religious groups and the People's Republic of Kampuchea were much more neutral throughout its existence until the restoration of the monarchy a decade later.  Religion in Laos  In contrast with the brutal repression of the sangha undertaken in Cambodia, the Communist government of Laos has not sought to oppose or suppress Buddhism in Laos to any great degree, rather since the early days of the Pathet Lao communist officials have sought to use the influence and respect afforded to Buddhist clergy to achieve political goals while discouraging religious practices seen as detrimental to Marxist aims. Starting as early as the late 1950s, members of the Pathet Lao sought to encourage support for the communist cause by aligning members of the Lao sangha with the communist opposition. Though resisted by the Royal Lao Government, these efforts were fairly successful and resulted in increased support for the Pathet Lao, particularly in rural communities. Religion in the Socialist Republic of Romania During its Socialist era, the Romanian government exerted significant control over the Orthodox Church and closely monitored religious activity, as well as promoting atheism among the population.Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu. The Romanian Orthodox Church and Post-Communist Democratisation. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 52, No. 8 (Dec., 2000), pp. 1467-1488 Dissident priests were censured, arrested, deported, and/or defrocked, but the Orthodox Church as a whole acquiesced to the government's demands and received support from it. Unlike other Eastern Bloc states where clergy were forced to rely on donations or subsistence wages, Orthodox clergy in Romania were paid a salary equivalent to the average received by the general population, and received significant state subsidies for the reconstruction of churches destroyed in the war.Lucian N. Leustean. Between Moscow and London: Romanian Orthodoxy and National Communism, 1960–1965. The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 85, No. 3 (Jul., 2007), pp. 491-521 Starting in the 1960s, the state used religious officials of the Orthodox Church as ambassadors to the West, engaging in dialogue with religious organizations in the United Kingdom.Lucian N. Leustean. Constructing Communism in the Romanian People's Republic. Orthodoxy and State, 1948–49. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 59, No. 2 (Mar., 2007), pp. 303-329 This relatively favorable attitude towards the church continued until the death of Patriarch Justinian of Romania in 1977, at which point the state began a new anti-church campaign, engaging in urban renewal projects that entailed the destruction of churches.Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu. Politics, National Symbols and the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 58, No. 7 (Nov., 2006), pp. 1119-1139 == Communism and Abrahamic religions ==  Communism and Christianity  In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote: \\"Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\\" In Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, Engels drew a certain analogy between the sort of utopian communalism of some of the early Christian communities and the modern-day communist movement, the scientific communist movement representing the proletariat in this era and its world historic transformation of society. Engels noted both certain similarities and certain contrasts.Engels, Friedrich (1970) [1880]. Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. Marx/Engels Selected Works. III. Moscow: Progress Publishers. pp. 95–151. Retrieved 1 October 2020 – via Marxists Internet Archive. Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of Christian socialism. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the Bible suggests that the first Christians, including the Apostles, created their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection. Advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the Apostles themselves. Contemporary communism, including contemporary Christian communism, owes much to Marxist thought—particularly Marxian economics. While not all communists are in full agreement with Marxism, communists share the Marxist critique of capitalism. Marxism includes a complex array of views that cover several different fields of human knowledge and one may easily distinguish between Marxist philosophy, Marxist sociology and Marxist economics. Marxist sociology and Marxist economics have no connection to religious issues and make no assertions about such things. On the other hand, Marxist philosophy is famously atheistic, although some Marxist scholars, both Christian and non-Christian, have insisted that Marxist philosophy and the philosophy of Marx and Engels are significantly different from one another and that this difference needs recognition. In particular, Jose Porfirio Miranda found Marx and Engels to be consistently opposed to deterministic materialism and broadly sympathetic towards Christianity and towards the text of the Bible, although disbelieving in a supernatural deity.Miranda, Jose Porfirio (1980). Marx Against the Marxists: The Christian Humanism of Karl Marx. London: SCM Press. .  Liberation theology  In the 1950s and the 1960s, liberation theology was the political praxis of Latin American theologians, such as Gustavo Gutiérrez of Peru, Leonardo Boff of Brazil, Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay and Jon Sobrino of Spain, who made popular the phrase the \\"Preferential option for the poor\\". While liberation theology was most influential in Latin America, it has also been developed in other parts of the world such as black theology in the United States and South Africa, Palestinian liberation theology, Dalit theology in India and Minjung theology in South Korea. Consisting of a synthesis of Christian theology and Marxist socioeconomic analyses, liberation theology stresses social concern for the poor and advocates for liberation for oppressed peoples. In addition to being a theological matter, liberation theology was often tied to concrete political practice.Liberation Theology Archived March 11, 2012, at the Wayback Machine., Canada & the World, February 10, 2010  Communism and Islam  From the 1940s through the 1960s, communists, socialists and Islamists sometimes joined forces in opposing colonialism and seeking national independence. The communist Tudeh Party of Iran was allied with the Islamists in their ultimately successful rebellion against the Shah Pahlavi in 1979, although after the Shah was overthrown the Islamists turned on their one-time allies. The People's Mujahedin of Iran, an exiled political party which opposes the Islamic Republic, once advocated communist ideals, but has since abandoned them. Communist philosopher Mir-Said (Mirza) Sultan-Galiev, Joseph Stalin's protégé at the People's Commissariat for Nationalities (Narkomnats), wrote in The Life of Nationalities, the Narkomnats' journal.  Communism and Judaism  During the Russian Civil War, Jews were seen as communist sympathizers and thousands were murdered in pogroms by the White Army. During the Red Scare in the United States in the 1950s, a representative of the American Jewish Committee assured the powerful House Committee on Un-American Activities that \\"Judaism and communism are utterly incompatible\\". On the other hand, some orthodox Jews, including a number of prominent religious figures, actively supported either anarchist or Marxist versions of communism. Examples include Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, an outspoken libertarian communist, Russian revolutionary and territorialist leader Isaac Steinberg and Rabbi Abraham Bik, an American communist activist.  Communism and the Baha'i Faith  Analysis reveals that the Bahá'í Faith as both a doctrinal manifest and as a present-day emerging organised community is highly cooperative in nature with elements that correspond to various threads of Marxist thought, anarchist thought and more recent liberational thought innovations. Such elements include, for example, no clergy and themes that relate to mutualism, libertarian socialism and democratic confederalism. There are many similarities and differences between the schools of thought, but one of the most common things they share are the time frame within which both ideologies were founded as well as some social and economic perspective. A book by the Association for Bahai Studies was written as a dialogue between the two schools of thought. == Communism and Buddhism == Buddhism has been said to be compatible with communism given that both can be interpreted as atheistic and arguably share some similarities regarding their views of the world of nature and the relationship between matter and mind. Regardless, Buddhists have still been persecuted in some Communist states,Mongolia. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. notably China, Mongolia and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. Many supporters of the Viet Cong were Buddhists, strongly believing in the unification of Vietnam, with many opposing South Vietnam due to former President Ngo Dinh Diem's persecution of Buddhism during the early 1960s. The current Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso speaks positively of Marxism despite the heavy persecution of the Tibetan people by the post-Mao Zedong and post-Cultural Revolution Chinese government. The Dalai Lama further stated that \\"[o]f all the modern economic theories, the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. [...] The failure of the regime in the former Soviet Union was, for me, not the failure of Marxism but the failure of totalitarianism. For this reason I still think of myself as half- Marxist, half-Buddhist\\". In India, B. R. Ambedkar wrote in his essay Buddha or Karl Marx that \\"[t]he Russians are proud of their Communism. But they forget that the wonder of all wonders is that the Buddha established Communism so far as the Sangh was concerned without dictatorship. It may be that it was a communism on a very small scale but it was communism without dictatorship a miracle which Lenin failed to do.\\"https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_03.pdf == Religious criticism of communism == Because of the perceived atheistic nature of communism, some have accused communism of persecuting religion.Communism Persecutes Religion.

Released off their fourth studio album, The Gap Band II, the song and its parent album both achieved commercial success. The single was released in several countries in different formats. In the United States, it was a 12\\" with the B-side being \\"Party Lights\\". In the Netherlands, the 12\\" B-side was \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\". In France, the single was a 7\\" with no B-side. In the UK the track first surfaced in mid-late 1979 as the B-side of the 12\\" release of \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" / \\"Steppin' (Out)\\" (Mercury Records MERX2). Then in 1980, due to its popularity, was flipped and re-titled with just \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" as the B-Side (Mercury Records 7\\" MER22 / 12\\" MERX22). It was later released once again as the B-side to some copies of the remix version of \\"Party Lights\\" (Mercury Records 12\\" MERX37). In 1987, a 12\\" remix was released in the UK with a Dub version B-side (UK Club records JABX54). The single became an international hit for the group upon its late 1979 release, though it failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at number-one on its Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart), the song hit the top ten on the US R&B; and disco charts and became a big-seller overseas where it peaked at number six in the UK in 1980 and number six in the Netherlands. ==Structure== *The song, which runs for nearly nine minutes in the full 12\\" single version, features a driving bass-line with a simple repeated E-G-A-B pattern. P-Funk influence  *The humorous monologues throughout the song by Gap Band lead singer Charlie Wilson were inspired by his cousin Bootsy Collins' own humorous slant in his songs. *Wilson's spoken intro, \\"this is radio station W-GAP\\", was a reference to Parliament's opening line in \\"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)\\", \\"welcome to radio station W-E-F-U-N-K, better known as WE-FUNK.\\"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) lyrics at LetsSingIt.com *The line, \\"the bigger the headache the bigger the pill, the bigger the doctor the bigger the bill\\" was said to be influenced by similar lines from Parliament- Funkadelic in the mid-'70s including the line \\"the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill\\" in \\"Dr. Funkenstein\\". The Jack & Jill line would later be continued on their next anthem, \\"Humpin'\\". *The horn break is a direct lift from the intro to \\"Disco to Go\\" by The Brides of Funkenstein. *The band made little use of the synthesizer prior to this song, and the use of the synthesizer expanded with each passing album. By 1982, most of the band's hits were synthesizer-laden electrofunk. **The Gap Band III featured \\"Humpin'\\" and \\"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\\" which use even more synthesizer than this song. **By Gap Band IV, almost all the songs which were not quiet storm-style ballads were heavily laden with synthesizer. The use of synthesizers led to two songs, \\"Early in the Morning\\" and \\"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\\" topping the R&B; charts in 1982. Nursery rhyme allusions *\\"Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun/stupid Jill forgot her pill and now they've got a son.\\" **Their 1980 song, \\"Humpin'\\", also references Jack & Jill. *\\"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall/Humpty Dumpty had a great fall... I say he cracked on the whack!\\" Little Miss Muffet is also mentioned. ==Legacy== The song is said to be one of the first songs to use hip-hop-styled monologues in a song. The song's success broke ground for the group, who would go on to become a successful R&B; outfit throughout the 1980s. It remains a popular song in the Gap Band's repertoire to this day. In the UK, this song is typically \\"danced\\" to by sitting on the floor in rows and performing a rhythmic \\"rowing\\" action. The origin of this unusual dance is credited to DJ Nigel Tolley , while others credit English broadcaster Alex Dyke. (The same rowing on the floor is also done to Rock the Boat by The Hues Corporation.) It was especially popular during the 1980s. Sampling The song was sampled several times, especially in the 1990s G-funk era: * \\"Ooops Up\\" by Snap! (1990) * \\"Mo' P****\\" by DJ Quik (1992) * \\"Didn't Mean to Turn You On\\" by 2nd II None (1994) * \\"Strap on the Side\\" by Spice 1 (1994) * \\"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\\" by Snoop Dogg feat.

The school building that exists today was constructed in 1927, and is still operated by the Memphis City Schools as the Northwest Preparatory Academy, serving children who are unable to function in a regular school environment. ==History== The Board of Education authorized the new Memphis Vocational High School in July 1911, and opened it September 1911, in the recently vacated Memphis High School building at 317 Poplar. The school was opened at the same time as the new Central High School, with the intention \\"to take the load off the new Central High, so that additional schools would not have to be built for some time\\".1 Memphis Vocational High School was the first vocational high school in the US, opening with 72 students in grades 7 to 10, before classes began to grow. In 1917, J. L. Highsaw, a classroom teacher at the school, became principal. In 1918 the school name was changed to Crockett Vocational High School, with four teachers and 232 students. In 1921 the name was changed again to Crockett Technical High School. Soon a new building was required, and it was decided that the nearby palatial Van Vleet mansion on Poplar Avenue would be demolished in favour of a modern school building. The school board paid $90,000 for the property on which the home was located, and spent $500,000 to build the new school, built by the architectural firm of Hanker, Cairns, and Wallace. Until the new building opened, overflow classes were taught in the Jefferson Annex, the old Fowlkes School on Jefferson. In 1928 the new building at 1266 Poplar was completed and the school changed its name for a final time to Memphis Technical High School. At the main entrance were four Corinthian columns, supporting a portico on the front. Some elements from the previous Van Vleet mansion were retained, including two stone lions at the east gate (since moved to the entrance of Memphis Zoo and then to a central location within the zoo), a stone bench from the mansion's green house, and two large classic urns at the top of the entrance steps. The four columns and portico of the school's entrance themselves reflect the entrance to the Van Vleet mansion. In 1936, Tech had 47 teachers and over 1400 students. Highsaw retired in 1957 and W. A. Bourne became principal, until 1975. The school continued to grow until the \\"decline of the cities\\" in the 1970s. With the changing demographics of the inner-city, it finally closed in 1987. ==Notable alumni== Tech High School's front gate *James Autry - 1951.

He served as the general manager and head coach of the New Orleans Hornets. Bower held the Hornets head coaching position during most of the 2009–10 season, and the general manager position twice, in 2002–03 and from 2005 to 2010. ==New Orleans Hornets== General manager Bower helped rebuild the Hornets, despite the troubles Hurricane Katrina placed on the club and the city of New Orleans in general. He took a giant step in re-writing Hornets history by trading franchise piece Baron Davis to the Warriors, then selecting guard Chris Paul fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft. The disaster Katrina caused forced the Hornets to move to Oklahoma City until the 2007–08 NBA season, but Bower continued to build his club. Through trade, draft, and signings, the Hornets actually competed in their two seasons in Oklahoma with a 38–44 record in 2005–06 and 39–43 in 2006–07. Yet again, another series of trials and tribulations, the Hornets improved and contended. Injuries to Paul (for 18 games), Peja Stojaković (for sixty-nine), and scoring big man David West (for thirty) dampened the opportunity to make the playoffs. For 2007–08, the Hornets came back home to open arms. They broke out, with the dangerous roster of Tyson Chandler (whom Bower traded for in 2006 for J. R. Smith), Paul, Stojakovic, West, and new acquisition Morris Peterson (from Toronto), with pieces like 3-point specialists Rasual Butler and Jannero Pargo (the former acquired in a 2005 trade, the latter left prior to the 2008–09 NBA season) and rebounders Melvin Ely and Ryan Bowen; and developing youth such as Julian Wright and Hilton Armstrong (both draft picks of the Hornets). The general of it all was Coach of the Year Byron Scott prior to the 2004–05 NBA season, and the Hornets won 56 games, their first divisional title, and were labeled \\"contender\\" by many analysts. Bower's performance in spearheading the Hornets from lottery team to contender gave him 12 votes from the sportswriters for the Sporting News NBA Executive of the Year, behind Lakers' GM Mitch Kupchak and winner, Boston Celtics' Danny Ainge. Bower helped draft David West, J. R. Smith, Chris Paul, Darren Collison and Marcus Thornton. Bower had been with the organization for 14 years, beginning in 1995–96, director of scouting, director of player personnel, as a scout, GM (in 2002–03), and assistant to former coaches Paul Silas and Tim Floyd. Bowers served as an advance scout for the Charlotte Hornets in 1995–97 and the Hornets Director of Scouting in 1997–2009. He also was an associate head coach at Marist College from 1990–95, prior to that, being an assistant coach at both Marist and Penn State University. Head coach On November 12, 2009, Bower was made the head coach of the team after the firing of Byron Scott. He led the team to a 34–39 record despite injury problems in the team. At the end of the season, he stepped down from the coaching duty and returned to his position as a general manager. He was replaced by Monty Williams. Bower and the Hornets parted ways on July 13, 2010.http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5377770 ==Marist== On April 10, 2013 it was announced that he will take over as coach of the Marist College men's basketball team. Bower served as an assistant coach for the Red Foxes from 1986 to 1990 and served as the Associate Head Coach from 1990 to 1995. He was involved in the team's 1987 NCAA Tournament appearance and ECAC Metro Conference regular-season championships in 1987 and 1988. Bower also aided in the development of Rik Smits, the second overall pick in the 1988 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers.http://www.goredfoxes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=27700&ATCLID;=207362875 ==Detroit Pistons== On June 3, 2014, Bower was named the general manager of the Detroit Pistons. On June 13, 2016, the Pistons signed Bower to a contract extension. Under Bower, the Pistons reached the playoffs in his second season as the general manager. However, on June 1, 2018, Bower was fired from his position as general manager of the team. ==Phoenix Suns== On April 11, 2019, Bower was named a senior vice president of basketball operations for the Phoenix Suns Under this new title, Bower helps relay certain information towards general manager James Jones when necessary. ==Personal life== Bower and his wife, Lisa and have a daughter, Lindsey, born in January 2003.

Manufactured by Vekoma, The Flying Cobras was the first roller coaster addition to Carowinds following the park's purchase by Cedar Fair in 2006. It originally operated at Geauga Lake from 1996 to 2007 until its relocation to Carowinds in 2008. Following the 2016 season, the roller coaster was refurbished and renamed again in 2017. ==History== The Flying Cobras, originally named The Mind Eraser, opened at Geauga Lake in 1996. It was renamed to Head Spin when Cedar Fair purchased Six Flags Worlds of Adventure from Six Flags in 2004. On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom would no longer operate as an amusement park, and instead become solely a waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom. The ride was moved to Carowinds, where it was renamed to Carolina Cobra. The ride occupies the spot of the Flying Super Saturator roller coaster, which was dismantled and put up for sale after the 2008 season. This was the first roller coaster for Carowinds since the addition of Nighthawk in 2004. On August 18, 2016, Carowinds announced the expansion of County Fair for the 2017 season, which included refurbishing the Carolina Cobra. It was renamed The Flying Cobras to pay tribute to the classic air shows that were once seen at the Carolina County Fair, and also received a new paint scheme with blue track and white supports. ==Ride experience== The Flying Cobras is one of over 50 boomerang coasters installed by Vekoma around the world, but it is the first roller coaster to feature all new re-designed MK-1212 trains directly from Vekoma.http://carolinacobra.carowinds.com/public/ride/index.cfm#trains After dispatch, the train is pulled backwards up the lift hill. After that, riders are dropped down, fly back through the station and into a Cobra Roll element. The riders then are taken through a 360-degree vertical loop and are sent up a second hill. The riders pause, and are sent down to do the full circuit again backwards. ==Incidents== On October 18, 2009, Carolina Cobra's second lift hill failed to catch, resulting in a rollback that couldn't make it back through the second set of inversions The passengers were able to exit the ride onto a nearby platform.

It is located in North Cascades National Park on the headwaters of Blum Creek, a tributary of the Baker River. Fed by two small retreating glaciers and several snowfields on the southern side of Mount Blum, the waterfall is formed by the largest meltwater stream that feeds the mainstem of Blum Creek. The falls tumble down a high glacial headwall several miles within the national park in two distinct stages; the first is a series of slides over rounded rock, above the tree line, and the second is a series of near-vertical plunges to the forested valley below. Although most of the falls is clearly visible, parts of it are obscured by tall pines that grow at its base. There is no trail leading to the waterfall. ==Etymology== The falls takes its name from the creek, which in turn receives its name from Mount Blum, which was named for John Blum, a United States Forest Service fire patrol pilot killed in an early 20th-century plane crash. ==Statistics== The series of cascades totals in height, although this distance has never been officially measured. The falls occur over a run of Blum Creek, although again, this distance is only approximated. During peak flow, when high temperatures accelerate melting of ice and snow in the upper basin, the creek may be able to flow over per second, with an average width of . Contrarily, during low winter temperatures, the ice and snow ceases to melt, and the falls diminish in volume or may stop flowing completely. ==History and access== In 1920, the first reported sighting of the falls was by Pacific Northwest photographer Asahel Curtis, who also photographed the falls. However, as that date was before Mount Blum was named, the waterfall was also unknown and unnamed, and remains obscure to this day. Today, the Baker River Trail leads upstream several miles along the Baker River, and as it crosses Blum Creek, one may obtain a view of the upper portion of the falls. The falls is also visible from a portion of the Shuksan Lakes Trail, which climbs Mount Shuksan on the opposite side of the Baker River valley. From this trail better views are obtained. However, as the falls are not the best in the area, and as more well-known Sulphide Creek Falls is close, the falls are little-known by most visitors to the area. ==See also== *Sulphide Creek Falls ==References== Category:Waterfalls of Washington (state) Category:North Cascades of Washington (state) Category:Waterfalls of Whatcom County, Washington Category:North Cascades National Park Category:Cascade waterfalls Category:Segmented waterfalls ","title":"Blum Basin Falls"},{"id":"20225006","text":"Thomas F.

Corbet Lough is a particular place of interest for anglers while the highest point of the parish, locally known as 'the Knock' offers panoramic views of the Mourne Mountains towards the south and Slieve Croob towards the north east. ==History== The marsh in the Ardbrin area of Annaclone is of particular historical interest and several Celtic artefacts were found in it, including a horn known as the 'Ardbrin Horn' which now resides in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin. Historically the area belonged to the Magennis clan, whose castle, no longer standing, was situated in nearby Rathfriland. Indeed, the aforementioned Celtic artefacts found in the parish cement its link with the ancient clan. ==People== *Patrick Brontë, father of Charlotte Brontë and Emily Brontë, was born in the parish in 1777 and also taught in a school in the parish. As a result, the area of southern Annaclone is known as 'The Brontë Homeland'. Although Patrick Brontë's house is now in ruins, the nearby Brontë Interpretative Centre maintains the link between the family and the area. *Catherine O'Hare, the first European woman to cross the Canadian Rockies (with her husband Mr. Schubert, and two small children, enroute to the Fraser Valley gold rush), was born around 1835 in the townland of Ballybrick in Annaclone. ==Sport== *The parish has a strong GAA club, Annaclone GAC (Gaelic Athletic Club). Founded in 1897 it is the second oldest club of its kind in the county after Leitrim Fontenoys. *Annaclone also plays host to a stage of the Circuit of Ireland Rally as well as many cycling events throughout the year. ==Civil parish of Annaclone== The civil parish of Annaclone includes the village of Annaclone.

There is some evidence to suggest he was signed by Hull City in the 1930/31 season but did not make a senior appearance for the club, before transferring to Bristol Rovers in the 1931/32 season. After one season at Bristol Rovers Calvert moved to Leicester City and became dedicated servant of the club, including during the Second World War. In January 1948 Calvert requested a transfer and was sold to Watford where he played only a handful of games.Frickley Athletic Museum ==Records== He is one of the oldest players ever to play for either Leicester or Watford in the Football League; he transferred from Leicester to Watford a few weeks before his 41st birthday. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1999 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:English Football League players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Hull City A.F.C. players Category:Frickley Athletic F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:People from Beighton, Sheffield ","title":"Joe Calvert"},{"id":"20225044","text":"Qendër is a former municipality in the Shkodër County, northwestern Albania.

It was issued after Rogers left the label and signed to RCA Records. ==Overview== Duets opens with \\"We've Got Tonight\\", a hit 1983 single with Sheena Easton. Side two begins with another classic duet, \\"Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer\\" with Kim Carnes from the 1980 album Gideon. All of the remaining eight songs on the album are with Dottie West and come from his two collaboration albums with West, including the 1978 hit \\"Every Time Two Fools Collide\\" from the 1978 album of the same name. However, their duet \\"What Are We Doin' in Love\\" (a No. 1 country and top 40 pop hit) from 1981 is missing. Also included on this album is Sonny and Cher's \\"All I Ever Need Is You\\". Rogers' producer Larry Butler co-wrote \\"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\\" with Chips Moman. \\"'Til I Can Make It On My Own\\" and \\"That's the Way It Could Have Been\\" are two Tammy Wynette numbers. While this is a compilation album, there was still a single released from it. \\"Together Again\\", one of the many duets with West and which first appeared on Classics, reached No. 19 on the US country chart and No. 29 in Canada. The album was eventually certified platinum and gold in the US and Canada, respectively. It reached No. 43 on the US country charts and No. 85 on the pop charts in 1984.

Winfrey first endorsed Obama in September 2006 before he had even declared himself a candidate. In May 2007 Winfrey made her official endorsement of candidate Obama, and in December 2007, she made her first campaign appearances for him. Two economists estimate that Winfrey's endorsement was worth over a million votes in the Democratic primary race and that without it, Obama would have received fewer votes.The Role of Celebrity Endorsements in Politics: Oprah, Obama, and the 2008 Democratic Primary. Then-Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich claimed that the endorsement was so significant in electing Obama president that he considered offering Obama's former seat in the Senate to Winfrey. ==Winfrey's endorsement influence== Winfrey was at times called \\"arguably the world's most powerful woman\\" by CNN and Time.com, \\"arguably the most influential woman in the world\\" by The American Spectator, \\"one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century\\" and \\"one of the most influential people\\" of 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 by Time. Winfrey is the only person in the world to have made all nine lists. At the end of the 20th century Life listed Winfrey as both the most influential woman and the most influential black person of her generation, and in a cover story profile the magazine called her \\"America's most powerful woman\\". Ladies Home Journal also ranked Winfrey number one in their list of the most powerful women in America and then senator Barack Obama has said she \\"may be the most influential woman in the country\\". In 1998 Winfrey became the first woman and first African American to top Entertainment Weekly's list of the 101 most powerful people in the entertainment industry. In 2003 Winfrey edged out both Superman and Elvis Presley to be named the greatest pop culture icon of all time by VH1. Forbes named her the world's most powerful celebrity in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Columnist Maureen Dowd seems to agree with such assessments: Vanity Fair wrote: Bill O'Reilly said: Biographer Kitty Kelley states that she has always been \\"fascinated\\" by Winfrey: The power of Winfrey's endorsement has been most consistently measured by the spike in sales that products receive when she endorses them on her show, most notably, books selected for Oprah's Book Club. Business Week stated: The power of Winfrey's endorsement is also credited with making Dr. Phil, who got his start appearing on Winfrey's show, into a household name, hit talk show host, and the author of multiple best-sellers. ==Endorsing Barack Obama== On September 25, 2006, Winfrey appeared on Larry King Live and was asked about a fan who started a campaign to get Winfrey to run for president. Larry King noted that Winfrey's lawyers had apparently warned the man to stop the campaign. Winfrey chided the lawyers and advised the fan to \\"take all your energy, and put it in Barack Obama\\". Winfrey explained that Obama was her favorite senator and she hoped he would run for president. Then, on October 19, 2006, Winfrey interviewed Obama and his wife Michelle on her show and reiterated the endorsement that she had previously made on Larry King, while promoting his book The Audacity of Hope. Winfrey explained that she would be on the air for several more years, so if he ever decided to run, she would hope he would announce it on her show. Obama's appearance on Oprah caused his book to reach the No. 1 spot on both Amazon.com's and the New York Times bestseller list. Immediately following Winfrey's two endorsements, Time magazine put Obama on their October 23, 2006 cover with the caption \\"Why Barack Obama could be the next president.\\" Obama eventually decided to announce his candidacy, not on The Oprah Winfrey Show, but at the steps of the Illinois state legislature. With Obama officially becoming a candidate for president in 2008, Winfrey decided not to interview him or any other candidate during the campaign because as a vocal Obama supporter, she noted that she may be unable to be objective. In May 2007, Winfrey once again appeared on Larry King Live and was asked if her endorsement of Obama still applied. She replied \\"of course\\" and explained that what Obama stood for was worth her going out on a limb for. When King asked Winfrey if there was a woman side of her that would lean towards Obama's opponent, then front-runner Hillary Clinton, Winfrey explained that she had great respect for Senator Clinton, and that her endorsement of Obama did not imply that she was against anyone else. After endorsing Obama, however, Oprah's ratings fell 7%. In June 2008, when Obama secured the Democratic nomination, Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight: In late August 2008, Winfrey attended the Democratic convention and reacted emotionally to Obama's speech, telling reporters \\"I've never experienced anything like that. I cried my eyelashes off.\\" Elaborating further, Winfrey explained \\"I woke up this morning and I went to Google and I googled the entire Martin Luther King speech because like most Americans I, you know, you listen to the 'I Have a Dream' part. In the earlier part of the speech, he talks about the promise of democracy. And I think that today that promise was fulfilled in a way that I never imagined in my lifetime.\\" Winfrey also told reporters: ==Fundraising== In the fall of 2007 Winfrey held a fundraiser for Obama at her California home and raised several million dollars. In October 2008 Winfrey hosted a second fundraiser for Obama, this time in Chicago. ==Campaign appearances== In the fall of 2007, Obama was considered a long shot, an absolute outsider in the race for the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States and was still considered unlikely to win the Iowa caucus, and polls showed him losing the black vote to Clinton. In late November 2007, the Obama campaign announced that Winfrey would be campaigning for Obama for a series of rallies in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Even before Winfrey appeared thousands of Iowans flocked to Obama's campaign offices, and 1,385 signed up as volunteers to score tickets to see Winfrey's Iowa appearance. The Columbia, South Carolina event on December 9, 2007 drew a crowd of nearly 30,000, the largest for any political event of 2007. Newsweek's Howard Fineman reviewed Winfrey's speech in South Carolina: ==Impact== More than one million votes Grant Park Using a novel methodology, Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore, economists at the University of Maryland, College Park concluded that Winfrey's endorsement of Obama not only netted him 1,015,559 votes in the Democratic primary alone (with a 95% confidence interval of 423,123 to 1,596,995) but decided the election. The researchers were not able to apply their methodology to all states however, so their estimate does not include any additional Oprah effect that may have emerged in Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, Kansas, or Alaska. \\"It does appear to have been a decisive, if not a deciding, factor,\\" explained Garthwaite. Garthwaite and Moore matched sales of Winfrey's \\"O\\" magazine and the spike in sales of her book club picks to Obama's votes in the Democratic primary. After controlling for a large range of confounding factors such as the fact that both Obama and Winfrey are popular with African Americans, Garthwaite and Moore showed that votes for Obama spiked in precisely the same geographic areas where Winfrey is the most popular. By applying the same methodology to Obama's 2004 Senate race, when he did not have Winfrey's endorsement, they found no relationship between Obama votes and Winfrey popularity in Illinois; the relationship only emerged after the endorsement, suggesting that Winfrey's endorsement had caused the spike in Obama's vote total in those counties. Garthwaite and Moore also showed that the connection is not because people who read women's magazines preferred Obama to Clinton. Just the opposite, Obama got less support where women's magazines such as Self and People are popular. After controlling for racial demographics, the economists also found no relationship between the popularity of Ebony magazine, whose readership is largely African American, and support for Obama. In addition to getting Obama over a million votes, the researchers found that Winfrey's support boosted campaign contributions to him in those counties where she is most popular. They found that Winfrey's biggest effect was in caucus states like Iowa. During the Democratic primary, there was controversy over which states should be counted in the popular vote total and not all states released official vote counts, but it's estimated that at most, Obama won the popular vote by 151,844 votes without counting Michigan's disputed votes. Clinton, however, won the popular vote by 176,645 votes when Michigan's numbers were included. Increased viability Another study suggests that Winfrey's endorsement may have also had indirect benefits for Obama. Researchers Andrew Pease and Paul R. Brewer of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee conducted an experiment in which some subjects were exposed to news of Winfrey's endorsement and others weren't. They found that those who had such exposure were more likely to vote for Obama, if only because they thought her endorsement made Obama more electable; for such voters Winfrey's endorsement was important for strategic reasons. The researchers concluded that when evaluating the impact of celebrity endorsements, one must also consider \\"subtler effects, such as those on viability assessments.\\" Polls A CBS poll found that a third of all Americans claimed that most people they know would be more inclined to vote for Obama because of Winfrey's endorsement. A study by the Pew Research Center found that Winfrey's campaign appearances had dramatically increased Obama's visibility, especially among African-Americans. One reason Winfrey's endorsement was useful in helping Obama compete with Senator Clinton was because as of December 2007 (when Winfrey first began campaigning) Winfrey was the one woman in the world more admired than Hillary Clinton among American women. Political commentary \\"There's no doubt that Oprah could tip a close presidential election if she strongly backed one candidate,\\" predicted psychologist James Houran.Newsmax, May 2007, pg 62 In the May 2007 issue of Newsmax, political analyst Dick Morris predicted Winfrey's endorsement would have an important impact: When asked by Larry King if there was a \\"woman side\\" of Oprah that \\"would lean towards a Hillary\\" Winfrey replied: Later Dick Morris would see significance in the fact that Winfrey campaigned for Obama in December, and Iowa voted right after Christmas: \\"Because Oprah has such a reputation as a tastemaker, I think her early endorsement forced people to take Obama's candidacy seriously,\\" explained Dr. Mark Anthony Neal, author, pop culture critic and Duke University professor. \\"It made Obama more than a 'Black' candidate. Also, given Oprah's championing of women's issues, her decision not to support Hillary (Clinton) struck a chord for early undecideds... Obama's people understood that much of the Black electorate in the South was made up of women, and Oprah's campaigning with the Obamas, particularly in South Carolina, helped give the campaign some momentum\\" In April 2008, The New York Times editorial board wrote: And Thomas Schaller noted: ==Senate seat consideration== The then governor of Illinois reported being so impressed by Winfrey's influence on the election of Barack Obama that he considered offering Winfrey Obama's vacant senate seat. Governor Blagojevich summarized his reasons for considering Winfrey on various talk shows: Winfrey responded to the disclosure with amusement, noting that although she was absolutely not interested, she did feel she could be a senator. Political analyst Chris Matthews praised the idea of making Winfrey a senator suggesting that in one move it would diversify the senate and raise its collective IQ. Elaborating further he said: Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times agreed with Matthews, claiming Winfrey would be \\"terrific\\" and an \\"enormously popular pick.\\" == Winfrey's potential presidential run == Winfrey has been urged by many media figures to run in the 2020 presidential election, recalling her endorsement for Obama. Obama's successor, President Donald Trump, commented on her decision by stating, \\"She says she'll run only if she gets the go ahead from the Almighty,\\" he said. \\"All right Oprah, go ahead and run.\\" ==References== Category:Oprah Winfrey Category:2008 United States presidential election endorsements Category:Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign Category:September 2006 events in the United States Category:May 2007 events in the United States Category:2006 in American television Category:2007 in American television ","title":"Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama"},{"id":"20225179","text":" USS Wasaka III (SP-342) was an armed motorboat that served in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1919.

Andal Goddess Lakshmi had been reincarnated on earth as the daughter of a devotee. She was named Kothai. As she grew up, she learnt about Krishna and loved him. Once, she wore the Lord's garland. Just as she was admiring herself - her father caught her and slapped her. After much crying, she promised never to wear the Lord's garland again. The devotee did service to Lord Vishnu and put the garland on him. To his surprise, it fell off. The devotee learnt that Lord Vishnu only liked garlands that had been worn by Kothai. Kothai comes in with the previous garland and then they garland Lord Vishnu. The story ends with Kothai merging with Lord Vishnu. The Thief There is a king, who makes one of his men a king of a city. He then gives his daughter in marriage to the new king. The new king is engrossed in war. His wife makes him change his views and he begins building a temple.

In September 1547, Luttrell accompanied Somerset's army into Scotland, and led the vanguard of 300 men at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, where the Scots were resoundingly defeated.Phillips, p. 197 In the aftermath of Pinkie, Luttrell was appointed captain of the English base at the island Abbey of Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth, from whence he harassed Scottish shipping with little success.Phillips, p. 207 His uncle Thomas Wyndham visited in December with two warships.Phillips, p. 212: CSP Scotland, vol. 1 on 28 December 1547 he raided Burntisland and burnt ships and buildings at the pier, and Rossend Castle surrendered to him.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 58. Eventually Inchcolm was abandoned, and Luttrell was sent north in March 1548 to captain Broughty Castle which dominated the Tay and Dundee. One of Luttrell's brothers was killed in Dundee in November 1548.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 167. He was trusted as a diplomatist no less than as a soldier, and, in March 1549, he was appointed one of the two English commissioners to treat with the Earls of Argyll, Athol and Errol and others, with a view to the expulsion of the French (who were allied with the Scots against the English) from Scotland, and a marriage between Edward and Mary. The negotiation, however, came to nothing.H. C. Maxwell-Lyte, A History of Dunster and of the Families of Mohun and Luttrell, 1909, quoted at Some of Luttrell's correspondence at this time was captured by the French, and still survives, but perhaps the most remarkable survival is his 'letter of defiance' written to James Doig of Dunrobin besieging him at Broughty Castle in November 1548.Cameron, Annie I.,Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine 1543-1560, SHS (1927), prints the captured letters and the letter of defiance The tide was already turning in Scotland's favour, and at midnight on 12 February 1550 Luttrell and the garrison at Broughty surrendered to a joint French and Scottish force.Tabitha Barber in Hearn, pp. 65-66 Luttrell was held for ransom as a prisoner of James Doig of Dunrobin. On the day the peace of the Treaty of Boulogne was declared in England, 29 March 1550, Thomas Wyndham was sent to Scotland with two post horses and five Scottish hostages to exchange for Luttrell.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (1890), 421. On 16 May 1550 Archbishop Hamilton organised the payment of his ransom of £1000 for the exchange of the sons of George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Master of Semple. George Douglas's son would later rule Scotland as Regent Morton.Cameron, Annie I, The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), 322, footnote citing NAS ADCS, 26, 128: Hannay, Robert Kerr, ed., Acts of the Lords of Council in Public Affairs (Edinburgh, 1932), p. 601. Luttrell was immediately arrested for a debt to a Dundee merchant. Regent Arran paid this £19-11s in September 1550.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (1911), 443. Back in England, he was rewarded with a gift of land in July 1550 by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who had seized control of the Council from Somerset in 1549.Phillips, p. 254 Sir John Luttrell died in an epidemic of the sweating sickness on 10 July 1551, while preparing for an expedition to Morocco with his uncle, Thomas Wyndham.

John remained a prisoner in Scotland after the treaty until his debts and ransom were paid in September 1550.Cameron, Annie I., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), p.322 fn.

Berri (born September 26, 1969) is a sports economist and professor of economics at Southern Utah University, known for his sometimes- controversial analysis of NBA basketball. He is a past president of the North American Association of Sports Economists, and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Sports Economics and The International Journal of Sport Finance. ==Academic Background== Berri graduated from Nebraska Wesleyan University with a B.A. in economics in 1991, and earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. from Colorado State University. He taught economics at Coe College and California State University-Bakersfield before accepting a position at Southern Utah University in 2008. ==The Wages of Wins== Berri is best known for co-authoring, along with Martin Schmidt and Stacey Brook, the 2006 book The Wages of Wins: Taking Measure of the Many Myths in Modern Sport. The book opened to favorable reviews in several major media outlets, including endorsements from Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker and Joe Nocera in The New York Times. In The Wages of Wins, Berri, Schmidt, & Brook look at the 4 major North American sports from an academic, econometric point of view, investigating issues like the relationship between payrolls and wins, quarterback play in the NFL, and competitive balance in baseball. The portion of the book that has drawn the most attention—positive and negative—has been Berri's analysis of the NBA, particularly with regard to player performance. By running a series of linear regressions, Berri has developed a model called \\"Wins Produced\\", which \\"explains 95% of team wins\\". The Wins Produced model is a refinement of an earlier model put forth in a 1999 paper published in the journal \\"Managerial and Decision Economics. Berri's work is frequently viewed as a lightning rod for criticism because the Wins Produced model often runs counter to the conventional wisdom of basketball. Berri has not discouraged such controversy, either, in his posts for The Wages of Wins' accompanying blog, \\"The Wages of Wins Journal\\", which frequently criticizes NBA decision- makers (i.e., coaches and general managers) and members of the media. ==Criticism== Berri has come out in opposition of certain traditional linear weights-style NBA evaluatory statistics like TENDEX and the NBA's official \\"efficiency\\" metric, claiming that they overvalue scoring and undervalue shooting efficiency. A similar criticism has been made of John Hollinger's Player Efficiency Rating, a model that Berri also argues significantly undervalues shooting efficiency. He has also criticized non-box score-based stats like Adjusted Plus-Minus, claiming that the basic box score numbers tell decision-makers most of what they need to know about a player's value. In December 2011, Berri released an updated version that adjusted the defensive rebound weight to account for diminishing returns. Berri has provided data on women's basketball for the journal The Ladies League as well as several other media outlets. ==Stumbling on Wins== Stumbling on Wins: Two Economists Expose the Pitfalls on the Road to Victory in Professional Sports is Berri and Schmidt's follow up on The Wages of Wins and was published in March 2010 by FT Press.Stumbling on Wins, FT Press 2010. == References  External links == * The Wages of Wins Journal * The Wages of Wins Official Site Category:Living people Category:American statisticians Category:American sportswriters Category:Southern Utah University faculty Category:Nebraska Wesleyan University alumni Category:Colorado State University alumni Category:California State University, Bakersfield faculty Category:21st- century American economists Category:1969 births ","title":"David Berri"},{"id":"20225568","text":"Liu Hun (柳渾) (715 – February 23, 789http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=5&ycanzi;=&mm;=1ⅆ=&dcanzi;=%A4B%A5fOld Book of Tang, vol. 13 .), né Liu Zai (柳載), courtesy name Yikuang (夷曠), alternative name Weishen (惟深), formally Count Zhen of Yicheng (宜城貞伯),That Liu Hun was a count is per his biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 125 and New Book of Tang, vol. 155 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 13. was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong. == Background == Liu Zai was born in 715, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Xiang Prefecture (襄州, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) but claimed as their ancestral lands the Hedong region (河東, roughly modern Shanxi) and claimed the Jin Dynasty (265-420) official Liu Chun (柳純) as an ancestor. Their traceable ancestry included officials of Jin Dynasty, Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Liu Shangsu (柳尚素) and father Liu Qingxiu (柳慶休) both served as county-level officials.New Book of Tang, vol. 73 Liu Zai's father Liu Qingxiu died early. He was studious, but was poor as a result of his father's early death. He passed the imperial examinations early in Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756) and was made the sheriff of Danfu County (單父, in modern Heze, Shandong).Old Book of Tang, vol. 125. == During Emperor Suzong's reign == During the Zhide era (756-758) of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, Liu Zai served as a secretary for Huangfu Shen (皇甫侁) the surveyor of Jiangxi Circuit (江西, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi).As Huangfu was removed from his position in 757, Liu's service under Huangfu must before that time. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 219. He was then recalled to serve as Jiancha Yushi (監察御史), an imperial censor. As the imperial censors were required to be careful and formal in their behavior, and Liu was free in his spirit, Liu became unhappy and sought another position. The chancellors had regard for his talents, however, and so had him made Zuo Bujue (左補闕), a low-level official at the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). He was later given the responsibility of monitoring the tax revenues from Jiangxi Circuit. == During Emperor Daizong's reign == Early in the Dali era (767-779) of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Wei Shaoyou (魏少遊), the governor of Jiangxi Circuit, requested that Liu Zai serve as his secretary. While he was serving under Wei, there was an occasion when the abbot of a Buddhist temple dedicated to Emperor Xuanzong was drinking at night with his disciples, and in their drunkenness, the temple suffered a fire. They blamed it on the deaf servant guarding the door, however, and bribed the military officer Wei put in charge of the investigation to submit a report indicating such. Wei believed the report and was set to punish the servant, and while many people knew of the servant's innocence, no one dared to speak. Liu and his colleague Cui Youfu, however, stepped in and reported this to Wei. Wei was surprised, and after he interrogated the abbot further, the abbot confessed. Wei thanked them and stated, \\"Except for you two gentleman, this old man would have committed a wrong.\\" Later, after Lu Sigong (路嗣恭) succeeded Wei, Lu made Liu the deputy commander of the circuit militia (團練副使, Tuanlian Fushi). In 778, Liu was made the prefect of Yuan Prefecture (袁州, in modern Yichun, Jiangxi). == During Emperor Dezong's reign == In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Cui Youfu became chancellor, and he recommended Liu Zai to be the examiner of Zhejiang Circuit (浙江東西道, headquartered in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu). He was later recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as Shangshu Zuo Cheng (尚書左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). In 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then at Chang'an to await deployment, mutinied, and Emperor Dezong was forced to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Liu followed him to Fengtian. Meanwhile, the Jingyuan soldiers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu soon declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin. To create suspicion within Emperor Dezong's followers, he issued an edict naming Liu and Cui Ning chancellors. Emperor Dezong, believing Cui to be complicit in Zhu's rebellion, executed Cui, but took no actions against Liu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. Later, when Emperor Dezong was forced to further flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), Liu followed him, and was made Zuo Sanqi Changshi (左散騎常侍), a senior advisor at the examination bureau. After Zhu's state was destroyed in 784 and Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an, Liu, stating that his name had been tainted because it had been in an edict of Zhu's, and also that the character of Zai (載) contained a radical, ge (戈), that signified the use of force while the state was to be pacified, requested permission to change his name to Hun, and permission was granted. In 786, Liu was made the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang) and was created the Count of Yicheng. In 787, under the recommendation of the powerful chancellor Han Huang, Liu was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto as well, and he was also given authority over the examination bureau. Believing Han to be overly harsh, although he was recommended by Han, he sternly rebuked Han for battering a low-level official to death, and thereafter, Han moderated his behavior somewhat. Meanwhile, he opposed Emperor Dezong's consideration of a former close associate, Bai Zhizhen (白志貞), for promotion, believing that Bai was a flatterer unfit for promotion. Emperor Dezong nevertheless promoted Bai while Liu was away ill. When Liu recovered, he offered his resignation, but Emperor Dezong turned it down.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Later in the year, Emperor Dezong, despite the opposition of the major general Li Sheng, entered into a peace treaty with Tufan's chancellor Shang Jiezan (尚結贊). On the day that another major general, Hun Jian, as Emperor Dezong's emissary, was set to formally sign the treaty with Shang at Pingliangchuan (平涼川), Emperor Dezong remarked to the officials at Chang'an that it was a fortunate time for the state. Liu stated that he believed that he was worried because he found the Tufan to be untrustworthy, and Li agreed; Emperor Dezong, angry at their continued opposition to the treaty, rebuked them both. That night, however, reports from the general Han Yougui (韓遊瓌) arrived that Tufan forces had ambushed Hun and nearly captured him. Emperor Dezong, amazed that Liu had predicted this, had an imperial messenger deliver the report to Liu. The next day, he stated to Liu, \\"You are but a scholar. It is amazing how you were able to predict this so accurately.\\" Meanwhile, because Liu was willing to speak, his relationship with fellow chancellor Zhang Yanshang, whom Emperor Dezong trusted, became poor. On one occasion, Zhang sent an associate to state to Liu, \\"You, lord chancellor, are greatly honored for your virtues. If you are more careful with your words in the imperial halls, you can stay chancellor for a long time.\\" Liu responded:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. However, Liu was soon offending Emperor Dezong, as Emperor Dezong liked people who spoke elegantly and implicitly. However, Liu was straightforward and often used colloquialisms. He wanted to demote Liu to be the secretary general for an imperial prince, but at the urging of fellow chancellor Li Mi, only demoted him to be Zuo Sanqin Changshi again. It was said that Liu was humorous, and in his association with others he was not as arrogant as high level officials usually were. Several days after his removal as chancellor, he was touring with his old friends and did not appear at all upset over his removal. At that time, former chancellors Li Mian and Lu Han commented, \\"When we see Lord Liu of Yicheng, we, in comparison, feel like overly constricted men.\\" Liu died in 789. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 125. * New Book of Tang, vol. 155. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 228, 232, 233.

It innervates most of the flexor muscles in the forearm and hand. Its sensory component supplies the skin of the palm, thumb, index and middle finger as well as half the ring finger, and the bones of the wrist. In the proximal forearm it gives rise to the anterior interosseous nerve which innervates the flexor of the thumb (FPL), the flexor digitorum profundus of the index finger (FDP IF), and the pronator quadratus, and terminates in a sensory branch to the bones of the wrist, i.e., the carpal tunnel. Compression of the proximal median nerve results in weakness of these three muscles, and can cause aching pain in the wrist on the basis of the sensory nerve to the carpal bones. == Diagnosis== The characteristic physical finding is tenderness over the proximal median nerve, which is aggravated by resisted pronation of the forearm.Hartz, C R, R L Linscheid, R R Gramse, and J R Daube. \\"The pronator teres syndrome: compressive neuropathy of the median nerve.\\" The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Sund also served as GM for the Dallas Mavericks from 1979-92; Detroit Pistons from 1998-2000; Seattle SuperSonics from 2001-07 and Atlanta Hawks from 2008-12. ==Early managerial career== Sund began his managerial career in 1974 with the Milwaukee Bucks after graduating from Ohio University with a degree in sports administration. Sund holds a bachelor's degree in political science from Northwestern University where he was a two-sport athlete, twice named academic All-Big Ten on the basketball squad, while also seeing action as a tight end and wide receiver on the football team. At Northwestern, he joined Delta Upsilon fraternity.HAWKS: Rick Sund Bio The expansion Dallas Mavericks hired him in 1979 at 28 years of age, making him the youngest general manager in the NBA's history. He helped assemble the first ever Mavericks roster, and for the remainder of his multiple-year tenure around the organization, brought in Brad Davis, Rolando Blackman, Mark Aguirre and others. His 1986-87 Mavericks won a then-franchise record 55 games and took home the Midwest division crown.Mavericks history They reached the Western Conference Finals the next year, but fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games. He aided the then-rookie general manager of the former Seattle SuperSonics, Wally Walker in 1994. He moved on to the Detroit Pistons in 1995-96, a roller coaster five seasons at the helm of a talented team holding a young Grant Hill. They made the playoffs four of six seasons Sund ran the front office. One of the most notable trades during his tenure was the 1997 deal of Otis Thorpe to the Vancouver Grizzlies for a protected future 1st round pick. This pick eventually became unprotected in 2003 and netted the 2nd pick in the draft, by which new GM Joe Dumars selected Darko Milicic, widely considered the biggest bust in NBA history. Sund then left for the Seattle SuperSonics, running the team for six seasons. During his tenure, Sund traded for Ray Allen (using franchise figure Gary Payton), drafted talented young players such as Nick Collison, and built his Sonics around Allen and fellow sharpshooter Rashard Lewis. In spite of this, the SuperSonics only made the playoffs twice during Sund's six seasons as general manager. ==Managerial career with the Atlanta Hawks== After his firing, Sund was hired by the Hawks, who had fired Billy Knight. Prior to the 2008–2009 season's start, sixth man Josh Childress left for Europe after not receiving an offer higher than his restricted free agent qualifying offer. Sund acquired Maurice Evans and Ronald \\"Flip\\" Murray to fill Childress' vacancy. While Evans was overpaid (three years at $2.5 million per year),https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/e/evansma01.html Murray did serve as a great sixth man in his one season with the Hawks, averaging 12.2 PPG on .447 FG% from 2008–2009, while being paid $1.5 million.https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/m/murraro01.html The Hawks clinched the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference during the 2008-09 season, edged the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs in seven games after falling behind 2–1, and then were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round.http://espn.go.com/nba/recap/_/id/290511001/cleveland-cavaliers-vs- atlanta-hawks Over the summer 2009, Sund's Hawks made some more moves. They drafted Jeff Teague and Sergei Gladyr. , Gladyr still has not played an official game with the Hawks. He also re-signed free agents Mike Bibby (three years, roughly $6 million per yearhttps://www.basketball- reference.com/players/b/bibbymi01.html), Zaza Pachulia, and Marvin Williams (five years at about $7.5 million per yearhttps://www.basketball- reference.com/players/w/willima02.htmlhttp://hoopshype.com/salaries/atlanta.htm). Then, Sund acquired Jamal Crawford via trade for Speedy Claxton and Acie Law, and Crawford went on to become the NBA Sixth Man of the Year, averaging 18.0 PPG on .449 FG% in the 2009–2010 season.https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/c/crawfja01.html He also signed free agents Joe Smith and Jason Collins, neither of whom made significant contributions in the 2009–2010 season. The Hawks won 53 games that season, clinched the third seed behind the Orlando Magic, and edged the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games after falling behind 3–2. In the second round, the Magic swept the Hawks in the most lopsided playoff series in NBA history. Joe Johnson made a comment following one of the losses that he didn't care if Hawks fans showed up.http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-hawks/johnson-on-unhappy-fans-522943.html Over the summer of 2010, Sund signed Joe Johnson to a six-year, $119 million contract.https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Joe-Johnson-to- sign-a-ridiculous-deal-with-the-A?urn=nba,252877 That summer he also did not re-sign Mike Woodson as head coach, but instead of hiring a coach and changing the Hawks mediocre culture, he promoted Woodson's head assistant Larry Drew (three years, about $1.25 million per yearhttp://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta- hawks/larry-drew-to-return-1440504.html). However, he also extended Al Horford for five seasons at $12 million per season, and drafted Jordan Crawford. Instead of using the Hawks' 31st overall pick, Sund sold it for cash. Sund also re-signed Jason Collins. During the 2010–2011 season, the Hawks continued to start Bibby over Teague, played Jordan Craword very little, and won 44 games despite few injuries. Just before the trade deadline, Sund traded the prospect Jordan Crawford, the Hawks' future first-round pick in the 2011 draft, and dumped Bibby and Evans's salaries all to the Washington Wizards for Kirk Hinrich and Hilton Armstronghttp://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=6152388 in return. The Hawks however did upset the Orlando magic in six games as the #5 seed in the 2011 playoffs, and played competitive for a while against the top-seeded Bulls in the second round (winning game 1 and almost game 2, only to lose game 3 badly, win a close game 4, and lose 5 and 6 badly). Jason Collins proved to be useful against Dwight Howard on defense, but not against the Bulls. In the summer of 2011, the Hawks only draft pick, in the second round, was used on Keith Benson, who didn't make the team during the December training camp. Jamal Crawford was not re-signed to avoid going into the luxury tax. However, Sund also re-signed Collins, and added Tracy McGrady, Willie Green, Jannero Pargo, Vladimir Radmanović, Jerry Stackhouse, and Eric Dampier, all at veterans minimums. Signing that many veteran minimum contracts pushed the Hawks into the luxury tax, although McGrady, Green, and Pargo had productive seasons. Childress also came back from Greece, and was signed-and-traded to Phoenix for a trade exception (not used) and a second-round draft pick (sold for cash to pay the luxury tax).http://blogs.ajc.com/hawks/2012/03/15/atlanta- hawks-hawks-trade-second-round-draft-pick-for-cash/ The Hawks also signed 27-year-old rookie Ivan Johnson, who had a productive season, even finishing as rookie of the month in April.http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/ivan-johnson- named-eastern-conference-rookie-month The Hawks won 40 games in the lockout- shortened season despite Horford missing most of the season, and clinched home court and the #5 seed against the #4 division winner Boston Celtics. The Hawks lost in six games.

It also involves two devices that Gilbert would re-use: baby-switching and a calendar oddity. Produced soon after Gilbert first met Arthur Sullivan, but before the two had collaborated, Gilbert's first full-length comic opera, The Gentleman in Black, was based on the theatrically popular theory of metempsychosis. Gilbert and Frederic Clay had collaborated previously on a one-act opera, Ages Ago.Frederic Clay, entry in Grove Dictionary of Music, 3d edition, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 17 June 2015 The music was not published and is now lost. The piece was never revived in Gilbert's lifetime, although modern performances have been given, some adapting Sullivan music. The libretto is included in Original Plays by W. S. Gilbert in Four Series, in the fourth volume in the series (1911) published by Chatto and Windus of London. ==Background== From the mid-1860s through the early 1870s, W. S. Gilbert was extremely productive, writing a large quantity of comic verse, theatre reviews and other journalistic pieces, short stories, and dozens of plays and comic operas. His output in 1870 alone included dozens of his popular comic Bab Ballads; two blank verse comedies, The Princess and The Palace of Truth; two comic operas, Our Island Home and The Gentleman in Black; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.Gilbert's Plays – Annotated chronological listing , The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 16 June 2015Crowther, Andrew. \\"Gilbert's Non-Dramatic Works\\" , W. S. Gilbert Society, accessed 3 January 2011 Gilbert's dramatic writing during this time was evolving from his early musical burlesques.Crowther, Andrew. \\"The Life of W. S. Gilbert\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, March 1997, accessed 17 June 2015 Some of his work during this period exhibited a more restrained style, exemplified by a series of successful \\"fairy comedies\\", such as The Palace of Truth (1870).\\"Court Theatre\\" in The Times, 19 April 1871, p. 8, col. 2. At the same time, he was developing his unique style of absurdist humour, described as \\"Topsy-Turvy\\", made up of \\"a combination of wit, irony, topsyturvydom, parody, observation, theatrical technique, and profound intelligence\\". The opera The Gentleman in Black, one of Gilbert's most absurdist pieces, dates from the middle of this period, when Gilbert was trying different styles and working towards the mature comic style of his later work, including the famous series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas.Crowther, p. 67.Stedman, chapter 8 The story of The Gentleman in Black contains early glimpses of some of the \\"Topsy Turvy\\" ideas that Gilbert would later use in his more famous works written with Arthur Sullivan, including the switching of infants who grow up to be different ages (as in H.M.S. Pinafore) and plot devices that depend on technical errors involving the calendar (as in The Pirates of Penzance).Ainger, p. 83Gänzl, Kurt. \\"William Schwenk Gilbert\\", Operetta Research Center, Amsterdam, 1 January 2001 The music was in an \\"Offenbachian\\" vein, and the story is a \\"dramatic variation of the pseudo-German supernatural tale, such as Dickens's 'The Baron of Grogswig'\\", \\"The Metapsychosis\\" or Gilbert's own \\"The Triumph of Vice\\".Stedman, p. 79 ==Synopsis== The opera is set in 1584 with Act I in the Market Place of a German Village and Act II at the Gates of Castle Schlachenschloss. ;Act I Bertha Pompopplesdorf, who considers herself the prettiest girl in the village, is engaged to Hans Gopp, a handsome, kindly, but simple villager (Gopp was originally played by a woman). Hans is jealous of the rich, but ugly, old and unpleasant Baron Otto von Schlachenstein, who is strangely attractive to women. The Baron woos Bertha. Bertha pretends to be in love with the Baron to teach Hans a lesson. Depressed by this, Hans wishes that he could swap places with the Baron. At the same time, the Baron, realising that Bertha is just using him, envies Hans and wants to swap places with him. The Gentleman in Black (the King of the Gnomes) has the power to transfer souls. He offers to make the two men's wishes come true by exchanging their souls and bodies for one month. The date is 13 August 1584, and so the souls will revert to their original bodies on 13 September. He utters this spell: :Otto's body, grim and droll, :Shrine young Hans's simple soul; :Otto's soul, of moral shoddy, :Occupy young Hans's body! ;Act II After the souls are transferred, Hans notices that Bertha is attracted to his former body, which now contains the Baron's soul. Hans is now rich, but he is old and ugly, with a large family. To the Baron, the attention of Bertha and the advantages of a younger body are not sufficient compensation for the life of poverty that he now must live. He devises a cunning plan. He tells Hans that, as babies, they were both nursed by Hans's mother, and that the peasant baby was jealous of the young Baron. > \\"One night – the babes were three weeks old, and were wonderfully alike – > the peasant's babe crept from his clothes basket, quietly removed the > sleeping Baron from his sumptuous cradle, placed the Baron's son in the > clothes basket, and creeping into the Baron's cradle, covered himself up and > went to sleep. The cheat was never discovered! The peasant's son was brought > up as the young Baron – the young Baron as the peasants son.\\" Hans: \\"But I > think you must be mistaken, for you are twenty years older than I am.\\" > Baron: \\"I am now – but when I was three weeks old, of course I was the same > age as you were when you were three weeks old. ... You see I am naturally > quicker than you are – besides, I'm ashamed to say I've lived a very fast > life\\".Original Plays by W. S. Gilbert in Four Series, by Chatto and Windus: > London, Fourth Series (1911) Hans signs a contract agreeing to these facts and stipulating that they should resume their original social positions immediately. So Hans becomes a peasant in the old Baron's body but assumes that he will be a youthful Baron beginning on 13 September. However, this is all a trick so that the Baron can immediately regain his baronial station. By 13 September, he says, \\"I shall destroy the paper, and prove by the fact that I am twenty years older than he is, it's utterly impossible we could have been changed at birth – I shall return to my rank, and he will be punished as an impostor.\\" But an announcement is made before the Baron puts his plan into action: > \\"Proclamation! Whereas certain irregularities have crept into the calendar > in the course of the last 1584 years, and whereas these irregularities > (although in themselves unimportant), constitute in the aggregate a > considerable space of time, be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, that > from this date forward, thirteen days be omitted from the calendar, whereby > this third day of September under the Old Style becomes the thirteenth day > of September under the New Style!\\" The result of this imperfectly calculated proclamation is that the Baron and Hans find themselves immediately in their original bodies. Hans and Bertha begin a life of youthful nobility, and the Baron is left an ugly, old peasant. ==Original cast== * The Baron Otto von Schlachenstein – Edward Danvers * Grumpff, his steward – William M.

Germany–Italy relations are the international relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Italian Republic. ==History== Italia und Germania, painted by Johann Friedrich Overbeck before Italian and German Unification. Relations were established after the Unification of Italy. The two countries historically enjoy a special relationship since they fought together against the Austrian Empire and parts of their respective territories belonged to the Holy Roman Empire and the German Confederation. Italy and Germany were both part of the Triple Alliance but they became enemies during World War I. Both countries eventually became members of the Axis powers during World War II, formed an alliance during the Cold War (West Germany), were among the inner six and became two of the G6 nations after their economic miracle. Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti was not in favour of the German reunification but today the Italian government and the German one are full and leading members of the European Union. In 2005, a German cardinal was elected Bishop of Rome. Germany has an embassy in Rome and consulates in Milan and Naples, while Italy has an embassy in Berlin and consulates in Frankfurt, Freiburg, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Saarbrücken, and Stuttgart. German community in Italy Italy - Germany Relations (1939) Before the eruption of World War II the Italian government, lead by Benito Mussolini, established The Pact of Steel between Adolf Hitler's Germany government in efforts to establish a unified military entity to combat the Allied Powers. Although both sides established a governmental agreement, Italy and Germany remained fearful and distrusted towards one another. This distrust between the two governments would often contradict their military actions of uninosnese to being ones aimed against one another. In 1940 the original bipolar pact between Germany and Italy would be adding an existing member with Japan becoming the Tripartite Pact.  Italian Social Republic  In 1943 members of the Italian Grand Council voted against Benito Mussolini's political power and demanded his resignation. The decline in support from Mussolini's government was viewed as being rooted in the betrayal of his closest advisers and aides. During this time Victor Emmanuel stripped the Prime Ministerial powers of Mussolini and demanded his arrest. While arrested Mussolini was forced to the island of Ponza and placed as a political prisoner. Soon after Mussolini was sent to the Mt. Gran Sasso where German soldiers made a daring attempt in rescuing him and bringing him to Adolf Hitler. During this time Hitler sought to regain Mussolini's political support back into Italy's government. Just after a short time of Mussolini's demise those that allied against and caused his fall from power were trialed and executed. In efforts to regain a hold on the Italian government Hitler sought to establish the Italian Social Republic, a puppet republic in the town of Salo, in which he encouraged Mussolini to rally political support in efforts to fight against allied forces. Being a reinstalled leader Mussolini who was once a sovereign leaders was now seen as a puppet that was in the hands of the German government.  Italian - German Trade (2017)  During 2017 Italy's economy was valued as being the seventh largest exporting country in the world, while being ranked tenth among all imports around the world. In 2017 Italy's top importing and exporting partner was Germany at $72.2 billion in imports, while exporting $58.5 billion. At 7.1%, the largest product that Italy imports are cars, while its leading exports are Packaged Medicament's (Medicines) at 4.5%. These being Italy's largest imports, 33% are imported from Germany and 12% are from Spain. Whereas Italy's leading exports in Medicines are to Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland at a combined 32%, exports to Germany alone are at 9.6%. ==Country comparison== {  - ! ! Germany !

He played for Derry in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and was on the Derry side that finished runners-up to Dublin in the 1958 All-Ireland Championship – winning an Ulster Championship with the county that year, and three more in 1970, 1975 and 1976. For his performances in the 1967 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, O'Connell won a Cú Chulainn Award (the awards which ran between 1963 and 1967 were the forerunner to the modern day All Star Awards). O'Connell played his club football for Ballerin Sarsfields. He was instrumental in helping Ballerin reach the 1976–77 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship final, where they were defeated by Austin Stacks of Kerry. He also won two Derry Championships and an Ulster Senior Club Football Championship with the club. He is regarded as a Derry legend, and an all-time great of the game. He was in particular known for scoring exploits – he is ninth in the all-time list of top Ulster scorers in Championship football with a tally of 11–118 (11 goals and 118 points—each goal equals 3 points; 11 × 3 + 118 = 151 points, see GAA scoring rules). In the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association (1984), O'Connell was named in the Football Team of the Century comprising players who never won an All-Ireland. Former Derry County Board chairman Gerard O'Kane said of O'Connell \\"everyone growing up when Sean O'Connell was playing wanted to be Sean O'Connell\\". ==Background and early life== Sean O'Connell was born in Garvagh in the 1930s; his father Pat was a farmer and a talented soccer player. His mother Brigid (née McKenna), originally from Slaughtneil, was a school teacher. He had four brothers and four sisters. His elder brother Seamus was a priest and played with Derry in the 1950s. His other brothers Paddy and Gerard played at Under 21 level for Derry, while Cahir was a decent club player in the 1960s and early 1970s. His cousin Seamus O'Connell played soccer for the likes of Chelsea F.C. in England where he helped the club win their first ever League title in 1954–55. Sean boarded at St Columb's College in Derry. O'Connell tried his hand at boxing in his youth and was a member of Garvagh Boxing Club. He worked as a teacher and was principal of St Patrick's College in Dungiven for many years. He lived in Limavady for many years and he and his wife Margaret had four children. He died in July 2003 and is buried in Limavady. ==Playing career== Playing style One of O'Connell main attributes was his amazing and consistent scoring tallies. He frequently scored double-figures in games for both Ballerin and Derry, and was top scorer in both the 1974 and 1975 All-Ireland Championships. He was particularly known for being able to evade his marker by his incredible use of the sidestep dummy. He was also an extremely reliable free-taker. His tally of 11 Championship goals is one of the highest ever in Ulster football history. Inter-county O'Connell along with some of his Ballerin club-mates represented Derry at Minor level, – breaking into the Minor in 1955 and made his Senior debut two years later. In 1958 he played for Derry against Galway in the Wembley Tournament (a tournament played in Wembley Stadium, London, England, for Irish people in the city to watch). He scored the first ever Gaelic football point scored in the stadium, but Derry lost out to Galway. That year O'Connell as was part of Derry's first ever Ulster Senior Football Championship winning team, beating Down in the final by four points (1–11 to 2–04). On 24 August, Derry caused one of the biggest shocks in the history of Gaelic football when the first-time Ulster Champions beat Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final 2-06 to 2–05 – O'Connell's \\"brilliant solo goal\\" proving decisive. They met Dublin in the All-Ireland final but Derry were defeated. It has been claimed a series of poor refereeing decisions in that game cost Derry greatly, but Derry captain Jim McKeever said in a 2002 interview that it should also be noted that \\"It was an exceptionally good Dublin team\\". The 1950s was a decade of very high standards of football and was a very difficult era to win an All-Ireland, with the likes of Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Louth, Cavan, Meath and Dublin having very strong teams at the time. Unfortunately for Derry, they never quite managed to keep that team together, and only O'Connell from that starting 15 would ever win another Ulster title and play in another All-Ireland semi-final. They did however reach the National League final in both 1958/59 and 1960/61, but they lost out to Kerry on both occasions, partly due to O'Connell being suspended for both deciders – he was suspended because he played soccer, which was against GAA rules at the time (Rule 27). O'Connell won a Cú Chulainn Award (forerunner to the All Star Awards) in 1967 and won further Ulster Championships in 1970, 1975 and 1976 – and was captain for the 1970 triumph. In addition to being top scorer in the 1971 Ulster Championship, he was top scorer in both the 1974 and 1975 All-Ireland Championships. O'Connell's goal in the 1975 All-Ireland semi- final against Dublin has been called one of the greatest ever scored in Croke Park. He was a replacement All Star in 1976. In the 1976 Ulster decider replay against Cavan, he came off the bench in extra-time and played a vital role in securing the title for Derry. He was 37 years old when he played in 1975–76 National League final against Dublin – Derry lost by a point in what has been described as the \\"greatest ever League final\\". Club O'Connell made his debut for the Ballerin Senior team in 1953. That year, as a fifteen-year-old year he played for Ballerin in both the Derry Minor and Derry Senior Championship finals – both on the same day in Magherafelt. Ballerin however, were defeated in both finals – by Bellaghy and Desertmartin respectively. In 1957 however, Ballerin won their first ever Derry Championship, beating Ballymaguigan in the final on a scoreline of 3–08 to 2–06. Playing for Ballymaguigan that day was fellow Derry footballing legend Jim McKeever. O'Connell, now a 19-year-old, scored four points in that decider. Ballerin won their second ever Derry Championship in 1976, this time defeating Dungiven in the final by 0–09 to 0–03, with O'Connell playing a starring role. They went on to win that year's Ulster Senior Club Football Championship – defeating St. Joseph's (Donegal) in the quarter-final, Enniskillen Gaels (Fermanagh) in the semi-final and Clan na Gael of Armagh in the decider – O'Connell's performances once again proving vital to the club's success. The team easily beat Killererin of Galway in the 1976–77 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship semi-final, setting up a final clash with Austin Stacks of Kerry. The two teams were very closely matched the whole match, with Austin Stacks effectively winning the game in the last three minutes – the game finishing 1–13 to 2–07. Such was the esteem in which O'Connell was held that virtually all the Austin stacks players rushed to commiserate with him after the match. His role in bringing Ballerin to the All-Ireland final cannot be underestimated – with two seventeen-year-olds, an eighteen-year-old and a nineteen-year-old among the six forwards, his experience and ability were irreplaceable. He retired from club football in 1978, bringing an end to an incredible playing career. Province O'Connell played for Ulster for many years and won five Railway Cup medals with the province (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1971). He was captain for the 1971 success. School While O'Connell was at St Columb's, the school didn't compete in open competitions, such as the MacRory Cup, therefore his football at the school was confined to house and class matches. Other sports O'Connell played some soccer with Irish League side Coleraine F.C., playing in the centre half position. Other smaller soccer clubs he lined out for included Park and Dungiven Celtic. He was an outspoken critic of the GAA's Rule 27 which prohibited its players from playing foreign sports, and received a ban for playing the sport. He was also a decent golfer and in his youth participated in boxing as well as basketball. ==Managerial career== O'Connell was manager when Derry Minors won the Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Championships in 1965. He was also manager of the Derry Under 21 team who won Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under 21 Championships three years later in 1968. Many were surprised that he was never given the job of Derry Senior manager. He also served five years as manager of Ballerin and was also Chairman of the club for five years. ==Honours== County * All-Ireland Senior Football Championship: ** Runner up: 1958 * National Football League: ** Runner up: 1958–1959, 1960–1961, 1975–76 * Ulster Senior Football Championship: ** Winner (4): 1958, 1970, 1975, 1976 ** Runner up: 1957, 1971 * Dr. McKenna Cup: ** Winner (5): Years? * Dr Lagan Cup: ** Winner (1): Year?

It has become a trend throughout East, South and Southeast Asia and is largely produced in Japan, South Korea and China. == Design == Circle lenses make one's eyes appear larger and come in a variety of colors and effects. They have been around since 2004 and are very popular in countries such as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China. The diameter of regular contact lenses that are sold in the United States are on average 14mm–16mm. Similar to the diameter of regular contact lenses, circle lenses have no more than 15mm diameter since larger sizes would be harmful to the eyes at daily wear. When the diameter of the circle lens is described as 16mm or 18mm, it is only the provided visual effect of the circle lens. The difference between the two types of lenses is that circle lenses are tinted not only in areas that cover the iris of the eye, but also prominently in the extra-wide outer rim of the lens. The result is the appearance of a bigger, wider iris with a limbal ring, creating an illusion of large eyes. Saturday, April 25, 2020 The optical zone in the middle is transparent and it is large enough to provide clear vision. When big eye contacts first launched, they were only available in yearly disposable format, but as the trend spread, these lenses are now available as dailies, biweeklies and monthlies. The lenses are popular among teenagers and young adults. Many people consider circle lenses to be a fashion accessory rather than a medical device. In Hong Kong, many young female models wear them as popular fashion icons. == Popularity == In Asia, circle contact lenses can be bought from many online stores and are imported from manufacturing countries such as South Korea to nations such as Thailand, China, Malaysia, Japan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Vietnam, and Taiwan. They can be purchased without a prescription (0.00 or plano) or with prescription. Their legality in the West varies with the local laws, and in the United States they are currently classified as a medical device and are not legal for sale without a valid prescription. == Risks == A meta-analysis reported that cosmetically tinted lenses appear to be safe when properly prescribed by an eye care professional and when used correctly. Decorative soft contact lens must be fitted appropriately, as tinted soft contact lenses may reduce vision by temporarily increasing the number of high- order aberrations under bright-light and low-light conditions, as the center of tinted lenses does not always coincide with the center of the cornea, and thus decorative soft contact lenses must be fitted appropriately. Indeed, concerns with these lenses in the United States arise from people buying lenses without consulting their optometrists, which could result in lenses that do not fit the individual's eyes properly. == Legality == United States In the United States decorative, non-corrective contact lenses are considered medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sale and marketing of such devices require market clearance by the FDA and a valid prescription from a medical professional. Devices that have not been cleared by the FDA may be subject to seizure by US Customs. Korean contact lens companies Geo Medical Inc. and Migwang Contact Lens (operating under the brand name Clearlab in the US) have been approved by the FDA for sale in the United States. Circle lenses manufactured in Korea are under the approval and guidelines of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Acuvue, an American subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (J&J;), has a line prescription of 1-Day circle lenses marketed under the name \\"Acuvue Define\\" available in Far East markets, online and now in the UK and US. == See also == *Body modification == References == Category:Contact lenses Category:Asian culture Category:Human eye Category:Chinese fashion Category:Japanese fashion Category:South Korean fashion Category:Malaysian fashion Category:Singaporean fashion Category:Sri Lankan fashion Category:Taiwanese fashion Category:Thai fashion ","title":"Circle contact lens"},{"id":"20225916","text":"John Chetwynd, 2nd Viscount Chetwynd (c.1680 – 21 June 1767) was a British diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1715 and 1747.

Washakie was laid down on 13 October 1943 at Brooklyn, New York, by Ira S. Bushey and Sons as YT-386. She was launched on 13 February 1944. Reclassified as a large harbor tug and redesignated YTB-386 on 15 May 1944 prior to completion, she was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 30 June 1944 and placed in service on 1 July 1944. Washakie steamed from New York City, transited the Panama Canal, and served the Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet, for the duration of World War II. During the last year of hostilities with Japan, she served at various forward bases in the Central Pacific but finally ended up at Okinawa. She remained active at Okinawa even after the Japanese capitulation on 15 August 1945. Washakie received one battle star for World War II service. When Typhoon Louise struck Okinawa in October 1945, Washakie was one of several ships grounded or otherwise damaged by the storm. As a result of that damage, she was placed out of service on 16 October 1945. Soon refloated, she was ordered to Sasebo, Japan. While underway, she ran into another typhoon and was towed to an anchorage near Shanghai, China, for safety. She remained in Chinese waters for another six months before returning to the United States in April 1946. After completing inactivation overhaul, she was placed in reserve with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, at San Diego, California. In May 1953, Washakie came out of reserve, retransited the Panama Canal, and reported for duty at Mayport, Florida. There she remained for the next 22 years, serving under the auspices of the Commandant, 6th Naval District. In February 1962, she was reclassified a medium harbor tug and received the new designation YTM-386. Her name struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1975. Presumably, she was sold sometime thereafter.

It stars Rebecka Hemse, Jesper Salén and Jenny Ulving. ==Plot== The movie opens at a boarding school, at the time of the big party before summer break. While most of the students are outside listening to the headmaster's speech one student, Rebecka, is seen showering and writing a letter before jumping off the school's tower to her death. A year later the student Sara, who witnessed the suicide, is attending her final year at the school. Two new students, math genius Felix and diplomat son Leo, start to study at school. Sara and her friend Therese start to tell them of the local legend, Strandvaskaren (the Drowning Ghost). A century ago a farmer slaughtered three male students at the school before drowning himself in the nearby lake. He is believed to return once every year on the day of his death to haunt the school, and there is a tradition among the students to have a party at that day in the barn where the farmer once lived. Sara finds out that the farmer killed the students to avenge the rape and murder of his daughter, but it was all covered up by the authorities because the rapists were upper class. At the party, Sara's former boyfriend Måns and his friend Ynge try to pull a prank on Sara, but the drunken Ynge tries to rape her. Sara pushes him away and runs away while Måns yells at Ynge for going too far. Sara runs out and finds Måns current girlfriend hanging dead in the hallway. Ynge goes to have some milk and is killed by a fork struck through his head. Måns find the hysterical Sara and tries to calm her down and apologize. A masked man appears and rams an axe into Måns' head as Sara runs off. Sara locks in Leo into a storeroom and calls for Therese and Felix to help. Sara finds an 8 mm film in a box that had belonged to Rebecka, and discovers that Rebecka had a brother who has a weird similarity to Felix. Felix shows up and tells Sara that he and Rebecka were siblings. They were separated because their father was mentally unstable and put away. When Rebecka died, he swore to avenge her, dressed up as the Drowning Ghost, and started to kill the students who tormented Rebecka. He asks Sara to not say anything but believes she would any way and tries to kill her. Sara knocks him out and runs away with Therese. Therese falls into the well and breaks her leg. Sara climbs down after her. Morning comes and Felix awakens. He finds Sara and Therese, who are too afraid to call for help, in the well and climbs after them. Sara and Therese crawls down the pipe to the lake but Felix catches up with Therese and kills her off screen. Sara manages to reach the lake and escapes in a boat at the beach. She keeps her eyes on the pipe to see when Felix comes out of there, but falls asleep. When she awakens she has no idea how long she has been sleeping, and Felix is nowhere to be found. Felix tries to climb into the boat from underwater, but Sara cuts his hand by starting the boat engine. Felix tries to attack once more but Sara apparently kills him by bashing the anchor into his back. Felix sinks down to the bottom. Sara is saved by the police and reunited with Leo on the beach; the police try to fish Felix up but instead find the farmer. Sara and Leo leave the boarding school and graduate at a school in Stockholm. During the graduation day eight months after the events, with all parents and friends of the many students present, Sara looks out over the sea of people and suddenly sees a sign with the words written in red paint \\"My beloved sister Rebecka\\". The film ends with Sara realizing that even though she cannot see him in the crowd Felix is still alive and amongst the people watching her and her classmates graduate. == Cast == *Rebecka Hemse as Sara *Jesper Salén as Felix *Jenny Ulving as Therese *Peter Eggers as Leo *Daniel Larsson as Måns Weine *Rebecca Ferguson as Amanda *Anders Ekborg as Thomas *Kjell Bergqvist as Peder Weine *Anders Ahlbom as Bengt *Tommy Andersson as Pappan *Sasa Bjurling as Rebecka *Alma Duran as Rebecka as a child *Patrick Gillenhammar as Felix as a child *Oskar Thunberg as Doctor 1 *Stig Engström as Professor Ek *Erik Hultqvist as Markus *Kerstin Steinbach as Laila *Magnus Ehrner as Doctor 2 *Bojan Westin as Anna-Lisa *Frans Wiklund as Yngve *Filip Benko as Student ==Production== The film was shot at Filmhusateljéerna, Filmhuset in the Svenska Filminstitutet in Gärdet, Stockholm, Sweden. ==Release== The film premiered on 13 May 2004 as part of the Cannes Film Market.

Usually, it is attached to a halter. The lead may be integral to the halter or, more often, separate. When separate, it is attached to the halter with a heavy clip or snap so that it can be added or removed as needed. A related term, lead shank or lead chain refers to a lead line with a chain attached that is used in a variety of ways to safely control possibly difficult or dangerous horses if they will not respond to a regular lead. ==Variations== A lead can be made from a variety of materials, including cotton, horsehair (woven or braided hair, usually from a horse's tail), leather, nylon or other synthetic materials. Lead ropes, as the name implies, are round and made of various types of rope, usually between 5/8 and 3/4 inch (about 2 cm) in diameter.http://www.sstack.com Halters and leads at Schneider's Saddlery Co. Lead lines are usually flat webbing or leather, and are generally wide, though may be narrower for show use. Flat lines are less bulky and more comfortable in the hand for leading and animal, but may lack adequate strength for tying. A lead most often attaches to the halter with a sturdy snap. In some cases, the lead is tied or spliced permanently to the halter. A lead for a horse usually is in the range of long, but longer and shorter lengths are seen. The lead shank consists of a lead, usually a flat line, with a chain end, or, less often, thin nylon or rope. The chain end ranges from long and has a snap or clip on the end that attaches to the halter, and a ring on the other end that is attached to the lead line. Some lead lines are permanently sewn to the chain shank, others have buckles or clips allowing the chain to be removed. Lead shanks are usually used on potentially difficult or dangerous horses, such as stallions or those that, for various reasons, will not respond to a regular lead. For this reason, in some regions, lead shanks are sometimes called \\"stud chains.\\" They are also commonly seen on in-hand horses of all ages and sexes at some horse shows, as the chain shank can also be used to transmit commands quickly but inobtrusively, encouraging a prompt response from the horse. For aesthetic purposes, the lead may be the same color as the halter, and sometimes even made of the same materials. ==Use== A group of horses being led together by a single handler Leads are used to lead, hold, or tie an animal or string of animals. A horse may be led by a person on the ground, sometimes called \\"leading in-hand,\\" or may be led by a rider mounted on another horse, a process called \\"ponying.\\" A \\"string\\" of animals refers to animals tied to one another by their leads, whether the human leads the horses in hand or from another horse. Horses requiring physical conditioning, such as Polo ponies or roping horses, may be conditioned in strings. Pack horses are often led in strings on the trail, usually with the handler ponying the first pack horse and for the rest, the lead rope of one horse is tied to the tail or saddle of the horse in front of it. ==Safety in leading== Horse led from the side, excess lead rope folded and held, not wrapped around the hand Wrapping the lead rope around the hand can have disastrous consequences By tradition, the handler leads a horse from the horse's left (\\"near\\") side, though situations may arise when a horse needs to be led from the right (\\"off\\") side. In some areas, particularly in the American west, the handler may be in front of the horse while leading, though this technique does place the handler at risk due to not being able to see what the horse is doing. When leading a horse, the handler usually holds a single thickness of the lead with the right hand, while carrying the gathered slack of the lead in the left. The excess line should be laid in back-and-forth loops that fall on either side of the hand; holding the excess in circular loops, wrapping, or coiling the lead around the hand is dangerous, the handler can be dragged, injured or even killed if the horse pulls away, tightening the loops of the lead around the hand. When used to lead a horse in hand, the materials used in a lead, particularly synthetics, may put a handler at risk of a rope burn should the horse pull the lead from the handler. Some handlers wear gloves while leading a horse. ==Tying== A lead rope tied to a fencepost with a safety knot known as a \\"figure 8\\" halter hitch A horse in crossties. Either chain or rope are used to restrain the animal. Crossties are not used to lead the animal, only for restraint Lead ropes may be used to tie up animals. Common methods of tying off a lead include the halter hitch and a subset of other loop knots, collectively known among equestrians as safety knots and quick release knots. If the animal begins to panic, a person can pull the working end to quickly release the knot before it becomes too tight to untie quickly. The purpose of such a knot is to be easy to untie even when under significant tension. However, some animals do learn to untie themselves and may require the loose end of the rope to be passed through the slipped loop to prevent this occurrence, or be tied with alternative methods of restraint. Animals, usually horses, may also be placed in crossties, usually for grooming, tacking up and related activities. Crossties are commonly made from two lead ropes, each attached to a wall with the snap end placed on either side of the horse's halter. This technique of restraint keeps the horse from moving around as much as with a single lead, and is particularly handy when people are working on both sides of the animal. However, the method also presents some danger to the animal if it rears or falls. Ideally, crossties are attached at one end with either a quick release panic snap or breakaway mechanism. Flat lead shanks and thin diameter ropes generally lack the strength to securely tie a large animal such as a horse or cow, but may be more comfortable in a person's hand for leading. Ropes of a thick diameter (3/4 in or more) and high tensile strength generally are adequate to tie a large animal that resists being tied; thinner and/or weaker leads generally will break if significant tension is put on them. A common point of failure is the snap fastener used to attach the lead to the halter. An animal that panics and attempts to escape while tied with a lead can cause itself serious injury or damage the objects to which it is tied. When an animal is left unattended or if a safety knot is improperly tied and cannot be released, views differ as to whether a lead rope should be made strong enough not to break under tension, or if it should have safety elements that allow it to give way when tension reaches a certain point in order to minimize potential injury. Some people carry a very sharp knife in a belt holster or boot or keep a sharp knife in a convenient location in order to cut a lead in case of emergency. In other cases, particularly on leads used to restrain an animal in a horse trailer, a panic snap may be used, though releasing the snap while under extreme tension also may put a handler at some risk of injury. ==Use of a shank== A lead shank applied through the mouth. Generally not permitted under the rules for horse shows in the United States. A lead shank applied around the nose. Shank over the gums. Hard jerks on a lead shank can frighten a horse, damage the head, or cause a horse to rear. Light, short tugs are generally enough to get the attention of a horse. The chain should only come into action when pulled, not when hanging loosely. The handler does not hold the chain itself, as it can hurt the handler's hands should the horse pull back or move its head quickly. Chain shank attachments * Over the nose: The shank is run through the left ring of the halter (on the side of the face), wrapped once around the noseband of the halter, threaded through the right side nose ring of the halter, and attached on the upper right ring of the halter (near the ears of the horse). In some places, this configuration is called a \\"stallion chain,\\" though the setup is used on horses of all sexes under some circumstances. If the chain is not attached to the upper right ring, the halter can slide into the horse's eye when the shank is applied. When pressure is applied, the shank puts pressure on the nose of the horse, encouraging the animal to become more aware of the handler's signals. If the shank is used harshly, the handler can damage the horse's nose. An alternative use is to take the chain over the nose, around and under the chin, and attached back to itself. * Under the chin: the shank is run through the lower left ring of the halter, under the chin, through the lower right ring of the halter, and attached either back to itself or to the upper right ring. This tends to make a horse raise his head, but also has a stronger disciplinary effect. The chain, if too short to be attached back on itself, can also be run through the left ring and attached to the right ring, though the halter may also be moved off-center when the shank is applied, and the snap may be subject to pressure that may cause it to fail. * Chain through mouth: The chain is run through the left lower ring, through the mouth, through the right lower ring, and attached to the upper right ring. This is quite severe and can damage the mouth if used harshly. * Chain over gum: similar to the chain through the mouth, except the chain is rested on the upper gum of the horse's mouth, under the upper lip. The most severe attachment, may cause bleeding if the horse resists. ==See also== *Longe line *Rein *Lead (leg) *Lead change ==References== Category:Headgear (horse) ","title":"Lead (tack)"},{"id":"20226060","text":"Heidelberg Raceway was an American auto racing track which was built in Scott Township, Allegheny County, approximately southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It held weekly races and numerous special events between 1948 and 1973. It held four NASCAR Strictly Stock/Grand National Series and one NASCAR Convertible Division race between the 1940s and 1960s. In 1960, Heidelberg became the first track to fall off NASCAR's tour. The land is now occupied by a shopping center called Raceway Plaza. ==History== The track was the brainchild of the original Wrights Sea Food Inn owner, Ike Wright. It was originally constructed between 1947 and 1948 to be used as a horse racing establishment, with help and financial backing by Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney. When horse racing was not legalized in Pennsylvania., the track was converted into a place for autos to compete. The original track was a 1/2-mile dirt track that eventually had a 1/4-mile track cut into its infield. The tracks shared part of a straightaway that existed in front of the main grandstands. Over the final years of the tracks existence, there was also a figure-8 course being used within the quarter-mile section of the track. The first races happened at the track in May 1948. The first event was almost rained out, but track officials had drivers pilot their race cars around the course, using the heat buildup from the vehicle's tires to dry the track surface. Once the races began, the air became dusty from the cars racing around the track. The Observer-Reporter interviewed fans after the track closed, and they reported that the air was so dusty that fans could rarely see the race cars come down the straightaways. Thursday nights were selected because the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball team had only three Thursday night baseball games that season. Midget cars were the first weekly series, featuring drivers Jimmy Bryan, Bill Schindler, Al Shaffer, and Billy Spear. They raced on the 1/4 mile inner track. Special events featured sprint cars on the 1/2-mile track. From 1950 until 1953, the track began hosting coupe racing under NASCAR sanction. In 1954, Ed Witzberger took over promotion of the track, and eventually formed the Pittsburgh Racing Association (PRA) which raced coupes up to five nights per week including Thursday nights at Heidelberg. Other tracks in the association included South Park Speedway, Monduke Speedway, and Clinton Speedway. Chris Economaki, was the track announcer for special events in the 1950s. The track featured coupes until 1961, then late models became the track's main class. Witzberger had both tracks paved before the 1967 season. At the end of the 1972 season, when track promoter Ed Witzberger and driver Tom Colella could not come to terms on a three-year lease, an agreement was reached where Colella would lease the track, for one year, in 1973. The track was permanently closed at the end of the 1973 season. In an interview in 2007, Colella cited the 1973 oil crisis and urban sprawl as factors in the decision. Ed Howe won the last race on the track, a 250-lap special event, in 1973. Herb Scott had won more championships at Heidelberg than any other driver with a total of ten season championships. Nick Garin decided to build a Pennsylvania Motor Speedway in Imperial, Pennsylvania and he purchased many of the components from Heidelberg. He used the bleachers and fence from around the track at the new speedway. The site formally known as Heidelberg Raceway is now \\"Raceway Plaza\\"; a shopping strip mall that includes a Walmart, Lowe's Home Improvement, and Shop-N-Save. Other notable weekly drivers * Dick Linder, NASCAR and USAC driver * Joe Mihalic * Norm Benning, Jr., ARCA driver * Bud Middaugh * Tom Colella * Bob James former mechanic for Richard Petty * Jody Ridley ==Special Races== Tri-State 150 The PRA began hosting the Tri-State 150 as a special event on the 1/2-mile track after the regular season was completed. Winners included Herb Scott (1958), Gus Linder (1959), Joe Mihalic (1963) and Norm Benning, Sr. (1964). Benning said that the race winner won around $3000. \\"Today that would be nothing,\\" Benning said. \\"It was big back then. I remember one time we had 186 cars for a weekend race. Heidelberg brought in cars from Ohio, Michigan, Indiana weekly. It was the best track and it paid the most money.\\" Gulf 250 The track later started hosting a second major special event in late October called the Pittsburger 200. When the track was paved, it became the Pittsburger 250. The 250 began attracting pavement drivers from around the United States, including NASCAR driver Bobby Allison.  Gulf 100  On August 2, 1973 Heidelberg hosted a NASCAR sanctioned event for the Grand National East Series. The 100 lap event attracted several NASCAR regulars; including Tiny Lund, Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough and Buddy Baker. Local driver Tom Colella qualified fastest at slightly over 88 mph to start on the pole. Colella led from start to finish to win $845 and the event by 2 laps over second place Tiny Lund who took home $685. Bobby Watson, Jeff Faber, and Bruce Gould rounded out the top 5.  NASCAR races  Heidelberg held the seventh event in the first season of NASCAR's Strictly Stock Series on October 2., racing-reference.info. Lee Petty, father of NASCAR's winningest driver Richard Petty, won his first NASCAR race at the track. Petty had rolled his big boxy Buick Roadmaster earlier in the year at the Charlotte race, and brought a lighter weight number 42 Plymouth to the Heidelberg track. Petty beat local driver Dick Linder by five laps, the largest margin of victory throughout the 1949 season. Bill Rexford finished third, followed by Sam Rice and Sara Christian to round out the top five. Christian's fifth place finish in that race was the highest finish by a woman driver in the top level of the NASCAR racing until March 5, 2011, when Danica Patrick finished 4th in the NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. At the track's final race for NASCAR's premier Grand National series in 1960, Lee Petty won with his son Richard Petty finishing second. There would be no father-son 1-2 finish until Bobby Allison beat Davey Allison at the 1988 Daytona 500. Strictly Stock/Grand National {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Date ! Surface !

The journal originated in 1892, making it one of the oldest scholarly journals in the United States. Currently in its third series, the Quarterly is the leading journal for the study of early American history and culture. It ranges chronologically from Old World–New World contacts to about 1820. Geographically, it focuses on North America—from New France and the Spanish American borderlands to British America and the Caribbean—and extends to Europe and West Africa. Though grounded in history, it welcomes works from all disciplines bearing on the early American period—for example, literature, law, political science, anthropology, archaeology, material culture, cultural studies. The journal is named for the College of William and Mary where it was founded in 1892. It has been published in three successive series, with volume numbers repeating with each new series. The journal's first series of 27 volumes ran from 1892 to 1919. The second series began in 1921 and ended in 1943, while the third series began in 1944 and runs through the present day.

International Galleries said it was a Constable. Leaf paid £85. Five years later when he tried to auction it, Leaf was told that it was not a Constable. He claimed rescission of the contract against International Galleries, to get back his money. ==Judgment== Denning LJ held that Mr Leaf was barred because too much time had lapsed. He held that in the event of lapse of too much time between the making of the contract and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake about the quality of the subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for breach of condition. Jenkins LJ and Lord Evershed MR concurred. * Summary In essence, the court held that there was no breach of contract, no \\"operative mistake\\", but there WAS misrepresentation. However, after a period of five years the right to rescission had lapsed, leaving the claimant with no remedy at all. ==See also== *Vitiating factors in the law of contract *Misrepresentation in English law *Misrepresentation Act 1967 *Mistakes in English law *Salt v Stratstone Specialist Ltd [2015] EWCA Civ 745, damages in lieu unavailable if rescission would be, including the impossibility of restitutio in integrum. ==References *D Alberge, 'Michelangelo at the Met?

There are also wall structures indicative that part of the house could be isolated by means of a wooden portcullis. ==History== Councillor John Gilman, a proprietor of sawmills and member of a prominent early Exeter family involved in shipping, built the log house in 1709 and fortified it for protection.The Gilman Garrison, The Gilmans of Exeter, Nancy Merrill, seacoastnh.com It was owned late in the 18th century by Ebenezer Clifford, a master carpenter of renown throughout New Hampshire's Seacoast region, who took on Daniel Webster as a tenant while the latter attended Phillips Exeter Academy. In the 20th century, it underwent restoration and was converted into a museum of Americana, which also showcased some of the building's distinctive features.

It was established in 1970 by the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, DD (1968-1997) the year Pope Paul VI made a papal visit to the Philippines.http://vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1970/documen and two years after his arrival as the first Bishop of the newly created diocese (1968). ==The Foundation== Bishop Ataviado with meager funds started laying the foundation of a formation house of his future collaborators, the priests, in 1970. He at first housed the young seminarians at his own newly constructed Bishop's residence where they were trained in all aspects of life necessary to become effective and faithful servants of the Lord in the future. While Latin was taught inside the seminary, other subjects were and until now are being taught in the diocesan school, St. Joseph College. ==Formation== The first rector of the seminary was Fr. Vicente Lora (d.2004)who was assigned before the creation of the new diocese in the Sacred Heart Seminary, Palo, Leyte. Fr. Lora came from San Rafael, Maasin, Southern Leyte. When Fr. Lora left for a parish assignment in 1972, Fr. Arfeo Sescon took over the challenge of forming young men amid the political and social upheavals in the capital, Manila where he was trained for the priesthood under the guidance of the Dominican Fathers of the University of Santo Tomas Central Seminary. Helping him to run the whole seminary affairs was Rev. Fr. Felix Paloma who took the initiative of improving the seminary facilities to attract more young men to the seminary. With the increasing demand of having new parish priest appointed in different parts of the diocese, seminary formators would not last for more than two or three years. It happened indeed the year after Fr. Amado Olayvar left the seminary in 1977 for a parish assignment that the Bishop himself took the cudgel in running the seminary simply because he did not have any priest available for the seminary. His priests were all in the parishes. However, the Bishop put a major seminarian on regency in charge of the daily activities and schedule of the seminary. On their regency years, Wilson de los Reyes, Santos Sabondo, Celso Moreno, Romeo Mangyao, and Leonardo Kilat were one time assigned and stayed in the seminary. This arrangement with non-clerics as resident-formators lasted for how many years until in 1982 when the diocese started to reap the first fruits of Pope Paul VI Minor Seminary. It was this year that Bishop Ataviado did the first ordination to the priesthood of those coming from this minor seminary. The first alumnus to be assigned as rector of the seminary in 1982-1983 was Rev. Fr. Adelfo Briones. His term was marked by a reform of seminary policies and discipline. But when a new parish asked for his pastoral care and presence, Fr. Adelfo Briones did not hesitate to accept the challenge. The seminary once again left orphaned until the ordination of Rev. Fr. Anastacio Lito Narit who stayed in the seminary from 1983-1986. Although his term was beset with all kinds of problems due also to the political, social, and economic conditions of the time, the seminary had survived because of the austere life adopted by the formators and the seminarians. After the EDSA Revolution, a new and energetic priest set a new direction of the minor seminary. But Rev. Fr. Rogelio Lumbre's vision for the seminary suddenly deadened when he was assigned a few months later to a parish. Msgr. Amado Olayvar, fresh from Rome, rescued the sad state of the minor seminary. It was this time that extension building for the pre-college formation was almost complete. The seminary came back to life again with the iron hand of the prefect discipline of Romeo Mangyao and followed by Leonardo Kilat. In 1989, Fr. Nicolas Lagumbay came and transformed the seminary almost like a home conducive for community living and learning. It's during his term that produced later a lot of priests presently serving the diocese. This happy atmosphere would not last long without the efforts of the next Rector in 1992-94. Fr. Eufemio Gohetia raised funds to keep the seminary building looking new and the roofs re-structured to withstand the merciless downpour during rainy seasons. Fr. Leopoldo Suarez, Jr. in 1994-1995 gave the seminarians a good liturgical orientation while still in the formation. His term was cut short because a parish was suddenly left with no one to take care of. Thus, while still a deacon, Rev. Dennis Cagantas began running the seminary with much \\"responsible-freedom\\" given to seminarians until 1996. His term was again cut short when Bishop Ataviado got sick and was hospitalized for many months in Manila. Since he was the Private Secretary of the Bishop, he had no choice but to be with the Bishop. So, Fr. Plutarco Rodriguez was assigned to take care of the seminary from 1997-1999. It was during his term that there were liturgical innovations being done in the seminary activities. When the new Bishop came to take possession of the diocese after the death of Bishop Ataviado, Fr. Roel Handayan became the rector. The new Bishop Precioso Cantillas never lost time in getting closer to the diocesan seminary, the apple of his eye, as canonists put it. Being an administrator himself in the past, Bishop Cantillas devised plans to improve the quality of formation of his minor seminarians. Thus, starting this time, seminarians were never that more closely monitored in their development as young men and as future priests. The upkeep of the seminary personnel was never taken for granted by him. In fact, immediately a few weeks after his arrival, he already floated the idea of constructing a new seminary building to house not only minor seminarians but also college seminarians. The handbook of the minor seminary started to be formed during the term of Rev. Fr. Oscar A. Cadayona. The admission procedures were reviewed and standardized. The devotion to the Holy Mass and to the Blessed Virgin Mary marked the liturgical and spiritual life of the seminarians. The periodic outing to woods or mountains or seas fostered camaraderie of future priests or future public servants. The resident spiritual director, Fr. Angelito Rosales, made a lot of difference to the seminarians' sense of personal belongingness to Jesus Christ. The number of seminarians at this time increased every year until Fr. Cadayona left for Rome for post-graduate studies in philosophy in 2005. At present, the minor seminary is run by Rev. Msgr. Marnito Bansig. now the new rector is joy luzon. == Rectors== * Fr.

The son of a garment district salesman, Haber grew up in an apartment overlooking Ocean Parkway in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. He attended Erasmus Hall High School; some of its alumni included actors Jeff Chandler, Moe Howard, Bernie Kopell, Barbara Stanwyck, singer Barbra Streisand, author Mickey Spillane, chess player Bobby Fischer and Sid Luckman, the former quarterback of the Chicago Bears. When Louis Haber died at fifty- two of a heart attack, Mel became the family's breadwinner. To make ends meet, the twelve-year-old started delivering groceries, sold peanuts and beer at Ebbets Field and spent his summers in the Catskills as a busboy. He says it was there where he learned “motion efficiency,\\" which is commonly known as “working smart,” a trait he used when he eventually operated six different restaurants. Once Haber graduated high school, he enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Technology (F.I.T.) on the west side of Manhattan in the fall of 1954. ==Successes and failures== Two months after Haber enrolled in F.I.T., he quit after he received a phone call from businessman Artie Schifrin, who offered him a job at $85 a week working for Wallfrin Industries. In December 1954, ABC aired a series called Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter. The coonskin cap worn by actor Fess Parker set off a craze with the nation's youth, and several manufacturing companies, including Wallfrin Industries, jumped on the multimillion-dollar business bandwagon and began producing coonskin items. The craze lasted longer than anyone expected and finally ended when raccoon tails surged from twenty-five cents each to $5 a pound by May 1955. Out of work for the first time in his life, Haber regrouped at age nineteen. He first sold shoes and then stocks before he received a life-changing phone call from Schifrin, who switched Wallfrin Industries from a bicycle accessories business to an automotive novelty business and desperately wanted him back. ==Wallfrin Industries== Following World War II, the greatest and longest economic boom in world history was launched, and by the late fifties, approximately ten million cars were sold on an annual basis. It was an era in which American teenagers (the Baby Boom Generation) did everything in their cars. Between 1961 and 1968, Wallfrin Industries produced 750 different items such as hula dolls that gyrated in rear windows, religious statues for the dashboard, fuzzy dice for the rear view mirror, self-adhesive pin striping and tiger tails to hang on the gas tank. Their most successful product was Amber Lens Dye, which sold more than one million units. Automatic Radio purchased Wallfrin Industries in 1968 for $3 million, of which Haber collected 10 percent. Haber used the money to start several new businesses on the side. He launched a boiler-cleaning business, a front-end wheel-alignment franchise, a company factoring medical centers, an import business, a vacuum forming business, and an automotive- chemical manufacturing business. None of them were money makers and Haber shut them down and regrouped. Facing a textbook mid-life crisis, Haber traded in his large house in Long Island and Rolls Royce for a used Fiat and a furnished apartment in Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles. ==Palm Springs== Invited by a friend to visit Palm Springs, Haber stumbled upon the Ingleside Inn in 1975. The property, located at 200 Ramon Road, was in a state of disrepair thanks to an absentee owner. Haber learned the original owner was the widow of Humphrey Birge, manufacturer of the Pierce-Arrow motorcar. She built the private estate at the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains in 1925 and sold it a decade later to Palm Springs Councilwoman Ruth Hardy, who transformed the place into a 20-room hotel. She successfully ran the Inn for the next thirty years as an exclusive private club whose guests came by invitation only. Hardy's clientele included Howard Hughes, John Wayne, Greta Garbo, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Greer Garson, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Salvador Dalí, Norman Vincent Peale and J.C. Penney. After Hardy's death in 1965, the stardust from the old days had largely faded away over the next decade. Haber, who knew nothing about operating a resort, made a spontaneous handshake deal to buy the property for $300,000. On April 15, 1975, Haber became the owner of the Ingleside Inn. ==Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's== Haber shut down the Inn that summer and spent $500,000 in restoration costs, including Melvyn's restaurant. (here for Table of Contents) The Inn re-opened on September 15, 1975 and was an immediate success. Over the years, the Inn has become a magnet for Hollywood's elite, U.S. Presidents, royalty, aristocrats, captains of industry and celebrities visiting Palm Springs. They include Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Marlon Brando, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Sylvester Stallone, Liza Minnelli, Liberace, Barry Manilow, Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn, Rita Hayworth, Pat Boone, Debbie Reynolds, Larry King, John Travolta, Sidney Sheldon, David Hasselhoff, President Gerald Ford, and George Hamilton, just to name a few. The status of the hotel was enhanced when Frank Sinatra and Barbara Marx held their pre-wedding party at Melvyn's in July 1976. Later the restaurant and Inn were named one of the world's premier hotel and dining venues by Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. ==Cecils and other restaurant ventures== Tapping into the popularity of disco, Haber opened Cecils, a Chinese restaurant/discothèque on October 1, 1979. The $1.2 million disco rivaled Studio 54 in popularity and attracted celebrities like Kirk Douglas, Sonny Bono, Evel Knievel, Reggie Jackson, Smokey Robinson, Joan Collins, Jack Paar, Mary Martin, Carol Conners, Lola Falana, Lyle Waggoner, Ed Marinaro, Deney Terrio and John Travolta. Haber followed Cecils with a pair of dining ventures in the early 1980s: Saturdays and Doubles. Saturdays was a knock off of the T.G.I. Friday's franchise while Doubles was a large restaurant inside the famed Tennis Club. Haber unexpectedly found himself the second largest employer in Palm Springs with approximately 200 people on his payroll. ==Angel View Foundation== Pop culture historians had proclaimed disco dead by 1980, but it was alive and well in Palm Springs. Haber sold Cecil's to a pair of local businessmen in 1985. That same year he also sold Doubles and Saturdays. Haber then devoted himself to the Angel View Crippled Children's Foundation, which was based in nearby Desert Hot Springs. The foundation was originally created by a group from the Coachella Valley who felt the area's natural hot springs would be useful in the rehabilitation of children with polio. Angel View's mission broadened to include those children afflicted with a wide range of physical challenges. Haber served as a board member in 1983 and became Angel View’s president in 1993. The foundation opened its seventeenth home and named it the Mel Haber House on November 14, 2002. ==Safe House== After being the President of Angel View for many years, Mr. Haber stepped down and in 2014 joined the Board of Operation SafeHouse. SafeHouse is dedicated to the protection and well-being of children in crisis providing emergency shelter and a secure haven for runaway, abandoned and homeless children. As a founding member of the Riverside Anti-Trafficking Task Force, SafeHouse is the leading organization working to stem the growing epidemic of child trafficking in our Coachella Valley. SafeHouse provides assistance to more than 800 children a year helping them make a new start in life. ==Touche== Palm Springs had been awaiting Haber's return to the club scene and in January 1994, he obliged them with the opening of Touche, a $1.3 million Moroccan-themed bar, nightclub and restaurant. More than 500 people showed up on opening night, including Andy Williams, George Hamilton, Connie Stevens, Jack Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Marc Lawrence and Jackie Mason. Despite an international plug from Runaway with the Rich and Famous (featuring Robin Leach), a pattern emerged at Touche: Haber was turning people away on weekends, but had no mid-week business. He eventually discovered that people's work and play habits had changed, and that there was also more enlightenment about alcohol and substance abuse through the media. Haber sold Touche in 1996 for $250,000 and returned his attentions back to The Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's, which were still thriving. ==Author== With the sale of Touche, Haber wrote an anecdotal book called Bedtime Stories of the Ingleside Inn. The book mainly focused on funny stories and misadventures involving the Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's. With a dedication by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 1996 book sold approximately 10,000 copies. Haber's second book, Palm Springs á la Carte: The Colorful World of the Caviar Crowd at Their Favorite Desert Hideaway, was co- authored with biographer Marshall Terrill and published in 2008. ==Honors== On October 24, 1996 (his 60th birthday) Haber received a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.Palm Springs Walk of Stars: By Date Dedicated Also, the City of Palm Springs designated the Ingleside Inn as an official historic site. ==References * Category:1936 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American hoteliers Category:American humorists Category:American Jews Category:American male writers Category:American restaurateurs Category:Businesspeople from California Category:People from Flatbush, Brooklyn Category:Fashion Institute of Technology alumni Category:Erasmus Hall High School alumni ","title":"Mel Haber"},{"id":"20226853","text":"A Lambda Boötis star is a type of peculiar star which has an unusually low abundance of iron peak elements in its surface layers.

A. Rodriguez at the Conservatorio Superior of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and subsequently with Solomon Mikowsky at Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He has performed extensively throughout Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, the UK and the US, in halls including Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall in New York, Royal Festival Hall in London and numerous other venues. He has collaborated with conductors such as Ivan Fischer, Victor Pablo, Cristian Mandeal, Matthias Bamert, Gunther Herbig, Adrian Leaper, José R. Encinar, Stanisław Skrowaczewski, with orchestras such as the Budapest Festival Orchestra, The Turin Symphony, The Northern Sinfonia, as well as the major Spanish orchestras (Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Galicia, Nacional de Cataluña, Castilla y León, Sinfónica de Madrid). He has been invited to play at various international music festivals, including the Festival Internacional de Canarias, Festival de La Roque-d'Anthéron, Quincena Musical Donostiarra, Festival Internacional de Santander, among others. He studied composition with Giampaolo Bracali and Ludmila Ulehla at Manhattan School of Music. His compositional language may be defined as “algorithmic spectralism”, merging elements of the spectralist movement (Grisey, Murail, Radulescu, etc.), in which timbre plays a fundamental role, with processes derived from mathematical disciplines such as cellular automata, L-systems, fractals, genetic algorithms, number theory, spectrum analysis, additive synthesis, psychoacoustics, etc. Needless the say, the use of the computer is indispensable, usually producing results in the form of electronic music. However, his main interest is not in electroacoustics, but to “transcribe” these results using traditional instruments. This requires a very careful and elaborate process of quantization of melodic, rhythmic and timbre elements, so it can be adequately performed by human players. These transformations, however, leave intact the essence of the original process. His works are published by PeriferiaMusic and Fractal Music Press. A programmer as well, he has written the PC freeware program FractMus, which explores fractal and generative processes for music composition. His articles on the subject have been published by specialized magazines such as Electronic Musician. and MIT's Leonardo Music Journal. Since 2002, he is a professor of piano at the Centro Superior de Música del País Vasco, Musikene. ==Selected works== ;Orchestral *Ricercare: D.

The McKinley Birthplace Home and Research Center is located near the Memorial at 40 South Main Street in Niles. The historic house museum has been furnished for the period when President McKinley was in office. ==History== Planning On March 4, 1911, President William Howard Taft as Commander-in-Chief, authorized Congressional funding for a national memorial to be located in the town of McKinley's birth: Niles, Ohio.\\"Want $100,000 for McKinley Memorial,\\" The New York Times. 28 June 1914.

After securing nearly $200,000 for the Memorial without utilizing taxpayer funding, Butler and the Association sought public donations of $1 each to establish a permanent endowment. \\"Subscribers\\" (as the donors were called) would receive a book autographed by Butler \\"describing the work of the Memorial\\" that also contained a reproduction portrait of McKinley and \\"a facsimile of the act of Congress authorizing and commending the construction of the Birthplace Memorial.\\" Competition and design J. Massey Rhind's statue of William McKinley The Memorial is the subject of the 1916–17 commemorative McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar The Association had its own ideas for the Memorial's general design when they announced plans to offer a prize for the best architectural proposal in 1914. The city of Niles had already set aside a five-acre park as a location for the Memorial (purchased with municipal funds), and the Association stipulated that the design would be for a granite two-story structure with a basement, and that the structure must include a 1,000-seat auditorium (the \\"main feature\\"), a public library, a \\"relic room\\" for display of assorted effects, \\"an assembly hall for meetings of the veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic, where State encampments may be held, and for Spanish–American War Veterans, and a room for the meetings of officials of the city.\\"\\"M'Kinley Memorial at his Birthplace: a Two-story Granite Building, to Cost $200,000, in Niles, Ohio.

Additionally, the Association specified that the Memorial would house not only a statue of McKinley, but also \\"bronze busts of men associated with him in the affairs of the nation,\\" such as Theodore Roosevelt, Marcus Hanna, Butler, and Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, the latter two of whom were large contributors to the Memorial's fund. Upon publication of the Association's announcement, a competition commenced within the American Institute of Architects. Edgerton Swartout (who was once an architect at McKim, Mead and White), Charles A. Platt (American landscape architect), and Edward Brodhead Green (Albright-Knox Art Gallery)served as judges for the competition, which comprised entries from Cass Gilbert (architect of the Woolworth Building), Henry Bacon (designer of the Lincoln Memorial), Harold Van Buren Magonigle (architect of the McKinley National Memorial and Mausoleum), Palmer, Hornbostel and Jones (a partner of which worked on the Queensboro Bridge), J. L. Decker (a local architect in Niles), and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary (designers of the Detroit Institute of Arts). In 1915, the competition was concluded, and the $1,000 prize was awarded to McKim, Mead, and White.Swartout should have exempted himself from judging, based on conflict of interest, but there is no evidence of this. Their design, somewhat typical of their other Beaux-Arts work, reflected Greek and Roman themes in all aspects, from architectural elements to the lettering on tablets and statuary. Indeed, the entire Memorial was described not unlike a temple of antiquity, with McKinley assuming the role of \\"household god\\": : \\"Seen from the approach on Main Street, the building will be dominated by its central feature, a colonnade or propylaea leading into a court of honor. :It is this court, the atrium of the old Roman palaces where the statue of the household god stood, which is to be the climax of the entire structure.\\"\\"New York Architects Win Award for M'Kinley Memorial,\\" The New York Times. 17 January 1915.

The plot is about a depressed professor whose spirits are lifted when he rents part of his home to a young couple. It was based on the novelette An Apartment for Jenny by Faith Baldwin. Campus exteriors were filmed at the University of Nevada, Reno. ==Plot== Just after World War II, retired philosophy professor Henry Barnes (Gwenn) confides in his friend, law professor Edward Bell (Lockhart), that he is planning to commit suicide. He has reached this decision calmly and logically, feeling that having been forced to retire by the college, he is no longer useful, and he should not stay alive and use up the world's scarce resources. It is later revealed to the viewer that Henry's wife has died and his son was killed in the war. Edward tries to talk Henry out of his plan and contacts Dr. Philip Conway, who examines Henry and finds him in very good health. Henry asks the doctor to prescribe him sleeping pills, but Dr. Philip will only give him two at a time to prevent Henry from committing suicide by overdose. Jason Taylor (Holden) is a United States Navy veteran who survived the sinking of the USS Vincennes and is now attending college on the G.I. Bill, hoping to become a chemistry teacher. He and his young, pregnant wife Peggy (Crain) live in a cramped camper while she seeks a better apartment for them, where Jason can concentrate on his studies without anxiety. The post-World War II housing shortage is affecting many G.I. Bill students who have brought wives and families with them; quonset huts have been set up in every spare space, and Edward, who is also serving as VA housing administrator, is swamped with paperwork and requests. Peggy and Henry randomly meet on a campus bench and Henry is fascinated by her youthful slang and enthusiasm. She tells him all about Jason and their housing dilemma. When she complains about the unresponsive \\"creep\\" housing administrator, Edward, Henry reveals that Edward is his good friend. Peggy then goes to Edward's office to pressure him. Edward discovers that Henry has a spare attic and assigns Peggy and Jason to live with Henry. The young couple move in and disrupt the usual peace and quiet of Henry's home. At first Henry is upset by the noise and chaos, but they all work through the tensions and end up making an impromptu family. Jason and Peggy help with the house chores and Peggy starts calling Henry \\"Pop\\". Peggy also finds new work for Henry, having him teach a free class for the G.I. Bill students' wives, who are worried about being left behind by their newly educated husbands. However, Henry is still planning to commit suicide on March 1, saving up the pills he gets two at a time from the doctor. Meanwhile, Jason, who is having trouble in his chemistry class and is worried about money, is considering quitting school to take a job selling used cars in Chicago. Peggy then suddenly has a miscarriage, saddening them all. Henry tells Peggy that he had planned to commit suicide, but has changed his mind. Jason quits school and moves to Chicago to sell cars, leaving a depressed Peggy behind to recover at Henry's house. Dr. Conway tells Henry that Peggy's illness is not health-related but rather stems from her disappointment that Jason gave up his dream. Henry contacts Jason and tries to talk him into returning to school. Henry thinks his efforts have failed, but unbeknownst to Henry and Peggy, Jason secretly returns to try to pass his exams. He does well on them all, except his most difficult subject, chemistry. Halfway through the exam, he almost gives up in frustration, but is talked out of it by his chemistry professor, who turns out to also be a Navy veteran. With the professor's encouragement, Jason passes the chemistry exam. Meanwhile, Henry, having told Peggy that his home is her home, has decided to commit suicide after all and takes his saved-up stash of pills. Peggy calls Dr. Conway and finds out that the doctor did not give Henry sleeping pills, but instead substituted a different non-lethal pill. Jason comes home and he and Peggy give Henry coffee and help him walk off the effects of the pills. Jason tells Henry that he knew many men who died during the war—perhaps even Henry's son—who would love to have Henry's option to continue to live. In the end, Henry is happily reunited with Jason, Peggy and his professor friends, and Peggy announces she and Jason plan to have another baby. ==Cast== *Jeanne Crain as Peggy Taylor *William Holden as Jason Taylor *Edmund Gwenn as Professor Henry Barnes *Gene Lockhart as Professor Edward Bell *Griff Barnett as Dr. Philip Conway *Randy Stuart as Dorothy *Betty Lynn as Wife *Marion Marshall as Ruth *Pati Behrs as Jeanne ==References* Category:1948 films Category:1948 comedy films Category:1948 comedy-drama films Category:1948 drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American pregnancy films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on works by Faith Baldwin Category:Films directed by George Seaton Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films shot in Nevada ","title":"Apartment for Peggy"},{"id":"20226904","text":"Demographic economics or population economics is the application of economic analysis to demography, the study of human populations, including size, growth, density, distribution, and vital statistics. ==Aspects== Aspects of the subject include * marriage and fertility * the family * divorce * morbidity and life expectancy/mortality * dependency ratios * migration * population growth * population size * public policyTheodore W.

P. Clive, Schubert and His World (Oxford University Press) 1997, s.v. \\"Pálffy von Erdöd, Ferdinand\\" supplies most of the information in this article. ==Life== Born in the Habsburg residence Vienna the son of Count Lipót Pálffy de Erdőd (1739–1799), he was a distant relative of the Imperial field marshal and Hungarian palatine János Pálffy (1664–1751). He attended the mining institute at Schemnitz, Hungary (now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia) from 1794 to 1796, where he remained in government service before returning to Vienna in 1806 to work in the Austrian ministry of mines. Jakob Alt: Theater an der Wien, 1815 In 1807 Pálffy was among the association of court nobles that acquired the Theater an der Wien, as well as the leases of the other two theatres patronised by the court, the Burgtheater and the Theater am Kärntnertor. By degrees he became solely responsible for the court theaters, and in 1813 he acquired outright the Theater an der Wien, inducing Louis Spohr to come from his court appointment in Gotha to conduct its orchestra. Count Pálffy was a dedicated patroniser of Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he reserved an honored place in his theatre—in close vicinity to the orchestra due to Beethoven's incipient deafness. According to Spohr, he nevertheless was vociferously accursed by the impetuous composer. Under Pálffy's directorship, the Theater an der Wien saw the premiere of Helmina von Chézy's Rosamunda, which sank without a trace, save for its incidental music by Franz Schubert, whose 1820 melodrama Die Zauberharfe found eight performances at the Theater, for which Schubert dedicated to Palffy his Grande Sonata in B-flat major (D 617).Clive 1997. He found fault with Spohr's 1813 opera Faust, so that Carl Maria von Weber arranged its premiere at the Prague Estates Theatre in 1816. During the period of his proprietorship, which lasted until 1826, he offered opera and ballet and, to appeal to a wider Viennese audience, popular pantomime and variety acts, losing money in elaborate spectacles until he was forced to sell the theater at auction in 1826, and to disperse his library and collection of mineral specimens. Fearing arrest for his outstanding debts, he fled Vienna for Preßburg (Bratislava) where he remained for several years. ==Notes== Category:Impresarios Category:1774 births Category:1840 deaths ","title":"Ferdinánd Pálffy"},{"id":"20227001","text":"The 2008 Golden Spin of Zagreb () was the 41st edition of an annual senior- level international figure skating competition held in Zagreb, Croatia.

He was one of the many Jesuit missionaries who strove throughout Germany, from Freiburg to Berlin and Danzig, to reawaken and strengthen the country's Catholic forces after the stormy year of 1846. ==Life== Hasslacher was born in Coblenz. His youth was somewhat tempestuous. As a medical student in the university in Bonn, in 1831, he identified himself with the German student movement, which was looked upon as revolutionary; and he was compelled, in consequence, to undergo seven years confinement in Berlin, Magdeburg, and Ehrenbreitstein. During these years he underwent a spiritual change, and in particular, by studying the Church Fathers, stirred his mind with theological knowledge; after his liberation he entered, in the spring of 1840, the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, at Saint-Acheul, France. He was ordained to the priesthood on 1 September 1844, and then preached with much success in the Strasbourg Cathedral, until the year 1849. It was at this time that the popular missions were inaugurated in Germany, but Hasslacher's delicate health could not long withstand the physical exertions entailed, and this apparent difficulty and disadvantage led the zealous-heated missionary into the field of activity which was particularly his own, namely, the conference. This he himself explains in a detailed letter (Deutsches Ordensarchiv) written from Bad Ems to his provincial in 1860. He gave conferences in all the larger cities in the Rhine and Westphalia. His strength failing, he was sent in 1863 to conduct, in Paris, the St. Joseph's Mission for German Catholics, but even this labour became after ten years too much of a tax on his physical powers so that he was compelled to abandon it and to take up similar but lighter duties at Poitiers. After a year he was brought back, very ill, to Paris, where he died. ==References== ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Hertkens, Erinnerungen an P. Hasslacher (Münster, 1879).

The organization's web site serves as a clearing-house of business and recruiting information that allows interested parties to come together in service of thousands of foreign assistance projects worldwide. Devex has over 800,000 registered members within the international development community - including development organizations, donor agencies, suppliers and aid workers - the company claims more than 1 million active users. Devex's President and Editor-in-Chief, Raj Kumar, began the organization in 2000 as a student project at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Kumar’s goal was to lower the administrative costs of donor agencies so they could devote a greater share of resources to foreign-assistance projects themselves. “With $200 billion in foreign aid each year,” Kumar said in 2008, “a few percentage points of efficiency gains is like adding another Gates Foundation to the world.” ==Services== Devex uses content-sharing and social-networking tools to dramatically reduce the time and expense which international development professionals have typically had to devote to recruiting and information- gathering. The features offered on devex.com include a searchable database of over 700,000 professionals and a company directory listing more than 12,000 development companies. Devex also provides its members with information about projects being funded by over 350 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies. Its real-time intelligence on the development sector prompted the Washington Post to compare Devex to Bloomberg L.P.’s financial information service. At any given time, the site provides details on as many as 35,000 active projects in the developing world. Devex members receive several types of reports on these activities including: *Tender Reports consolidate specific procurement notices from over 150 donor agencies, which are posted on devex.com within 24 hours of their initial publication. *Project Reports provide information on opportunities presented as part of funding for specific aid projects or programs. *Early Intelligence Reports use interviews with agency representatives, government officials and other inside sources to provide Devex's Executive Members with project information that has not yet been publicly released. *Business Insight Articles *Country Pipeline Strategy Reports ==Recent history== Devex expanded its media arm in 2008, hiring dozens of reporters and employing freelancers worldwide.

The Sussex family had longstanding ties to Lewes and Firle, both under control of the Earls Warenne, Earls of Surrey. As Yorkshire Levetts acted as witnesses for documents executed by the Earls of Surrey, and William de Livet was the steward of Wakefield for the 5th Earl, suggests that they may have followed their more powerful betters northward to Yorkshire. The Sussex Levetts and Yorkshire Levetts do not share coats-of-arms, but their arrival in Yorkshire likely predated the general use of heraldry. was likely born in Hooton Levitt, the son of Nicholas de Lyvet, the lord of the manor.Nicholas de Lyvet owned the manor at nearby Lupset and at Pickburn, which he held of William Earl Warenne, Earl of Surrey. There were four Hootons in Yorkshire, the name meaning 'a farmstead on a spur of land,' from the Old Norse. Hooton Levitt was a tiny village, bordering on Nottingham Forest. As late as 1379, it had only 30 taxpayers. What made it valuable were its quarries, and those controlled by the nearby Cistercian Abbey of Roche.There were considerable quarrying lands in South Yorkshire, including those of the now-vanished village of Levitt Hagg, also named for the Levett family. It was these quarries, and others like them nearby, that would later supply the grinding stones necessary to the cutlery industry that emerged at nearby Sheffield, and that in the meantime supplied building material to much of the county.Also necessary to the eventual iron and steel industry was coal, also readily available nearby, and in later centuries quite a few coal lands were controlled by Levetts living at High Melton and elsewhere. These family holdings were largely squandered by two barrister brothers, Thomas Levett, High Sheriff of Rutland, and his brother John, a York barrister wielding a powerful appointment from the Archbishop of York. Perhaps not surprisingly, the two lawyers' lawsuits litter old Yorkshire records. The Lyvet family were lords of the manor of several South Yorkshire villages, and Hooton Levitt (sometimes spelled Hooton Levett) was given the manorial affix of the Anglo-Norman family who eventually came to own it.Maltby-Maltbie Family History, Dorothy Maltby Verrill, Birdsey Lucius Maltbie, Maltby Association, Newark, New Jersey, 1916 William Levett married Constantia, granddaughter of Richard FitzTurgis,One of the earliest appearances of the FitzTurgis name is on a York charter of 1194 which refers to \\"Turgis, son of Turgis.' The name Turgis was probably Norman, but the origin is pure Viking. The name FitzTurgis means, when translated, son of (fils de in French) Thor (Turgis), the Old Norse god. Both FitzTurgis and de Busli have been described by one historian as 'two members of the lesser baronage.' The name FitzTurgis was later Anglicised to Sturges and its variants. founder of Roche Abbey and first to style himself 'de Wickersley' after his holding of the nearby village of Wickersley.The de Wickersleys later moved to Broomhall, Sheffield, where the family name eventually died out, and the family holdings were carried by marriage into the family of Robert Swift, High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1599, from a family increasingly powerful in the region who came from Rotherham. Following the marriage of William Levett and Constantia de Wickersley, the Levett family controlled the Abbey through its patronage. In today's world such abbeys seem an odd concept, but during the Middle Ages they controlled huge swaths of land. Roche Abbey's holdings—and it was only of middling rank—were enormous, sprawling across five counties: Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Lancashire.Roche Abbey lands: table of holdings, Roche Abbey, Sheffield University, cistercians.shef.ac.uk Little is known of the life of William Levett, lord of the manor of Hooton Levitt and controller of Roche. He appears to have been a power in the region, having witnessed a charter in 1240 confirming a grant under William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, one of the most powerful Norman magnates, of land to the Kirklees nunnery. Levett (referred to as 'William de Livet') served as Steward to the Earl of Surrey.Confirmation by William, Earl Warren (ca. 1240), of the grant by Reinerus Flandrensis, Muniments of Kirklees and Armytage Family, West Yorkshire Archive Service, Calderdale, The National Archives, nationalarchives.gov.uk The Levett family's name is often connected with grants of land to the Abbey through the centuries.Yorkshire: The History of Roche Abbey from Its Foundation to Its Dissolution, James D. Abeling, Printed by Robert White, Worksop, 1870 As lords of the manor of Hooton Levitt and principal patrons of Roche Abbey, the Levett family wielded considerable influence in the region. But these were turbulent times, punctuated by the Black Death and the evolving feudal order, in which labor imbalances due to plague deaths gave the common laborer leverage against his lords. By the time of the tenure of Roche Abbey Abbot John de Aston (1356-1358) the Levett family seemed to have been stretched thin. In 1377 John Levett, son of William and likely grandson or great-grandson of the original William who gained control of the Abbey through marriage, sold control of Roche to a London merchant.John Levett's sale of the patronage of Roche Abbey followed by 30 years the most profound ravages of the Black Death, from 1348-49, which altered irretrievably the agricultural landscape of England. Aside from conferring more power onto the scarcer peasant laborers, the Plague also converted many landlords to raising sheep instead of cereals. The Black Death almost certainly figured into Levett's sale of Roche – perhaps even taking the life of an intended heir. The deed records Levett's words: \\"I, John Levet, son and heir of William Levet, of Hooton Levet, have given, granted, and by this present charter confirmed to Richard Barry, citizen and merchant of London, the whole of my estate, which I have or my ancestors have ever had in the foundation of the Abbey of Roche....\\"Ibid. At the height of the Abbey's power, during the tenure of the FitzTurgis family and their Levett descendants, Roche had some 80 monks within its walls. Quarrying its stone-rich meadows yielded large profits, as did income from its sprawling holdings,Possessions of Roche Abbey, rotherhamweb.co.uk principally of grazing land but also within the city of York.Roche Abbey, Rotherhamweb.com The family's ties to this ecclesiastical bedrock during the turbulent Middle Ages likely provided some measure of spiritual comfort. All this passed out of the family's hands in 1377, perhaps because of financial mismanagement or the collapsing labor market due to the Black Death. The family continued to remain in the area,The Levetts seemed to feel some proprietary interest in the Abbey, or perhaps a sense of sour grapes that they had lost control. Although the family had disposed of their patronage of Roche Abbey by sale to a London merchant in the fourteenth century, a lawsuit was filed in 1534 by 'William Levet v. Henry, Abbot of Roche.'

The narrow gauge C and W Railway ran from Castlegar to Trail and up to Rossland. The Columbia and Western Railway was a historic Canadian narrow gauge railway located in southern British Columbia. Constructed in 1896, its route connected silver and gold mines at Red Mountain and Rossland and a smelter at Trail. Augustus Heinze was the force behind the line as he also was the developer behind the Trail smelter and worked quickly to gain competitive advantage prior to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway into the Kootenay region. Premier Turner of Victoria passed \\"An Act to Incorporate the Columbia and Western Railway Company\\" (C&W;) on April 17, 1896. Capitalization was stated to be $5 million. Besides bestowing a grant of of land per completed mile of the narrow-gauge trackage— for any standard gauge built—the Act permitted the C&W; to build west through the metal-rich Boundary District and on to Lake Okanagan at Penticton to connect with the CPR's lakeboat service to its Mainline via that lake to the Shuswap and Okanagan Railway. The company had four years to accomplish the construction or lose the $50,000 deposit that it was required to remit to the government within six months of the Act's passage. Initially it was a narrow gauge line, and the steep, rise up the mountain from the Columbia River necessitated the use of three Shay locomotives to move the open ore cars, past the fruit trees of Warfield, and onto the LeRoi and War Eagle mines. A spur ran to the Arrow Lakes steamer landing at Robson. Heinze sold to Canadian Pacific Railway in 1898. The line was regauged to by the CPR in 1899. The CPR had a standard gauge portage railway running from Nelson to Robson and it was built in 1891. The CPR then embarked on a massive expansion placing a line over the Crowsnest Pass to Creston, which indirectly connected to Nelson, then to the portage railway down the Kootenay River. The fundamental basis for all of this was to move coal from Fernie to the smelter at Trail—in connection with shifting the ore down Red Mountain and sending the final reduced concentrates out to the Eastern US. The purchase of the C and W line allowed for the continued westward expansion of a standard gauge line. This it did by 1900 running a link via Brooklyn, Gladstone and Paulson to Grand Forks. The CPR took the C and W and its generous land grants and merged it into the Kettle Valley Railway it was then building. Technically, the portion of the Kettle Valley Line that runs from West Robson through Gladstone and Grand Forks to Midway is the Columbia and Western line while the Kettle Valley Railway proper is section that runs west from Grand Forks to Hope. J. W. Stewart the famed general and builder, worked on the project (see Foley, Welch and Stewart). A wooden railway bridge, crossing the large Columbia River, was built in 1902 at Robson to the new town of Castlegar on the west bank. Thus, by this time the Kettle Valley Railway and the Columbia and Western Railway were physically joined to the main Canadian Pacific system via Princeton, Brookmere, Merritt and Spences Bridge. The Coquihalla Pass line to Hope was finished in 1916. Again, the Canadian Pacific had extensive fleets of lake steamers and tugs on Okanagon, Arrow, Slocan and Kootenay Lakes. The Section from Castlegar to Grand Forks is now a cycling trail. From The Paulson Summit, it is about uphill, downhill, then flat to the City of Castlegar water intake. About in, one passes a memorial to Doukhobor Peter V. Verigin, who was killed in one of the earliest terrorist attacks in Canada; a still-unsolved Canadian Pacific Railway train explosion on October 29, 1924 near Farron, between Castlegar and Grand Forks, British Columbia.

As of August 2016, the company worked with 25 self- driving car programs. Velodyne Lidar ships sensors to mobility industry customers for testing and commercial use. ==History== David Hall founded Velodyne in 1983 as an audio company specializing in subwoofer technology. Velodyne's experience with laser distance measurement started in 2005, when David Hall and his brother Bruce (then president of Velodyne) entered a vehicle in a driverless car race called DARPA Grand Challenge sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The experience led them to realize shortcomings both in camera-centric approaches and in existing lidar technology, which only scanned a single, fixed line of sight. Velodyne developed new sensors for the 2007 race. The brothers sold their perception detection system as a steering input to five of the six teams that finished the 2007 race. The system rotated 64 lasers and measured the time of flight to calculate distance of surrounding objects. This created a 360 degree 3D map of the environment. The new system produced one million data points per second, while earlier systems produced 5,000 data points per second. A Velodyne HDL-64E, an HDL-32E, a Puck, and an Ultra Puck Velodyne donated one of its early prototype sensors to the Robotics Collection at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in 2011. In 2016, Velodyne's Lidar department was spun off from Velodyne Acoustics as Velodyne Lidar, Inc. On August 16, 2016, Velodyne announced a $150M investment from Ford and Baidu. In 2017, the company opened their fully automated megafactory in San Jose, California, to speed up production while reducing the cost of sensors. Velodyne also has a production facility in Morgan Hill, California, and an R&D; center in Alameda, California. In 2017, Velodyne provided their sensors as a sponsor of the SAE GM AutoDrive Challenge, a three-year competition in which eight university teams develop a Level 4 automated vehicle. In 2018, Velodyne partnered with Mothers Against Drunk Driving in a campaign to advance autonomous vehicles for improving roadway safety and preventing impaired driving deaths. In October 2018, Velodyne organized the inaugural World Safety Summit on Autonomous Technology. In the same year, the company also signed agreements to collaborate with Nikon and Veoneer for manufacturing and mass production. In January 2020, Hall announced he was stepping down as CEO in favor of Anand Gopalan, who was previously CTO. On July 2, 2020, Velodyne LiDAR announced that it would combine with Graf Industrial in order to become publicly tradable on NASDAQ with ticker VLDR,https://velodynelidar.com/blog/graf-and-velodyne-lidar-announcement/ c.f. reverse merger. ==Technology== An Alpha Puck, Velarray, and VelaDome Applications for Velodyne Lidar's technology include autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, mapping, security, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Velodyne's sensors have a range of up to 300 meters and can be used for immediate object detection without additional sensor fusion. When in use on a moving vehicle, a Velodyne sensor can create a precise image of the road ahead, including detailed street signs and foliage. In April 2017, Velodyne announced Velarray, a sensor that produces a directional image rather than the surround view provided by previous sensors. The range, resolution, and field of view facilitate object detection, allowing for longer braking distance and increased safety. Designed for seamless vehicle integration, this compact sensor generates a detailed directional image, day or night. It can be concealed within roof lines, in bumpers and behind windshields. Also in 2017, the company introduced the Alpha Puck (previously known as VLS-128) sensor with a range of up to 300 meters. This sensor is made for autonomous driving and advanced vehicle safety at highway speeds. In 2019, Velodyne introduced the VelaDome™, a compact embeddable lidar that provides a 180° x 180° image for near-object avoidance. The company also introduced Vella™, software that establishes the Velarray™ as an integral component for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). ==Partners and customers== Velodyne Lidar Alpha Puck on a Voyage vehicle In 2010, Google (now Alphabet) began testing self- driving cars on the streets in the San Francisco Bay Area using Velodyne's Lidar technology. Alphabet's first self-driving car prototype (built on Toyota's Prius model) used Velodyne's HDL-64E lidar sensor. Since then, Alphabet has stopped using Velodyne sensors in its vehicles. In 2012, Velodyne Lidar signed a contract with Caterpillar for a supply of lidar sensors to be used for off-road vehicles. These sensors help Caterpillar map quarries, farms and work sites during construction. In 2012 through 2015, Velodyne's spinning HDL-32E sensors have been seen on mobile mapping vehicles by Nokia Here,http://photos.mercurynews.com/2015/07/28/photos-here-a-nokia-company-has- global-fleet-of-cars-for-3d-street-mapping/#1 Microsoft Bing Maps, Tencent, Baidu, and TomTom. Leading mapping providers like Topconhttps://www.topconpositioning.com/news-events/news/product-news/topcon- announces-next-generation-3-d-mobile-mapping-system and Leica Geosystems also use Velodyne's scanners for their turnkey mobile solutions. In 2016, Ford Motor Company announced that it will expand its fleet of self-driving R&D; vehicles and use Velodyne Lidar's Ultra Puck sensors. In 2017, Velodyne partnered with Renovo as Reference Lidar provider for AWare automated mobility operating system and with Mercedes-Benz for a Perception System Contract. In 2018, the company partnered with Embark, Geodetics, Voyage, Exyn Technologies, Yellowscan, Phoenix LiDAR, NAVYA, ThorDrive and Postmates. Velodyne Lidar also partnered with Nikon as a new strategic investor with an investment of $25M. == Models == {  - ! Name !! HDL-64E !! HDL-32E !! Puck !! Puck Lite !! Puck Hi-Res !! Ultra Puck !!

Hütter and his medical team transplanted bone marrow deficient in a key HIV receptor to a leukemia patient, Timothy Ray Brown,Stern.de who was also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subsequently, the patient's circulating HIV dropped to undetectable levels. The case was widely reported in the media, and Hütter was named one of the \\"Berliners of the year\\" for 2008 by the Berliner Morgenpost, a Berlin newspaper. == HIV treatment == In 2009, Hütter, Eckhard Thiel and others from the Charité Hospital in Berlin, Germany, published a report on the case in the New England Journal of Medicine. Their patient Timothy Ray Brown, a US citizen born in Seattle, Washington, and living in Berlin, had both acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and HIV. The physicians found a bone marrow donor with a CCR5-Δ32 mutation in both genomic copies of a gene encoding a cell-surface chemokine receptor called CCR5. Because \\"most of HIV strains\\" use the CCR5 receptor to enter a host cell, the mutation confers resistance to HIV infection. The patient himself was heterozygous for CCR5-Δ32. Following the transplant procedure, the patient's CD4+ T-cells circulating in the blood were homozygous for CCR5-Δ32. The macrophages in his bowel, which continued to express wildtype CCR5 (because they hadn't been replaced yet from bone marrow precursors), also had no detectable virus. After 600 days without antiretroviral drug treatment, the patient's blood, bone marrow and bowel HIV levels were below the limit of detection; the virus was thought to be present in other tissues. However, the patient actually had a brain biopsy, in addition to biopsies of his intestines, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow—basically, every part of the body that can be biopsied. All were negative for virus. There is no virus in this person's body out to two and a half years off of all anti-HIV drugs. His antibody levels—called titers—are declining just the way expected if the patient was vaccinated against HIV and then the levels of antibodies were examined. They'd be very strong in the beginning, but would weaken if they are not re-exposed to the virus. It is believed this patient has no HIV in his body and therefore there is nothing to re-expose him, so the concentration of HIV antibodies in his blood is decreasing. It is predicted that, in a couple of years, his HIV antibody test will be negative. The mortality risk associated with bone marrow transplants is thought to contraindicate the use of this experimental treatment for HIV- positive individuals without leukemia or lymphoma. Some researchers such as Edward Berger believe that resistance to CCR5 inhibition may emerge if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge (these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor, from which they become independent). Before the treatment though the patient had low levels of the CXCR4 virus but after the treatment this type of HIV could not be detected either which Hütter called \\"very surprising\\". People without CCR5 can be more sensitive to some infections such as West Nile virus. Jay Levy, one of the first researchers to isolate and describe HIV in the early 1980s, wrote an editorial accompanying Hütter's publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. Noting the reduction in detectable HIV in the patient's blood and the return of the patient's circulating CD4+ T-cell population to normal levels, with all of the cells expressing the resistant variant of CCR5, Levy cautions that calling this treatment a cure would be premature. This is because HIV is known to hide in latent form in a variety of organs not easily sampled, including the heart and brain. The high risks of a bone marrow transplant also make this treatment risky since many bone marrow patients die. And the CXCR4 virus that was detectable in the blood of the patient before the treatment \\"could eventually emerge\\". Levy does believe though that this case \\"could pave the way for innovative approaches that provide long-lasting viral control with limited toxicities for persons with HIV infection\\". As of June 4, 2010, Hütter's patient was in very good health and had been HIV- and cancer- free (combined) for two years. In the March 10, 2011, issue of the medical journal Blood, Hütter wrote, \\"it is reasonable to conclude that cure of HIV infection has been achieved in this patient.\\" Hütter concurred with this assessment. Hütter received an award on June 3, 2010, from the AIDS Policy Project, a national advocacy group focused on an AIDS cure, and San Francisco Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi on behalf of the people of San Francisco. The text read: > \\"Dr. Gero Hütter: In recognition of your historic achievement of being the > first doctor to functionally cure AIDS/HIV through an innovative procedure > that entails a remarkable example of the use of stem cell transplants.

He has been a Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since October 2008, representing the electorate of Cabramatta. He also served as mayor of Fairfield from 2004 until March 2012. ==Early life and career== Lalich was born in Egypt to refugee parents who had fled the war in Yugoslavia. His family migrated to Australia when he was three, and spent time in resettlement camps at Uranquinty and Bonegilla. They eventually settled in the Bonnyrigg area, where Lalich's father worked for the Department of the Postmaster- General and ran a farm. Lalich remained in the Bonnyrigg area, where he worked as an electrician for Prospect Electricity before his election to the City of Fairfield council as a Labor candidate in 1987. He was elected by his colleagues as mayor in 1993–94, and was a candidate for preselection for the seat of Cabramatta in 1994, losing to Reba Meagher. Lalich remained on council, was again elected mayor by his colleagues in 2002, and ran and won as the first popularly elected mayor of Fairfield in 2004. He was easily re- elected as mayor in late 2008, only weeks before his election to parliament in October 2008. ==Election to parliament== In September 2008, Reba Meagher, the embattled state Health Minister, resigned from politics after it became clear that she would likely be dumped from Cabinet in a forthcoming ministerial reshuffle. This resulted in a by-election for her seat, and Lalich, who had lost a preselection vote to her in 1994, was immediately touted as her replacement, duly winning preselection. He faced a strong challenge in the usually safe seat due to an unpopular government and a strong Liberal candidate in Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Dai Le, but withstood a 20-point swing against Labor to hold the seat for the party. Lalich was sworn in as a member of the Legislative Assembly on 18 October, and appointed to the Public Bodies Review Committee on 30 October. He also vowed to continue as Fairfield mayor in addition to his parliamentary responsibilities. ==March 2011 Election== Lalich was able to retain the seat of Cabramatta for the ALP at the March 2011 Election against Dai Le, who failed previously at the 2008 by-election. Controversy arose when leaflets were distributed during the campaign, stating Le supported her Liberal colleague Chris Spence, the Liberal candidate for The Entrance and former leader of Pauline Hanson One Nation. Both sides campaigned heavily in the local area, with the Liberal Party taking an unprecedented interest in Cabramatta. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Yugoslav emigrants to Australia Category:Yugoslav refugees Category:Egyptian emigrants to Australia Category:Australian people of Serbian descent Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Mayors of Fairfield, New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Nick Lalich"},{"id":"20227339","text":"The Red River near Menadarva Mill The Red River at Godrevy beach The Red River ()Place-names in the Standard Written Form (SWF) : List of place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel . Cornish Language Partnership. is a small river in north-west Cornwall, United Kingdom which issues into St Ives Bay at Godrevy on Cornwall's Atlantic coast.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The Red River is about long and was given its name from the mineral deposits associated with tin mining which formerly coloured its water red. The river's gradient is relatively steep; the stream falls from source to sea. ==Geography== The Red River rises from springs near Bolenowe on the Carnmenellis granite batholith, an upland plateau. The river flows north, passing through a gorge in the granite ridge west of Carn Brea. Beyond the gorge, the river passes Tuckingmill, and Tuckingmill Valley Park, once a centre of mining and associated industries. At the hamlet of Combe, the Tehidy stream joins the Red River which then turns west towards Godrevy. ==Tin streaming== The Red River's catchment area includes the major mining areas of Tuckingmill, Pool, and Camborne. Thus: > The Red River catchment has been subjected to mining and mineral working for > many centuries, particularly during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. > It has been extensively tin streamed and its water used for mineral > processing, both for use in the mineral separation processes and as a source > of power. As a result of past mining activities the river has undergone many > modifications and for significant parts of its course the river has been > diverted, canalised, and, in places, embanked. Very little, if any, of the > river can be considered to be in a truly natural condition. In The Mining Journal (1872), the author, Mr Watson, asked ″if any stream or gully in Australia, Brazil or California had proved to be so continuously rich and productive as the Red River.″ The river was fed by tributary streams that flowed from the dressing-floors and slime pits of the principal mines, and the ″squatters″ could earn £20,000 per year working on the slimy river-bed. Mr Watson remarked on the inefficiency of the mines in allowing so much tin to be lost. By 1879, Captain James of South Frances mine, estimated £30,000s worth of tin was lost by the mines. On 25 June 1879 the lease for the tenement of Rosewarne Mill was auctioned at Abraham's Hotel, Camborne. The sale included the \\"valuable\\" tin stream works\\" including a 12-inch cylinder engine, three waterwheels, stamps and all the minerals found in the mill leat and the main river within certain defined boundaries. The Magor Coombe streamworks were bought for £750 by Captain Rabling in 1879. In January 1883 The Cornishman newspaper reported that an estimated £42,000 worth of tin went down the river and many thousands of pounds yearly are made by ″the squatters″ who set up machinery and harvest the waste products of the mines. Within Tuckingmill Valley Park is a small island containing the remains of a chimney stack, brick scrubber building and collapsed flue. The buildings (circa 1905) are associated with the production of arsenic which was a valuable resource for Cornish tin and copper mines when production of the metals was declining and the mines were closing. More efficient calcining furnaces were built and the gases fed through convoluted labyrinths where they cooled and condensed on the flue walls. The walls were scraped and the deposits further refined to make 100% pure arsenic. Arsenic was used as a pesticide for the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) in the cotton fields of the United States, as well as in the paint and dye industry producing new colours such as canary yellow and emerald green. High stone-faced banks, are the remains of ten sluices which controlled the flow of water, to enable the recovery of tailings. The sluices were part of the Tolgarrick tin treatment operations which closed in 1986. Following the closure of the last mine, South Crofty, in 1998, the Red River has lost its distinctive colour, and natural ecology and biodiversity are being re-established. Tn the 2017, the Environment Agency granted permission for the new mine owner to discharge effluent from the mine to prepare for future reopening. The river gives its name to the Red River Inn public house (formerly The Pendarves Arms) in nearby Gwithian. ==Wildlife and ecology== The Red River is one of the most modified streams in the UK due to centuries of mining which has led to heavy metal contamination and the realignment of the course. The river is gradually re-establishing a more natural look as banks erode and some of the sediment deposited to form bars and small islands. The river and ponds of the Tuckingmill Valley Park provide valuable habitat within an urban area, for two nationally scarce insects; scarce blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio) and small red damselfly (Ceriagrion tenellum). The larvae of the golden-ringed dragonfly (Ceriagrion tenellum) have been found and the adults can be seen through the summer and autumn. Other dragonflies include the common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and the once rare migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) which usually fly in August and September. Both frog (Rana temporaria temporaria) and common toad (Bufo bufo) spawn are found along the edges of the ponds in the early part of the year and the otter (Lutra lutra) has returned following the improvement in water quality. The invasive plants, parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) is regularly removed by hand to prevent its spread, and the growth of Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) has been restricted by chemical treatment. ==See also== * Geology of Cornwall * The Red River by Paul Williams available from Amazon Books 2016 ==References== Red, River Category:Arsenic mines in Cornwall Category:Mining in Cornwall ","title":"Red River (Koner)"},{"id":"20227365","text":"Taltal is a Chilean commune and city in Antofagasta Province, Antofagasta Region. According to the 2012 census, the commune has a population of 11,132 and has an area of . The commune is home to Paranal Observatory and includes the northern portion of Pan de Azúcar National Park. ==Etymology == The etymological origin of the name is the indigenous word Thalthal, which means “night bird.”Diccionario Geográfico de la República de Chile (1899) página 790 ==History== The history of Taltal begins with the opening of the copper mine \\"El Cobre\\" by José Antonio Moreno in 1850 about 20 kilometers north of Taltal. This brought miners and prospectors to the area. In 1855 Moreno expanded his operations to include Taltal. The discovery of copper in 1858 on nearby Mount Cachiyuyal increased pressure on the port, which had to utilize customs officials from Copiapo. So Moreno requested official recognition of the port which was granted by decreeDecreto Supremo Nº 91 signed by Chilean President Manuel Montt Torres. on 12 July 1858. However, the real boom began in 1876 with the opening of nitrate mines, in particular potassium nitrate. In 1879, the first nitrates were shipped from the area. In 1882 a railway was completed from Cachinal de la Sierra and other nitrate mining sites. It was built by the \\"Taltal Railway Company\\", a British company, sold to private investors in 1954, and dismantled in 1970 due to the end of nitrate mining. At the peak of production in the 1930s, Taltal had a population of over 30,000 and was the third largest nitrate port in Chile. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Taltal had 11,000 inhabitants (6,182 men and 4,918 women). Of these, 9,564 (86%) lived in urban areas and 1,536 (14%) in rural areas. The population grew by 2.3% (11,148 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. ==Administration== As a commune, Taltal is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Guillermo Hidalgo Ocampo. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Taltal is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Pedro Araya (PRI) and Mr. Manuel Rojas (UDI) as part of the 4th electoral district, (together with Antofagasta, Mejillones and Sierra Gorda). The commune is represented in the Senate by Carlos Cantero Ojeda (Ind.) and José Antonio Gómez Urrutia (PRSD) as part of the 2nd senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region). ==Tourism== * Llullaillaco National Park is an area of 268,670 ha protected by the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF). It lies in the Andes at an altitude of between 3,000 and 6,700 meters, and includes the Llullaillaco Volcano (6,739 meters), Cerro de la Pena Mountain (5260 m) and Cerro Aguas Calientes Mountain (5,060 m). The park is home to vicuñas and guanacos, with the highest population density of these species in the region. The park is part of the protected area of the Montano Desert that lies in the Cordillera Domeyko the desert steppe and the Andean salt flats. * Paranal Observatory, located on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert, 110 km north of the city and administered by the European Southern Observatory.

This paintings are the remains of an extinct culture called the Chango people, who drew their experiences of hunting guanacos, sea lions and whales. It is believed that the paintings are between 500 and 1,000 years old. * Caleta Paposo () is 54 km north of Taltal. It was once a mining centre and was inhabited by the pre-Hispanic Chango people. Surrounded by pastures irrigated by moisture coming off the sea, the area has a very rich flora and fauna and was once a border between Chile and Bolivia in the nineteenth century. ==Architectural heritage== The city of Taltal contains many houses that are registered in the Inventory of Cultural Heritage Properties in Chile. Highlights include the Alhambra Theatre (1921), the Augusto Capdeville Museum (1885), the railroad houses (1886), the Plaza Hotel (1898), houses in the downtown area, the (which was completely devastated by a fire in January 2007 but is now rebuilt) and the Protestant church (1896).  Taltal wind farm  The company Enel Green Power has begun the construction of the new Taltal Wind Farm, which will be located in the commune of Taltal, Chile, approximately 1,500 kilometers north of Santiago, the Chilean capital. The project will require a total investment of $190 million US dollars and will produce a total of 99 megawatts (MW).

The channels can be formed by protein complexes that run across the membrane or by peptides. They may cross the cell membrane, connecting the cytosol, or cytoplasm, to the extracellular matrix.Roux, B., and Schulten, K. (2004). Computationals Studies of Membrane Channels. Structure 12, 1343 - 1351. Transmembrane channels are also found in the membranes of organelles including the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes.Alberts, B., Bray, D., Hopkin, K., and Johnson, A. (2010) Essential Cell Biology, 3rd ed. (New York: Garland Science) pp. 387 – 420. Transmembrane channels differ from transporters and pumps in several ways. Some channels are less selective than typical transporters and pumps, differentiating solutes primarily by size and ionic charge. Channels perform passive transport of materials also known as facilitated diffusion. Transporters can carry out either passive or active transfer of materials while pumps require energy to act.Lodish, H., Berk, A., Kaiser, C., Krieger, M., Scott, M., Bretscher, A., Ploegh, H., and Matsudaira, P. (2008) Molecular Cell Biology, 6th ed. (New York: W. H. Freeman) pp. 437 – 474. There are several modes by which membrane channels operate. The most common is the gated channel which requires a trigger, such as a change in membrane potential in voltage-gated channels, to unlock or lock the pore opening. Voltage-gated channels are critical to the production of an action potential in neurons resulting in a nerve impulse. A ligand-gated channel requires a chemical, such as a neurotransmitter, to activate the channel. Stress-gated channels require a mechanical force applied to the channel for opening. Aquaporins are dedicated channels for the movement of water across the hydrophobic interior of the cell membrane.Verkman, A. (2011) Aquaporins at a Glance. Journal of Cell Science 24, 2107 - 2112. Ion channels are a type of transmembrane channel responsible for the passive transport of positively charged ions (sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrogen and magnesium) and negatively charged ions (chloride) and, can be either gated or ligand-gated channels. One of the best studied ion channels is the potassium ion channel. The potassium ion channel can allow rapid movement of potassium ions while being selective against sodium. Using X-ray diffraction data and atomic model computations a likely structure of the channel consists of a number of protein alpha-helixes forming an hourglass shaped pore with the narrowest point halfway through the membrane's lipid bilayer. To move through the channel the potassium ions must shed their aqueous matrix and enter a selectivity filter composed of carbonyl oxygens. The potassium ions pass through one atom at a time along five different cation (positively charged ion) binding sites.Roux, B., and Schulten, K. (2004). Computationals Studies of Membrane Channels. Structure 12, 1343 - 1351. Diseases caused by ion channel malfunctions include cystic fibrosis where the channel for the chloride ion will not open or is missing in the cells of the lungs, intestine, pancreas, liver and skin. The cells can no longer regulate salt and water concentrations resulting in the symptoms typical of the disease. Additional disorders resulting from malfunctions in ion channels include forms of epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, certain types of periodic paralysis and ataxia.Celesia, G. G.

Its range appears to be limited to coastal waters off Tumbes in northern Peru, where it is found partially buried in sand or mud. The larger of the original two specimens measured 40.4 cm long and the smaller 15.7 cm. Like other round rays, the Tumbes round stingray has a rounded pectoral fin disc, slightly wider than it is long. The tail is stout, bearing a serrated stinging spine, and terminates in a rounded caudal fin. The pelvic fins have abruptly rounded tips. The teeth have narrowly oval bases and no elevated cusps. The dorsal surface is covered uniformly by dermal denticles on stellate bases, becoming larger towards the midline of the disc; the underside is smooth. There are also thorns on the dorsal surface of the disc and tail. The dorsal coloration consists of ochre vermiculations separating brownish-white oval or circular spots about the size of the eye, becoming more distinct towards the margin of the disc and on the pelvic fins. The denticles and tail spine are ochre-colored, and the underside is light tan with a dark border along the edge of the disc. The coloration, denticles and several proportional measurements distinguish the Tumbes round stingray from other Urobatis species. Due to its highly restricted distribution and shallow inshore habitat, this species merits conservation concern. Information is needed on whether this species is being affected by fisheries activities in its range. ==References== Tumbes round stingray Category:Fish of Ecuador Category:Fish of Peru Tumbes round stingray ","title":"Tumbes round stingray"},{"id":"20227449","text":"The Silesian Regional Assembly () is the regional legislature of the Voivodeship of Silesia in Poland.

He was a trusted advisor to three emperors — Emperor Suzong, Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, and Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong — but declined to formally serve in the governments of Emperors Suzong and Daizong, serving only as Emperor Dezong's chancellor. He was a highly controversial figure in historians' commentaries, as he was viewed by some historians as frivolous and eccentric, while others praised him for his genius in matters of foreign policy and military matters. == Background == Li Bi was born in 722, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an, but his ancestors claimed order from Liaodong Peninsula and further claimed ancestry from the Warring States period state Qin (the precursor to Qin Dynasty) official Li Tan () and Li Tan's son, the Zhao prime minister Li Qi (). Their traceable ancestry included officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Later Yan, Northern Wei, and Northern Zhou. Li Bi's father Li Chengxiu () was a county magistrate.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. == During Emperor Xuanzong's reign == It was said that Li Bi could read and write by age six, and that in his youth, he was known for his intelligence and dexterity. That year, when Emperor Xuanzong put out a general order requesting people to recommend those well-versed in Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, the officials all recommended those whom they knew. An eight-year-old named Yuan Chu (), a grandson of the great scholar Yuan Banqian () and a cousin to Li Bi (Yuan Chu's mother was a sister to Li Chengxiu), particularly impressed Emperor Xuanzong. When Emperor Xuanzong asked Yuan Chu whether he knew anyone else like him, Yuan Chu replied that Li Bi was one. Emperor Xuanzong thus summoned Li Bi. When Li Bi arrived, Emperor Xuanzong was playing Go with the high-level official Zhang Shuo the Duke of Yan, and Zhang, wanting to test the child, asked to make up a poem comparing Go to life and recite it. Zhang then recited the poem that he thought of on the spot, and Li Bi immediately followed with one of his own. Both Emperor Xuanzong and Zhang were amazed, and Zhang congratulated Emperor Xuanzong on finding a divine child. Emperor Xuanzong gave Li Bi an award and honored his household.New Book of Tang, vol. 139 . He also had Li Bi associate with his son Li Jun the Prince of Zhong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 218. Li Bi became learned in the Confucian classics and the histories, but was particularly well-learned in the I Ching. He was also a talented writer and wrote poems well, and he had great ambitions to assist emperors. He was honored by officials such as Zhang Jiuling, Wei Xuxin (), and Zhang Tinggui ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 130 . Zhang Jiuling, in particular, treated him as a friend notwithstanding the age and position differences. Li Bi, however, did not like to be restricted by governmental regulations, and as he grew older often journeyed among Mount Song, Mount Hua, and the Qinling Mountains, seeking out for the alchemist arts that could lead to eternal life. During the middle of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), Li Bi submitted a petition from Mount Song discussing the affairs of state. Emperor Xuanzong, remembering the meetings when he was young, summoned him to Chang'an and made Li Bi an attendant to Li Jun — whose name had been changed to Li Heng by that point and who had become crown prince. However, after Li Bi wrote some poems satirizing such powerful figures as Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, Yang became displeased and requested that Li Bi be exiled to Qichun Commandery (蘄春, in modern Huanggang, Hubei). Only after a pardon was Li Bi allowed to return to Chang'an. Thereafter, he took no governmental positions and became a hermit at Yingyang (潁陽, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). == During Emperor Suzong's reign == In 755, An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang, and by summer 756, forces of his new state of Yan reached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Li Heng, however, did not follow Emperor Xuanzong to Chengdu, but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). He summoned Li Bi to Lingwu to serve as an advisor, and Li Bi did so. It was said that they spent so much together discussing the affairs of the military and the state that they often slept in the same bedroom, just like the times when Emperor Suzong was just a prince. It was said that Emperor Suzong consulted Li Bi on every matter, including military commissions. He wanted to make Li Bi Zhongshu Ling () — the head of the legislative bureau of government () and a post considered one for a chancellor — but Li Bi declined, stating, \\"I find it much more honored that Your Imperial Majesty treats me as a guest and a friend, than as a chancellor. Why do you want me to take an inferior position?\\" Thereafter, when Emperor Suzong wanted to make his son Li Tan the Prince of Jianning, who was known for his military talent, the supreme commander of the armed forces, Li Bi pointed out that awkwardness would then come to the issue of imperial succession given that Li Tan was younger than his brother Li Chu the Prince of Guangping. Emperor Suzong agreed and gave the title of supreme commander to Li Chu instead. Li Tan, however, did not resent Li Bi for this and thanked Li Bi for his suggestion. It was said that at that time, the soldiers, whenever they saw Emperor Suzong and Li Bi surveying the troops together, the soldiers would comment: \\"The one who wears the yellow robe is the holy one [(i.e., emperor)]. The one who wears the white robe is the mystical one.\\" Emperor Suzong, hearing this, told Li Bi to put on the purple robe of a high-level official, and Li Bi reluctantly agreed. Subsequently, Emperor Suzong gave him the title of imperial advisor (侍謀軍國, Shimou Junguo) as well as Li Chu's secretary general. From that point on, he and Li Chu would rotate to be on duty at the army headquarters, ready to act on the generals' reports; when Li Chu was attending to Emperor Suzong, Li Bi would be at headquarters, and when Li Bi was attending to Emperor Suzong, Li Chu would be at headquarters. Emperor Suzong also gave the keys to the makeshift palace to Li Chu and Li Bi. Whenever there were generals' requests that needed immediate action, Li Chu and Li Bi would act on them, and whenever further approval from Emperor Suzong were necessary, they would take them to the palace and submit to Emperor Suzong through a slot in the door. In fall 756, at Li Bi's suggestion, Emperor Suzong moved his headquarters from Lingwu to Pengyuan (彭原, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), to better coordinate the troops coming to his aid. Also in fall 756, however, Li Bi and Li Tan both offended Emperor Suzong's favorite concubine Consort Zhang. Emperor Suzong had been considering creating Consort Zhang empress, but, as Li Bi advised him that it was inappropriate to do so before he had a chance to seek the approval of Emperor Xuanzong (whom he honored as Taishang Huang (retired emperor)), he decided to wait. Meanwhile, however, around this time Emperor Xuanzong sent Consort Zhang a saddle with seven kinds of jewels studded on it as a gift. Li Bi opined that in the difficult times, it would be inappropriate for her to use such a luxurious item, and therefore suggested instead that the jewels be removed and rewarded to those soldiers with accomplishments. Emperor Suzong agreed — and Li Tan publicly praised the decision, causing Consort Zhang to thereafter bear much resentment toward Li Bi and Li Tan. Meanwhile, in winter 756, after the chancellor Fang Guan failed to recapture Chang'an and suffered heavy losses, Emperor Suzong initially wanted to punish Fang, but at Li Bi's intercession, did not do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 219. Meanwhile, Li Bi also suggested to Emperor Suzong his plan of destroying Yan: * That the major generals Li Guangbi and Guo Ziyi be sent to the region north of the Yellow River to engage the Yan generals Shi Siming, Zhang Zhongzhi, so that Shi and Zhang would be unable to move south. * That meanwhile, Emperor Suzong himself not attack, but continue to stay close to Chang'an, so that the Yan generals An Shouzhong () and Tian Qianzhen (), then at Chang'an, would be unable to move east. * That Li Guangbi and Guo then launch periodic attacks against Yan troops, such that the Yan forces would be forced to constantly move and become worn out. * That in spring 757, Li Tan be sent to join Li Guangbi to capture Fanyang, and then the Tang armies could then converge toward An Lushan's capital at Luoyang and attack it. Emperor Suzong was happy about the plan. Meanwhile, however, Consort Zhang entered into an alliance with Emperor Suzong's trusted eunuch Li Fuguo, and together the two became powerful inside the palace, purportedly carrying out much misdeeds. Li Tan considered trying to kill them, and despite Li Bi's advice to the contrary, Li Tan did not stop his planning. In 757, Consort Zhang and Li Fuguo struck first, accusing Li Tan of plotting to kill Li Chu, and Emperor Suzong, believing their accusation, forced Li Tan to commit suicide. This caused Li Chu and Li Bi to be fearful of her as well, although at Li Bi's urging, Li Chu did not himself try to kill them. Around this time, Emperor Suzong also consulted Li Bi on what his thoughts were on how to reward the generals after Yan's destruction, and Li Bi advocated that the generals be given fiefdoms so that they would want to pass them to their descendants. (Emperor Suzong initially agreed, but the plan was never actually implemented in Emperor Suzong's reign or after.) Later in spring 757, Emperor Suzong advanced to Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Aid troops from Anxi Circuit (安西, headquartered in modern Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, as well as Xiyu states, were arriving, and Li Bi, as he had previously suggested, advocated that the troops be sent to attack Fanyang first, to root out Yan's power base, before attempts should be made to recapture Chang'an and Luoyang. This time, however, Emperor Suzong overruled him, stating that he wanted to capture Chang'an as soon as possible to welcome Emperor Xuanzong back to the capital, despite Li Bi's objections that doing so would prolong the rebellion in that the Anxi and Xiyu troops could not bear the heat and would be worn out after recapturing Chang'an and Luoyang. (As it turned out, whether it was due to Emperor Suzong's decision to overrule Li Bi or not, the rebellion would not be completely put down until 763.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222.) In summer 757, with major aid from Huige, Tang forces commanded by Li Chu recaptured Chang'an. Emperor Suzong entered Chang'an and sent messengers to bring Li Bi to Chang'an. Upon Li Bi's arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Suzong informed Li Bi that he had sent messengers to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that he return to Chang'an and offering the throne back to Emperor Xuanzong. Li Bi pointed out that this would cause Emperor Xuanzong to be apprehensive as to Emperor Suzong's sincerity, and as Li Bi predicted, Emperor Xuanzong initially not only declined but further requested to remain in Jiannan Circuit (劍南, headquartered in modern Chengdu). Only after Emperor Suzong, at Li Bi's suggestion, had the government officials make a joint submission to Emperor Xuanzong no longer mentioning the return of the throne, did Emperor Xuanzong agree to depart Jiannan to return to Chang'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 220. Thereafter, Li Bi requested to resign his positions and return to the mountains as a hermit. Emperor Suzong was surprised and stated to Li Bi that this was time for him to be rewarded. Li Bi stated that if he stayed, he would die because people (apparently referring to Consort Zhang and Li Fuguo, although his biography in the New Book of Tang also referred to the chancellor Cui Yuan) would be jealous of him for five reasons — that he had too long of an association with Emperor Suzong; that Emperor Suzong trusted him too much; that Emperor Suzong treated him too well; that he had too much accomplishments; and that their friendship was too legendary. Emperor Suzong initially guessed that the real reason for his wanting to leave was Emperor Suzong's refusal to follow his advice on attacking Fanyang first, but Li Bi then stated that it was because of Li Tan's death. He argued to Emperor Suzong that Li Tan was innocent, and that by this point, there would surely be false accusations against Li Chu as well, and that he should not listen to them. With Li Bi insisting on resigning, Emperor Suzong allowed him to return to hermit life at Mount Heng, and had the local government there build him a hermitage and supply him with supplies due a high-level official (of the third rank). While he was at his hermitage, he got into the habit of using pine branches to make back supports, and on one occasion, when he saw one in the shape of a dragon, he sent it to Emperor Suzong as a gift. == During Emperor Daizong's reign == Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by Li Chu (as Emperor Daizong), whose name had been changed to Li Yu by this point. Li Bi remained a hermit at Mount Heng, but later, Emperor Daizong sent eunuchs to Mount Heng to summon him to Chang'an. When Li Bi arrived, Emperor Daizong built him a study next to the palace, and, while he gave Li Bi a purple robe to wear again, he and Li Bi often met in civilian clothes, and he consulted Li Bi on major decisions. He also had the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en build Li Bi a vacation home. He wanted to make Li Bi a chancellor, but Li Bi declined. At one Duanwu Festival, however, when officials were offering gifts to Emperor Daizong, Emperor Daizong demanded a gift from Li Bi — himself. He wanted Li Bi, who had been a vegetarian and celibate and also abstained from alcohol, to marry, observe a normal diet, and become an official. Under persuasion from Emperor Daizong, Li Bi agreed and married a Lady Lu, a niece of the deceased general Li Wei (). Emperor Daizong further bestowed him a mansion and but continued to have him live part of the time in the palace. In 768, after consulting with Li Bi, he posthumously honored Li Tan an emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. In 770, Emperor Daizong, in conjunction with the chancellor Yuan Zai, killed Yu. Thereafter, Yuan became jealous of Li Bi's close association with the emperor and accused Li Bi of having been Yu's associate. Emperor Daizong, not wanting to be in a confrontation with Yuan, sent Li Bi to Jiangxi Circuit (江西, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) to serve as the secretary to Jiangxi's governor Wei Shaoyou (). After Yuan was executed in 777 for corruption, Emperor Daizong recalled Li Bi to the capital. However, soon, the new chancellor Chang Gun, also jealous of Li Bi, requested to have Li Bi sent out to be a prefectural prefect — arguing that if Li Bi were to become a chancellor in the future, he should have administrative experience. Emperor Daizong agreed, and in 779 sent Li Bi out to be the prefect of Li Prefecture (澧州, in modern Changde, Hunan), as well as serving as the commander of the prefectural militia of two neighboring prefectures.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225. == During Emperor Dezong's reign ==  Prior to chancellorship  In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Li Bi had previously taught Emperor Dezong, who was then the Prince of Fengjie, when Emperor Suzong was at Lingwu. However, Emperor Dezong did not recall Li Bi initially. By 784, when rebellions by Zhu Ci and Li Huaiguang forced Emperor Dezong to flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), Li Bi was serving as the prefect of Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). Emperor Dezong summoned Li Bi; Li Bi and Du Ya (), the prefect of neighboring Mu Prefecture (睦州, also in modern Hangzhou), thus reported to Liang Prefecture. After Zhu's rebellion was destroyed later in the year, allowing Emperor Dezong to return to Chang'an, Emperor Dezong made Li Bi Zuo Sanqi Changshi (), a high level consultant at the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng). It was said that other officials and the public were all piqued and ready to see what Li Bi would advise the emperor about. At that time, Emperor Dezong was concerned that Li Huaiguang, who was then controlling the region of Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), would continue to create problems for the imperial government, but Li Bi pointed out that Li Huaiguang himself lacked powerful messages to keep his subordinates obedient to him, apparently alleviating some of Emperor Dezong's concerns. Li Bi further spoke on behalf of Han Huang, the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), whom Emperor Dezong had been suspicious of, and subsequently, Emperor Dezong sent messengers, including Han Huang's son Han Gao (), to Zhenhai to show that he had no further apprehensions of Han Huang. Han Huang, in gratitude, sent the imperial government a large supply of rice, allowing the Chang'an region to recover from a major famine.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. In 785, after Zhang Quan (), the military governor of Shanguo Circuit (陝虢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), was assassinated by his subordinate Daxi Baohui () and Daxi took over the circuit, Emperor Dezong, concerned that Daxi Baohui would join Li Huaiguang, sent Li Bi to Shanguo to try to calm the situation. Li Bi, initially claiming that he was only there to make sure that the food supplies would continue to flow through the circuit to Chang'an, initially promised that he would recommend Daxi to succeed Zhang. However, after he settled the situation down, he secretly persuaded Daxi that the only way for him to save himself was to flee. Daxi did so, and Li Bi took over the circuit. Emperor Dezong gave him the title of defender (防禦使, Fangyushi) rather than military governor. In 786, Li Bi built a new road to allow supply shipment over land, to avoid the rapids where the Wei River flowed into the Yellow River. In 787, when soldiers sent from Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) to join the defense against Tufan in the west suddenly mutinied and tried to head back to Huaixi, pillaging on the way, Li Bi intercepted them and crushed them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.  Chancellorship  Later in 787, Emperor Dezong summoned Li Bi back to Chang'an and made him Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. He also gave Li Bi the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto, and created him the Marquess of Ye. At their first meeting with Li Bi as chancellor, and with other chancellors Li Sheng, Ma Sui, and Liu Hun present as well, Emperor Dezong wanted Li Bi to promise not to carry past grudges against those who had harmed him, and Li Bi, after stating that he had no real enemies and that such persons who had been jealous of him as Li Fuguo and Yuan Zai had already died, in turn wanted Emperor Dezong to promise the safety of both Li Sheng and Ma Sui — both of whom had been instrumental in ending the rebellions and restoring his rule, against any false accusations that might be made against them. Emperor Dezong agreed. Li Bi immediately presented to Emperor Dezong the proposal to reverse cuts in the ranks of the governmental officials that fellow chancellor Zhang Yanshang had carried out, pointing out that the reduced ranks were unable to carry out the affairs of government. He also refused Emperor Dezong's attempts to divide governmental responsibilities between chancellors — pointing out that chancellors should oversee all government affairs. Emperor Dezong agreed to both of his proposals. Meanwhile, Zhang, who had a grudge against Li Shuming () the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), discovered that Li Shuming's son Li Shēng (李昇, note different tone than the famous general), along with several other young officials, were often secretly visiting Emperor Dezong's aunt Princess Gao, whose daughter was the wife and crown princess of Emperor Dezong's son and crown prince Li Song. He informed this to Emperor Dezong, intimating that Li Shēng was having an affair with Princess Gao. When Emperor Dezong asked Li Bi to investigate this, however, Li Bi correctly guessed that it was Zhang who informed Emperor Dezong of this and suggested no investigation, pointing out that Zhang's accusations also appeared to be intended to endanger Li Song. Emperor Dezong agreed, and thereafter moved Li Shēng to the position of head of Li Song's household, away from Princess Gao. Meanwhile, with the public owing much tax debt, Li Bi suggested the granting of a general tax amnesty if the people would admit to what they owed and paid a fraction thereof. Emperor Dezong agreed, and it was said that the amnesty helped the treasury to recover much of its losses. He also required the emissaries from foreign states — who had stayed in Chang'an ever since An Lushan's rebellion but who continued to receive stipends from the Tang government — to make an election whether to return home or to become Tang citizens and not receive the diplomat stipends. The emissaries all decided to stay despite the lack of stipends; they largely became military officers and soldiers, strengthening the imperial guard corps while reducing public expense. Emperor Dezong and Li Bi discussed the return to the corvée conscription system — which had been used early in Tang history but had been abolished by the time of Emperor Xuanzong. Li Bi, who had initially advocated for its return, by that point was pointing out that the treasury could not afford paying the expenses of such a system. He instead proposed using various measures, including the offers of free land, to encourage soldiers to settle on the borders with Tufan and become farmer- soldiers. Emperor Dezong agreed, and with the offers of free land, it was said that some 50% to 60% of soldiers sent to the Tufan frontier decided to stay in the region. After Liu was removed in late 787, Li Bi was effectively the sole chancellor, with no other civilian officials carrying chancellor title. (Ma, Li Shèng, and Hun Jian carried chancellor titles but were generals.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. By late 787, the matters with Princess Guo flared up, as she continued her affairs with Li Shēng and the other young officers, but was exposed in her affairs by other nobles. She was also accused of using witchcraft against Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong, in anger, imprisoned her, and further suspected Li Song of being complicit. Li Song, in fear, divorced Princess Guo's daughter Crown Princess Xiao, but Emperor Dezong continued to be incensed, considering deposing Li Song and replacing Li Song with another son Li Yi () the Prince of Shu — who was actually his biological nephew, whom he adopted after Li Yi's biological father, his brother Li Biao () the Prince of Zheng, died early. Li Bi earnestly protested Li Song's innocence, and at one point appeared to be at the risk of being the object of Emperor Dezong's wrath himself. Eventually, Emperor Dezong's wrath subsided, particularly after Li Bi pointed out the example of what happened to Li Tan, and Li Song was spared. Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong complained that he had insufficient funds for use in the palace. Li Bi instituted a new system where a part of the tax revenues were designated for the emperor's personal use, to try to stop Emperor Dezong from personally extracting tributes from local governments — as that was causing the local officials to in turn extract them from the people, above and beyond the regular tax burden. However, even with Li Bi's new budgeting, Emperor Dezong continued to demand tributes from local governments and further instructed them not to inform Li Bi. When Li Bi found out, he was upset, but chose not to try to stop Emperor Dezong again. Also in late 787, Li Bi finally proposed his plan for counterattacks against Tufan — enter alliances with Huige, Nanzhao, and the Abbasid Caliphate, with the alliance with Huige being the most urgent. However, Emperor Dezong hated the Huige, ever since several of his attendants were tortured and killed by Huige's Maoyu Khan Yaoluoge Yidijian () in 762 while he was still a prince, and therefore refused. Only after repeated attempts by Li Bi that that grudge should not be borne against the current khan, the Hegu Khan Yaoluoge Dunmohe () as well as repeated analyses of how crucial the Huige alliance would be did Emperor Dezong agree — particularly after Li Bi, who had strong friendships with both Yaoluoge Dunmohe and the Huige chancellor Baipodi (), extracted promises from Yaoluoge Dunmohe to submit to Tang as a subject, as a matter of formality. Emperor Dezong was pleased, and subsequently, the treaty was cemented with the betrothal of Emperor Dezong's daughter Princess Xian'an to Yaoluoge Dunmohe. Meanwhile, Li Bi requested to have another chancellor named, but Emperor Dezong declined, pointing out that he could not find another person with the same talent. By 789, Li Bi was seriously ill, and only then did Emperor Dezong agree to name more chancellors. At Li Bi's recommendation, Emperor Dezong made Dong Jin and Dou Can chancellors as well. Li Bi died soon thereafter. == Historians' views of Li Bi == The historians' views on Li Bi were highly mixed. The editors of the Old Book of Tang did not view Li Bi's chancellorship highly, believing that he lacked contributions while serving as chancellor and criticizing him for his Taoist beliefs and frequent discussions of Taoism, although it referred to Li Bi as highly intelligent with good ideas. The lead editor, the Later Jin historian Liu Xu, commented: The lead editor of the New Book of Tang, the Song Dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu, was more complimentary, although he was also critical of Li Bi, believing that he became chancellor in Emperor Dezong's reign only because Emperor Dezong became more superstitious as his reign went on: Contrary to the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, which had relatively skimpy records of Li Bi's deeds, Sima Guang, also of Song Dynasty, included extensive records of Li Bi's contributions in his Zizhi Tongjian — but personally wrote only a short comment about Li Bi, stating: The commentator to the Zizhi Tongjian, Hu Sanxing, toward the end of Song Dynasty, was in turn very complimentary of Li Bi, believing that his dabbling in Taoism was a way to avoid getting in danger, while making exceptional contributions during the reigns of three emperors. His view was shared by the modern historian Bo Yang, who even ranked Li Bi to be the most talented Chinese chancellor since Wang Meng. Bo was particularly complimentary of Li Bi's suggestions that led to the gradual alleviation of Tufan attacks against Tang.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 56 [789]. == In Popular Culture == Li Bi is one of the main characters of the 2019 Chinese historical drama The Longest Day in Chang'an. In the series he is featured as the Chief of Chang'an's \\"Peacekeeper Corps\\" and wears a Taoist Robe. Li Bi holds close relationships with members of the Tang Dynasty's royal family, in particular he is a trusted confidant of the Crown Prince. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 130. * New Book of Tang, vol. 139. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 218, 219, 220, 224, 225, 231, 232, 233.

Washington was among thirteen frigates authorized to be constructed for the new Continental Navy by an Act of Congress of 13 December 1775, and among four to be built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The act called for all thirteen ships to be ready for sea by March 1776. Official designs were drawn up for the ships, but credit for their design is a matter of dispute, with Joshua Humphreys, John Wharton, and Nathaniel Falconer all being possible designers.Chapelle, pp. 56-59. In any event, plans had been drawn up and copies made of them by 2 February 1776,Chapelle, p. 59 too late for the ships to be completed by March 1776. The design of the 32-gun frigate USS Randolph, also built at Philadelphia under the same construction program, probably to the same design as Washington - the two ships may even have been sisters - provides insight into the design of Washington, which has not survived. Randolphs design appears to have been inspired by British 36-gun frigates of the period. This resulted in a ship with a similar beam and depth of hold to the 36-gun British ships, but longer than the 36-gun frigates of the time, and thus oversized for her rate - much in the way the French Navy built oversized ships at that time. Randolph was planned to be somewhat more lightly built than the British frigates that inspired her design, with a broader frame spacing and a much more raked bow, but with less freeboard.Chapelle, pp. 64-65, 74, and 557 The thirteen ships were named on 6 June 1776. Washington, built by Manuel Eyre, Jehu Eyre, and Benjamin Eyre, was launched on 2 August 1776. She was not yet completed when British forces advancing on Philadelphia in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War threatened to capture her, and she was scuttled incomplete on 2 November 1777 to prevent capture. The portion of her hull remaining above water was burned in May 1778, while her bottom was salvaged and sold in Philadelphia.Chapelle, pp. 74 and 78 ==NotesReferences== *Chapelle, Howard I.

In the recruitment industry, expertise finding is the problem of searching for employable candidates with certain required skills set. In other words, it is the challenge of linking humans to expertise areas, and as such is a sub-problem of expertise retrieval (the other problem being expertise profiling). == Importance of expertise == It can be argued that human expertise is more valuable than capital, means of production or intellectual property. Contrary to expertise, all other aspects of capitalism are now relatively generic: access to capital is global, as is access to means of production for many areas of manufacturing. Intellectual property can be similarly licensed. Furthermore, expertise finding is also a key aspect of institutional memory, as without its experts an institution is effectively decapitated. However, finding and \\"licensing\\" expertise, the key to the effective use of these resources, remain much harder, starting with the very first step: finding expertise that you can trust. Until very recently, finding expertise required a mix of individual, social and collaborative practices, a haphazard process at best. Mostly, it involved contacting individuals one trusts and asking them for referrals, while hoping that one's judgment about those individuals is justified and that their answers are thoughtful. In the last fifteen years, a class of knowledge management software has emerged to facilitate and improve the quality of expertise finding, termed \\"expertise locating systems\\". These software range from social networking systems to knowledge bases. Some software, like those in the social networking realm, rely on users to connect each other, thus using social filtering to act as \\"recommender systems\\". At the other end of the spectrum are specialized knowledge bases that rely on experts to populate a specialized type of database with their self-determined areas of expertise and contributions, and do not rely on user recommendations. Hybrids that feature expert-populated content in conjunction with user recommendations also exist, and are arguably more valuable for doing so. Still other expertise knowledge bases rely strictly on external manifestations of expertise, herein termed \\"gated objects\\", e.g., citation impacts for scientific papers or data mining approaches wherein many of the work products of an expert are collated. Such systems are more likely to be free of user-introduced biases (e.g., ResearchScorecard ), though the use of computational methods can introduce other biases. There are also hybrid approaches which use user-generated data (e.g., member profiles), community-based signals (e.g., recommendations and skill endorsements), and personalized signals (e.g., social connection between searcher and results). Examples of the systems outlined above are listed in Table 1. Table 1: A classification of expertise location systems {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Type ! Application domain ! Data source ! Examples -  Social networking  Professional networking  User-generated and community-generated  * LinkedIn * ResearchGate * XING * Academia.edu -  Scientific literature  Identifying publications with strongest research impact  Third-party generated  * Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters) -  Scientific literature  Expertise search  Software  * Arnetminer -  Knowledge base  Private expertise database  User-Generated  * MITRE Expert Finder (MITRE Corporation) * MIT ExpertFinder (ref. 3) * Decisiv Search Matters & Expertise (Recommind, Inc.) * ProFinda (ProFinda Ltd) * Skillhive (Intunex) * Tacit Software (Oracle Corporation) * GuruScan (GuruScan Social Expert Guide) -  Knowledge base  Publicly accessible expertise database  User-generated  * Expertise Finder * Community of Science Expertise * ResearcherID (Thomson Reuters) -  Knowledge base  Private expertise database  Third party-generated  * MITRE Expert Finder (MITRE Corporation) * MIT ExpertFinder (ref. 3) * MindServer Expertise (Recommind, Inc.) * Tacit Software -  Knowledge base  Publicly accessible expertise database  Third party-generated  * ResearchScorecard (ResearchScorecard Inc.) * authoratory.com * BiomedExperts (Collexis Holdings Inc.) * KnowledgeMesh (Hershey Center for Applied Research) * Community Academic Profiles (Stanford School of Medicine) * ResearchCrossroads.org (Innolyst, Inc.) -  Blog search engines   Third party-generated  * Technorati } == Technical problems == A number of interesting problems follow from the use of expertise finding systems: * The matching of questions from non-expert to the database of existing expertise is inherently difficult, especially when the database does not store the requisite expertise. This problem grows even more acute with increasing ignorance on the part of the non-expert due to typical search problems involving use of keywords to search unstructured data that are not semantically normalized, as well as variability in how well an expert has set up their descriptive content pages. Improved question matching is one reason why third-party semantically normalized systems such as ResearchScorecard and BiomedExperts should be able to provide better answers to queries from non- expert users. * Avoiding expert-fatigue due to too many questions/requests from users of the system (ref. 1). * Finding ways to avoid \\"gaming\\" of the system to reap unjustified expertise credibility. * Infer expertise on implicit skills. Since users typically do not declare all of the skills they have, it is important to infer their implicit skills that are highly related their explicit ones. The inference step can significantly improve recall in expertise finding. == Expertise ranking == Means of classifying and ranking expertise (and therefore experts) become essential if the number of experts returned by a query is greater than a handful. This raises the following social problems associated with such systems: * How can expertise be assessed objectively? Is that even possible? * What are the consequences of relying on unstructured social assessments of expertise, such as user recommendations? * How does one distinguish authoritativeness as a proxy metric of expertise from simple popularity, which is often a function of one's ability to express oneself coupled with a good social sense? * What are the potential consequences of the social or professional stigma associated with the use of an authority ranking, such as used in Technorati and ResearchScorecard)? * How to make expertise ranking personalized to each individual searcher? This is particularly important for recruiting purpose since given the same skills, recruiters from different companies, industries, locations might have different preferences for candidates and their varying areas of expertise. == Sources of data for assessing expertise == Many types of data sources have been used to infer expertise. They can be broadly categorized based on whether they measure \\"raw\\" contributions provided by the expert, or whether some sort of filter is applied to these contributions. Unfiltered data sources that have been used to assess expertise, in no particular ranking order: * self-reported expertise on networking platforms * expertise sharing through platforms * user recommendations * help desk tickets: what the problem was and who fixed it * e-mail traffic between users * documents, whether private or on the web, particularly publications * user-maintained web pages * reports (technical, marketing, etc.) Filtered data sources, that is, contributions that require approval by third parties (grant committees, referees, patent office, etc.) are particularly valuable for measuring expertise in a way that minimizes biases that follow from popularity or other social factors: * patents, particularly if issued * scientific publications * issued grants (failed grant proposals are rarely know beyond the authors) * clinical trials * product launches * pharmaceutical drugs == Approaches for creating expertise content == * Manual, either by experts themselves (e.g., Skillhive) or by a curator (Expertise Finder) * Automated, e.g., using software agents (e.g., MIT's ExpertFinder) or a combination of agents and human curation (e.g., ResearchScorecard ) * In industrial expertise search engines (e.g., LinkedIn), there are many signals coming into the ranking functions, such as, user- generated content (e.g., profiles), community-generated content (e.g., recommendations and skills endorsements) and personalized signals (e.g., social connections). Moreover, user queries might contain many other aspects rather required expertise, such as, locations, industries or companies. Thus, traditional information retrieval features like text matching are also important. Learning to rank is typically used to combine all of these signals together into a ranking function == Collaborator Discovery == In academia, a related problem is collaborator discovery, where the goal is to suggest suitable collaborators to a researcher. While expertise finding is an asynchronous problem (employer looking for employee), collaborator discovery can be distinguished from expertise finding by helping establishing more symmetric relationships (collaborations). Also, while in expertise finding the task often can be clearly characterized, this is not the case in academic research, where future goals are more fuzzy. == References  Further reading == # Ackerman, Mark and McDonald, David (1998) \\"Just Talk to Me: A Field Study of Expertise Location\\" Proceedings of the 1998 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work. # Hughes, Gareth and Crowder, Richard (2003) \\"Experiences in designing highly adaptable expertise finder systems\\" Proceedings of the DETC Conference 2003. # Maybury, M., D'Amore, R., House, D.

Keith was born on May 29, 1920 in Stewart Creek, West Virginia to Howard, a steelworker, and Mary Rawson Keith, who worked in a bakery. He received a bachelor's degree from Salem College in North Carolina in 1943, earned a master's degree in chemistry from Indiana University in 1945 and was awarded a doctorate from DePaul University in 1947.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Carl D. Keith, a Father of the Catalytic Converter, Dies at 88\\", November 14, 2008. Accessed November 15, 2008. From 1943 to 1957, Keith was a chemist at Sinclair Oil. He later was hired by Engelhard Industries. From 1976 until his retirement from Engelhard in 1985, Keith was an executive vice president, president and finally chairman of the company. ==Catalytic converter== The 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act required significant reductions in hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. The converters available at the time were oxidation catalysts, which could handle hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide, but were ineffective in reducing nitrogen oxides. Car manufacturers and catalyst companies were trying to develop a multiple step process that would address hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in one process while reducing nitrogen oxides in another. The three-way catalyst developed by Keith and chemical engineer John J. Mooney with their team at Englehard allowed all three exhaust pollutants to be remediated using a single catalyst bed. Their solution to addressing the variations in air / fuel mixtures was to combine rare-earth oxides and base metal oxide components in the catalyst together with Platinum and Rhodium in a ceramic honeycomb with tiny passages coated with the catalytic material. This design ensured that the oxygen needed in the reactions was absorbed up when it was in excess and released when it was needed, allowing all three pollutants to be removed in a single catalytic component. The three-way catalytic converter reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen, oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water.An AIChE Mini History of John Mooney , New Jersey Institute of Technology. Accessed November 15, 2008. The initial catalytic converters were installed in cars in the 1975 model year. In 1976, the three-way catalyst was introduced, which, after updates, has been able to eliminate 97% of tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions, 96% of carbon monoxide and 90% of nitrogen oxides produced in automobile engines and those used in light trucks and sport utility vehicles. A statement cited by The New York Times from the United States Environmental Protection Agency showed that cars today produce 98% less nitrogen oxide emissions than cars from the 1970s, and \\"the three-way catalytic converter is the greatest contributor to that reduction\\". ==Awards== In 2001, Keith and Mooney received the Walter Ahlstrom Prize, awarded in conjunction with the Finnish Academies of Technology, for their work in inventing and commercializing the three-way catalytic converter. Estimates were that by the time the award was received, the converters developed by Keith were installed in 80% of new cars manufactured worldwide and had prevented 56 million tons of hydrocarbons, 118 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 464 billion tons of carbon monoxide from being emitted as pollution in the 25 years since their introduction.Staff. \\"Engelhard Scientists Awarded Walter Ahlstrom Prize for Invention of Catalytic Converter Technology\\", Business Wire, November 15, 2001.

The current principal is Dr. Fazal Dad, replacing Dr Thomas Moore, who departed from the college in September 2018. ==History== Blackburn College started as Blackburn Technical College, which was established in 1888 by public subscription. It originally specialised in engineering and textiles, later introducing tertiary courses, such as A–levels in 1984. ==Locations== The main campus is located close to Blackburn Town Centre, and consists of several buildings. ==Development== In the 2000s, four phases of construction were announced, as the college aimed to modernise its campus, and increase the range of degrees offered. The first was St Paul's Centre, with IT and sixth form facilities, which was completed in 2007 at a cost of £8.8 million, and was opened in September 2007 by John Sentamu. Construction of this building began in July 2006. Phase 2, the University Centre, was completed in 2009, costing £14 million, and was opened in September 2009, by Labour MP Jack Straw and then Blackburn Rovers manager Sam Allardyce. Phase 3 of the re development is the largest building in the entire programme, the £18.3 million Beacon Centre, opposite the Construction Centre on St. Paul's Street, which was completed in the end of 2011, and was opened in February 2012, by chair of governors Sir Bill Taylor and The X Factor finalist Amelia Lily. It includes teaching spaces, for art and photography studios and IT suites, as well as a male and female multi faith prayer room. In July 2012, demolition of the 1960s Feilden Street building, which housed the colleges Sixth Form until the St Paul's Centre in 2007, began (with a little help from Mark Felix), making room for Phase 4, as well as Phase 5. In September 2013, Phase 4 of the re development, the STEM(MM) (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (Media and Music)) building opened, the Sir Bill Taylor Futures Centre, which is named after the long running governor, and is placed next to the University Centre. In September 2014, the college's new Regional Automotive Hub opened, and was officially opened in August 2014 by Carl Fogarty, and has had developed input by representatives from both Nissan and Škoda. The Regional Automotive Hub is Phase 5 of the colleges re development, and possibly one of the last buildings to be built, along with a new leisure centre, which was opened in March 2015 by Rebecca Adlington. Construction began in November 2013, and was completed in August 2014. It was originally set to open in September 2014, a month after the opening of the Regional Automotive Hub. It is called Blackburn Sports & Leisure Centre, and includes a six lane pool, learner pool, two sports halls, gym, aerobics studio, wet/dry changing facilities, as well as a new coach drop off point. It replaces the 1980s Waves Water Fun Centre, opened by Princess Anne, which closed in February 2015, and was demolished during March 2016. ==Reports== In January 2008, the college was rated as outstanding in an Ofsted report, which took place in November 2007. In September 2008, it was one of five colleges in the North West to be awarded Beacon status by the Quality Improvement Agency. The College currently has a status of requires improvement with Ofsted and is no longer a Beacon status QIA college. The recent monitoring visit of the College continues to grade the College as requires improvement. ==See also== * Sir Robert Howson Pickard FRS, head of chemistry and principal 1900 to 1920, later Vice-Chancellor of the University of London from 1937 to 1939. ==References * Centenary Booklet This Centenary Booklet commemorates 100 years of service by Blackburn College to the Community of Blackburn, Darwen and East Lancashire.

The climate of Los Angeles is a year-round mild-to-hot and mostly dry climate for the LA metropolitan area in California. The climate is classified as a Mediterranean climate, which is a type of dry subtropical climate. It is characterized by seasonal changes in rainfall—with a dry summer and a winter rainy season. Under the modified Köppen climate classification, the coastal areas are classified as Csb, and the inland areas as Csa. The Los Angeles area contains microclimates, where daytime temperatures can vary as much as between inland areas such as the San Fernando Valley or San Gabriel Valley, and the coastal Los Angeles Basin. ==ClassificationsTemperatures and seasons== The primary weather station for Los Angeles is located near downtown at the University of Southern California campus, and this article refers primarily to climate data generated by this station as representative of the Los Angeles metropolitan area as a whole. Los Angeles is a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa), with hot, dry summers, and cooler wetter winters. While the typical dry-summer and wet-winter pattern typical of most Mediterranean climates is part of the climate of Los Angeles, precipitation annually is lower than in many typical Mediterranean climates. The summer dry season normally runs from May through October, when clear skies, hot temperatures, and very little change in sensible weather occur from day to day. Average high temperatures are in the lower 80's F (26-28 C) with overnight lows in the lower 60's F (15-17 C). During this season, there is essentially no rainfall, and both July and August average less than 0.05 of an inch (1.27 mm) of monthly precipitation. The winter wet season normally runs from November through April. Precipitation episodes in Los Angeles, with a few notable exceptions, are largely caused by extratropical disturbances approaching California from the west or northwest during the winter season. The normal seasonal rainfall measured at downtown Los Angeles is 14.77 inches, of which 92% falls between November 1 and April 30. While there is a great increase in rainfall in the winter months, the winter months in Los Angeles are still frequently sunny and pleasant with mild temperatures. The average highs range from the upper 60's F to 70 F (17-21 C) with cooler overnight lows in the upper 40's and lower 50's F (8-12 C). Summer monsoon thunderstorms moving westward across Greater Los Angeles, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and intense lightning. Summers are warm to hot, and nearly completely dry. The summer temperature pattern usually begins in late June or early July, and lasts through September or October, although it may start as early as late May. In August, the average high/low at the University of Southern California downtown campus are and . The same figures at the LAX airport, approximately to the southwest and near the ocean, are and . However, temperatures across the region often exceed during the summer. This happens when an atmospheric high-pressure area becomes dominant over the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah (a frequent occurrence), and the resulting offshore flow of the atmospheric air mass shuts off the normal coastal sea breeze in Los Angeles. July, August and September are the hottest months, with September holding the all-time record of . Skies are nearly constantly sunny, unless interrupted in late spring and early summer by the June Gloom pattern, which is unpredictable year-to-year. The North American Monsoon can bring occasional thunderstorms and high humidity to Los Angeles in the summer and early fall. Typical June Gloom conditions in late morning at Seal Beach, June 2013. Winter Winters are mild, with average high temperatures at the Downtown/USC weather station of and lows of , with occasional heavy rainfall. Temperatures across the coastal basin rarely drop below , although light frost does occasionally form during cooler nights, at least in areas removed from the direct influence of the coastal air (approximately inland from the beach). The last severe cold outbreak in the Los Angeles area occurred in December 1990, when temperatures dropped below freezing across a major portion of the coastal plain, and into the low to mid 20s F over inland valleys. Temperatures stayed below freezing for up to eight hours at some valley locations, resulting in significant damage to plants and commercial agriculture. In the winter months, high pressure systems over the deserts often bring Santa Ana winds, resulting in dry, and dusty days. On rare occasion, temperatures can reach into the range during Santa Ana Winds even in December or January. Sunny skies characteristically dominate the weather pattern in the winter season, mixed in with the occasional rain producing weather system. Spring and Autumn Spring and autumn hardly exist as such in this climate. Summer temperature patterns of highs and lows usually persist until early November. Likewise, the \\"winter-season\\" temperature pattern of highs and lows may last through April or May, periodically interrupted by hot Santa Ana wind events for up to a week at a time. The rainy season always ends by mid-May. June is normally a transitional month of less-volatile temperatures between , with increased cloudy days and the disappearance of the Santa Ana winds. ==Rainfall== A very clear evening view of Mount Lee and the Hollywood Sign from the Griffith Observatory lawn, one day after a rain. Most rain occurs during the winter and early to mid spring, typical of a Mediterranean climate. However, the amount received is usually lower than in other Mediterranean climates. The first sporadic rainfall of the rainy season usually occurs in October or November, with heavy rain becoming more common late November through early April. Usually the Pineapple Express storms from December to March. February, on average, is the wettest month. The rains then taper off in April or by May, usually see only two to three light rain showers. However, the timing and volume of rains in the winter is far from predictable. After a significant rain, the region's air is cleared of the usual atmospheric haze as well as man-made smog, giving exceptionally clear views across the giant metropolis. Rain clouds breaking up over South Los Angeles. Most cold fronts and depressions spun off by the polar low, the strong winter seasonal low-pressure area in the Gulf of Alaska, fail to carry significant precipitable moisture as far south as Los Angeles, resulting in the region's relatively low average rainfall amount of even in normal years. However, a \\"normal\\" year rarely occurs, since rainfall in Los Angeles is subject to the position and strength of the jet stream, and the strength of the Gulf of Alaska low. Some years, a well-developed series of cold fronts moves into the area with relatively short separation between each, bringing intermittently rainy periods to Los Angeles for several weeks at a time. If this pattern persists in a rainy season, significantly above-average precipitation will be received. Other years, especially in the drought years of 2012–2016, a blocking region of atmospheric high pressure over the eastern Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, diverts the jet stream and its flow of cold fronts far to the north through Canada and down into the U.S. Midwest, leaving the U.S. west coast and especially Los Angeles under warm and dry conditions for weeks to months at a time. Because the rainy season begins in late fall and ends in early to mid spring, precipitation is measured using the water year instead of the calendar year, to give an accurate picture of each rainy season's precipitation amounts. Each water year begins October 1 and ends the following September 30, during the driest part of the year. Sometimes rainfall can occur in the summer from westward-straying monsoon thunderstorms, but this is unusual. Even less common is rain from remnants of dissipating eastern Pacific hurricanes. Los Angeles averages only of precipitation per year, and this is lower at the coast and higher in the mountains and foothill cities. Rain is typically brought with when High Pressure systems in the summer which move east in a clockwise motion across the western United States bringing monsoonal moisture to the area. This will usually occur during the summer months (usually in July–September). Snow is extremely rare in the Greater Los Angeles area and basin, but the nearby San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains typically receive a heavy amount of snow every winter season. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was on January 15, 1932.Burt, Christopher. Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book. New York: Norton, 2004: 100. Los Angeles Airport has an estimated pan-evaporation rate of per year.Water Policy: What about All Those Swimming Pools in Los Angeles? By Peter Gleick, Pacific Institute, December 3, 2013 El Niño–Southern Oscillation Historically-speaking, the warm-phase of an El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime typically coincides with above average precipitation across Southern California. The above average sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean are largely responsible for this as the ocean acts as a rich moisture source for tropical moisture to advect towards the North American continent in atmospheric river events. Prior to the strong El Nino of 2015–2016, the previous two strong El Niño events in 1982–83 and 1997–98 coincided with well-above average precipitation across Southern California. While some measurements suggest the 2015-2016 El Niño was the strongest on record since 1950, Southern California received below average precipitation contrary to what the Climate Prediction Center predicted leading up to the winter months. While scientists have long agreed the intensity and timing of the winter precipitation pattern in Los Angeles is more complex than just analyzing the warm/cool phase of ENSO, the fact that Los Angeles received below average precipitation during the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016 will be the subject of numerous research studies among climate scientists. ==Surrounding areas in the region== Coastal Basin The Los Angeles Basin, composed of the coastal plain surrounded by mountains, is generally the coolest in summer and mildest in winter. Overall, it receives less rainfall than the surrounding valleys and mountains. LAX LAX airport and its surroundings (Westchester and El Segundo, as well as Santa Monica, Venice, and the immediately surrounding neighborhoods) are generally the coolest part of the region in the summer, as they receive a near-constant sea breeze. Santa Monica and its environs may be cooler than areas only further inland. Under the Köppen climate classification LAX has a semi-arid climate due to its modest winter rainfall and mild mean temperatures. For monthly statistics, see Climate of Los Angeles#Temperatures and seasons Santa Monica Santa Monica has mean temperatures low enough for its precipitation numbers to still retain a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). Culver City, Inglewood and Palms Area Culver City, Inglewood, Palms, and surrounding areas are only a few miles inland from Santa Monica and the beach, but reach temperatures up to 10 degrees (F) warmer on average in the summer. Culver City has a semi-arid climate that is still significantly moderated by the Pacific trade winds keeping averages mild compared to areas farther inland. Long Beach Long Beach, located in the coastal basin about to the south of downtown Los Angeles, has a coastally-influenced climate, but is not as cool as Santa Monica, or the Westside, or the South Bay during the summer. Long Beach sits on a south-facing section of coast, and does not receive as much sea breeze cooling from the prevailing westerly/south-westerly winds (as these winds may pass over the Palos Verdes Peninsula, San Pedro, and the twin ports first). Long Beach's high temperature can compete with those of downtown Los Angeles. Locations further north in Long Beach, which stretches over northward from the water, can be considerably warmer than Long Beach's coast and airport weather station. San Fernando Valley The San Fernando Valley is known for significantly higher temperatures than the coastal basin. Canoga Park and Woodland Hills, in the south-west end of the valley, typically record the highest temperatures. The all-time high of nearly rivals the record high temperatures of Phoenix, Arizona () and Palm Springs (). The city of Burbank, at the eastern end of the Valley, is also known for being significantly hotter than downtown Los Angeles, which is only to the south. During winter both the Canoga Park and Burbank weather stations are significantly wetter than some coastal stations and thus retain hot-summer mediterranean climates (csa). By comparison, Canoga Park has quite cool summer nights, in contrast to many other interior Southern California areas. Orange County North/Central Orange County The climate of Santa Ana, the county seat of Orange County, as well as Anaheim, both in north-central Orange County, are quite similar, and typical of locations on the coastal plain inland from the beach. Whilst Santa Ana sits firmly on the border between the semi-arid and the hot-summer mediterranean climate, Anaheim is firmly a semi-arid climate with very low precipitation for the Los Angeles metropolitan area. ==Extreme weather== Records In downtown Los Angeles, weather records began on July 1, 1877. The highest temperature recorded in downtown Los Angeles was on September 27, 2010. The lowest temperature was on January 7, 1913 and on January 4, 1949.http://climexp.knmi.nl/data/mgdcnUSC00045115.dat The wettest “rain year” from July to the following June was 1883/1884 with , and the driest 2006/2007 with .Los Angeles and San Diego rainfall The greatest rainfall in one month was in December 1889, which also had the most days – twenty – receiving at least of rain. The greatest rainfall in 24 hours was on March 2, 1938. At the Los Angeles International Airport, the highest recorded temperature was on September 26, 1963. The lowest temperature was on January 4, 1949. The wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1947 with . The greatest rainfall in one month was in February 1998. The greatest rainfall in 24 hours was on November 21, 1967. In Long Beach, the highest recorded temperature was on October 16, 1958, and October 15, 1961, and again on September 27, 2010. The lowest temperature was on January 20, 1922. The wettest year was 1978 with . The driest year was 2002 with . The greatest rainfall in one month was in January 1969, including a record 24-hour rainfall of on January 20 that month. In San Fernando Valley, the highest recorded temperature was on August 24, 1985. The lowest temperature was on February 6, 1989.https://web.archive.org/web/20130902181245/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/041484.pdf Snowfall inside the city of Los Angeles is rare. The record snowfall occurred on January 19, 1949, when of snow fell inside city limits, however Burbank reported 4.7 inches. Since official records were first kept in 1877, the downtown Los Angeles weather station observed measurable snowfall three times, in 1882, 1932, and 1949. . Santa Ana Winds The Santa Ana winds in Southern California sweep from the deserts and across the Los Angeles metropolitan area pushing smoke from wildfires far out into the Pacific Ocean. The Santa Ana winds are strong, extremely dry offshore winds that characteristically sweep across Southern California and northern Baja California during late September into early May. They range from hot to cold, depending on the prevailing temperatures in the source region, the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Nevertheless, the winds are notorious for causing hot, dry weather due to compressional heating of the lower atmosphere. Notable Santa Ana windstorms happen several times a year between fall and spring. Once every several years a strong windstorm causes significant damage, toppling or uprooting large old trees and damaging structures across the region. Heavy Rains, Landslides, and Debris Flows While overall precipitation is low, the rain that does fall occasionally comes in brief heavy storms. Combined with steep mountain slopes and recent burn areas from wildfires, these heavy rains often cause landslides and debris flows in foothill areas, damaging structures and blocking roads. Thunderstorms, Lightning, and Tornadoes Textbook cumulonimbus-formed summer thunderstorms are fairly rare in Los Angeles, because the atmosphere over the coastal basin is generally too stable and dry, especially during summer, to allow the strong vertical development necessary for mature cumulonimbus clouds. Full, mature thunderstorms can develop in the surrounding deserts and mountains during the summer North American Monsoon, but rarely over the Los Angeles metropolitan region and coastal basin but the moisture is coming off on Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California. This atmospheric stability is largely due to the cool and persistent marine layer, which is fueled by the constant influx of cold Pacific water via the California Current. Summer thunderstorms that do manage to form on the coastal basin are typically associated with the North American Monsoon and/or tropical cyclones, or downburst winds then weak tornadoes. which can bring enough tropical heat and moisture to overcome the cool marine layer, destabilizing the atmosphere. Though still relatively rare, thunderstorms most often occur during warm southerly-flow winter rain storms. These warm storms are different from the typical northwesterly cold fronts that bring most of the region's winter precipitation. Atmospheric instability caused by these warm winter storm systems allows the formation of small, weak, isolated thunderstorms, which tend to move across the area quickly, producing a few rumbles of thunder, and soon dissipate back into the larger rain storm system. Occasionally, these bring impressive displays of lightning, hail, and damaging winds to small localities within the region. Small, weak, isolated tornadoes can occur during these events, but are exceedingly rare. Likewise, weak-to- moderate-strength waterspouts may form over the ocean (typically off the stretch of coast between Long Beach and Huntington Beach) during warm winter storms, but again, this is very rare. ==Sea temperatures== The average annual temperature of the sea is , from in January to in August.\\"Pacific Ocean Temperatures on California Coast\\" – beachcalifornia.com { +Average sea temperature: - !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !Year - style=\\"background: #CCFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #CCFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFCC66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFCC66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFCC66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFCC66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF66; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF99; color: black;\\" style=\\"background: #FFFF66; color: black;\\" } ==Ultraviolet index== { +Ultraviolet index Average UV index Los Angeles, USA – weather-atlas.com - !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !Year - f7e400;color:#000000;\\"3 f7e400;color:#000000;\\"4 f85900;color:#000000;\\"6 d8001d;color:#000000;\\"8 d8001d;color:#000000;\\"9 d8001d;color:#000000;\\"10 6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 d8001d;color:#000000;\\" 10 d8001d;color:#000000;\\" 8 f85900;color:#000000;\\"6 f7e400;color:#000000;\\"4 f7e400;color:#000000;\\"3 f85900;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"6.8 } ==NotesReferences== Category:Environment of Los Angeles Los Angeles Category:Los Angeles metropolitan area Category:Greater Los Angeles Category:Climate of California Category:Southern California ","title":"Climate of Los Angeles"},{"id":"20228046","text":"Blackburn College may refer to: * Blackburn College (Blackburn with Darwen), United Kingdom * Blackburn College (Illinois), United States ","title":"Blackburn College"},{"id":"20228090","text":"Dimitrije Vukčević studied Nuclear Physics at the University of Belgrade before embarking on a career in commerce.

He was a close friend and correspondent of poet John Keats, whose letters to Reynolds constitute a significant body of Keats' poetic thought.E-notes on 19th century literary criticism; includes image Reynolds was also the brother-in-law of the writer and humorist Thomas Hood, who was married to his sister Jane. ==Early life== Reynolds was born in Shrewsbury to George Reynolds, teacher at Shrewsbury School and Charlotte Cox Reynolds. His mother was related to the Hamilton family, from which Reynolds received his middle name, which included the Gothic writer William Thomas Beckford. Reynolds attended Shrewsbury School, then enrolled at St Paul's School in London,I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge 1995) p. 788 when the family moved in 1806, completing formal education in 1810. ==Early career== He took a junior clerkship in an insurance office, the Amicable Society for Perpetual Assurance, working there at least until 1816; and from 1818 to 1820, he worked in Essex Street for Francis Fladgate, a solicitor. Meanwhile, he pursued his self-education by reading widely in classical and English literature and also began writing poetry. He was encouraged in his literary interests by his friend John F M Dovaston, a former student of Reynolds's father. ==Literary works== Reynolds's first published poem, \\"Ode to Friendship\\" appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1812. He was a prolific journalist and reviewer, and published collections of poems and a diverse array of articles. He received favourable notice from a number of critics and poets, including Byron, whose work Reynolds had closely imitated. Later he published The Eden of Imagination, imitating Wordsworth, who had also encouraged him. Early in his poetic career, John Clare claimed to be a huge admirer of Reynolds's work, and the two met and socialised with other contributors to the London Magazine. ==John Keats== His friend Leigh Hunt supported his writing and introduced him to another young poet Hunt greatly admired, the then unknown John Keats. Together with Percy Bysshe Shelley, the two were featured by Hunt in his 1816 article on a “new school of poets”, called ‘’Young Poetry’’.D Hay, Young Romantics (London 2011) p. 98 Keats and Reynolds became friends, encouraging and challenging each other in their quest for literary recognition. Keats was in 1819 to praise Reynolds’ Wordsworth parody, ‘’Peter Bell: A Lyrical Ballad’’;D Hay, Young Romantics (London 2011) p. 175 and it is in witty parody that Reynolds is now considered to have been at his poetic best.I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge 1995) p. 788 ==Personal life== In 1822, he married Eliza Drewe, which led to a friendship and literary collaboration with her brother-in-law, Thomas Hood. Together the two wrote several comic and satirical pieces, the most popular being Odes and Addresses to Great People in 1825. Tragedy struck in 1835 when his ten-year-old daughter Lucy died. He was bankrupt in 1838 but continued earning a small income writing. In 1847 he moved to the Isle of Wight as assistant clerk in a county court. Reynolds became depressed and started drinking heavily, although he was not without friends and admirers to the end. In 1852, Reynolds was found dead in the bedroom of his father's apartment in Newport, three months after his birthday. ==See also== *Zetosophian society ==ReferencesSources== * Barnard, John, Keats’s ‘Robin Hood’, John Hamilton Reynolds, and the ‘Old Poets’.

Isolda Izvitskaya was born in the small town of Dzerzhinsk, Russia. Her father was a chemist, her mother a teacher. Upon leaving high school she enrolled at VGIK (the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography). She was given small parts in several movies while still a student. In 1955 Izvitskaya was chosen for the lead in The Forty-First, a film based on a short story by Boris Lavrenyov. The film was very successful all over the country and in 1957 it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival where it was very well received. A new café in Paris was named after her. At home Izvitskaya was made a member of the Association for Cultural Relations with Latin American countries; this gave her the opportunity to travel outside of the USSR. Izvitskaya starred in several more movies; however, none of them achieved the success of The Forty- First. She made several more attempts to work in films but parts were getting smaller and scarcer, and she became depressed. In 1971 her husband, the actor Eduard Bredun, left her. She had a nervous breakdown and locked herself in her apartment in Moscow. She was found dead in her home, which was empty of any food. Her husband insisted that the obituary state \\"poisoning with an unknown substance\\" as the cause of death but according to the BBC Russian Service she died of cold and starvation. ==Filmography== {  - !

His pregnant step-sister Kayavarnam (Viji Chandrasekhar) approaches him with a request that he should not contest the upcoming election for Village Chief, as her husband wants to contest. Rajamanickam relents without thoughts, and his sister goes happy. Meanwhile, leaders of 8 villages gather with Rajamanickam, and convince him to contest, as the Village Chief post will be contested by many people with wrong intentions if Rajamanickam doesn't contest. Rajamanickam agrees with the villagers, and asks his brother- in-law to withdraw. His brother-in-law vehemently refuses and the election heavily contested. Rajamanickam wins with a high vote difference and his brother-in-law hangs himself. Kayavaram portrays the suicide as heart attack, and promises revenge on Rajamanickam, effectlively severing their relationship. In 2010, Vetrivel (Sasi Kumar) is a organic-fertiliser vendor, who lives in a nearby village with his parents (Ilavarasu and Renuka) and brother Saravanan (Ananth Nag). Saravanan falls in love with his classmate Subha (Varsha), the only daughter of Rajamanickam. Meanwhile, Vetrilvel develops a liking for an agriculture researcher Janani (Miya). Vetrivel urges his father to approach Rajamanickam with a marriage proposal between Saravanan and Subha for which Rajamanickam opposes citing caste differences. Vetrivel and Saravanan plan to kidnap Subha during a temple festival but the plan fails as they accidentally kidnap another girl Latha (Nikhila Vimal) by mistake. Latha is engaged to Arul (Rajesh), son of Kayavarnam and her wedding was supposed to take place in a week. Vetrivel realizes his mistake and rushes back to the village to drop off Latha but her father commits suicide before her arrival thinking that Latha eloped with someone. She understands that it was Kayavarnam who behaved very rude towards Latha’s father which made him to end his life. Vetrivel marries Latha as she is helpless now. Vetrivel’s parents accept Latha understanding her situation. Janani although disappointed, understands Vetrivel’s situation and accepts his decision. Meanwhile, Rajamanickam plans to get his daughter Subha married to his relative but Vetrivel interferes and cancels the wedding talks. Finally, Rajamanickam decides to get Subha married to Arul with the hope of ending his long dispute with Kayavarnam. The wedding is arranged and Rajamanickam drops off Subha in Kayavarnam’s house fearing Vetrival’s intervention again. But Rajamanickam finds out that Kayavarnam has plans to ditch Subha after wedding as a means of revenge on Rajamanickam. Rajamanickam understands his mistake and meets Vetrivel and agrees for Subha's wedding with Saravanan. On his way back, Rajamanickam is kidnapped by Kayavarnam. Meanwhile, Arul informs Subha that he does not want to marry her without her consent. Arul asks Subha to inform Saravanan about her whereabouts so that Saravanan can come and rescue her.

Many of the provisions of the constitution of India were drawn from their Irish counterpart, the Constitution of Ireland. There are also regular governmental visits. Indo- Irish relations were also strengthened by people like of Pandit Nehru, Éamon de Valera, Rabindranath Tagore, W B Yeats, James Joyce, Sister Nivedita and Annie Besant. ==Emerging relations== During the struggles for freedom from colonial rule, Indian and Irish \\"nationalist movements were linked by a history of rebellion against British rule.\\" Studies have often compared to the two independence struggles.In addition to the Ireland and India, one such study (T.G.

Both countries held economic, political, and strategically important ties to the British empire. In both cases, the independent struggles led to other movements within the British empire for independence (while even other European empires like Angola were motivated by moves such as India in defence against European imperialism). A sixteenth century proverb said \\"he who would win England, must with Ireland begin;\\" this was matched by Lord Curzon's \\"As long as we rule India we are the greatest power in the world. If we lose it we shall drop straight away to a third rate power.\\" Lord Salisbury continued, perhaps prophetically, that \\"Ireland must be kept like India by persuasion if not by force.\\" The aim to progress Irish Catholics and Indian Muslims and Hindus served to promote the cultural nationalisms and autonomous demands of both nations. A significant number of Irish people joined the British civil service and the army regiment during the nineteenth century. The Irish civil servants included Sir Michael Francis O'Dwyer and General Reginald Dyer who provided distinguished service during the British Rule in India. Additionally, Irish missionaries, educationalists, medical and engineering service professionals were also posted in India during this period. ==Formal relations== Mutual recognition occurred in 1947, upon Indian independence, while diplomatic exchange opened later. India established an embassy in Ireland in 1951, while Ireland did the same in 1964.

In this the families of Indians and NRIs were tied with Ahakista and County Cork. An elegant memorial in the village stands as a testimony to these ties; while the opening of an Éamon de Valera Marg in the Indian capital also fostered these ties. ==Irish philanthropy== Some €5m was said to be being spent in India each year. A substantial proportion of the funding was said to be channelled through some of the large Irish NGOs, including Trócaire, Goal and Concern, and agencies that augment the Irish Aid funds from their own resources to implement large-scale programmes where they focus, such as Odisha and West Bengal. Further portions of the funds were granted to a second category of Irish and international NGOs to fund stand-alone projects and programmes through the Civil Society Fund. An increasing level of resources was also earmarked by the Irish Government for supporting the work of indigenous civil society within the country. The Irish embassy was also said to be pursuing a range of initiatives and strategies to ensure that resources produced maximum outcomes in terms of efforts to reduce poverty in some of the poorest parts of India. Amongst the highlighted social issued in India, one NGO, using Irish Aid funds, developed wells at girls’ schools; this supported the twin aims of providing clean water and promoting education for the girl-child. ==Economic relations== Total trade between the two countries went from €363.5 million in 2005 to €447.3 million in 2007.

Last accessed on 21 November 2007. His superiors approved this plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of \\"Tomasz Serafiński\\". On 19 September 1940, he deliberately went out during a łapanka in Warsaw, and was caught by the Germans along with other civilians and sent to Auschwitz. He was the only known person ever to volunteer to be imprisoned in Auschwitz. ==Forming ZOW in Auschwitz== In the camp Pilecki was known as Tomasz Serafiński (Prison Number 4859) and began the work of organising the Związek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW). ZOW would become the Auschwitz branch of Armia Krajowa and its aims were to improve inmate morale, provide news from outside, distribute extra food and clothing, and set up intelligence networks. ZOW was organized in a cell network of \\"Fives\\", whereby each five agents knew nothing about their comrads. The first \\"Five\\" was formed out of Pilecki's TAP members, various captured soldiers of the Polish army. It included: Dr. Władysław Dering - number 1723, Lieutenant- Colonel Władysław Surmacki - number 2795, Jerzy Hlebowicz - the false name of Captain Jerzy de Virion - number 3507, Eugeniusz Obojski - number 194 and Roman Zagner - number unknown. This group was nicknamed the \\"High Five\\" of ZOW. Its commander was Lieutenant-Colonel Władysław Surmacki.Adam Cyra, Ochotnik do Auschwitz - Witold Pilecki 1901–1948 [Volunteer for Auschwitz], Oświęcim 2000. By 1941 ZOW had grown substantially with \\"High Five\\" creating numerous sub-groups. Despite being an arm of the Polish resistance, membership was not limited to Poles, though Jewish members had a much lower life expectancy since the Germans prioritized exterminating Jews over Polish prisoners. Notable members of ZOW included the famous Polish sculptor Xawery Dunikowski and ski champion Bronisław Czech. ZOW members worked in the camp's SS administration office (Mrs. Rachwalowa, Capt. Rodziewicz, Mr. Olszowka, Mr. Jakubski, Mr. Miciukiewicz), the [magazines] (Mr. Czardybun), and the Sonderkommando, which burned human corpses (Mr. Szloma Dragon and Mr. Henryk Mendelbaum). The organisation had its own system of enforcing order (with a secret criminal court), as well as supply lines to the outside. Thanks to civilians living nearby, the organisation regularly received medical supplies. Inmates even constructed a radio receiver and hid it in the camp hospital. Many smaller and non-Polish underground organisations at Auschwitz eventually merged with ZOW. In the autumn of 1941, Colonel Jan Karcz was transferred to the newly created Birkenau death camp, where he proceeded to organise more ZOW structures. By spring of 1942, the organization had over 1,000 members, including women and people of other nationalities, at most sub-camps. Meanwhile, the Gestapo redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, and from late 1942 succeeded in killing many of them. ==Intelligence== From October 1940, ZOW sent numerous reports about the camp and its means of genocide to Polish resistance's Home Army Headquarters in Warsaw. ZOW's first report reached the Polish resistance in November 1940. A shortwave transmitter hidden in Block 11 also sent information directly to the Polish government-in- exile in London.Rubeigh James Minney. I shall fear no evil: the story of Dr. Alina Brewda. Kimber, 1966. p. 152. Beginning March 1941, Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the government in exile and onwards to the British government and other Allied nations. These reports were the first about the Holocaust and a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Nonetheless, those reports were discarded as \\"too extreme\\" by Allied intelligence chiefs for much of the war. ==Unrealized plans for an uprising== Pilecki planned for the liberation of the camp, hoping that the Allies would drop arms or troops into Auschwitz (such as the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, based in Britain), or that the Home Army could organize an assault by land. Pilecki's agents trained meticulously for their chance to seize the camp from their guards at the hint of Allied relief. Nevertheless, by 1943 Pilecki had realized no possibility of rescue existed from outside the camp. Deciding to break out of the camp, and hoping to personally convince the Home Army that a rescue attempt was a valid option, when he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut the phone line and escaped on the night of 26–27 April 1943, taking along documents stolen from the Germans. In the event of capture, they were prepared to swallow cyanide. After several days, with the help of local civilians, they contacted a Home Army unit. Pilecki submitted another detailed report on conditions at Auschwitz which was forwarded to London, but the British authorities refused air support for an operation to help the inmates escape. An air raid was considered too risky, and Home Army reports on Nazi atrocities at Auschwitz were deemed to be gross exaggerations. In turn, the Home Army decided that it wasn't able to storm the camp by itself. In October 1944 ZOW aided the Jewish Sonderkommando revolt at the camp (7 October 1944), providing the explosives for the uprising. ==Post- War Communist Poland== On 8 May 1947, Pilecki was arrested by the Polish Ministry of Public Security. He was accused of illegal border crossing, use of forged documents, not enlisting with the military, carrying illegal arms, espionage and working for \\"foreign imperialism,\\" and preparing the assassination of several officials. On 25 May 1948, Pilecki was executed at the Warsaw Mokotów Prison. Until 1989, information on his exploits and fate was suppressed by the Polish communist regime. ==NotesBibliography== *E.

He was part of the New Zealand team that toured England in 1986, but never played a Test or ODI. Barrett's first-class debut came for Worcestershire against Cambridge University in June 1985; in a drawn match in which little play was possible, he took the single wicket of Shaun Gorman and did not bat. He only ever made one further first-team appearance for the county, when he took 0-43 in eight overs and scored 5 not out against Gloucestershire in a John Player League match at Moreton-in-Marsh near the end of the season. Returning to New Zealand, he appeared three times for Auckland in the 1985-86 Shell Trophy, collecting five wickets in his first game against Canterbury; he then played several times for New Zealand Young Cricketers against their touring Australian counterparts, making five Youth Test and two Youth ODI appearances, although without any startling success. Back in England for 1986, he was unable to break into the Worcestershire first team, but in July and August he turned out a number of times for the touring New Zealanders, though without gaining any international honours or indeed more than three wickets in any innings. He also accompanied his country to the Netherlands for two minor games. Barrett moved from Auckland to Northern Districts for the 1986-87 season, and in a Shell Cup game against Otago in late December 1986 recorded by far his best innings figures in any top-class match, claiming 6-12 from ten overs. This was the first (and, as of 2008, remains the only) time that a Northern Districts player had taken six wickets in a List A innings. However, it was not quite enough: Otago won the match by one wicket. More home Youth internationals against the Australians followed later that season, although again without any eye-catching figures. He played on for Northern Districts for a couple more seasons, several times taking four wickets in a first-class innings but never managing to go one better. His career-best innings return in the longer game was 4-32, achieved against his old club of Auckland in February 1989, although his accomplishment was somewhat overshadowed by the 18-year-old Chris Cairns' maiden first-class century, rather eclipsing his previous personal best of 32! Barrett played only one match in the 1989-90 season, and his career ended unsuccessfully with no wickets against Wellington. ==See also== * List of Auckland representative cricketers ==ReferencesCategory:New Zealand cricketers Category:Auckland cricketers Category:Northern Districts cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:1966 births Category:Living people ","title":"Brian Barrett"},{"id":"20228558","text":"Martha Diaz is a Colombian-American community organizer, media producer, and social entrepreneur who is best known as the founder of the H2O International Film Festival.

The band was founded by Andre Serafini, Russell Mofsky and Addison Burns. Quit has released one studio album and been on numerous compilations and one DVD compilation. Quit released Earlier Thoughts in 1990 when most of the members were 18 and 19 years old. Quit has played shows with Green Day, Helmet, and Fugazi. Quit has recorded over four full-length albums of material. ==History== Quit was part of the late 1980s to mid 1990s Miami music scene and local punk music scene. Band members hung out at skate ramps, surfed, and went to local shows and house parties mainly in one southern part of Miami. Quit was formed in the summer of 1988, when Andre Serafini and Russell Mofsky wanted to start a band. Andre played in a band, Chocolate Grasshopper, and Russell was playing with metal gods Cynic. They knew Addison Burns from the local skate scene and asked him to join. Omar Cuellar joined in on bass guitar. After a few months, Tony Rocha replaced Cuellar on bass, and Quit's first performance was on Labor Day weekend in 1988 for the Rock-A-Thon. Quit has had four full-time members since 1989: Andre Serafini on drums, Russell Mofsky on lead guitar, Addison Burns on lead vocals/rhythm guitar, and Tony Rocha on bass. Songs were written by band members, and they would work on the arrangements together. Quit released its first album, Earlier Thoughts, on Esync Records. Quit re-released Earlier Thoughts in 1996 on Rojo Records with two bonus tracks recorded live on the air from WLRN's Off the Beaten Path, an overnight punk radio program. Quit played consistently from 1988-1996. There were some unfortunate events that occurred with Quit that affected the band's future. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew destroyed much of the warehouse that Quit used to rehearse, store their equipment and merchandise. In 1993 Addison fell off the roof of his house and broke his wrist. He was unable to play guitar for a year. In 1993, Quit recorded material for a new studio album but it did not materialize. Quit opened for Green Day during their Kerplunk tour. Additional members that have played in Quit are from bands such as Cell 63, Fay Wray (Rob Coe), Vacant Andys and King Friday. ==Earlier Thoughts== The album Earlier Thoughts was produced by Ralph Cavallaro while he was attending the University of Miami. He produced and managed Quit beginning as a student project. The executive producer was Rat Bastard (Frank Falestra). 2,000 units were released, including 500 cassette tapes, 500 compact discs and 100 vinyl LPs. Many of the vinyl LPs were damaged during the hurricane. Quit was one of the local Miami punk bands to release their album on compact disc. ==1990-1993== Quit continued to play shows and tour after Earlier Thoughts was released. In 1992 Quit recorded songs for a new studio album, Grazing Day. The album was not released. ==After 1996== Quit toured across the U.S. for two weeks in 1999. In the summer of 2002, Quit played a couple of reunion shows in Miami. In April 2015 Quit announced reunion shows. In July 2015, Quit performed at three concerts in Florida. Cities included Tampa, Gainesville, and Miami. This was the first time in 25 years that Quit performed live with the four members that recorded Earlier Thoughts. Quit is currently working on new material. ==Logo== The Quit logo has been well received since the band started using it in 1988. The logo was designed by Nancy Carlson who also contributed to the art layout on the Earlier Thoughts album. The design is similar to the Stüssy skate clothing line that was popular in the late 1980s and earlier 1990s. ==Relevant projects== Band members are active or have played in numerous bands including The Cold Ones, Adventures in Tourism, The Enablers, Fay Wray, and King Friday. Addison currently plays with Chris Wollard from Hot Water Music in Chris Wollard and the Ship Thieves. Russell formed and leads Gold Dust Lounge. ==Demos== *\\"Gettin' On Off It\\" 1988 — self-released ==Albums== *Earlier Thoughts 1990 - ESYNC OCULAR INTERCHANGE *Earlier Thoughts 1996 - Rojo Records (re-remixed re-release of the 1990 record.

It was established in 1923 during the time of the Weimar Republic and lasted until the first years of the Third Reich. This organization was inspired on the figure of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of Prussia, held in reverence by many Germans of the time. The Bund Königin Luise had also a children branch known as Kinderkreis (Children Circle).Liederbuch für den Kinderkreis: Das Kornblümchen Hg. von der Bundesleitung des Bundes Königin Luise, Halle a.d.S. 1933 The Queen Louise League as an organization had cultic overtonesPhilipp Demandt, Luisenkult 2007 built around the veneration of the former Prussian queen as a role model for all German women. She became idealized for her feminine virtues, her determination and her love for her country, as well as for her beauty and the fact that Napoleon, portrayed as an \\"enemy of everything German\\", hated her.Johannes Thiele, Geliebte Luise. Königin von Preußen. Ihr Leben in Bildern. Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung Berlin 2003, The league's ideals were distilled into a booklet named ABC für unsere Arbeit (ABC for our Work) which every member had to know by heart.Philipp Demandt, Luisenkult 2007 Like many of the emergent nationalistic movements of the time, this organization was highly structured, with local branches all over Germany. ==History== The Queen Louise League was politically very close to far-right German parties of the time, like the German National People's Party (DNVP) and also Der Stahlhelm organization from its establishment. Many wives Der Stahlhelm members belonged to the Queen Louise League and they were, like their husbands, strongly opposed to democracyConan Fisher, The Rise of National Socialism and the Working Classes in Weimar, Berghahn Books, Providence/Oxford 1996 and in favor of German re-armament. After the Machtergreifung, or takeover of the government by Adolf Hitler, the Queen Louise League was initially welcomed by the Nazi party as an ally. There were strong bonds between both movements owing to their common extremely conservative ideology and solid German nationalism.Geraldine Horan, Mothers, Warriors, Guardians of the Soul - 2003 Campaigning along with the brownshirts for a \\"Greater Germany\\" with expanded borders and \\"freedom from weight of the reparations\\", the League's members had taken active part in parades and events organized by the Nazis even before their accession to power. The Queen Louise League shared as well with the Reichskolonialbund the demand for the return of the former German colonies. Despite its ideological affinity with most of the Third Reich's nationalistic ideals, the Queen Louise League was disbanded all the same by the Nazi government in 1934.Conan Fisher, The Rise of National Socialism and the Working Classes in Weimar, Berghahn Books, Providence/Oxford 1996 The reason was the difference in local practices, be it at the Gau or national level, which didn't match those wished by the Nazi leadership of the country.Jill Stephenson, The Nazi Organisation of Women, London 1981 Following its dissolution the members and departments of the Königin-Luise-Bund were integrated into the corresponding branches for women and children of the Nazi Party, like the NS-Frauenschaft (Nazi Women's League), Bund Deutscher Mädel (League of German Girls) and its children section into the National Socialist Schoolchildren's League (NSS) or the Kinderschar of the Nazi Women's League. ==See also== *Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Queen Louise) *Gleichschaltung *NS-Frauenschaft *Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM) == References == (partly) *Bund Königin Luise, 10 Jahre Freiheitskampf, 1923-1933, Vaterländischer Verlag, Halle a.d.Saale.

It became the state's largest wind facility when the first phase was completed in 2009. The electricity is being sold to the Southern California Public Power Authority. ==Project details== The project was developed and financed in two phases by First Wind. Construction began in November 2008. The first phase had a posted capacity of 204 MW with 97 wind turbines, including 58 Clipper Liberty 2.5-MW wind turbines and 39 GE Energy 1.5-MW turbines. It went online in November 2009 and supported more than 300 development and construction jobs. First Wind spent about US$30 million with Utah-based businesses developing and building the first phase of the project. Another $50 million was spent statewide on items such as wages and taxes. A second phase of the project began in July 2010 and foundations were poured in October. The expansion adds another 68 GE 1.5-MW turbines for a total of an additional 102 MW. On 9 May 2011 the company announced that Phase II was online. There is a proposal to build a third phase located 45 miles south of Delta, Utah with up to 300 wind turbines. The 240 MW Escalante Solar Project went online in September 2016, located southwest of Milford Wind.

It is a family chronicle (1852–1910) of three generations of Scottish-American Presbyterians in rural Western Pennsylvania and their struggles to maintain their strict faith. The first generation is Daniel and Sarah McDowell, a farm couple. Sarah bears 12 children (of whom five survive) to her dour Calvinistic husband; her bitterness about her repeated, difficult confinements is effectively shown. The second generation is about their children, David and Jeannie. David moves to Pittsburgh where he becomes a judge. Jeannie marries a minister who has been serving as the local school teacher to earn money to complete his education. Jeannie's daughter, Constance, represents the third generation. She becomes a school teacher and struggles to find her place in a changing world. The novel dramatizes the gradual weakening of the strict Calvinism of the Scottish immigrants in an increasingly secular society. ==References== * * Category:1936 American novels Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania Category:Family saga novels Category:Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:1936 debut novels ","title":"The Rolling Years"},{"id":"20229009","text":"Stefan Petrucha (born January 27, 1959) is an American writer of comics and young adult fiction.

He worked in the transport industry after leaving school, working as a McDonald's manager for a period, before returning to university to study economics and industrial relations. He was appointed as an advisor to his local MLA, member for Hurstville and future Premier Morris Iemma in 1994.

After delaying an announcement for two weeks, Iemma announced on 19 September that he would indeed retire; a move reportedly attributed to his efforts to see Furolo, his preferred choice, endorsed as his successor. Furolo subsequently won Labor preselection for what had been Labor's safest seat in the state, and easily won the seat, polling more than 58% of the primary vote, despite a 15-point swing against Labor. He was sworn in as a member of the Legislative Assembly on 18 October, and as a member of the Legislative Review Committee on 30 October. ==Controversy== In October 2010, Furolo borrowed a Lamborghini (reportedly valued at $400,000) from local businessmen, \\"the Kazzi brothers\\", for the purposes of a \\"joyride\\".

Originally named \\"Rosario Cricket Club\\", it was established on March 27, 1867. The RCC and the Buenos Aires Cricket Club (established in 1864) are recognised as the first sports club of Argentina. During its first years of existence, the club had several fields that served for sports practice. The club rented a land on Presidente Roca and Jujuy streets, where many sports (such as baseball, bicycle races, cricket, croquet, football, polo, quoits, rugby, tennis) were practised. The \\"Justas Atléticas\\" (an annual athletics competition) were also held there. Due to the variety of sports practiced, the club was referred to as \\"the Athletic Society\\" instead of \\"the Cricket Society\\". Finally, the club changed its name to \\"Rosario Athletic Club\\",100 años del Club Atlético Del Rosario by Juan Pascual on El Gráfico, March 1967 between May and August 1884 Some highlights during those years were the first inter-club rugby union (29 June 1886) and association football (12 July 1887) matches, played against Buenos Aires Cricket Club teams. In 1889 the club moved to its current location at Plaza Jewell, named after brothers Charles and Edward Jewell who gifted a 24,000 m2 land to the club. Officially inaugurated on August 30, Plaza Jewell is the oldest sports ground in Argentina. In 1893, Atlético del Rosario adopted its current colors, \\"claret & light blue\\". In football, the club had the honour to be the first club from Rosario playing in Primera División although the squad only participated in the 1894 championship. Rosario A.C. was invited by the Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations to participate in the Tie Cup, played by teams of Buenos Aires, Rosario and Montevideo. Rosario AC won the 1902 (defeating legendary Alumni by 2-1 in the playoff match), 1904 (beating Uruguayan CURCC 3-2) and 1905 (winning over CURCC again by 4-3) editions totaling 3 championships in 6 years.

Thirteen years later, in 1899, along with Buenos Aires FC, Lomas and Belgrano AC, the club would become a founding member of the \\"River Plate Rugby Championship\\", the origin of today's Argentine Rugby Union.\\"Hechos históricos de la Unión\\" at UAR website Rosario AC's rugby field is considered the oldest in Argentina, having been inaugurated in 1899.\\"La memoria viva del deporte\\" on Atlético del Rosario website, 28 Apr 2015 Buenos Aires cricket teams posing together in 1916 In 1917 the football section was discontinued after a riot between supporters of Rosario Central and Newell's Old Boys in Plaza Jewell. In 1928 Atlético del Rosario, then playing in the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires championship, became a founding member of the Unión de Rugby de Rosario. As a founding member of the URBA and the URR, the club has the particularity of being a full member of both unions to this day. Field hockey was added as a sport in 1930, being played by women's teams and first. In 1955 the team started to play in the tournaments held by \\"Asociación Argentina Amateur de Hockey Sobre Césped\\", promoting to Primera División in 1959. The club won two championships in 1975 and 1978 but in 1991 it was relegated to the second division. From 1956, Atlético would only take part in the local competitions, before rejoining URBA competitions in 1983. When playing in the URBA, the team uses CA San Isidro's home ground in San Isidro, Buenos Aires, in order to facilitate travel for the visiting teams. In 1991 Atlético was relegated to the second division, where it played the 1992 season promoting to Grupo I that same year.

Due to their name in the Potawatomi language, the Mshkodésik were often confused with another tribe, the Mascoutens. As part of the Council of Three Fires, the Prairie Band were signatories to the 1829 Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien (). Independently of the Council of Three Fires, the Prairie Band were also signatories to the 1832 Treaty of Tippecanoe () as the Potawatomi Tribe of Indians of the Prairie. Under the Indian Removal Act, the Prairie Band were forcibly relocated west, first to Missouri's Platte Country in the mid-1830s and then to the vicinity of Council Bluffs, Iowa in the 1840s, where they were known as the Bluff Indians. The tribe controlled up to five million acres (20,000 km²) at both locations. After 1846, the tribe moved to present-day Kansas. At that time, the reservation was thirty square miles which included part of present-day Topeka. During the period from the 1940s - 1960s, in which the Indian termination policy was enforced, four Kansas tribes, including the Potawatomi were targeted for termination. One of the first pieces of legislation enacted during this period was the Kansas Act of 1940 which transferred all jurisdiction for crimes committed on or against Indians from federal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas. It did not preclude the federal government from trying native people, but it allowed the state into an area of law in which had historically belonged only to the federal government. On 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.US Statutes at Large 67:B132 A memo issued by the Department of the Interior on 21 January 1954 clarified that the reference to \\"Potawatomi\\" in the Resolution meant the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, the Kickapoo, the Sac and Fox and the Iowa tribes in Kansas. Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the Kansas Act of 1940 the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination. In February, 1954 joint hearings for the Kansas tribes were held by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs. The Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation tribal leader, Minnie Evans (Indian name: Ke-what-no-quah Wish-Ken-O) led the effort to stop termination. Tribal members sent petitions of protest to the government and multiple delegations went to testify at congressional meetings in Washington, DC.http://www.pbpindiantribe.com/tribal-history.aspx Tribal Council members Vestana Cadue, Oliver Kahbeah, and Ralph Simon of the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas traveled at their own expense to testify as well. The strong opposition from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes helped them, as well as the Sac & Fox and the Iowa Tribe, avoid termination. ==Government== The Prairie Band are governed by a democratically elected tribal council.

The family moved to the Hawkesbury region in 1940, and his father purchased a jewellers at 161 Windsor Road, Richmond in 1946. After gaining his initial education at Richmond High School, Rozzoli gained his Watchmaking trade certificate in 1960 and worked in the family business, \\"Rozzoli’s Jewellers\\", from 1956 until 1972. After his father's death in 1975, his brother Ron Rozzoli (b. 1936) took over the business, which he operated until his retirement in 1995. Ron Rozzoli was the Honorary Secretary of the Richmond School of Arts from 1960 to 2003. In December 1968 Rozzoli was elected as an Alderman on the Windsor Municipal Council (a forerunner to the City of Hawkesbury). Serving until 1974, Rozzoli's time as a local politician was marked by an interest in the protection of heritage buildings in the local area and the effects of sand and gravel mining in the Hawkesbury River. Rozzoli served as the founding President of the Hawkesbury District Conservation Society. Rozzoli soon became involved in the local branches of the Liberal Party of Australia, serving as Secretary of the Richmond Branch from 1972 to 1973 and as Secretary of the Hawkesbury State Electoral Council from 1972 to 1973. ==Political career== When the sitting Liberal member for the local seat of Hawkesbury, Bernie Deane, resigned due to ill health on 24 October 1972, a by-election for his seat was declared for the 17 February 1973. At age 33, Rozzoli narrowly won Liberal pre-selection for the seat after five ballots, defeating among others, Alan Cadman. The seat had gradually become more marginal over the years and Rozzoli went on to narrowly defeat the Labor candidate Peter Dunn by a two-party-preferred margin of 52 to 47 percent. He would be re-elected a further nine times in this seat. Serving as a shadow minister while the Liberal Party was in opposition during the 1980s, Rozzoli was elected deputy leader in 1981, serving under leader John Dowd. However, with the departure of Dowd from the leadership on 15 March 1983 Rozzoli was defeated in his position of Deputy Leader by Rosemary Foot 7 votes to 6.Hancock, \\"The Liberals\\", p. 228. While serving as an MP, Rozzoli undertook law studies through the Barristers Admission Board, being awarded a Diploma of Law in 1985 and was called to the bar in New South Wales in July 1985. When the Liberal Party under leader Nick Greiner won office in March 1988, Rozzoli was elected as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. After being re-elected in this office in 1991, during the tense period of the hung parliament where the Greiner government was held in place by three independents, Rozzoli was congratulated by the then Leader of the Opposition, Bob Carr: \\"This is the second occasion upon which your election has proceeded unopposed by the Opposition. Such a rare union ticket in this place could begin to earn you, the suspicion of your colleagues.\\" The independent member for South Coast, John Hatton, was also glowing in his admiration: \\"I have been in this House for 18 years and I have seen Speakers come and go. Mr Rozzoli is the fairest and most impartial Speaker I have seen in this House.\\" Rozzoli sought to model his time in the Speaker's chair on the role of the Speaker of the House of Commons and has been the last speaker in the NSW Parliament so far to wear the full traditional dress of the Speaker, which includes the wig and full legal dress. Rozzoli's strict impartiality and affability as Speaker earned him great credit from all sides during the turbulent period of the hung parliament from 1991 to 1995 and was the only speaker of the Legislative Assembly in the 20th century to not have had a dissent or censure motion moved against him. In 1999 the University of Western Sydney awarded him with a Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) recognising his services to the University of Western Sydney. On 1 January 2001 Rozzoli, as a serving Member of Parliament, was awarded the Centenary Medal. His brother Ron was also awarded the medal for his service to the Richmond School of Arts. Rozzoli attempted to recontest his seat for a tenth time at the 2003 election, but amidst a period of intra- party factional conflict, was defeated for Liberal preselection by former Hornsby mayor Steven Pringle. The animosity created by defeating Rozzoli after thirty years was later touted as a factor in Pringle's own loss of preselection to Ray Williams after only one term; at the time, Rozzoli stated \\"what comes around, goes around\\". ==Later life== After leaving politics, Rozzoli served as national president of the Australasian Study of Parliament Group and as the Chair of the National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. Rozzoli also serves as a Director of the NSW Law & Justice Foundation, a Director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and as an Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Government at the University of Sydney. In 2005, the City of Hawkesbury decided to honour Rozzoli and his brother Ron by naming a new function room within the 'Deerubbin Centre' incorporating the Hawkesbury City Library, Museum and Art Gallery as the \\"Rozzoli Room\\". In the 2008 Australia Day Honours Rozzoli was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM): \\"For service to the New South Wales Parliament, and to the community of the Greater Western Sydney area through a range of environmental protection, health and welfare, and educational organisations.\\" In July 2015, following the significant public criticism of the conduct of the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop, including her decision to include the cost of helicopter flights to attend a part fundraiser within her parliamentary entitlements, Rozzoli was interviewed for his views as a former speaker. In addition to criticising the decision over the flights, Rozzoli noted that Bishop had failed to grasp \\"the true essence\\" of her role as Speaker: \\"She is seen as a politically-biased speaker, which is what I don’t like about it. Before I went into the Speaker’s job, I made a very careful study of the role. I read everything I could possibly find. I tried to immerse myself in the subject so that what I absorbed was its ethos. I don’t think Bronwyn’s done that and I don’t think she understands the first thing about it.\\" ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Australian people of English descent Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:New South Wales local government politicians Category:Politicians from Sydney Category:Recipients of the Centenary Medal Category:Speakers of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Kevin Rozzoli"},{"id":"20229883","text":"Uncial 0181 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated paleographically to the 4th-century (or the 5th). == Description == The codex contains a small parts of the Gospel of Luke 9:59-10:14, on one parchment leaf (15 cm by 14 cm).

ZTE Blade and various models are popular in China. Huawei P10 and other models are sold throughout China. China's mobile phone industry or cell phone industry has high growth rate, raising its share on the global mobile phone market. During 2007, 600 million mobile phones were made in China which accounted for over 25 percent of the global production. China is the largest market in terms of mobile phone subscribers. ==History== * In 1987, wireless telephone communication in the modern sense started by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of China, using TACS technology. A nationwide network was completed in the following year.Baidu Encyclopedia: China Mobile Communications Corporation's History (in Chinese) * In 1994, the fixed telephone company (China Telecom) and two mobile phone telephone companies (China Mobile and China Unicom) were spun off from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. * In 2002, the fixed telephone company was split into two: China Netcom for North China and China Telecom for South China * Until 2008, China's mobile phone service was provided by the three companies: ** GSM service from China Mobile ** GSM and CDMA service (begun in 2002) from China Unicom. ** PHS service from the two fixed phone companies: China Netcom and China Telecom * In 2008, another reorganization of the telecommunications industry was made a year before the 3G service was granted. * In 2015, China recorded 1.3 billion mobile subscribers in its domestic market. Nearly everyone in the country has a mobile phone. Nearly 29.6 percent of mobile consumers or 386 million users are on the LTE 4G network. ==Mobile phone service providers== After the 2008 reorganization of China's telecommunication industry, there are now three mobile phone service providers. China Mobile China Mobile () continues the old China Mobile's service, absorbed China Railway Communications, and began 3G service using TD-SCDMA, China's disputed own technology. China Unicom China Unicom () continues the old China Unicom's GSM service, absorbed the old China Netcom's network of fixed telephones in the north of the Yangtze River in China, and started 3G service using W-CDMA technology. China Telecom China Telecom () continues PHS service of the old China Netcom and China Telecom, continues the old China Telecom's network of fixed telephones in the south of the Yangtze River, and began 3G service using CDMA2000 technology. ==Mobile Phone Industry== Wireless communication is regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The mobile phone industry in China has grown to become a large industry, including research of new technology, manufacturing of mobile phones and building of communications networks, contributed by the domestic companies and also foreign companies, such as: * Datang Telecom (Research and development of China's 3G TD-SCDMA technology) * Huawei Technologies * ZTE * Alcatel-Lucent * Ericsson * Nokia-Siemens Networks Huawei Technologies is expected to surpass Nokia-Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent to become the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, after Ericsson, in 2009. ZTE and China Mobile have done turnkey mobile phone network projects in Pakistan, Ethiopia, etc. ==Mobile Phones== Major mobile phone manufacturers Mainland China based Companies:- *Haier *Hisense *Huawei *LeEco (former Letv) *Lenovo (Vibe lineup) *Meizu *Oppo *OnePlus *TCL (including Palm) *Vivo *Xiaomi *ZTE *Infinix International Companies:- *Asus *HTC *Motorola Mobility (subsidiary of Lenovo) *Foxconn *Samsung *LG *Apple *Google Domestics sales The domestic sales of mobile phone made a breakthrough of 100 million in China in 2006. In 2007, the domestic sales of mobile phone in china were 190 million, increased by 74 percent as compared with 2007. The impetus mainly came from the rapid growth of new mobile phone users and old customers' upgrading demands. Of 190 million mobile phones, 140 million were made through formal channels, while the rest were made through informal channels such as smuggling, counterfeiting and renovating. Export volume The export volume of China's mobile phones added up to a record high of 385 million in 2006, increased by 69.3 percent as compared with 2005. In 2007, this figure reached 483 million, increased by 125.45 percent as compared with 2006. As far as 2006, the export volume had reached US$31.214 billion, increased by 52.47 percent as compared with 2005. The export volume of 2007 was 35.6 billion dollars, increased by 114.01 percent as compared with 2006. Development trend Since 2011 smartphones, especially running the open source Android operating system, have become increasingly popular in the Chinese mobile market. By 2016 smart-phones have become the dominant seller in the Chinese market. This is due to the Android system providing the possibility for factories to produce smartphones with increasing ease, which in turn has allowed prices to decrease even to below RMB 1,000 Yuan. These cheap smartphones are also exported to every corner of the world thanks to Chinese internet sales platforms such as aliexpresss.com and DHGate.com, and overseas online sales platforms such as eBay.com and Amazon.com.https://www.compareimports.com/china-brands/ Pricing China's mobile phone market is dominated by products with price under 2000 RMB yuan (about 300 dollars). Products at this price have accounted for 60 percent of the whole mobile phone market, competing with China's local brands, informal mobile phones and international brands. ==Features of China's mobile phones== * Most mobile phone services are prepaid. Pre-payment can be made by buying a card (50 or 100 yuan) and calling the mobile phone provider, or through commercial banks. You can top-up the account via Wechat()/top-up voucher/Alipay()/credit card online everywhere. * There is a clear distinction of mobile phone and mobile phone service in China, unlike some countries such as Japan where the mobile phone is sold by and locked to the mobile phone service companies. This tradition was broken by the 2009 introduction of Apple Inc.'s iPhone. * Stealing of mobile phones and therefore SIM cards is quite common. When a mobile phone is stolen, the owner must visit the mobile phone service provider to cancel the previous card, in order to retain the previous phone number and pre-payment. * A short message (SMS) or duanxin (), usually 0.10 yuan per message (up to 160 alphabetic or 70 Chinese characters), can be sent to any other cell phones across different cell phone service companies, GSM, CDMA or PHS. * Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or caixin () is also available, usually 0.3 yuan per message (up to 50 kilobytes). * A custom ringback tone (\\"calling\\", ), usually 5 yuan per month, is an additional service. It is when the called party can send a ringback tone to the calling party music (or any kind of sound) that the called party likes. Usually detested by foreigners, but loved by the Chinese young. ==See also== * Panasonic *Communications in China *Telecommunications industry in China ==References== Category:Electronics industry in the People's Republic of China Category:Manufacturing in China China Category:Telecommunications in China ","title":"Mobile phone industry in China"},{"id":"20229892","text":"Koba is a sub-district in the Indonesian province of Bangka-Belitung, Indonesia.

Love, Jr. (born August 24, 1968) is a Republican former member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing the 74th District from November 2002 until his resignation in August 2013. He represented part of Montgomery. ==Biography== Love was born in Montgomery and graduated from Auburn University Montgomery with a degree in business administration. He acquired a Subway franchise in 1992, and eventually opened 16 restaurants in the Montgomery area before selling them in 2006. In 2008, midway through his second term, Love ran for the open seat in after eight-term Republican Terry Everett announced his retirement. He finished first in a six candidate primary, winning 35% of the vote. His opponent in the primary run-off was Republican State Senator Harri Anne Smith. Love went on to easily beat Smith in the run-off. He faced Democrat Bobby Bright, the mayor of Montgomery, in the general election. The race was very close, despite the 2nd's Republican voting history. It fell into Republican hands in Barry Goldwater's 1964 landslide, and Republicans hadn't let go since then. Ironically, both Love and Bright are deacons at First Baptist Church of Montgomery. In the November election, Bright received 143,997 votes to Love's 142,231 votes—a margin of 1,766 votes, or just over 0.6 percentage points. While the two candidates each won eight of the district's 16 counties, Bright won the district's share of Montgomery County by 30 points. Love had the option of requesting a recount since the margin of victory was less than a point, but opted not to do so and conceded the seat to Bright. Jay has been married to his wife, Cheri, for 14 years and have four children: Rachel, Addison, Rebecca and Caroline.

India recognized Palestine's statehood following declaration on 18 November 1988;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000827/082711eo.pdf although relations between India and PLO were first established in 1974. After India achieved its independence in 1947, the country has moved to support Palestinian self-determination following the partition of British India. In the light of a religious partition between India and Pakistan, the impetus to boost ties with Muslim states around the world was a further tie to India's support for the Palestinian cause. Though it started to waver in the late 1980s and 1990s as the recognition of Israel led to diplomatic exchanges, the ultimate support for the Palestinian cause was still an underlying concern. Beyond the recognition for Palestinian self-determination ties have been largely dependent upon socio-cultural bonds, while economic relations were neither cold nor warm. India provided $10 million relief to Palestine's annual budget on one occasion. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Israel, there has been increased cooperation in military and intelligence ventures. The fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Islamist anti-state activities in both countries paved the way for a strategic alliance. Since then, Indian support for Palestine has been lukewarm although India still recognizes the legitimacy of aspirations of Palestine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, became the first Prime Minister of India to visit Palestine in 2018. ==History==  Establishment of relations  India was the first non-Arab country to contemporaneously recognize the Palestine Liberation Organisation's authority as \\"the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\\" A PLO office was set up in the Indian capital in 1975, with full diplomatic relations established in March 1980. India recognized Palestine's statehood following declaration on 18 November 1988; although relations between India and PLO were first established in 1974. Upgrade of relations India opened a Representative Office in Gaza on 25 June 1996. Indian support was said to extend to \\"consistent and unwavering support\\" on the Palestinian issue, where it shared the perception that the question of Palestine is at the core of the Arab–Israeli conflict. India has thus consistently supported the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a State and the consequent imperative need for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region based on United Nations Security Council resolution 242, 338 and 425, as well as the principle of \\"Land for Peace.\\" India has also supported the Madrid Conference of October, 1991. India participated in the 2007 Annapolis Conference and the consequent donors conference. India's government noted the direct relevance for India on the issue and favoured the creation of \\"sovereign, independent, united states of Palestine\\" asserting that its support for the cause remains unwavered. External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, briefed the Consultative Committee in his ministry saying, \\"India's support to the Palestinian cause has not wavered.\\" Practically a year later, as a gesture of solidarity with the Palestinian cause, India gifted a piece of prized real estate in the Indian capital's elite diplomatic enclave for the building of an embassy of the Palestinian National Authority's President (PAP) Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas will lay the foundation stone of the chancery-cum-residence complex of the embassy of Palestine, where the PAP Abbas would formally dedicate the building to the people of Palestine from the people of India. The gift underscored India's \\"unwavering solidarity and commitment to an independent Palestine\\" and was seen by some to balance its growing relations with Israel. On his visit, the PAP said that India had played a great role in West Asia peace process. After the ceremonial reception and a guard of honour at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhawan, Abbas said relations between India and Palestine had always been good and that the two countries were making efforts to improve such relations. \\"You know how good relations we have, between India and Palestine since [the] great Indira Gandhi and [the] great Yasir Arafat. And everyday, it's improving. We are very glad with the help and the support of the Indian people to the Palestine.\\" The next day the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, \\"India believes that the solution should be based on the relevant UN Resolutions, the Arab Peace Plan and the Quartet road map resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel. In 2008, the prime minister of India also gave a statement that \\"We hope to see the realisation of a sovereign, independent, united and viable Palestine, co-existing peacefully with Israel. I have reaffirmed our position on this to President Abbas during our conversation today.\\"\\" A joint statement also added that \\"India also called for an end to the expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine and for an early and significant easing of restrictions on the free movement of persons and goods within Palestine.\\" Domestic Palestinian controversy arose, however, as Abbas received some flak for his intransigence. On the visit to India he stated that the country's \\"growing relationship with Israel is not a matter of concern for [the] Palestinians\\" as New Delhi's support for Palestinian independence remained clear. He was condemned for making an \\"utterly irresponsible, gratuitous statement\\" as \\"shameful\\" as it was \\"politically futile\\" and stood no chance to win the PA anything in return. Without an apparatus of Palestinian democratic accountability by the representatives of the people the flood of official Palestinian concessions was \\"guaranteed to continue unabated\\" as it would cause further damage to the struggle for \\"inalienable rights.\\" While talking about India's growing engagement with Israel, particularly in the field of defence, Abbas said, \\"India's relations with Israel is its sovereign decision. We are not going to interfere. We know very well that India is supportive of the Palestinian struggle for achieving its own independence.\\" His controversial comments were in stark contrast to report than India became Israel's second largest trading partner, while India became Israel's largest arm's market and the latter became the former's largest arms supplier. However, it was also said that the Palestinian economy has \\"incredible potential\\" which could be unleashed if the Israeli restrictions on Palestinian movement were lifted, this was accorded by the regional World Bank chief just after a high-level World Bank delegation inaugurated a sewage storage facility on a rare trip to the Hamas-ruled Gaza. While Indian support has often relied on the age-old, and often qualifiable propaganda basis, certain points did bound the pre-partition states of Ireland, India, and Palestine.Fraser, T. G., Partition in Ireland, India and Palestine On this front, where Israel \\"unabashedly defends the rights of Jews over all others, India (as a state) has never claimed religious exclusivism for Hindu citizens,\\" this gave credence to a legitimate support for the Palestinian cause. It was also shown, through academic analysis, that \\"economic factors can have a profound impact efforts to resolve conflict peaceably.\\" With this aforementions disclaimer, India could, theoretically, be an important ally to improve tensions. Studies of such parallels have also shown that economic factors do now draw positive yields. ==Indian aid to Palestine== Library at al-Azhar University, Gaza Strip At the Washington Donors Conference in October, 1995, India pledged US$1 million for assistance to the Palestinian people. At the subsequent pledging conference in Paris in January, 1996, India pledged another US$1 million which was utilised for construction of a Library-cum-Activity Centre at the Palestinian Technical College in Deir-El-Balah and another Library at the Al-Azhar University in Gaza. At yet another International Donors Conference in Washington DC on 30 November 1998, India pledged another US$1 million. The sum of US$300,000 was disbursed to Al-Azhar University for the construction of two additional floors to its library. The remaining amount was utilised for a Human Resource Development Programme. Following a visit of a security delegation to India in March, 1997, led by the Head of the Palestinian Security Forces, Maj Gen Nasser Yussef, India offered 51 specialised security training slots to Palestinians in various disciplines during the year 1997-98, which accounted for an estimated expenditure of 55 lakhs. India also continued to offer 8 scholarships under ICCR Schemes to Palestinian students for higher studies in India, while also offering several slots for training courses under the ITEC Programme. India added more than 50 training slots, at a cost of 40,63,000, to Palestinian personnel for specialised training courses during the financial year 1998-99, where 58 Palestinian officers completed their training. During the financial year 1999-2000, 38 more Palestinian officers utilised the facilities for training. In October 2008 PAP President Abbas visited New Delhi where he met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who announced an assistance of US$20 million to the Palestinian Authority and promised to do all New Delhi can to help it in the PNA's endeavours. PNA President Mahmoud Abbas paid a state visit to India in September 2012, during which India pledged US$10 million as aid. Indian officials said it was the third such donation, adding that New Delhi was committed to helping other development projects. India also pledged support to Palestine's bid for full and equal membership of the UN. Three pacts – on building schools, on Information Technology and imparting vocational training – were signed between the two side after the talks. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said: \\"Support for the Palestinian cause has been a cornerstone of India's foreign policy. I reiterated India's firm support for the struggle of the Palestinian people to achieve a sovereign, independent, viable and united state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\" Refugees The first group of Palestinian refugees from Iraq arrived in India in March 2006. Generally, they were unable to find work in India as they spoke only Arabic though some found employment with UNHCR India's non-governmental partners. All of them were provided with free access to governmental hospitals. Of the 165 Palestinian refugees from Iraq in India, 137 of them found clearance for resettlement in Sweden. ==Cultural ties== As in much of the Third World, including Eastern Europe, South East Asia and the South Asian periphery, the Bollywood legacy continues to build soft power prerogatives for India. ==Economic ties== An Indian company, M/s Satyam, Hyderabad (and M/s United Information Technology), were jointly awarded by Palestine Telecommunications Co a contract for the supply and implementation of Oracle Financial System in Nablus, West Bank. ==Bilateral visitation== PLO President Yasser Arafat visited India on 20–22 November 1997. He also paid a one-day visit to India on 10 April 1999. In 1997 a Memorandum of Understanding on Co-operation was signed between the two states. The MOU provided for a structured framework for bilateral co-operation in such diverse areas as commerce, trade, culture, science & technology, industrial collaboration, information and broadcasting, amongst others. Arafat also laid the foundation stone of an auditorium to be built by the Indo-Arab League in Hyderabad. In April, 1997 he attended the 12th Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Movement, where he addressed the NAM Foreign Ministers in a special session. The PLO's Executive Committee member, Sulaiman Najjab, visited India to participate in a seminar on \\"Prospects for Peace in the Middle East,\\" organised by the United Nations' Department of Information on 3–4 February 1998. The Director General of the Palestine Election Commission also visited India in February, 1998 to familiarise himself with the election process in India, where he visited Gandhi Nagar and Mumbai to witness the election process. The Palestinian Minister of Housing and Energy, Abdel Rahman Hamad, visited India in April, 1998 to attend another seminar organised by the Council of Arab Ambassadors. During the visit, he called on the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Minister of External Affairs. A Member of the Executive Committee of Al-Fateh, in charge of foreign relations and a member of the Palestine National Council, Hani Al-Hasan, visited India as a representative of the PLO to attend the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of India (CPI) held at Chennai from 18–20 September 1998. He also called on the Minister of External Affairs. An Indian official delegation visited the Palestinian self-rule areas in May, 1997 and called on President Arafat in Gaza. The Minister for External Affairs, Saleem I Shervani, met the Foreign Minister of the State of Palestine, Farouk Kaddoumi, at Tunis on 5 September 1997. Following this an MOU on Bilateral Co-operation between the Government of India and the PNA was concluded in November, 1997. There was a strengthening of co-operation in the field of trade, culture and information. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the West Bank on 10 February 2018, which was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Palestinian territories. During the trip to Palestine, Narendra Modi was conferred Grand Collar of the State of Palestine on 10 February 2018 ==See also== *India- Israel relations ==References External links == * Ambassadorial exchanges between Palestine and India * India's stake in Palestine cause Category:Bilateral relations of the State of Palestine Palestine ","title":"India–Palestine relations"},{"id":"20230130","text":"Felicia Stoler, D.C.N. is an American registered dietitian and exercise physiologist who has hosted Honey, We're Killing the Kids, a television series originally developed by the BBC that shows parents the consequences of poor parenting, using computer-generated images of what their children may look like as adults if they continue with their present life-style, dietary and exercise habits.

Harmon was born in Conneaut, Pennsylvania, the son of Jesse Pierce Harmon and Annie Barnes, he married Elmeda Stringham in 1846. He was devoted to his religion and was an industrious and multi-talented builder who constructed sawmills, a cotton factory, pony express roads, furniture, wagons, and worked as a farmer, blacksmith, policeman and other trades. Harmon joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1842 in Nauvoo Illinois. Because of the persecution of the members of the church, in February 1846, Harmon and his recently married wife loaded their possessions into a wagon and crossed the frozen Mississippi river for Iowa, and then traveled on to Winter Quarters near Florence Nebraska. These were especially hard times and, because of the harsh conditions, his mother, his sister and his first born child died and they are buried at Winter Quarters. In the spring of 1847 Harmon was chosen to be a leader in Brigham Young's vanguard company for the trek to the west. During the 1847 trek, Harmon is often remembered for building an early version of the modern odometer using the conceptual designs of William Clayton and Orson Pratt. It was placed on the wagon of Heber C. Kimball and it improved the efficiency and accuracy of logging the daily mileage. The use of this \\"Roadometer\\" was the key to the accuracy of the emigrant's guide later published by Clayton that was the essential to subsequent travelers of the Mormon trail. Later in the 1847 trek, Harmon was left with 9 other men to construct and operate a ferry across the North Platte river located near present-day Casper, Wyoming. After settling in Salt Lake City in 1848 he prospered, living in downtown Salt lake city, building one of the first sawmills and farming near the present location of Sugar House Park. Harmon kept detailed journals of his trek west and his 1850-1853 mission to England that have been published. On the trail heading east for his missionary service in 1850, he saw throngs of gold miners heading west in the second year of the California gold rush, and he was an eye-witness to, and a survivor of, the tragic cholera epidemic that decimated the participants. In 1851 he visited the famous Crystal Palace Exposition in London. He had success on his mission and led a company of about 300 Latter-day Saints from England to Salt Lake City on his return in 1853. In 1862 he was called to settle southern Utah. After experiencing floods of the Virgin river in Grafton, he settled in Toquerville where he built a lumbermill, farmed and made furniture. In 1865 Brigham Young called him to oversee the design, construction and equipping of a factory for producing cotton fabric. Cotton and Woolen fabrics were produced until 1904, although interest in cotton diminished after the civil war and the coming of the railroad. The building that housed the factory, located in Washington near St. George Utah, still stands. In 1870 Harmon moved to Holden, Utah, where he built another lumbermill. He and Elmeda had 12 children. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Anderson, Maybelle Harmon. The Journals of Appleton Milo Harmon (Arthur H.

Becky formed from a tropical depression that was designated on July 19. The next day it organized over the Yucatán Channel and became Tropical Storm Becky. Initially thought to have attained minimal hurricane status, Becky reached peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), but the storm began to deteriorate shortly thereafter. The storm made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 22, and rapidly weakened over land. Overall, damage was related to heavy rainfall that caused flooding in Tallahassee, Florida; 104 families suffered flood-related losses. About $500,000 (1970 USD) in damage was attributed to the storm. Further north, the heavy rainfall swelled rivers. Becky may have been partially responsible for spawning tornadoes that destroyed or damaged several houses. ==Meteorological history== On July 16, 1970, a large disturbance separated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 9. A tropical depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression moved through the Yucatán Channel, the convective cloud system became better organized. On July 20, in light of data from a Reconnaissance Aircraft flight, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Becky. The storm moved roughly northward under the influence of the Bermuda High to the east and a low- pressure area over Mexico. Reports from a Reconnaissance flight indicated that Becky was disorganized, with a minimum barometric pressure of . Although a fairly strong low-level circulation developed, there was insufficient warming of the center to produce a significant drop in barometric pressure at the surface. Late on July 20, a ship reported a minimum pressure of about , and another ship reported sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), which would be Becky's peak intensity. A Reconnaissance flight and weather radars suggested the development of an eye feature, and initially it was believed that the storm attained minimal hurricane status. Later it was later confirmed that Becky remained a tropical storm, and the previously forming eye failed to persist. On July 21, the storm deteriorated in organization as it continued northward. The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm. The storm made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly as it moved inland; as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into the Midwestern United States and completely dissipated over Michigan. ==Preparations== Storm total rainfall from Becky Offshore, Shell Oil removed some workers and equipment from offshore platforms. A hurricane warning was issued from Fort Walton, Florida to Port St. Joe, Florida. Similarly, a gale warning was posted for coastal areas of Alabama and Florida. A hurricane watch was issued for locations in Mississippi and Louisiana. On July 22, a tornado watch was posted for northern Florida. Tornado warnings were also issued, and a flash flood watch was declared for parts of western North Carolina. Gale warnings were posted from Panama City, Florida to St. Marks, Florida, with the expectation of winds to . Heavy rainfall of up to was predicted, and tides of forecast. Isolated tornadoes were possible as the storm made landfall. Thousands of residents were evacuated from the Panhandle of Florida, including Santa Rosa Island and Destin, as well as other low-lying locations. Some residents evacuated to storm shelters that were set up in various cities along the coast. A store in Destin reported increased sales in hurricane-related supplies such as canned goods and flashlights. Florida Governor Claude Kirk ordered health units and law enforcement to operate on emergency alert. Small craft in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico were advised to remain in port until the high seas subsided. ==Impact== Upon making landfall, a barometric pressure of 1007 mb accompanied the storm. Along the coast of the Panhandle, gale-force winds and tides of above-normal were reported. Tallahassee, Florida received of rainfall; due to the heavy precipitation, serious flooding occurred. At Anna Marie Island in Florida, heavy rainfall and squalls accompanied by winds of were reported. In South Carolina, heavy precipitation led to rivers approaching flood stage. Locally heavy rainfall caused rivers to rise in North Carolina, though they remained below flood stage. Along the Cape Fear River, a boat ramp was washed out. Farther towards the north in Georgia and Alabama, the rainfall helped to relieve persistent drought conditions. According to the Red Cross, 104 families in the Tallahassee region suffered flood-related losses, and two injuries were reported. There, winds gusted to . Flood waters were knee-deep around a county courthouse at Crawfordville, Florida. In low-lying areas, flooding damaged homes, and to the southwest of Tallahassee, of water forced the evacuation of 15 homes by rowboat. Over 100 cars were stranded in the flooding. As precautionary measures, a few secondary roads were closed in the region. Damage from Becky in the state totaled $500,000 (1970 USD), mostly in Leon and Wakulla counties. Two injuries were reported. Several tornadoes were reported. Near Panacea, Florida, a tornado destroyed a house and damaged two others. Another tornado in Emanuel County, Georgia killed one person and demolished two homes. However, due to the conditions that spawned the tornadoes, they are not directly attributed to Becky. ==See also== *List of Florida hurricanes *List of wettest tropical cyclones in the United States *List of tropical cyclones ==References== Category:1970 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Atlantic tropical storms Category:Hurricanes in Florida ","title":"Tropical Storm Becky (1970)"},{"id":"20230153","text":"George Bangs (February 26, 1826 – November 17, 1877) was an American businessman who began his adult life working in private ventures including printing, shoes, farming and journalism before becoming postmaster of Aurora, Illinois in 1861. During his postal career, he worked with the Railway Mail Service (RMS). There he improved the mail sorting system on trains and was the most prominent advocate of \\"fast-mail\\" express mail trains. In 1871, as the RMS General Superintendent, he oversaw the start of the \\"fast-mail\\" service which began in 1875. The next year he resigned after Congress cut funding. He died in 1877 and was remembered with an elaborate grave marker denoting his contribution to the postal service. ==Early life== Bangs was born in Milan, Ohio to Samuel and Electa (née Adams) Bangs. His heritage is traced back seven generations to Edward Bangs, a Plymouth Colony settler who arrived in 1623 on the Anne, the second ship to arrive in Colonial America after the Mayflower. Bangs grew up in Akron, Ohio and attended the local schools. At age nine, Bangs apprenticed as a printer working at the Akron Beacon. His skills were such that by age 15, he obtained employment as a journeyman printer at the Cleveland Herald. He may also have worked in Ravenna. He was next reported to be in Wisconsin, working for the Milwaukee Sentinel, the Janesville Gazette and the Rock County Democrat. One biography says he ventured into the boot and shoe business while in Wisconsin and was swindled by a business partner which caused him to move on to Illinois. ==Illinois== Bangs relocated to Kane County, Illinois, where he befriended Lewis Steward, a businessman and politician. He moved again in 1851 to Aurora, first working on the Aurora Beacon for over a year before farming strawberries for a short time. In 1858, with Steward's help, he purchased the Aurora Republican and merged it with the Beacon, becoming editor and publisher of the combined operation and making it an important Ohio paper. After the 1858 Lincoln–Douglas debates, he used the paper to suggest Abraham Lincoln as the Republican presidential candidate and worked to obtain his election in 1860. He maintained his involvement with the paper throughout the Civil War era until March 1866. Upon the outbreak of war, Bangs helped organize the volunteer 36th Illinois Infantry Regiment unit and was appointed a Colonel on the staff of Governor Richard Yates. ==Postal career== As a political spoil, Bangs was appointed postmaster of Aurora in 1861 as one of Lincoln's first appointments, and served - with a reappointment in 1865 - until 1869. He befriended George B. Armstrong, who became the General Superintendent of the Railway Mail Service (RMS) in 1869, at which time Bangs was made the assistant superintendent in Chicago. Upon the retirement of Armstrong in 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Bangs General Superintendent in Washington, D.C. ==Rail mail== A nighttime scene on a Currier & Ives postcard, , of a US railroad junction, \\"Fast-mail\\" train in center The United States Post Office Department utilized trains from the 1830s. Mail was shipped to be delivered to towns along rail lines or forwarded on to other destinations. In the 1860s, mail for the Western United States was shipped by rail as far as St. Joseph, Missouri, and forwarded by stagecoach from there. The process was improved in 1862 when the first mail car was used to sort the mail on the train before it reached St. Joseph. In 1864 Armstrong, then the assistant postmaster in Chicago, suggested widespread expansion of mail-sorting cars, leading to the development of the Railway Post Office car, first tested between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa, with the Chicago & Northwestern in August 1864. Bangs's first improvement to the RMS in 1869 was the addition of \\"serviceable lamps\\" used in mail cars that he had imported from Germany. In an 1874 report, Bangs advocated the creation of a mail train running between New York and Chicago, \\"designed to expedite the movement of mail from the east to the west and cover the distance in about twenty-four hours\\". His lobbying was successful and the RMS was expanded in 1875 with \\"fast-mail\\" trains, high-speed mail-only trains that had priority over all other rail traffic. Each train consisted of four mail cars and one coach. The first such routes were New York City to Chicago on the New York Central, and Philadelphia to Chicago on the Pennsylvania Railroad. The inaugural \\"fast- mail\\" train left New York at 4 a.m. on September 16, 1875, and arrived over away at Chicago's Lake Shore station in a record-setting 26 hours. Guests on the train numbered more than 100, including various postal officials, Senator Carl Schurz, and Vice-President Henry Wilson. The New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroad fast-mail trains to Chicago were called the Twentieth Century Limited and Limited Mail, respectively. Bangs also directed the RMS to first sort mail only to the state level and forward it to the most distant railway post office in each state that could process it further. This distributed the sorting process and reduced backups. Under his tenure, the number of miles of railroad that was used to haul mail increased to 70,083. Much mail continued to be carried by Railway Post Office cars on normal passenger trains. Even though the priority trains were very successful in improving mail operations, Congress discontinued funding eleven months after the initial run, causing Bangs to resign his position in 1876. ==Later life== Shortly after Bangs' resignation, President Grant dismissed Marshall Jewell from the cabinet-level Postmaster General position and offered it to Bangs. Bangs chose not to accept, since Grant's term was ending shortly. He had a reputation for efficiency and civil-service reform, and was considered a likely choice for the position again when it was filled by President Rutherford Hayes, but Hayes wanted a less practical and more political person. In 1876, Bang returned to journalism and founded Railway Age in Chicago. Bangs was appointed assistant Treasurer of the United States in Chicago and served in that role from March 1876 to August 1877. He became an agent of the Merchant's Union Express in Washington, where he died on November 17, 1877. Bangs had been suffering from Bright's disease, a malady of the kidneys. A funeral service was held at the house where he died and attendees included the two US Senators from Ohio, David Davis and Richard Oglesby, Postmaster General David M. Key, as well as other congressmen and postal officials. A special rail car, provided by the Pennsylvania Railroad, was used to transport his body and entourage, led by his successor superintendent of the RMS Theodore Vail, to Chicago where he was buried on November 21. The Chicago post office was closed for the funeral, in which 600 postal clerks marched in procession. Chicago mail trains were adorned in memorial. ==Grave== Monument atop Bangs's grave Bangs' grave, at Chicago's Rosehill Cemetery, is marked by a large stone carving featuring a large tree alongside a three-foot long railway mailcar (in scale) exiting a tunnel. The monument was largely paid for by postal workers. An inscription on the tree includes the words \\"His crowning effort, The Fast Mail\\". The dead tree depicts death while still supporting the life of plants and animals living in or on it; the rail tunnel is in the tree trunk's base. The monument was made from grey marble by sculptor and stonecutter Engelbert Gast, a Bavarian immigrant active in Chicago at the time, and is today considered a notable example of cemetery art. The tall monument, which cost , was unveiled in a ceremony on September 13, 1879 at Chicago's Interstate Exposition Building. ==Personal life== Bangs married Sophronia Wetmore, who died in 1888. == Bangs, Ohio == Bangs, a small railroad village in Knox County, Ohio is named after him. ==NotesReferences * Bangs monument at Waymarking.com * Bangs monument Category:1826 births Category:1877 deaths Category:United States Postal Service people Category:United States Department of the Treasury officials Category:19th- century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Editors of Illinois newspapers Category:Journalists from Wisconsin Category:19th-century American inventors Category:Union Army colonels Category:People of Illinois in the American Civil War Category:Typesetters Category:Cemetery art Category:People from Milan, Ohio Category:Burials at Rosehill Cemetery ","title":"George Bangs"},{"id":"20230206","text":"The Nightingale is a novel by the American writer Agnes Sligh Turnbull (1888–1982) set in a fictional rural Western Pennsylvania village (but much like the author's birthplace of New Alexandria, Pennsylvania, about thirty miles east of Pittsburgh) at the turn of the 20th century.

Other venders offering The Spooler as part of their OS were Amdahl, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Magnuson, and RCA. == The product == The Spooler was an operating system enhancement available for DOS, DOS/VS, DOS/VSE, and came packaged with some third party DOS-based operating systems. It 'spooled' (queued) printer and card data, freeing programs from being dependent upon the speed of printers or punched card equipment. The Spooler competed with IBM's POWER and SDI's GRASP. Like GRASP, The Spooler could reside in an independent 'Fn' partition. ==Platforms== Software The product ran under several DOS-related platforms: * DOS/VS * DOS/VSE * DOS/360 * DOS/360 clones, 3rd party or modified Hardware Hardware platforms included: * IBM System/360 which ran Spooler * IBM System/370 which ran Spooler/VS Several other venders either offered The Spooler as part of their OS or certified compatibility: * Amdahl * Fujitsu * Hitachi * Magnuson * RCA * Siemens == Marketing == The Spooler was sold by DataCorp of Virginia, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The marketing manager and chief salesman was Chaz Frank. Although their target audience was North America, initial sales were in the American South. For overseas sales, DataCorp engaged in both mail order and local vendors. The product was also embedded in third party operating system packages. == Development == The Spooler was originally developed at Carolina Steel in Greensboro, North Carolina by Don Stoneman, with the assistance of Harry Parrish and Charlie Rice. The program went into production in 1975. Upon commercialization in 1976, development moved to DataCorp of Virginia, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, under the direction of Leigh Lundin. Source of controversy DataCorp's original intention had been to continue development at a major banking data center they owned in Harrisonburg. However, their application programmers reported they did not have the expertise in-house. DataCorp, already in talks with independent developer, Leigh Lundin, for his Fx package, contracted with him to take over The Spooler. Three weeks later, after receiving the supposed source code, Lundin reported it had been encrypted and stripped of references and internal notes. DataCorp attempted negotiations with the original developer and pursued legal avenues, without fruition. Computer Associates stepped into the struggle, but failed to exploit it. The result was that DataCorp legally owned the rights to the package and had a growing customer base, but they also had bug reports and no viable source code. Their independent developer had vested time decoding and decrypting the original package to build a legal case. When DataCorp realized they were in an untenable position, Lundin proposed building decryption tools to reconstruct the packages. Within months, he had re- engineered the package and begun development of new versions. DataCorp, fighting off a second takeover attempt by CA, felt less comfortable than ever and, by the early 1980s, discontinued development. Fx The Spooler required a dedicated partition. With DOS having only three partitions and DOS/VS seven, giving up a partition to The Spooler placed a crimp in practicability. Leigh Lundin designed Fx, a pseudo-partition that relieved the user from relinquishing a working partition. Fx appeared in the DOS/VS version of SDI's Grasp as F0. ==References== Category:Computer printing Category:IBM mainframe software ","title":"The Spooler"},{"id":"20230299","text":"Pincher may refer to: ==Geography== * Pincher Station, Alberta *Pincher Creek a town in the southwest of Alberta, Canada ==People== * Christopher Pincher, British Conservative Party politician * Pinchers (singer) ==Other== * Pincher (Gobots) *A misspelling for Pincers (tool) ==See also== * Pincher Martin, a novel by William Golding * Pinscher, a type of dog * Pinches, a surname ","title":"Pincher"},{"id":"20230302","text":"Alain Chatillon (born 15 March 1943 in Revel, Haute-Garonne) is a member of the Senate of France.

In Outliers, Gladwell examines the factors that contribute to high levels of success. To support his thesis, he examines why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in the first few months of the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, how the Beatles became one of the most successful musical acts in human history, how Joseph Flom built Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom into one of the most successful law firms in the world, how cultural differences play a large part in perceived intelligence and rational decision making, and how two people with exceptional intelligence, Christopher Langan and J. Robert Oppenheimer, end up with such vastly different fortunes. Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the \\"10,000-Hour Rule\\", claiming that the key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours, though the authors of the original study this was based on have disputed Gladwell's usage. The book debuted at number one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background and the rest of the publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena. ==Background== alt=A man holds a piece of paper while he gives a speech Gladwell was a journalist for The Washington Post before writing for The New Yorker. The subjects for his articles, usually non-fiction, range from \\"Ron Popeil's infomercial empire to computers that analyze pop songs\\". His familiarity with academic material has allowed him to write about \\"psychology experiments, sociological studies, law articles, statistical surveys of plane crashes and classical musicians and hockey players\\", which he converts into prose accessible to a general audience and which sometimes pass as memes into the popular imagination. Before Outliers, Gladwell wrote two best-selling books: The Tipping Point (2000) and Blink (2005). Both books have been described as \\"pop economics\\". The Tipping Point focuses on how ideas and behaviors reach critical mass, such as how Hush Puppies rapidly grew popular in the 1990s. Blink explains \\"what happens during the first two seconds we encounter something, before we actually start to think\\". All Gladwell's books focus on singularities: singular events in The Tipping Point, singular moments in Blink, and singular people in Outliers. Gladwell was drawn to writing about singular things after he discovered that \\"they always made the best stories\\". Convinced that the most unusual stories had the best chance of reaching the front page of a newspaper, he was \\"quickly weaned off the notion that [he] should be interested in the mundane\\". For Outliers, Gladwell spent time looking for research that made claims that were contrary to what he considered to be popularly held beliefs. In one of the book's chapters, in which Gladwell focuses on the American public school system, he used research conducted by university sociologist Karl Alexander that suggested that \\"the way in which education is discussed in the United States is backward\\". In another chapter, Gladwell cites pioneering research performed by Canadian psychologist Roger Barnsley when discussing how the birthdate of a young hockey player can determine their skill level in the future. While writing the book, Gladwell noted that \\"the biggest misconception about success is that we do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work.\\" In Outliers, he hopes to show that there are a lot more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to \\"move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person\\". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the \\"man\\"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, \\"What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think.\\" ==Synopsis== Outliers has two parts: \\"Part One: Opportunity\\" contains five chapters, and \\"Part Two: Legacy\\" has four. The book also contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell as people who do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble the Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: \\"It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.\\" Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that we give them. The book begins with the observation that a disproportionate number of elite Canadian hockey players are born in the earlier months of the calendar year. The reason behind this is that since youth hockey leagues determine eligibility by the calendar year, children born on January 1 play in the same league as those born on December 31 in the same year. Because children born earlier in the year are statistically larger and more physically mature than their younger competitors, and they are often identified as better athletes, this leads to extra coaching and a higher likelihood of being selected for elite hockey leagues. This phenomenon in which \\"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\\" is dubbed \\"accumulative advantage\\" by Gladwell, while sociologist Robert K. Merton calls it \\"the Matthew Effect\\", named after a biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew: \\"For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him, that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\\" Outliers asserts that success depends on the idiosyncrasies of the selection process used to identify talent just as much as it does on the athletes' natural abilities. alt=A man speaks into a microphone. A common theme that appears throughout Outliers is the \\"10,000-Hour Rule\\", based on a study by Anders Ericsson. Gladwell claims that greatness requires enormous time, using the source of the Beatles' musical talents and Gates' computer savvy as examples. The Beatles performed live in Hamburg, Germany over 1,200 times from 1960 to 1964, amassing more than 10,000 hours of playing time, therefore meeting the 10,000-Hour Rule. Gladwell asserts that all of the time the Beatles spent performing shaped their talent, and quotes a Beatles' biographer, Philip Norman, as claiming \\"So by the time they returned to England from Hamburg, Germany, 'they sounded like no one else. It was the making of them.'\\" Gates met the 10,000-Hour Rule when he gained access to a high school computer in 1968 at the age of 13, and spent 10,000 hours programming on it. In Outliers, Gladwell interviews Gates, who says that unique access to a computer at a time when they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be \\"a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional\\", but that he might not be worth US$50 billion. Gladwell, however, never mentions that Gates' mother had access to the board of directors of IBM and was not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post. alt=A photo of a man in a suit Reemphasizing his theme, Gladwell continuously reminds the reader that genius is not the only or even the most important thing when determining a person's success. Using an anecdote to illustrate his claim, he discusses the story of Christopher Langan, a man who ended up owning a horse farm in rural Missouri despite having an IQ of 195 (Gladwell claims that Einstein's was 150). Gladwell points out that Langan has not reached a high level of success because of the dysfunctional environment in which he grew up. With no one in Langan's life and nothing in his background to help him take advantage of his exceptional gifts, he had to find success by himself. \\"No one—not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses—ever makes it alone\\", writes Gladwell. Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural abilities that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, was the son of a successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him. In the next chapter, Gladwell explains the fact that Asians are good at mathematics by correlating it to rice agriculture, particularly the fact that rice cultivation requires more work ethic than Western wheat agriculture. In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell advances the notion that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success stems from the fact that they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socioeconomic group. Before the book concludes, Gladwell writes about the unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a descendant of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met and fell in love with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success \\"is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky\\", and at the end of the book, he remarks, \\"Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success.\\" ==Style== Outliers has been described as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a \\"more personal book than its predecessors\\", noting, \\"If you hold it up to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful man trying to figure out his own context, how success happened to him and what it means.\\" He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had. == Reception == Published by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008, Outliers debuted at number one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times in the United States and The Globe and Mail in Canada on November 28, 2008, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Between June 2011, when the paperback version was released, and February 2017, the book made the New York Times bestseller list for paperback nonfiction 232 times. As in his other books, Gladwell's engaging and vivid prose drew praise in Outliers, though Gladwell's methodology has been criticized for too often falling prey to fallacious reasoning, inadequate and anecdotally based sampling, and oversimplified analysis. In particular, Anders Ericsson, who conducted the study upon which \\"the 10,000-Hour Rule\\" was based has written that Gladwell had overgeneralized, misinterpreted, and oversimplified his findings.https://web.archive.org/web/20190320062202/https://radicalscholarship.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/guest- post-the-danger-of-delegating-education-to-journalists-k-anders-ericsson/ David A. Shaywitz, reviewing the book in The Wall Street Journal, praised Gladwell's writing style as \\"iconic\\", and asserted that \\"many new nonfiction authors seek to define themselves as the 'Malcolm Gladwell of' their chosen topic.\\" He complimented its clarity and easy grace, but also pointed to these as possible Achilles' heels for Gladwell because of his oversimplification of complex sociological phenomena to \\"compact, pithy explanations\\". Furthermore, he praised the book for asking some important questions, such as \\"How much potential out there is being ignored? How much raw talent remains uncultivated and ultimately lost because we cling to outmoded ideas of what success looks like and what is required to achieve it?\\" In a discussion about the book in Slate magazine, John Horgan was particularly moved by Gladwell's family history. He felt that the links between race and achievement were given substantive analysis, but found the lessons mentioned in Outliers to be \\"oddly anticlimactic, even dispiriting\\". His contribution concluded by remarking, \\"Outliers represents a squandered opportunity for Gladwell—himself an outlier, an enormously talented and influential writer and the descendant of an African slave—to make a major contribution to our ongoing discourse about nature, nurture, and race.\\" BusinessWeek gave the book four out of five stars and appreciated its \\"Aha!\\" moments, but wondered if Gladwell purposely omits evidence that contradicts his thesis. The review remarked that Outliers was repetitive in parts, but that Gladwell eventually pulls the stories together into an overarching narrative. Criticism focused on the book's style and oversimplified conceptualizations. Displeased with Gladwell's generalizations drawn from small amounts of data, Roger Gathman wrote in The Austin American- Statesman that this was uncharacteristic of him, and believed that the approach points to a \\"certain exhaustion in his favorite method\\". He remarked that in Outliers, the experiments, analyses, and conclusions drawn are too mechanically applied to historical or cultural phenomena to \\"create a cognitive 'gotcha' moment\\", that Gladwell's analytical method was no longer working, and that \\"it's high time for Gladwell to produce something more challenging than his beautifully executed tomb robberies of old sociology papers.\\" Boyd Tonkin in The Independent held a similar opinion, and wondered why Gladwell \\"does not yet hold a tenured professorship at the University of the Bleedin' Obvious\\". Jason Cowley, reviewing the book in The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word \\"we\\" when defining his position, such as in the example: \\"There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. ... We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that the world in which we grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all.\\" He also believed that there was a \\"certain one-dimensional Americanness at work\\", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, \\"The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle.\\" In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final two chapters of Outliers \\"impervious to all forms of critical thinking\\". Finding it ironic that Outliers provided suggestions on how to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that \\"you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); and then you have to work really, really hard. That's about it.\\" He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that the Beatles' success had more to do with \\"the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry\\". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of the Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010: Case Western Reserve University's assistant professor of psychology Brooke N. Macnamara and colleagues have subsequently performed a comprehensive review of 9,331 research papers about practice relating to acquiring skills. They focused specifically on 88 papers that collected and recorded data about practice times. In their paper, they note regarding the 10,000-hour rule that \\"This view is a frequent topic of popular-science writing\\" but \\"we conducted a meta-analysis covering all major domains in which deliberate practice has been investigated. We found that deliberate practice explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. We conclude that deliberate practice is important, but not as important as has been argued\\". Sociologist Shayne Lee referenced Outliers in his opinion editorial for CNN.com that commemorated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Lee discussed the strategic timing of King's ascent from a \\"Gladwellian\\" perspective, citing Outliers as the inspiration for his argument. ==ReferencesSummary by Dan Dascalescu, about 3250 words Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:Books about creativity Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:Popular psychology books Category:Popular science books Category:Sociology books Category:Works by Malcolm Gladwell ","title":"Outliers (book)"},{"id":"20230454","text":"Fort Orange and Castle Island (the island left of the fort) 1893 map of Westerlo Island Castle Island is a former island located in the city of Albany, Albany County, New York. Over the past 400 years, Castle Island has been referred to as Martin Gerritse's Island, Patroon's Island, Van Rensselaer Island, and—since the late 19th century--Westerlo Island. (Van Rensselaer Island is also the name of a former island opposite Albany in the city of Rensselaer.) The land known as Castle Island has been connected to the mainland and now forms a part of the Port of Albany. ==History== The area now referred to as Westerlo Island was once five separate islands: Castle Island/Westerlo Island, Cabbage Island, Bogart Island, Marsh Island, and Beacon Island. Nineteenth and early-twentieth century historians claimed that around 1540, French fur traders built a stone \\"castle\\" or fortified trading post on Castle Island that they later abandoned. However, modern scholars have found no evidence to support this claim. The first definitive European settlement on Castle Island came in 1614 when the Dutch built Fort Nassau under the command of Hendrick Corstiaensen, but in 1618 the Fort was destroyed by flooding. The island was quickly divided into farms on a lease basis from the Rensselaerswyck patroonship. The first farm on Castle Island was called \\"Rensselaersburgh\\" and was established in 1630. The Dongan Charter of 1686, which incorporated Albany as a city, defined the City's southern boundary as the northern \\"tip of Marte Gerrite's island\\"; at the time; Castle Island was known as Marte Gerrite's island. From 1909 to 1928, Castle Island—then known as Westerlo Island—was the site of the Quentin Roosevelt Field, the precursor to the Albany International Airport. Early aviators such as Glenn Curtiss and Charles Lindbergh landed there. In 1926, Westerlo Island was annexed by the city of Albany from the town of Bethlehem, while the other nearby islands were not. With the filling in of the shallow creek and the coastal areas of the Hudson River, Bogart Island, Marsh Island, and Beacon Island merged with Cabbage Island by 1929. Island Creek still separated Westerlo Island from the mainland and from Cabbage Island, and the Normans Kill also separated Cabbage Island from the mainland. In the 1930s, Island Creek was filled in, connecting Westerlo Island to the mainland and ending its time as an island (though it is still labeled as Westerlo Island on NYSDOT and USGS Albany quadrangle maps). In 1932, Westerlo Island was opened as the Port of Albany, along with in the city of Rensselaer. The Canadian Pacific Railway's Kenwood Yard and railroad tracks sit on the site of the original creek. A park just north of the Port of Albany is located at the site of the former northern terminus of Island Creek with the Hudson River and retains the name Island Creek Park. By the 1950s, Cabbage Island too had merged with Westerlo Island, but the Normans Kill still flowed along its southern and western banks. The land along the Hudson River and north of the Normans Kill within the town of Bethlehem was once Cabbage Island. ==See also== *List of Hudson River Islands *History of Albany, New York ==References== Category:New Netherland Category:History of Albany, New York Category:Islands of the Hudson River Category:River islands of New York (state) Category:Islands of New York (state) ","title":"Castle Island (New York)"},{"id":"20230460","text":"Corn allergy, also called maize allergy, is a very rare food allergy. People with a true IgE-mediated allergy to corn develop symptoms such as swelling or hives when they eat corn or foods that contain corn. Corn allergy can be a difficult allergy to manage, due to many food and non-food products that contain various forms of corn, such as corn starch, modified food starch, vinegar, and vanilla extract, among many others. It is an allergy that often goes unrecognized. ==Symptoms== Symptoms appear after exposure, and range from mild to severe. As with other food allergies, most people who are allergic to corn have mild symptoms. As a result of a possible immunoglobulin E (IgE) allergy to corn, symptoms can resemble that of any other recognized allergy, including anaphylaxis. Reactions to corn derivatives, such as corn syrup, are also possible. ==Management== As with other food allergies, there is no cure. Most people who are allergic to corn cannot eat corn or anything containing proteins from corn.

CICC was founded in 1995 and is headquartered at China World Office 2, Jianguomen Outer Street, Beijing, China. It also has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and New York City. The firm provides equity and debt underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advisory, equity sales and trading, and fixed income, commodities and currency services to its clients. It also has a diversified investment management platform that includes asset management, mutual fund, fund of funds, and private equity. ==History== On July 31, 1995, CICC was incorporated by China Construction Bank, Morgan Stanley, China National Investment and Guaranty Co Ltd, GIC, and the Mingly Corporation, as the first Sino-foreign joint venture investment bank. At the time of CICC's incorporation, China Construction Bank and Morgan Stanley were its largest shareholders, with a 42.5% and 35% interest, respectively. In 1997, CICC established its first overseas subsidiary in Hong Kong, through which CICC became the first Chinese investment bank conducting securities underwriting business in Hong Kong. CICC completed its first overseas initial public offering project, the IPO of China Mobile on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which marked the beginning of the restructuring and overseas listing of large state-owned enterprises directly under the State Council of China, and was also the largest IPO in Asia in 1997 as well as the largest IPO of China-based companies ever up until the end of 1997. In 2004, China Construction Bank transferred its equity interest to China Jianyin Investment, which later transferred that to China Central Huijin, a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold its holdings to TPG, KKR, GIC and Great Eastern. CICC established its FICC division, and was one of the earliest investment banks to conduct fixed income business in China. In 2007, CICC set up its wealth management division, and was one of the earliest investment banks to engage in wealth management business in China. In 2010, CICC became the first investment bank to obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to raise and manage private equity funds. In 2015, CICC was converted into a joint stock company with limited liability whose top three shareholders were Huijin, GIC and TPG. In November 2015, CICC completed its own IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In 2016 CICC acquired China Investment Securities from Central Huijin in an all-share deal. In 2017, CICC acquired a majority stake (50+%) in US KraneShares, a leading exchange-traded fund provider that focuses on Chinese listed companies, with its biggest fund (KWEB) focused on Chinese Internet companies. In 2017, giant Chinese internet company, Tencent acquired a 5% stake in CICC. ==Notable former employees== *Bei Duoguang – CEO of JPMorgan First Capital Securities *Ding Wei – Head of Temasek China *Fang Fenglei – Chairman of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, Chairman of Hopu Investments *Ha Jiming – Vice Chairman, China of Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management *Jiang Guorong – Vice Chairman of UBS Asia *Jin Liqun – President of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank *David X.

The Pacific white skate (Bathyraja spinosissima) is a species of skate in the family Arhynchobatidae. It is one of the deepest-living of all skates, occurring at a depth of 800 to 2,938 m on the continental slope. It is native to the southeast Pacific Ocean from the Galapagos Islands to off Waldport, Oregon; an egg case and embryo has been collected from the Farallon Islands off San Francisco. Reports of it from the Sea of Okhotsk may represent a different species. Its species name, spinosissima, comes from the Latin spinosus meaning \\"thorny\\", referring to its covering of dermal denticles. The flattened pectoral fin disc of the Pacific white skate is slightly wider than long, with broadly rounded tips. The disc is covered with numerous small denticles above and below, giving it a shagreen-like texture. Adult males possess alar spines (on the dorsal surface of the pectoral fins near the tips). The tail is slightly longer than the disc, bearing a single median row of 23-29 thorns and two similar-sized dorsal fins near the end without an interdorsal thorn. The caudal fin is long and tapering, with a filamentous fold on its upper surface. Its teeth number 34 in the upper jaw and 23 in the lower. This species is a uniform pale to salty gray above and below, with dusky outer disc margins. The Pacific white skate feeds on benthic fishes. Like other skates they are oviparous; the egg cases are olive green in color and longitudinally striated, with horn-like projections on the shell. The size at birth is about 25 cm; the maximum known size is 1.5 m. They are of no commercial interest but are occasionally taken as by-catch. ==References== Category:Bathyraja Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Marine fauna of North America Category:Fish of Mexican Pacific coast Category:Fish of the Western United States Skate, Pacific White Category:Western Central American coastal fauna Category:Galápagos Islands coastal fauna Category:Fauna of California Category:Fish described in 1941 ","title":"Pacific white skate"},{"id":"20230644","text":"Yvon Collin (born 10 April 1944 in Montauban) is a member of the Senate of France.

It is cut in a briolette shape, and is a D-coloured (colourless) type IIa diamond. Its history was thought to date from the 12th century, when it was first acquired by Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Queen consort of King Louis VII of France between 1137 and 1152. This makes the Briolette of India the oldest diamond on record in the world, even older than the famous Koh-i-Noor. The diamond was in the possession of several famous historical figures such as King Richard the Lion Heart, who carried it with him to the third crusade, and King Henry II of France who presented it to his mistress Diane de Poitiers. The Briolette of India has disappeared from records for long periods, sometimes even for several centuries, before resurfacing again. It is currently believed to be in the possession of a European family. ==Early history== Modern reports of the diamond's history speculate that it dates back as far as the 12th century, when it is said to have first been acquired and brought to England by Eleanor of Aquitaine, the queen consort of King Louis VII of France. If Eleanor of Acquitaine did come into possession of the diamond, it was probably between 1137 and 1152, which would make the Briolette of India the oldest diamond on record. After her marriage to the King of France was dissolved, Eleanor married Henry II of England, to whom she bore eight children including Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) who is said to have later acquired the diamond. Modern sources speculate that King Richard I carried the Briolette of India with him when he took part in the third crusade. The diamond's history was not recorded for almost three centuries after it passed from Richard I's possession. Modern sources resume the story of the diamond from the late 16th century, when Henry II of France is said to have presented it to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. After Henry II's death, his queen consort, Catherine de Medicis, forced Poitiers to surrender the diamond as well as other jewels given her by the monarch. The jewels that were surrendered may have included the Briolette of India. ==The diamond in the 20th century== According to historian Hans Nadelhoffer, the Briolette of India was cut into its distinctive shape in Neuilly, Paris and sold to Cartier, along with another diamond called the Blue Heart (aka Unzue Heart).http://www.mnh.si.edu/earth/text/dynamicearth/6_0_0_geogallery/geogallery_specimen.cfm?SpecimenID=4002&categoryID;=1&categoryName;=Gems&browseType;=nameHans Nadelhoffer, Cartier (Chronicle Books, 2007), page 259 \\"Initially set as a pendant with a 126-grain pearl,\\" Nadelhoffer writes, \\"the splendid stone was combined the following year [1910] with two 22-carat emeralds and the same pearl to form a brooch, which was sent to the New York branch [of Cartier]. In 1911, Cartier's sold it to [American financier] George Blumenthal\\", who presented it to his wife, Florence Meyer Blumenthal.Hans Nadelhoffer, Cartier (Chronicle Books, 2007), page 321 The Briolette resurfaced in 1950, when it was acquired by New York jeweler Harry Winston. Winston sold the diamond to the wife of Canadian millionaire I. W. Killam and bought it from Dorothy J. Killam's estate ten years later, after her death. In July 1967, the Briolette of India was illustrated in a photograph by Richard Avedon. The image depicts Anglo-American fashion model Penelope Tree holding the unset stone before her right eye.Cathy Horyn, \\"How Avedon Blurred His Own Image\\", The New York Times, 13 May 2009https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/05/13/fashion/20090514-avedon- feature/index.html Harry Winston exhibited the Briolette in 1970 at a dinner organized for American fashion editors.

It is cut in a briolette shape, an exaggerated form of double rose cut. The diamond weighs . It is D-color and a type IIa diamond, which are the purest type of diamonds with no chemical impurities or plastic deformations in the crystal.

The agency provides bus service for much of the urbanized Fairbanks Metropolitan Statistical Area. MACS is part of the borough's transportation department and is the northernmost local bus network in continental North America. ==History== Prior to the formation of MACS, the public transit needs of Fairbanks were served, if at all, mostly by private operators. The longest-lasting of these was University Bus Lines, operated by Paul Greimann, Sr. University Bus Lines primarily provided service to and from Fairbanks, the University of Alaska campus, and Ladd Air Force Base, now Fort Wainwright. The Fairbanks North Star Borough began exploring the possibilities of offering public transit during the 1970s, when the population and economy of Fairbanks began exploding in conjunction with the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Voters in the City of Fairbanks voted in 1976 to allow operation of transit buses by the FNSB over the streets of Fairbanks. The system began operating in 1977 with two routes serving the Fairbanks urban area. A 1978 study recommended offering service to the outlying areas of the borough, including Ester, Chena Ridge Road, Farmers Loop Road and Goldstream Road. The system expanded to serve North Pole, Salcha and Farmers Loop, Fort Wainwright and other areas of the Fairbanks area. The system now operates 8 routes, and travels over 723,228 miles every year. ==Routes== Max C. Lyon, Jr. Transit Center in downtown Fairbanks. Blue Line bus laying over at the Transit Center. MACS has eight fixed routes identified by color. The Red and Blue Lines provide loop service around urban Fairbanks in opposing directions, while the other routes connect to more outlying destinations.

In 2011, an effort was initiated to privatize Van Tran. Spearheaded by conservative Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly members Diane Hutchinson and Michael Dukes, the system's cost, estimated at between US $61.71 and $76 per ride, was cited as justification. However, a study commissioned by the Borough Assembly found that privatization would only result in minor cost savings, and no action towards privatization was taken. ==References * Category:1977 establishments in Alaska Category:Bus transportation in Alaska Category:Government agencies established in 1977 Category:Transit agencies in Alaska Category:Transportation in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska ","title":"Metropolitan Area Commuter System"},{"id":"20231180","text":"Percival Healing (16 July 1878 -- 1 February 1915) was an English cricketer.

Her previous album Illuminations having sold so poorly as to lose Vanguard a considerable sum of money, the label placed considerable pressure on Sainte-Marie to come up with something that would sell in larger numbers. To this effect, She Used to Wanna Be a Ballerina was recorded with guitar from Ry Cooder and Neil Young and assistance from the latter's backing band Crazy Horse. There was also a change in focus of the material: covers of contemporary songs, which she had almost never recorded before, accounted for five of the eleven songs. Vanguard boss Maynard Solomon, who had produced her first five albums and most of Illuminations, surrendered production duties completely to Neil Young producer Jack Nitzsche, who was later to marry Sainte-Marie after she wrote \\"Up Where We Belong\\" with him in the early 1980s. This label-driven effort to achieve increased commercial success did briefly pay off when \\"Soldier Blue\\", the theme song from the movie of the same name reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart and was a hit throughout Europe. It failed to chart in the States, however, and the album barely dented the Billboard Top 200, which served to strain the relationship between Sainte- Marie and Vanguard and paved the way for their split in 1973 after Quiet Places.

His death occurred during an engagement at Franklin, Tennessee on September 2, 1864 during Major General Joseph Wheeler's raid into Tennessee in August and early September 1864 in an attempt to destroy the railroad that Union Army Major General William Tecumseh Sherman was using to supply his force from Chattanooga, Tennessee during the Atlanta Campaign.This engagement at Franklin, Tennessee should not be confused with the November 30, 1864 Battle of Franklin (1864), which was part of the Franklin–Nashville Campaign. ==Early life and career== John Herbert Kelly was born in 1840 to Isham Kelly and Elizabeth Herbert at their home in Carrollton, Alabama.Willis Brewer's Alabama, Her History, Resources, War Record, and Public Men: From 1540 to 1872 ( 1872) pg. 502 Kelly's father died while in Cuba when John was four, and his mother died three years later.

During that time Kelly left Fort Morgan with Brig. Gen. William J. Hardee to Missouri. It was here that he was appointed captain and assistant adjutant general on Hardee's staff. In 1862 Kelly was appointed major of the 9th Arkansas Infantry Battalion, which he led into battle at Shiloh. One month later Kelly became colonel of the 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. In October of that year he fought at the Battle of Perryville. Later in 1862 he fought at the Battle of Murfreesboro where he was wounded. Kelly commanded a large brigade of men at Chickamauga consisting of the 5th Kentucky, 58th North Carolina, 63rd Virginia, and the 65th Georgia Infantry Regiments. He lost 300 men at Chickamauga within the one hour. Also during the battle while leading his troops Kelly had a horse shot out from under him. Because of his bravery at the Battle of Chickamauga generals Cleburne, Liddell, and Preston asked for a promotion for Kelly. General Cleburne told Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon of Kelly, \\"I know no better officer of his grade in the service.\\" On November 16, 1863, John Kelly was promoted to a brigadier general at age 23.Thomas McAdory Owen, Marie Bankhead Owens' History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography (1921) pg. 326 Kelly's brigade was one of the key factors at the Battle of Pickett's Mill that lead to the Confederate victory. ==Capture and death== In August and September 1864 Kelly's Brigade fought at Franklin, Tennessee during Wheeler's raid on Sherman's railroad supply line.

The waters around Ponta dos Rosais consist of an oceanic plateau known as Baixa da Ponta dos Rosais: this plateau extends out north-northwest from the promontory. The islands of Faial, Pico, and Graciosa are often visible from Ponta dos Rosais. Faial and Pico are located approximately from Ponta dos Rosais. On the promontory stands the isolated, mid-century Nationalist lighthouse complex of Ponta dos Rosais. Ponta dos Rosais and the surrounding area are within a locally protected area of the Azores known as the Monumento Natural da Ponta dos Rosais (Ponta dos Rosais Natural Monument), a nature reserve which is part of the larger Nature Park of São Jorge conservation zone. Since June 1995 the Ponta dos Rosais area has also been protected through the European Environment Agency's Natura 2000 initiative under the Habitats Directive. This natural monument stretches from the coastal cliffs of Pico dos Cutelos along the southern coast to the northern cliffs and pasturelands of Chã do Areeiro. The reserve also includes the waters surrounding the point, the Rosais Islets, Ponta da Ilha, and Torrão da Açucar, as well as the Fajã Mata Sete, a volcanic debris field (fajã) of mixed basalt rocks, stacks, pyroclastic flows, and eroded debris. Sometimes treacherous trails—most skirting the coast—link together these various zones of the Ponta dos Rosais reserve. Biome The uplands are primarily pasture and other rural agricultural areas. Tourists visiting the area are attracted by the diversity of migratory and maritime bird species nesting in the cliffs of Ponta dos Rosais, including Cory's shearwater, little shearwater, common tern, and roseate tern. Introduced predator species around Ponta dos Rosais include feral cats and dogs, mustelids, and rodents, though the lattermost are kept in check by kite predation. Endemic flowering coastal plants present in the area include Azorean forget-me-not (Myosotis azorica) and Azorean heather (Erica azorica). The invasive cane grass Arundo donax threatens the continued presence and health of these endemic plants. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * Category:São Jorge Island Category:Geology of the Azores Category:Rosais ","title":"Ponta dos Rosais"},{"id":"20231309","text":"James Charles Stewart (7 September 1850 - 20 December 1931) was a Scottish- born Australian politician.

Cremonini was born and died in Cremona, Italy. Admired for his full lyric voice, he sang a wide repertoire that encompassed the bel canto works of Donizetti and Rossini, the Italian grand opera of Verdi, the verisimo operas of Mascagni, the French operas of Gounod and Massenet, and the German operas of Richard Wagner. He sang in several world premieres during his career, including creating the role of Chevalier des Grieux in the original 1893 production of Puccini's Manon Lescaut. An immensely popular singer, Cremonini's career was cut short upon his sudden death in 1903 at the age of 36.Riemens, A concise biographical dictionary of singers ==Biography== Cremonini's costume for Act II of Manon Lescaut, designed by Adolf Hohenstein for the world premiere Cremonini was born into an impoverished family with the name Giuseppe Bianchi. He studied under a teacher with the surname of Cima. Taking on the name Giuseppe Cremonini, he made his professional opera debut in 1889 at the Teatro Politeama in Genoa as Carlo in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix. The following year he performed the role of Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas's Mignon at both the Teatro Filodrammatico in Milan and the Teatro Coccia in Novara. In 1891 he sang the role of Turiddu in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana opposite the famous primadonna Hariclea Darclée as Santuzza at the Romanian National Opera. That same year she had an enormous successes as the title hero in Mascagni's L'amico Fritz at the opera's premieres in Mantua, Faenza and Palermo. In 1892 she made his Covent Garden debut as Nadir in Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles and sang the role of Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata with the company. On 1 February 1893, Cremonini created the role of Chevalier des Grieux in the world premiere of Puccini's Manon Lescaut at the Teatro Regio di Torino. It was the first time of many that he would sing opposite Cesira Ferrani, who originated the role of Manon. In 1894 Cremonini and Ferrani reprised their roles at Manon Lescaut's La Scala premiere and sang opposite each other in the world premiere of Alberto Franchetti's Il fior d'Alpe as Paolo and Maria.Budden, Grove Music Online In addition to Manon Lescaut, Cremonini also appeared in operas at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Teatro Costanzi in Rome, and at the Teatro Real in Madrid in 1893 and 1894. His performances included such roles as Turiddu, the Assad in Karl Goldmark's Die Königin von Saba, and the title role in Wagner's Lohengrin among others. He also sang the title role in the world premiere of Pietro Vallini's Il Voto at the Teatro Costanzi in 1894. In 1895 Cremonini sang in numerous roles with Opéra de Monte-Carlo including Turiddu, Amico Fritz, Enzo in La Gioconda, Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, and Arturo in I puritani. In 1896 he sang several roles at Covent Garden including Turiddu, Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, Lyonel in Martha, Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto, and Faust in Mefistofele. The following year he made his debut at the Berlin State Opera as Don Ottavio. Between 1895 and 1897, he also sang the role of Fernando in Donizetti's La favorita in numerous opera houses throughout Europe. Cremonini joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera in 1900 where he sang roles with the company for two seasons. He made his American debut with the company as Cavaradossi in the American premiere of Puccini's Tosca. He later reprised this role in Tosca's premieres in Boston and Chicago. Cremononini's other roles at the Met included Alfredo, Lohengrin, Nadir, Rodolfo in La Bohème, Fenton in Falstaff, Faust in Mefistofele, and the title role in Gounod's Faust among others. In 1902 he returned to Italy where he sang Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, Jean Gaussin in Sapho, and the role of Stolzing in the Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. His last performance, as Le Chevalier des Grieux in Massenet's Manon in his home city of Cremona, was just a few days before his sudden death in 1903. ==Recordings== Cremonini's voice is sometimes said to have been recorded in 1900/1 Mapleson Cylinder in recordings of duets from Tosca. However, the Mapleson recordings of Tosca are from 1902 and 1903 (when Cremonini was long gone from the Metropolitan, indeed dead by 1903). The existing recordings (from 1902/1903) are still, however, with soprano Milka Ternina or Emma Eames; but Ternina's tenor partner in 1902 (and Eames' in 1903) was in fact Di Marchi. The earlier performances with Cremonini were not recorded by Mapleson. Cremonini, unlike other important tenors at the time (such as De Lucia, Caruso, Tamagno, et al.) did not record commercially (if at all) in 1902/03. He is therefore, along with Di Marchi, one of the greatest \\"losses\\" of the dawn of \\"serious\\" sound recording. ==ReferencesSources== * *Jullian Budden: \\"Manon Lescaut (ii)\\", Grove Music Online ed.

Through a process of auditions, the awarding school will identify the most talented students and allocate awards appropriately. The award pays a substantial contribution towards the cost of attending the relevant course and in many cases, also includes a means tested maintenance grant. ==Courses== The vocational courses for which the awards are given are specially devised by Trinity College, London and, upon completion, provide a professional level qualification at either Level 5 or Level 6 on the National Qualifications Framework. Completion of one of these courses gives formal accreditation of the skills, knowledge and understanding that are acquired in training for employment as a professional actor, dancer, performing artist or in production roles supporting performance. Despite the fact that despite the courses being offered as post-16 further education, the qualifications are actually rated at graduate level. Courses which are eligible for funding: National Qualifications Framework - Level 5 *National Certificate in Professional Acting *National Certificate in Professional Classical Ballet National Qualifications Framework - Level 6 *National Diploma in Professional Acting *National Diploma in Professional Musical Theatre *National Diploma in Professional Dance *National Diploma in Professional Production Skills == Schools == All the schools which participate in the Dance & Drama Awards scheme are validated by Trinity College and are inspected for educational standards by OFSTED.

He migrated to Australia around 1885, when he became a miner at Bundamba, and was Secretary of the Bundamba Miners Association. He was a founding member of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, and was the first Labor member of any Australian parliament when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1888 as the member for Bundamba. Defeated in 1893, he was subsequently member for Burke from 1894 to 1896 and Bundaberg from 1896 to 1900. He left the Labor Party in 1899 over the party's socialist objective. In 1901, he was elected to the Australian Senate for Queensland, unofficially as a Protectionist (though there was no protectionist organisation in Queensland at the time). In 1903, the National Liberal Union endorsed non-Labor candidates, and Glassey, as a Deakinite, did not receive endorsement.

It is a compact, woody shrub with several main stems, small, linear to club-shaped leaves, and rounded groups of deep pink flowers from late spring to mid-summer. ==Description== Verticordia pritzelii is a shrub which grows to a height of and with several stems at its base. The leaves are linear to club-shaped, semi-circular in cross-section, long with a small point on the end. The flowers are scented and arranged in rounded groups, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is hemispherical in shape, about long and there is a swelling beneath each sepal. The sepals are spreading, deep pink but fade to white as they age. They are long, have 4-6 long, long, thin lobes and two hairy appendages. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, long, erect and more or less round with small teeth on their outer edge. The style is long, with hairs near the tip. Flowering time is from October to early January. The deep colouration of the flowers of V. pritzelii and its compact habit distinguish it from other members of section Catocalypta. ==Taxonomy and naming== Verticordia pritzleii was first formally described by Ludwig Diels in 1904 from a specimen collected near Coolgardie. The description was published in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis. The specific epithet (pritzelii) honours Ernst Georg Pritzel who visited Diels in 1900. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Catocalypta along with V. inclusa, V. apecta, V. insignis, V. habrantha, V. lehmannii and V. roei. ==Distribution and habitat== Pritzel's featherflower is found in yellow or white to grey sand, on undulating plains between Perenjori, Bungalbin and Forrestania in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Mallee, Murchison and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Verticordia pritzelii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== This species shows potential as a garden plant and is relatively easy to propagate, however, it has proven difficult to maintain in the garden although previously grown successfully in Kings Park Botanical Garden. ==References== pritzelii Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1904 ","title":"Verticordia pritzelii"},{"id":"20231732","text":"Alexander Gavrylyuk (born 1984 in Kharkiv) is a USSR-born Ukrainian and Australian pianist. == Career == Gavrylyuk's first concert performance was at the age of nine.

Initial inspirational directions which Carpenter shared with Howarth included albums by Tangerine Dream and The Police. ==Release== The original release included a contractual obligation to provide a written musical score, which Howard manually transcribed after recording was completed.

The engagement was between Ngāti Toa on one side and a colonial force of European troops, police, and Ngāti Awa allies on the other. The colonial force commanded by Major Last was seeking to end resistance to European settlement in the Hutt Valley region. It was pursuing over 300 Ngāti Toa, including women and children, led by Te Rangihaeata. ==Action== The battle took place over several days in early August 1846, on a forest ridge around north of Pauatahanui. On the Government side was Ngāti Toa chief Rawiri Puaha and 100 Ngāti Toa warriors, as well as 150 Ngāti Awa \\"friendlies\\". Three government soldiers and at least nine Ngāti Toa were killed. On 6 August, the colonial force encountered Te Rangihaeata defending a breastwork at the crest of the narrow forest ridge. Elements of the colonial force advanced to within of the fortification, but pulled back to around after losing three men, including acting-brigade-major Ensign Blackburn, who was killed by a Ngāti Toa fighter concealed in a tree. Last was unwilling to launch a suicidal frontal assault, terrain and vegetation prevented a flanking manoeuvre. Over the next several hours, the colonials unleased a musket barrage of thousands of rounds, but with little effect. On 8 August, Last had two small mortars brought up to about three-quarters of a mile from the defenders. They fired around 80 shells, many landing in or near the fortification. Disinclined to attack, and vulnerable to a counter-attack, Last withdrew the regular troops on 10 August, leaving Ngāti Awa troops to launch an occasional skirmish. On 13 August, Ngāti Awa discovered Te Rangihaeata had slipped away under cover of rain and darkness. They set off northwards in pursuit. The final skirmish occurred on the seaward side of the Pouawha Range, inland of Wainui. Ngāti Awa lost three men, in return killing four Ngāti Toa, before Te Rangihaeata made good his escape. ==Legacy== The engagement pushed Te Rangihaeata out of the area and was one of the last fought between Maori and early colonial forces in the region. The site of the battle has been preserved as a recreational area named Battle Hill Farm Forest Park. ==References *Battle Hill Cemetery, with a photo of memorial to Roberts and Tuite Battle Hill Category:1846 in New Zealand ","title":"Battle of Battle Hill"},{"id":"20232068","text":"Mt. Taranaki which is revered by the Maori, was recently granted legal status as a person The Māori people have a strong and changing conservation ethic from the time of their discovery and settlement of New Zealand until the present day and is closely tied to spiritual beliefs. ==Māori settlement== The Maori people first arrived in New Zealand beginning in 950 AD. At the time, the biodiversity of New Zealand was much greater than the current state with the only mammals being three species of bats. As a result, a large and diverse bird population inhabited the forests of the land. The largest species of eagle known, Haast's eagle, was native to the South Island. The Maori people would have adverse impacts, hunting the flightless moa to extinction and clearing large swathes of forests, both to make way for settlements and to light fires in order to more easily hunt birds. Approximately half the native forests of New Zealand were destroyed within the first several hundred years. Without their primary foodsource (the moa) Haast's Eagle would go extinct sometime in the 15th century. Most devastating to the local bird populations, the Maori people introduced the Polynesian Rat to New Zealand. Most likely, the rats were brought as a food source by the Maori settlers, but would escape and soon infest the island. This was especially harmful to the avian species of New Zealand which had evolved no behavioural defence against the rats having long had few, if any, natural predators. The Maori's daily life was dictated by the season. The planting season was in October and the harvest in February. Trapping rats and birds was commonly practised by the forest tribes. Despite a relatively small population, the tribes claimed ownership of the entire island, periodically visiting land to substantiate claims. For the Maori, the land was not merely a resource, but a connection to ancestors. The mana of the tribe was strongly associated with the lands of that tribe. From this came the Maori proverb \\"Man perishes, but the land remains.\\" The Maori beliefs included Atua, invisible spirits connected to natural phenomena such as rainbows, trees, or stones. Sacred pools were known as wai tapu. It is the policy position of the New Zealand Green Party to return wai tapu to the iwi, as some are currently under control of the Conservation Estate. Large number of New Zealand pigeons flocking to feed on the fruit of the toromiro is an indicator of the mana of the forest. Because of this, this bird is generally only hunted for special occasions; the feathers are worn by Maori women of high social status. Rāhui is a form of protection of natural resources that Maori implemented as a conservation measure as well as other reasons. ==Contemporary viewpoints== A Cultural Health Index for waterways has been developed that links Western science and the cultural knowledge from Māori about stream health. Maori belief dictates that Tane, the god of forest and birds, created the first man. In Maori society, special status is granted to those known as the tangata whenua 'people of the land', or Maori who have resided in the local district for many generations. This is in contrast with the Maori with no ancestral connection to the land, known variously as tangata haere mai 'people who have come in', rawaho 'outsiders' or tauiwi 'foreigners'. Depending on the remoteness of the community, the percentage of tangate haere mai can vary from as few as 5% to in excess of 70%.Today, the term tangata whenua often is used to broadly differentiate between Māori and other groups. Also important to Maori's relation with nature was the concept of tapu, a dangerous energy that had to be properly nullified through ritual. Every natural resource had this, meaning, at least in theory, exploitation of natural resources was limited by tapu. Maori land laws, which dictate equal partitioning of inheritances among children, have had the effect of preserving the land by making individual land blocks too small for economic use. Compounded with this, Maori of the older generation are culturally disinclined to sell their shares to developers, making the primary economic activity on these lands cutting firewood or cultivating small gardens. Maori blame European prohibition laws, many of which were implemented during the colonial era, for usurping the mana and contributing to the declining biodiversity of New Zealand. In particular, Maori pointed to the continuing decline to the New Zealand Pigeon in spite of prohibitions on hunting, claiming Tane was removing them as they were no longer being used by the people. Regaining responsibility for the environment of New Zealand is seen not only as important from a conservation standpoint, but critical to truly be tangata whenua. == Māori Ecological Knowledge == A team of researchers studied Maori traditional ecological knowledge of the Tuatara, a reptile native to New Zealand through oral questioning of elders. This is particularly important because the Tuatara is a living fossil, being the last living member of its taxonomic order. The Tuatara had been driven extinct on the main island and exists only on 37 offshore islands. The elders' testimony correctly matched existing scientific knowledge regarding the physiology, diet, range, and behavior . The researchers concluded that \\"In at least some cases, traditional ecological knowledge may persist as species decline and may serve as a valuable source of ecological information for conservation.\\" They additionally discovered through the testimony seven more sites that the Tuatara inhabited in recent times. Culturally, the Tuatara are generally considered a bad omen, though 20% of elders report Tuatara being kept as pets. Tuatara, which have a primitive \\"third eye\\", and a long natural lifespan, are believed to have great knowledge and ability to see hidden things. Conversely, elders of the Ngai Wai Iwi report putting the reptiles under their shirts to stay cool. In the paper, Ramstad concludes \\"Our current understanding of Maori attitudes toward tuatara needs revising to accommodate this heterogeneity in traditional ecological knowledge. Not all Maori fear tuatara, not all iwi subsisted historically on tuatara, and the cultural role of tuatara differs over time and among iwi.\\" == Legal Status of Geographic Locations == Today, approximately one third of New Zealand is under the mandate of the Department of Conservation. Whanganui River was recognized as having the legal status as a person by the government of New Zealand in 2017, ending that countries longest running litigation, which had begun 160 years ago. Prior to European settlement, the river was important for being easily navigable, which allowed widespread settlements through the Whanganui River valley. Prior to European colonization, this region was the most densely populated on the North Island. Regarding this status, the lead negotiator for the Whanganui Tribe, Gerrard Albert, stated “The reason we have taken this approach is because we consider the river an ancestor and always have...We can trace our genealogy to the origins of the universe, and therefore rather than us being masters of the natural world, we are part of it. \\" Two legal guardians, one from the tribe and one from the New Zealand government, are appointed. A Maori MP, Adtian Rurawhe, stated that \\"From a Whanganui viewpoint the wellbeing of the river is directly linked to the well-being of the people,\\" referring to the mana of the tangata whenua. Mount Taranki has been granted similar legal status later in 2017, with eight tribes and the New Zealand government acting as legal guardians. The Minister for treaty negotiations, Andrew Little, said of the decision \\"Today’s agreements are a major milestone in acknowledging the grievances and hurt from the past as the Taranaki iwi experienced some of the worst examples of Crown behaviour in the 19th century\\". Albert hopes that these decisions will set a precedent for other Maori tribes to grant legal personhood to geographic locations. Part of what is now Tongariro National Park was given to The Crown by the Maori chief Te Heuheu Tukino IV to ensure its protection. == Haka Kererū == The Haka Kererū was a ceremonial dance that \\"served to make the connection between the environment and the people, and points to the fundamental platform of life and existence—Papatūānuku (Mother Earth)\\". During its last recorded performance in 1972, \\"huahua (preserved kererū)\\" was served. The haka references the ecological devastation caused by European colonists.

He served on the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Panel on Leprosy and on the council of the International Leprosy Association, and received national honours in recognition of his work. Souza Araújo was born in Imbituva, Paraná, Brazil, in 1886. He graduated from the Escola de Farmácia de Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais and enrolled immediately at the Faculdade de Medicina de Rio de Janeiro, finishing there in 1915. While still a student, he also completed the Curso de Applicação offered by the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (IOC) in 1913. He received his doctorate from IOC, with his thesis entitled Estudo sobre o granuloma venéreo. His training concluded with the courses in Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in the USA in 1926, and in Dermatology at the London School of Dermatology between 1930 and 1931. After graduation Souza Araújo remained affiliated with the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz and began to concentrate on the area of leprology. During the 1920s he served as head of the Rural Sanitary Service of Pará, opening the Lazarópolis do Prata leprosarium on June 24, 1924. He later wrote a monograph on this leprosarium. As a researcher at IOC he published around 210 scientific works and headed the Leprology Laboratory from 1927 to 1956. He also edited the journal Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz during the same period. He was head of the Bacteriology Section and of the Division of Microbiology and Immunology from 1946 to 1956, and professor of the application course from 1928 to 1956. As an internationally renowned researcher Souza Araújo had an important role in the creation of the International Society of Leprology, holding the post of vice-president from 1932 to 1956. He dedicated himself to research into the control and treatment of leprosy, and played an important role both as a formulator of policy and as a critic of the policies and public initiatives in the field. He visited the main institutions involved in the study of and fight against the disease, both in Brazil and abroad. He was nominated Knight- Commander of the Military and Hospital Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem in 1936 and was a member of the WHO Expert Panel on Leprosy. Despite retiring in 1956, Souza Araújo continued working at the IOC until his death in 1962. In 1960 the Brazilian government awarded him the Order of Medical Merit in recognition of his outstanding work. He was a Councillor of the International Leprosy Association and patron of the Center for the Study of Leprosy of the University of Parana, to which he donated his personal collection of books on leprosy. ==Publications== *A História da Lepra no Brasil: Volume I, 1946.

His nickname is Big Daddy. ==Career== PDC Young made his PDC World Darts Championship debut in 2005 where he lost in the first round to fellow left-hander Josephus Schenk. He returned a year later but lost again in the first round, this time losing 3–0 to Mark Dudbridge. Young has appeared in five successive Las Vegas Desert Classics, reaching the second round in four of them. In 2004, he beat Lionel Sams in the first round before losing to Wayne Mardle. In 2005, he defeated Andy Hamilton in round one, but lost in the second round to Canadian John Part. 2006 saw a first round exit for Young in the Desert Classic, losing to Raymond van Barneveld, who was making his debut in the event. In 2007, Young defeated another Desert Classic debutant Tony Eccles in round one, but lost to Dennis Smith 8–7 in the second round. In the 2008 Desert Classic, Young defeated qualifier Martin Burchell in the first round before losing to Adrian Gray in the second round. On the eve of the 2008 US Open, Young claimed the biggest win of his career, winning the North American Darts Championship, earning him $15,000. His performances made him the top ranked player in the North American Order of Merit, earning him a spot in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. He was drawn in Group F with Terry Jenkins, Colin Lloyd and Wildcard qualifier Wes Newton. Young won his opening group game against Jenkins, coming from 3–0 down to win 5–4. He lost his next group game to Newton but then defeated Lloyd to advance to the second round where he lost to van Barneveld. Young qualified for the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship as the number one player in the American order of merit. He lost in the first round to Dutch teenager Michael van Gerwen. In the 2009 Grand Slam of Darts, Young again advanced from his group but again lost in the second round, in a last leg decider to Robert Thornton. At the 2010 PDC World Darts Championship, Young defeated Andy Smith 3–2 in the first round, before losing in the second round 4–0 to Terry Jenkins. Young was then a finalist in the 2010 North American Dart Championship, beating 1994 World Matchplay Darts champion Larry Butler before losing to former three-time world champion John Part in the final. He topped the North American order of merit once more to reach the 2011 World Championship, but was whitewashed 0–3 to Wes Newton. Despite winning the first set in the 2012 World Championship first round against Colin Lloyd, Young would go on to lose the match 1–3. He then represented the United States with Gary Mawson in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts and reached the quarter-finals, where they were defeated by England 1–3, having beaten Germany in the second round. Young qualified for the 2013 PDC World Championship where, for the second year in a row, he was involved in a tight game with Colin Lloyd in the first round. He took the first set and also led 2–1, but was eventually edged out in a deciding set by six legs to four. Young played in his third World Cup of Darts and first with Larry Butler in February 2013, but they finished bottom of Group F after losing 4–5 to Finland and 3–5 to Germany. He won two events on the North American Pro Tour during the year and finished runner-up in two others to top the Order of Merit. This earned Young a first round spot in the 2014 PDC World Championship where he suffered a nightmare on doubles against Mervyn King as he could only hit one out of twenty to lose 3–0. In the second round of the 2014 World Cup of Darts, Butler lost to England's Phil Taylor, but Young beat Adrian Lewis meaning a doubles match was required to settle the tie which the United States pair lost 4–1. In September he won the Japanese Soft Tip event by beating Shintaro Inoue in the final. Young also reached the final of the Las Vegas event but lost to Boris Krčmar. In 2015, Young claimed the Port City Open, Virginia Beach Dart Classic and the PDC Spectacular, the latter of which earned him a place in the 2016 World Championship. He won the first set against Terry Jenkins, but went on to lose 3–1 which marks Young's fifth successive first round exit in the event. Young retained his Virginia Beach Dart Classic title and lost in the final of the North American Qualifier for the 2017 World Championship. At the 2017 World Cup Team USA beat Italy 5–1 in the first round and Young lost 4–1 to Michael van Gerwen in round two, but Butler defeated Raymond van Barneveld 4–2 to send the match into a deciding doubles game which the Netherlands won 4–0. In the 2020 World Championship, which Young qualified for by being the highest ranked player from the United States on the CDC rankings, he became the last player to beat Raymond van Barneveld in a professional match by beating him 3-1. In Round 2, he lost to Jeffrey de Zwaan, after having one match dart at double 8 to win 3-1. ==World Championship results== PDC * 2005: First round (lost to Josephus Schenk 2–3) * 2006: First round (lost to Mark Dudbridge 0–3) * 2009: First round (lost to Michael van Gerwen 1–3) * 2010: Second round (lost to Terry Jenkins 0–4) * 2011: First round (lost to Wes Newton 0–3) * 2012: First round (lost to Colin Lloyd 1–3) * 2013: First round (lost to Colin Lloyd 2–3) * 2014: First round (lost to Mervyn King 0–3) * 2016: First round (lost to Terry Jenkins 1–3) * 2020: Second round (lost to Jeffrey de Zwaan 2–3) ==Performance timeline== {  style=\\"width:60%; margin:0\\" - !

The maximum possible length of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence is bounded by the number of its distinct symbols multiplied by a small but nonconstant factor that depends on the number of alternations that are allowed. Davenport–Schinzel sequences were first defined in 1965 by Harold Davenport and Andrzej Schinzel to analyze linear differential equations. Following these sequences and their length bounds have also become a standard tool in discrete geometry and in the analysis of geometric algorithms., pp. x and 2. ==Definition== A finite sequence U = u1, u2, u3, is said to be a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order s if it satisfies the following two properties: #No two consecutive values in the sequence are equal to each other. #If x and y are two distinct values occurring in the sequence, then the sequence does not contain a subsequence ... x, ... y, ..., x, ..., y, ... consisting of s + 2 values alternating between x and y. For instance, the sequence :1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3 is a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order 3: it contains alternating subsequences of length four, such as ...1, ... 2, ... 1, ... 2, ... (which appears in four different ways as a subsequence of the whole sequence) but it does not contain any alternating subsequences of length five. If a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order s includes n distinct values, it is called an (n,s) Davenport–Schinzel sequence, or a DS(n,s)-sequence.See , p. 1, for this notation. ==Length bounds== The complexity of DS(n,s)-sequence has been analyzed asymptotically in the limit as n goes to infinity, with the assumption that s is a fixed constant, and nearly tight bounds are known for all s. Let λs(n) denote the length of the longest DS(n,s)-sequence. The best bounds known on λs involve the inverse Ackermann function :α(n) = min { m  A(m,m) ≥ n }, where A is the Ackermann function. Due to the very rapid growth of the Ackermann function, its inverse α grows very slowly, and is at most four for problems of any practical size., p. 14.

The lower envelope of a set of functions ƒi(x) of a real variable x is the function given by their pointwise minimum: :ƒ(x) = miniƒi(x). Suppose that these functions are particularly well behaved: they are all continuous, and any two of them are equal on at most s values. With these assumptions, the real line can be partitioned into finitely many intervals within which one function has values smaller than all of the other functions. The sequence of these intervals, labeled by the minimizing function within each interval, forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order s. Thus, any upper bound on the complexity of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of this order also bounds the number of intervals in this representation of the lower envelope. In the original application of Davenport and Schinzel, the functions under consideration were a set of different solutions to the same homogeneous linear differential equation of order s. Any two distinct solutions can have at most s values in common, so the lower envelope of a set of n distinct solutions forms a DS(n,s)-sequence. The same concept of a lower envelope can also be applied to functions that are only piecewise continuous or that are defined only over intervals of the real line; however, in this case, the points of discontinuity of the functions and the endpoints of the interval within which each function is defined add to the order of the sequence. For instance, a non-vertical line segment in the plane can be interpreted as the graph of a function mapping an interval of x values to their corresponding y values, and the lower envelope of a collection of line segments forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order three because any two line segments can form an alternating subsequence with length at most four. == See also == * Squarefree word ==NotesReferences== *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. == External links == * Davenport-Schinzel Sequence, from MathWorld. * Davenport-Schinzel Sequences, a section in the book Motion Planning, by Steven M.

Ferrara based the film on The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, directed by John Cassavetes. It stars Willem Dafoe as a strip club owner and co-stars Bob Hoskins, Asia Argento and Matthew Modine. Ferrara had the cast improvise much of their lines. He described the film as his \\"first intentional comedy\\". ==Plot== Ray Ruby, who manages Ray Ruby’s Paradise, is worried about fewer tourists visiting the establishment so he decides to hold a lottery to bring them in. Ray is running out of money but people expect to be paid, including the pole dancers. A landlady by the name of Lillian plans on using the spot for a Bed Bath & Beyond location if she does not receive rent money. Desperate for money to keep the establishment open, Ray tries to find the winning ticket of his own lottery. His brother Johnnie helps keep the strip club open. The film shows the lives of people who depend on the strip club and what the lack of money does to them. ==Cast== * Willem Dafoe - Ray Ruby * Bob Hoskins - The Baron * Matthew Modine - Johnie Ruby * Asia Argento - Monroe * Riccardo Scamarcio - Doctor Steven * Sylvia Miles - Lilian Murray * Roy Dotrice - Jay * Joseph Cortese - Danny Cash (as Joe Cortese) * Burt Young - Murray * Stefania Rocca - Debby * Bianca Balti - Adrian * Shanyn Leigh - Dolle * Lou Doillon - Lola * Frankie Cee - Luigi * Anita Pallenberg - Sin * Andy Luotto - Stanley * Romina Power - Yolanda Vega * Julie McNiven - Madison The part of Ray Ruby was offered to Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel.Cryptekeeper 044 Abel Ferrara/New Rose Hotel at YouTube ==Release== It was screened out of competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

He was the Left Party's nominee for the 2009 presidential election, but was not considered a serious candidate by the German media. ==Early life== Sodann was born on June 1, 1936 in Meissen to a working-class family. After training to be a toolmaker, he moved to Leipzig in order to study law. In 1959 he transferred to the Theaterhochschule Leipzig, where he led a cabaret group. The group's performance was deemed subversive by the East German authorities and closed in 1961. Sodann was arrested by the Stasi and spent nine months in prison and was on probation for four years.\\"Vita,\\" official biography.\\"'Liberté, Egalité, Pfefferminztee',\\" Der Spiegel (8 July 2005). ==Acting career== In 1964 Sodann made his first performance with the Berliner Ensemble. In the following years, he acted and produced plays in Erfurt, Chemnitz and Magdeburg. In 1980, he moved to Halle and for years worked as a director there. He began acting in television shows during the late 1970s. In 1991 he first appeared in his most famous screen role, Police Commissioner Bruno Ehrlicher, in the long-running crime series Tatort. He remained with the series until November 2007. Since 2007 he has starred in a traveling act \\"Ost-West-Vis-à-Vis\\" with CDU politician and former Labor Minister Norbert Blüm.\\"Peter Sodann,\\" Internet Movie Database. ==Political activities== Sodann has been a vocal supporter of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which in 2007 became the Left Party. In July 2005 he announced his interest in running as a candidate of the PDS in Saxony for the 2005 federal election.Jens Schneider, \\"Des Kommissars neuer Tatort,\\" Sueddeutsche Zeitung (4 July 2005). However, he later withdrew himself from considering, citing restrictions on media employment for Bundestag politicians. On October 13, 2008, the Left Party's Bundestag delegation nominated Sodann as their candidate for the 2009 presidential election.\\"Peter Sodann wäre ein Bundespräsident des Volkes,\\" statement by Bisky, Gysi and Lafontaine (14 October 2008).

Since the German president is elected by the Bundesversammlung, in which the vast majority of seats would be held by the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, Sodann stood little chance of winning. Indeed, he finished third in the election, in which the incumbent Horst Köhler was re-elected. ==Personal life== Sodann is currently married to his second wife, Cornelia.

Webb studied at Canberra Grammar School and Yanco Agricultural College, and was a grazier before entering politics. He served a number of terms on the Shire of Yarrowlumla council, including several years as its mayor. He was subsequently preselected as the National Party candidate for the open local seat of Monaro, which had been vacated by retiring maverick National MLA Peter Cochran.Purches, Andrew. \\"Nationals preselect Webb to contest Monaro in NSW poll\\".

Most notable among those performing on Moonshot are the Memphis Horns, whilst production was by Buffy herself with Neon Philharmonic bass player Norbert Putnam, who had produced Joan Baez' last Vanguard release Blessed Are... and was to produce Buffy's next two albums as well. == Marketing and sales == Although the album itself fared little better commercially than its predecessor, only spending seven weeks on the Billboard Top 200, an extensive promotional campaign by Vanguard and extensive AM radio airplay saw the closing track, a cover of Mickey Newbury's \\"Mister Can't You See\\", become Sainte-Marie's sole significant commercial success in the States, spending two weeks in the lower reaches of the Top 40 in late April and early May 1972. However, Sainte-Marie was very upset with Vanguard's extensive promotion of the single and this was one reason why she only recorded one more album for the label before moving to MCA in 1973. == Critical reception == According to Robert Christgau, \\"those who love or even respect [Saint-Marie were] dismayed\\" by Moonshot. Reviewing in May 1972 for The San Diego Door, Cameron Crowe derided the album as the singer's \\"most embarrassing to date\\" and a victim of overproduction in the music industry. He was particularly critical of the music's use of electric solo breaks and the Memphis Horns to emphasize the lyrics. Janet Maslin was more enthusiastic about the record in Rolling Stone, applauding Sainte-Marie's stylistic range and refashioning of her vocals to suit the music's varied moods. \\"What's best about Moonshot\\", Maslin believed, \\"is that, considering the kind of experimental stylistic departure it represents, it nonetheless bears such a strongly personal stamp.\\" Ramparts magazine found the song selection effectively diverse, the music powerful, and Saint-Marie \\"capable of writing lines that jump out of a loudspeaker and grab the listener by the mind\\". Christgau was less impressed by her \\"unique attempt at a rock record\\" when he first reviewed it for Creem, but later said she had finally done \\"something overtly perverse—come out of Nashville with what sounds in its most interesting moments like an art-pop record (with politics, of course)\\", and encouraged her to expand upon its musical experimentation. In another retrospective review, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann wrote that Moonshot was \\"not the Buffy Sainte-Marie of her early political period, but the album demonstrates her versatility, and it works as an appealing pop effort.\\" Exclaim! journalist Andrea Warner recommended the record in her \\"essential guide\\" to the singer's music, writing that it is \\"filled with all sorts of era-specific flourishes, yet also feels timeless\\". Paul Evans was more critical in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992), regarding it as \\"her slightest record\\". ==Track listing== All songs composed by Buffy Sainte-Marie except where noted. # \\"Not the Lovin' Kind\\" – 3:53 # \\"You Know How to Turn on Those Lights\\" – 2:05 # \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand Forever\\" – 2:59 # \\"He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo\\" – 2:09 # \\"Lay It Down\\" (Gene Thomasson) – 2:47 # \\"Moonshot\\" – 3:49 # \\"Native North American Child\\" – 2:14 # \\"My Baby Left Me\\" (Arthur Crudup) – 3:01 # \\"Sweet Memories\\" (Mickey Newbury) – 3:19 # \\"Jeremiah\\" – 3:08 # \\"Mister Can't You See\\" (Mickey Newbury, Townes Van Zandt) – 3:17 ==Personnel== *Buffy Sainte-Marie – vocals, guitar, piano *Charlie McCoy, Billy Sanford – guitar *Norbert Putnam – bass *David Briggs – keyboards *Kenny Buttrey – drums *Memphis Horns ==Charts== Billboard (North America) {  !Year !Chart !Peak position - 1972 Pop Albums align=\\"center\\"134 } Single {  !Year !Single !Chart !Position - 1972 \\"Mister Can't You See\\" Billboard Pop Singles align=\\"center\\"38 - 1972 \\"He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo\\" Billboard Pop Singles align=\\"center\\"98 - } ==References External links == * Moonshot (album) Moonshot (album) Moonshot (album) ","title":"Moonshot (album)"},{"id":"20232735","text":" Washington (SP-1241) was a seagoing schooner barge that served in the United States Navy in 1917.

He won a major event, the 2010 Players Championship Finals, where he defeated Mervyn King in the final. He was also the runner-up to Phil Taylor in the 2011 Championship League Darts, and part of the Australia team which lost a sudden death shoot-out to England in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts final. Nicholson also acts as a sports commentator and TV and radio pundit. He was nicknamed \\"The Asset\\", and was known for coming on to the stage with sunglasses, and was also known for his Wrestling-style walk ons, using the song \\"Club Foot\\" as his walk on music for most of his career. Nicholson had a feud with Phil Taylor during the 2011 UK Open, in which he supposedly \\"waved goodbye\\" to Taylor after beating him in a sudden death leg to reach the quarter-finals. ==Career== 2008/2009 Before joining the PDC Pro Tour, Nicholson was one of the top players in the Australian Grand Prix circuit, winning 15 titles in 2008. His performances led him to the top of the DPA rankings and earned him a spot in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. He was drawn in Group H with Kevin Painter, Darryl Fitton and WDF number one Gary Anderson. Nicholson caused a surprise, as he beat Anderson 5–4 in his opening group game. This was despite constant booing from the crowd, who began chanting \\"Who Are You?\\" during his walk-on and after his first three darts which was a maximum 180, he put his finger to his mouth at the crowd which caused the crowd to boo him almost every time he threw his darts. Despite beating Anderson, losses to Fitton and Painter eliminated him at the group stage. Nicholson earned qualification for the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship through the DPA rankings. He defeated Adrian Gray in the first round, winning all nine legs for a three sets to nil victory. He then beat world number 6 Adrian Lewis in the second round 4–3 and then came from two sets down to beat world number 11 Dennis Priestley 4–2 to advance to the quarter finals. In the quarter-finals, he lost to world number 3 at the time, James Wade but his tournament performance lifted him into the top 50 on the PDC Order of Merit. After his performance in the World Championship, Nicholson decided to leave the DPA and play in the PDC Pro Tour in an attempt to qualify for the UK Open. His last 16 place in the Southern Regional finals ensured his qualification for the tournament. He beat Gary Anderson 6 legs to 4 in the second round, before losing 9–7 to pub qualifier Ken Mather, whereafter his relationship with the crowd soured further, claiming Mather's crowd had repeatedly shouted out while he was throwing. After the match as the crowd chanted \\"who are you\\" directed at Nicholson, he responded using profanity towards the crowd which he was later fined for by the DRA. Nicholson reached the semi-final of the PDPA Players Championship Barnsley 2, defeating Gary Mawson, Mark Dudbridge, John MaGowan, Justin Pipe and Denis Ovens before losing out to Colin Osborne, the eventual winner. Nicholson did not enter the qualifiers for the Las Vegas Desert Classic and failed to qualify for the World Matchplay. 2010 In 2010, Nicholson claimed his first PDC title, The Totesport Player's Championship. He had to play the quarter-final, the semi-final and the final in the same day. In the quarter-final he defeated Adrian Lewis 9–7. He then overcame reigning champion Phil Taylor 10–9 in the semi-finals, and followed this up with a 13–11 victory over Mervyn King in the final. During the latter stages of the tournament, the crowd started to support Nicholson due to his efforts against higher ranked and more experienced opponents (in particular Taylor), and as a result he relaxed his behaviour leading many pundits such as Alan Warriner-Little to suggest that he might give up the 'bad boy' image and just be himself.Nicholson Claims Purfleet Glory Planetdarts In March 2010, he moved into the top 16 of the PDC Order of merit for the first time. In the UK Open 2010, he beat Kirk Shepherd 9–6 in the third round, and 7–9 to Gary Anderson in the fourth round. On his World Matchplay debut, he lost 3–10 to Steve Beaton in the first round. 2011 In the 2011 World Championship, Nicholson continued reached the second round. He won his first title since January 2010 by winning the Crawley Players Championship (1) by defeating Adrian Lewis 6–4. He also came through a semi final clash with Gary Anderson defeating him 6–5. At the 2011 UK Open, Nicholson won final-leg deciders against Gary Anderson in round four, and Phil Taylor in round five, to reach the quarter-finals. He lost 7–10 to eventual champion James Wade. At the 2011 World Matchplay, Nicholson defeated Colin Osborne in the first round to secure a second-round match with Raymond van Barneveld. At the 2011 Championship League Darts, Nicholson lost 6–1 to Phil Taylor in the final. 2012 Nicholson made it to the last 16 of the 2012 World Championship by recording 3–1 and 4–0 victories over Mensur Suljović and Alan Tabern respectively. He next played Belgian Kim Huybrechts and won the first set, before losing 12 of the next 14 legs to exit the tournament 1–4. He hit 21% of his doubles in the match. After losing in the final of the Spanish Players Championship, Nicholson partnered Simon Whitlock again for the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts. Together they had victories over Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands to reach their first World Cup final, where they played the English pair of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis. Australia found themselves 0–3 down in the final, meaning that Nicholson had to beat Lewis in the last singles match and then win the doubles to force the tie to a sudden-death leg for the World Cup crown. Australia won both of the matches 7–4 and in the sudden-death leg Whitlock and Nicholson both missed two darts each to secure the title, with Lewis hitting the winning double for England. After the match Nicholson vowed that Australia would win the title in the future. In June, Nicholson missed ten darts to reach the quarter-finals of the UK Open as he lost 8–9 to Denis Ovens in the last 16. In the World Matchplay he was beaten 6–10 by Andy Smith. After his 0–6 first round defeat to Andy Hamilton in the European Championship he did some commentating for ESPN who were broadcasting the tournament in the UK. At the World Grand Prix he beat Michael Mansell and Colin Osborne to reach his first quarter-final in the event. He faced Wes Newton and led 2–0 in sets, but was unable to take out 106 for a straight sets win and instead went on to lose 2–3. In October, he reached his first final since the World Cup in February at the fifth European Tour Event of the year, the Dutch Darts Masters. His run included a win over Michael van Gerwen, who had won four tournaments in the previous two months and a semi-final victory over Wayne Jones who beat Phil Taylor in the previous round. He faced compatriot Whitlock in a first all Australian final on the PDC ProTour and lost 1–6, admitting afterwards that he had run out of steam by the conclusion of the tournament. At the Grand Slam of Darts, Nicholson lost two out of his three Group F games to finish third in the table and fail to qualify for the last 16. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Nicholson was 18th on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He missed one dart in the deciding leg against Ronnie Baxter in the first round, losing 5–6. 2013 Nicholson lost in the second round of the 2013 World Championship to Robert Thornton. He survived a total of five match darts from Thornton to take the match into a sudden death leg, which he lost. Nicholson never had a dart to win himself but did throw for the match during the final set. In his third World Cup of Darts with Simon Whitlock the pair were beaten in the last 16 when the Belgian brothers of Ronny and Kim Huybrechts defeated them 1–5. On 16 & 17 March 2013, Nicholson had wins over Dave Chisnall, Ross Smith, Darren Whittingham, Louis Blundell, Kim Huybrechts, Brendan Dolan, Co Stompé, Richie Burnett and Ronnie Baxter to secure back-to-back quarter final spots in the Speedy Services UK Open Qualifier 3 & Qualifier 4 events in Wigan. He was then whitewashed by Michael van Gerwen 6–0 in the quarter-final of Qualifier 3 and lost to 6–5 Gary Anderson the following day in the quarter-final of Qualifier 4.http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/11uq88q6ca7zu1efirgkyvh8pv/title/three-and- easy-for-van- gerwenhttp://www.pdc.tv/news/article/19rx65en5uja71093tl3sxbh04/title/speedy- services-uk-open-q4-latest Nicholson competed a few weeks later at the European Darts Trophy in Sindelfingen, Germany. He saw off Ronny Huybrechts 6–5 in the first round before coming back from 5–1 down to defeat Colin Lloyd in the last 32. He then claimed wins over Dean Winstanley and Mark Webster to secure a semi-final clash with world number three Michael van Gerwen. He saw off van Gerwen 6–2 to face Wes Newton in the final. Nicholson missed nine darts to lead 5–3 and in the deciding leg had three darts to win the tournament on 24, but hit a single 12 with his first and burst his score by hitting a single 13 with his second and lost the match 5–6. He reached another final in May at the third Players Championship but was defeated 4–6 by Jamie Caven. Nicholson lost 9–5 to John Bowles in the third round of the UK Open. In the opening round of the World Matchplay he saw 4–1 and 8–7 leads over Dave Chisnall turn into a 10–8 defeat and was in tears on the stage during the final leg. Nicholson said later that the feeling of not having enough during the match was too much to handle, but hoped the experience would be a starting point for a new phase in his career. He reached the last 16 of the Grand Slam of Darts losing heavily to James Wade 10–1. 2014 Nicholson beat Stuart Kellett 3–0 in the opening round of the 2014 World Championship, but Kevin Painter beat Nicholson 4–0 in the subsequent round. He co-commentated on the final, for BBC Radio 5 Live. Nicholson lost 9–5 to Terry Jenkins in the UK Open fourth round. Nicholson and Whitlock won through to the semi-finals of the World Cup of Darts where they faced England's Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis in a repeat of 2012's final. Whitlock was beaten 4–1 by Taylor, before Nicholson overcame Lewis 4–2 to mean a doubles match was required to settle the tie which Australia lost 4–0. Nicholson overcame Robert Thornton 10–8 in the first round of the World Matchplay, explaining later that his form had suffered over the previous months due to pains in his neck and shoulders which he has worked with an acupuncturist to help relieve. In the second round, Wes Newton fought back from 5–0 and 8–3 deficits and went on to survive five match darts from Nicholson to knock him out 15–13. This was the last major Nicholson played in during the year as he failed to qualify for the World Grand Prix, European Championship, Grand Slam and Players Championship Finals. 2015 Nicholson walked onto the stage without sunglasses for the first time in his career at the 2015 World Championship in a further attempt to move away from his bad boy of darts image. His first round match against Benito van de Pas went to a deciding set in which Nicholson lost all three legs to exit the tournament. He left his darts on the stage afterwards and said that he was unsure what he would do in the future. He returned to play the full schedule of events and qualified for the third round of the 2015 UK Open in which he drew Michael van Gerwen and lost 9–3. In the quarter-finals of the World Cup Nicholson knew a win over Belgium's Kim Huybrechts would see Australia reach the semis. He was 3–0 up but then missed a total of six match darts which led to him losing 4–3. Australia then lost the deciding doubles match 4–2. Nicholson failed to qualify for another PDC major event and could not get past the last 16 of any Pro Tour tournament. He fell outside the top 32 on the Order of Merit during the year and after losing in the first round of the qualifier it meant that missed out on playing in the World Championship for the first time since the 2008 event. 2016 Nicholson failed to qualify for the 2016 UK Open for the first time since the 2008 event. He reached the last 16 of one event all year, the 13th Players Championship, by beating Nathan Aspinall, Kyle Anderson (the player who has replaced him in Australia's World Cup team) and Simon Whitlock, but he then lost 6–1 to Benito van de Pas. He began commentating for the PDC during European Tour events and also for the BBC in the inaugural Champions League of Darts. 2017 Nicholson was a studio analyst and commentator on Channel 4's coverage of the 2017 BDO World Darts Championship. He was ranked 84th after the 2017 PDC World Championship and played in Q School to try and win his place on the tour back. He lost in the final round of the third day to Richie Burnett, before going all the way on the last day to earn a two-year Tour Card. The rest of Nicholson’s year was good enough to give him enough ranking money to qualify for the 2017 Players Championship Finals, although being the 59th seed meant he had to play Michael van Gerwen and lost 6–3. 2018 Nicholson, needing a good year to hold on to his tour card, made a good start by qualifying for the UK Open, where he eventually lost to Paul Hogan 10–6 in the third round. He continued his form by winning through to a European tour semi-final, where he was beaten by Adrian Lewis; this run effectively sealed his spot in the European Championships, as the 32nd seed, and the World Championships, due to there being more spots open to Pro Tour qualifiers this year. Nicholson made his return to the European Championship, where he was up against the top seed Michael van Gerwen. He made a good account of himself by opening with back-to- back twelve-darters with a 127 checkout on the bullseye, but failed to hit darts to go 3–2 up, and failed to win another leg; he lost 6–2. 2019 He announced on 11 January that he will not attend the 2019 PDC Q School in an attempt to renew his tour card. He insisted he needed to work on his darts, game and head in order to get himself ready for 2020. 2020 Ahead of Q-School, Nicholson announced that he will no longer be representing Australia in an interview with the BDO https://twitter.com/OfficialPDC/status/1211587735061843968 ==Feud with Phil Taylor== In the 2011 UK Open, Nicholson defeated Phil Taylor in the last 16 by 9 legs to 8 and supposedly waved goodbye to him. While being interviewed at that year's World Matchplay, Nicholson spoke of Taylor's reaction and stated that when they met again, if Taylor did not bring his 'A' game he would \\"put him to bed\\". Nicholson defended the gesture saying: 'I was waving bye-bye to the demons which had dogged me in too many televised tournaments'. The comments garnered much media attention. Taylor reacted angrily to Nicholson's comments, telling BBC Radio Stoke, \\"I think he's very, very silly.\\" Taylor added that Nicholson \\"has a big mouth and won't keep it shut\\". He played Taylor in an eagerly anticipated match at the 2011 European Darts Championships and was beaten 10–7, despite being 7–6 ahead. He was then defeated at the 2011 World Grand Prix by Taylor 3–0. ==CM Punk Association== During his walk-on in his second-round match against Raymond van Barneveld in the 2011 World Matchplay, Nicholson mimicked former WWE wrestler CM Punk by having X's marked on his hands, and also lifted up a Nexus scarf. However, he lost the match, 13–9. Then, when he met Phil Taylor, he once again mimicked CM Punk during his walk-on, using his signature pose on one knee, shouting \\"It's clobberin' time\\" and punching the air. During Taylor's walk-on, Nicholson sat Indian-style on the stage, another trait of CM Punk, in an attempt to anger Taylor. ==Career finals== PDC major finals: 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up) { class=\\"sortable \\" - width=\\"80\\"Outcome width=\\"20\\"No. width=\\"50\\"Year  style=\\"width:250px;\\"Championship  style=\\"width:200px;\\"Opponent in the final width=\\"70\\"Score(l) = score in legs, (s) = score in sets. -ffebcd;\\"  98FB98\\"Winner  1.  2010  Players Championship Finals   13–11 (l) -bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  ffa07a;\\"Runner-up  1.  2011  Championship League   1–6 (l) } PDC team finals: 1 (1 runner- up) { class=\\"sortable \\" -  style=\\"width:80px;\\" Outcome  style=\\"width:20px;\\" No.  style=\\"width:50px;\\" Year  Championship  Country  Teammate Opponents in the final  style=\\"width:70px;\\" Score(l) = score in legs, (s) = score in sets. - style=  ffa07a;\\"Runner-up  1.  2012      3–4 (m) } ==World Championship results== PDC * 2009: Quarter-finals (lost to James Wade 3–5) * 2010: First round (lost to Terry Jenkins 2–3) * 2011: Second round (lost to Peter Wright 2–4) * 2012: Third round (lost to Kim Huybrechts 1–4) * 2013: Second round (lost to Robert Thornton 3–4) * 2014: Second round (lost to Kevin Painter 0–4) * 2015: First round (lost to Benito van de Pas 2–3) *2019: First round (lost to Kevin Burness 0–3) ==Performance timeline== {  style=\\"width:50%; margin:0\\" - !

Kickoff was scheduled for 8PM EST/5pm PST, and was televised by ABC as part of its Saturday Night Football package. Per Big 12 policy, the Big 12 South Champion was declared the home team because the game took place in a home state of a Big 12 North team. Entering the game, designated \\"home\\" teams were 8-4 in Big 12 Championship Games. ==Selection process== The Big 12 Championship Game matched up the winners of the North and South divisions of the Big 12 Conference. The game was first played in 1996,https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E3D7153FF934A35751C1A960958260 when the conference was formed from the previous Big 8 plus four teams from the disbanded Southwest Conference. The championship game was somewhat modeled on the SEC format, which was the first conference in college football to have a conference championship game. Seven Division I FBS conferences currently have championship games—the AAC, ACC, Big Ten, C-USA, MAC, Pac-12, and SEC. However, the Big 12 title game ended after the 2010 edition. A major conference realignment that started in 2010 and carried over into 2011 saw the Big 12 drop to 10 members, below the 12 required by NCAA rules for a conference championship game. The same realignment saw the Big Ten and former Pac-10 expand to 12 teams each; both conferences held their first championship games in 2011. The Big 12 Championship Game has since returned in the 2017 season, with the top two teams playing in the game. ==Regular season== The Big 12 South representative in the game was the Oklahoma Sooners. This was the 114th year of season play for the Sooners who were led by head coach Bob Stoops, a two-time Walter Camp Coach of the Year award winner. The team was led on offense by quarterback Sam Bradford. The Sooners played their homes games at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Oklahoma. The team finished their regular season 11-1 (7-1, Big 12),http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=201&year;=2008 with the only loss coming to the Texas Longhorns. (see \\"South Division 3-way-tie controversy\\" section below) They entered the game ranked No. 2 in the BCS and Coaches poll, and No. 4 in the AP poll. The Big 12 North representative in the championship game was the Missouri Tigers. The team was coached by Gary Pinkel, who returned in his eighth season with Mizzou. The Tigers played their home games at Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium. Quarterback Chase Daniel returned for his final year of eligibility and led the Tigers to a second appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Tigers ended the regular season with a record of 9-3 (5-3, Big 12),http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=142&year;=2008 with losses coming to Oklahoma State, Texas, and Kansas. They entered the game ranked No. 20 in the BCS, No. 17 in the Coaches poll, and No. 19 in the AP poll. South Division 3-way-tie controversy Oklahoma, Texas, Texas Tech all finished the season with identical 7-1 conference records, creating a three-way tie for the South division championship. Under Big 12 tiebreaker rules, ties are normally broken by head-to-head matchups, but this case was unique as Texas beat Oklahoma 45-35, Oklahoma beat Texas Tech 65-21, and Texas Tech beat Texas 39-33, which made breaking the three-way tie impossible using head-to-head results. Because the first four tie-breakers did not dictate a winner, Big 12 rules dictated that the fifth tie-breaker was that the team with the highest BCS Ranking, based on the standings released on November 30 of that year, would represent the South Division. This in turn meant that coaches, journalists and computer rankings, which are the components of the BCS ranking formula, decided the South Division representative. Texas Tech, Texas, and Oklahoma were all presented Big 12 South Champion trophies from the Big 12. During the final week of the Big 12 regular season, Oklahoma defeated a tough Oklahoma State, and Texas defeated a much softer Texas A&M; delivering a sufficiently higher computer rating to Oklahoma.http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/2008/11/30/2008-11-30_sooners_win_big_12_south_thanks_to_bcs_c.htmlhttp://www.star- telegram.com/college_sports/story/1065666.html ==References * About the 2008 Championship game at Big12Sports.com Category:Big 12 Championship Game Big 12 Championship Category:Missouri Tigers football games Category:Oklahoma Sooners football games Category:Sports competitions in Kansas City, Missouri Category:December 2008 sports events in the United States Big 12 Championship Category:2000s in Kansas City, Missouri ","title":"2008 Big 12 Championship Game"},{"id":"20232797","text":"The 2009 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl game was a post-season college football bowl game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Texas Longhorns on Monday, January 5, 2009, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Texas participated in the Fiesta Bowl because the Big 12 champion University of Oklahoma Sooners were participating in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game; however the bowl kept its ties to the Big 12 by selecting the Longhorns, who did not play in the championship game as they beat Oklahoma in the Red River Rivalry, 45-35, then lost to Texas Tech and Texas Tech in turn lost to Oklahoma and dictated that a tiebreaker would decide that the highest BCS ranked team for the Big 12 South the week of November 28, 2008 would be in the title game. The Buckeyes were chosen as an at-large school as co-champions of the Big Ten Conference, having lost the right to play in the Rose Bowl due to a 13-6 loss to Penn State on October 25. The Fiesta Bowl served as the penultimate contest of the 2008-2009 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) of the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was the concluding game of the season for both teams involved. This 38th edition of the Fiesta Bowl was televised in the United States on FOX. It was the third meeting in the history of the two schools. The Longhorns (variously \\"Texas\\" or \\"UT\\" or the \\"Horns\\") are coached by head football coach Mack Brown and led on the field by quarterback Colt McCoy. The Buckeyes (variously \\"Ohio State\\" or \\"OSU\\" or the \\"Bucks\\") are coached by Jim Tressel and led on the field by Terrelle Pryor. The victory by Texas gave Ohio State their third straight bowl loss, their longest such streak since the early John Cooper era (when they lost 4 bowls in a row from 1989–92). This follows a four-game bowl winning streak which tied for longest in OSU history. ==Scoring summary== {  - ! Scoring Play !

Before 2005 each school had participated in college football for more than 100 years. They are home to nationally known traditions from the Buckeye leaf stickers and the O-H-I-O chant at Ohio State to Bevo and the Hook 'em Horns of Texas. One of the three most victorious programs in college football history as judged by either number of wins or winning percentage, the University of Texas has traditionally been considered a college football powerhouse. From 1936 to 2004, the team finished the season in the top ten 23 times, or one-third of the time, according to the Associated Press. The team that coach Mack Brown fielded in 2005 has been called one of the most memorable in college football history by College Football News. Like the Longhorns, the Buckeyes are an elite football program. The Buckeyes program has produced 164 first-team All-American players, including seven Heisman Trophy winners. The Buckeyes rank fifth in college football history in terms of both total wins and winning percentage. Previous meetings Texas and Ohio State have two of the longest-running programs in college football, but they have played each other only twice. Texas won the 2005 game en route to winning their most recent national championship (in the process becoming the first visitor to win a night game at Ohio Stadium). In the 2006 game, which was won by Ohio State, OSU and Texas were ranked #1 and #2 respectively. It was only the 36th time that the top two teams in college football had ever faced each other outside of the BCS National Championship . OSU later played against #2 Michigan Wolverines in the Buckeyes' regular season finale. ==Leading into the game== After being passed over in the selection for the 2009 BCS National Championship Game, the Longhorns were selected to represent the Big 12 Conference as host team in the Fiesta Bowl. The Buckeyes were selected as an \\"at-large\\" school from among the eligible teams. The day the bowl bids were announced the sports betting line opened with Texas as ten- point favorites, the most of any of the 2009 BCS bowls. ==References== Fiesta Bowl Category:Fiesta Bowl Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football bowl games Category:Texas Longhorns football bowl games Fiesta Bowl Fiesta Bowl ","title":"2009 Fiesta Bowl"},{"id":"20232802","text":"is a Japanese football player currently playing for FC Maruyasu Okazaki. ==Club statistics== Updated to 1 January 2020.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑ハンディ版 2018 (NSK MOOK)\\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 255 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"2017 J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑 (NSK MOOK)\\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 183 out of 289) {  - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Total - !

It is an excitotoxic neurotoxin when used in vivo and so is rarely used in intact animals, but it is widely used to selectively stimulate AMPA receptors in vitro. It is structurally similar to the compound willardiine, which is also an agonist for the AMPA and kainate receptors. Willardiine occurs naturally in Mariosousa willardiana and Acacia sensu lato. The name is unusual as it has two successive i's. This is not a typo. ==Toxicity== (S)-5-Fluorowillardiine activity has been studied in vitro in a variety of neural tissues. In mouse embryo hippocampal neurons, it was found to desensitize AMPA/kainate receptors with an EC50 of 1.5 μM –— 7 times more potent than racemic AMPA (EC50 of 11 μM). In another study, (S)-5-Fluorowillardiine showed biphasic dose-dependent neurotoxicity in cultural rodent cortical neurons, with EC50 vales of 0.70 and 170 μM. While in vivo research is sparse, a study in 5-day old mice injected with the closely related AMPA/kainate agonist (S)-5-Bromowillardiine showed cortical and white matter damage. AMPA antagonists reduced the extent of the damage in a dose- dependent fashion. ==Applications in Research== Radiolabeled 5-fluorowillardiine has been used to study the distribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors in rodent brains.It has also been used to evaluate the effects of various allosteric modulators of the AMPA receptor. ==Chemistry== Structure and Activity Synthesis of 5-fluorowillardiine 5-fluorowillardiine is derived from the nitrogenous base uracil found in RNA. It is one member of a family of willardiine compounds, which share uracil or a substituted uracil as an amino acid side chain. 5-Fluorowillardiine exists as two distinct isomers: * (2R) or D * (2S) or L The particularly high affinity of 5-fluorowillardiine for the AMPA receptor is attributed to its fluorine substituent at the 5-position of the ring, which is electron-withdrawing and small enough to not interfere with binding. By contrast, related willardiine derivatives with larger nonpolar electron withdrawing groups exhibit greater affinity for kainate receptors than 5-fluorowillardiine, and less affinity for AMPA receptors. The binding of 5-fluorowillardiine to the AMPA receptor is driven by entropy when its ring is uncharged. When the ring is deprotonated and has a negative charge, a favorable change in enthalpy primarily drives binding. Because the pKa values of halogenated willardiine derivates are approximately 8 (7.98 for 5-Fluorowillardiine), binding is mostly driven by an increase in entropy at physiological pH. Synthesis The synthesis of 5-Fluorowillardiine may be achieved by using 5-Fluorouracil as a nucleophile to open a specialized lactone in an SN2 reaction. Another straightforward approach is to perform a Strecker amino acid synthesis. ==References== Category:AMPA receptor agonists Category:Organofluorides Category:Amino acids Category:Pyrimidinediones ","title":"5-Fluorowillardiine"},{"id":"20232829","text":"Jonathan Carr (1942–2008) was a British journalist and author, who lived and worked primarily in Germany.

It was signed into law on 12 July 2009, although the provisions relating to the establishment of the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland did not come into force until a Statutory Instrument was made giving them effect on 30 September 2009.http://www.bci.ie/ The Act covers mainly regulation and broadcasting and digital switchover in Ireland. ==Proposals== The Act provides for the establishment of a single content regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which took over the roles formerly held by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC) in as well as a range of new functions and was constituted on 1 October 2009, with the former bodies wound up on the same date. There continues to be an element of separation, with a Contract Awards Committee and Compliance Committee remaining as committees of the BAI's main board. The BAI has power to award programme contracts (as the Commission for Communications Regulation continues to issue the broadcasting licences proper) in the independent sector and ensures that all broadcasters, public and private, comply with contract conditions and standard. It regulates enforcement of sound broadcasting conditions and public service broadcasters as well as commercial broadcasters, with RTÉ and TG4 having become semi state companies and took on a greater role in terrestrial television regulation as new Irish channels emerged on the new, more spectrum capacity extensive DTT platform. Television and radio stations face fines of up to €250,000 if they infringe codes of conduct or licence requirements under the Act's stricter enforcement mechanism. These financial penalties replaced the former limited redress available to the BCI of revoking licences for infringement of licences or codes. Modernisation of sound broadcasting contracts including the availability of 'fast-tracked' applications, licence enforcement, legal definitions regarding TV licence and contract awards are other features of this Act. Changes to the public service broadcasters and the allocation of public funding also took place with the new Act following on from discussion with the European Commission. It updated and revised the legislation relating to RTÉ and TG4 and established the framework for two public service broadcasters, an Irish Film Channel and an Oireachtas channel. It reconstituted the RTÉ and TG4 Boards (the former losing the \\"RTÉ Authority\\" name, becoming the \\"RTÉ Board\\") and renamed RTÉ from Radio Telefís Éireann to Raidió Teilifís Éireann, in order to reflect the proper Irish language spelling of the name. ==Community Radio== The Act provides for a legal definition of Community Radio for the first time. Groups whose members are representative of, and accountable to their community, and who seek to provide a social benefit through the supply of programming to that community on a not- for-profit basis may enter into a Community Sound Broadcasting Contract. The Act also extends the length of a temporary licence to 100 days within a 12-month period. The 100-day licence is only available to Community Sound broadcasters. The previous 30-day licence provision remains in place for other types of radio broadcasters. There is also a new definition of Media literacy in the Act which includes the processes by which individuals and communities can create and publish audio or audio-visual material by means of broadcast and related electronic media. The Act also charges the Broadcasting Authority with considering the needs of Community Broadcasters with regard to digital broadcasting. ==Public interest proposals== The Act introduced several proposals to protect the interests of viewers and listeners including a \\"right to reply\\" procedure where individuals whose reputation has been damaged may have this corrected in a further broadcast within 15 days. This is very similar to remedies available relating to the print-media sector although there the procedures under the Broadcasting Act differ as there is no ombudsman and the complaint is dealt with the Compliance Committee of the BAI. Provision was also made for the establishment by RTÉ and TG4 of audience councils to represent the views of listeners and viewers. This means that they are more akin to commercially driven boards of semi-state companies. A ban on advertising for junk food during children television viewing periods was also added when the Act was enacted in an effort to reduce the problems of obesity in Irish society that junk food adverts may encourage. Television licence fee evaders currently face significantly heavier fines but still get a last chance to avoid a court appearance. In its current form, it removed the former ban on advertising directed towards religious ends, replacing it with a ban on advertising that refers to the benefits or otherwise of belonging to or believing in a particular religion. ==Digital television== A date of between September 2012 and December 2012 for the switch-off of analogue transmission and the nationwide rollout of the digital terrestrial television platform was established, with an ASO date being set, by a further statutory instrument, as 24 October 2012. 31 December 2011 was the DTT full coverage date determined by the Minister where coverage would reach 90% of the population equivalent to analogue terrestrial (aerial) coverage under Statutory Instrument 85 of 2010, the RTÉ (National Television Multiplex) Order 2010, signed in February 2012. However coverage requirements are likely to be exceeded providing universal 100% coverage using a variety of DTT and DST from June end 2011.http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/rte-plans-for-saorview-digital-tv- service-46949.html The Act consolidates almost 50 years of legislation relating to Irish broadcasting according to the Department of Communications. It deals with Irish Analogue broadcasting systems and the amendment of legislation on Digital Terrestrial Television dating back to 2001. This Act amends previous acts such as the Radio and Television Act 1988, the Broadcasting Act 2001 and the recent Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007. The Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960-2001 was also repealed and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland came into existence on 30 September 2009. ==ReferencesAdditional sources== *LK Shields Solicitors outline the key aspects of the Bill before the Oireachtas *The Irish Government Department of Communications, Energy & Natural Resources website, section on broadcasting acts in Ireland *Oireachtas, 2007 The Houses of the Oireachtas, \\"Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 No.15 of 2007, Published: 18 April 2007, Accessed: 25 October 2007 *BCI evolutation into BAI planned for 2008 *RTE.ie/business \\"Bill sets up new broadcasting watchdog\\" Accessed: 14 May 2008. *Oireachtas, 2008 The Houses of the Oireachtas Broadcasting Bill 2008 to establish the BAI to take over BAI, RTÉ Authority, Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and Broadcasting Complaints Commission duties, and establish RTÉ and TG4 (previously Téilifis na Gaeilge) as corporate semi states and establish Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Oireachtas TV) and Irish Film Channel (Irish Film Board/Board Scannan na hEireann). *Consultation on DTT Multiplexes, Commission for Communications Regulation (radiowave spectrum regulator). *Commission for Communications Regulation, \\"Response to Licensing Digital Terrestrial Television\\", Document 07/90 *Commission for Communications Regulation, \\" License for Digital Terrestrial Television\\", Document 07/90a. *Commission for Communications Regulation, \\"Technical Conditions for Digital Terrestrial Television\\", Document 07/90b. *Commission for Communications Regulation, \\"ComReg published License framework for Digital Terrestrial Television\\", Document: PR09 1107. *Silicon Republic.com \\"DTT licences will cost operators €114k\\", by John Kennedy *Department of Communications commencement order of the Act 15 by the previous Minister for Communications, Ireland in April 2007 *Information on ComReg's role in Irish broadcasting spectrum regulation *Broadcasting Commission of Ireland DTT license applicants proposals ==External links== * Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (official site) * Broadcasting Act 2009 (being updated) * Broadcasting Bill 2008 (As passed by Dáil Éireann) Category:Acts of the Oireachtas 2009 Category:Television in the Republic of Ireland Category:Digital television ","title":"Broadcasting Act 2009"},{"id":"20232861","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

MacDonald was born in Opotiki, New Zealand, the son of an Australian volunteer in the New Zealand Wars and veteran of the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. He completed his early education in New Zealand before his family migrated to New South Wales, whereafter he attended state schools. He spent time as a shearer in New South Wales and Victoria before returning to New Zealand and entering the printing trade. He began as a journeyman compositor, but shifted into journalism over time, working for the Wairoa Guardian and the Napier-based The Daily Telegraph before rising to become chief compositor and acting editor of the Gisborne Herald. He was also involved in the Typographical Association in its early days and taught shorthand at the Gisborne Technical College in 1903–04. MacDonald later returned to Australia and worked as a journalist at The Argus and then The Age in Melbourne, including a stint in the parliamentary press gallery. He was one of the founding members of the Australian Journalists Association in 1910, spent time in London and studied at the University of London, before returning to Australia. He was then recruited as editor of the new Brisbane newspaper The Daily Standard in 1912, serving in that role until his appointment to the Senate and also serving as acting manager in 1913–14. He was involved in campaigning against the conscription referendums of Billy Hughes, but in 1918 was one of 12 newspaper editors selected by the Nationalist Party government to visit the World War I front. On 26 May 1922, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator for Queensland, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Nationalist Senator John Adamson; he had already been preselected as a Labor candidate for the forthcoming election. However, he was defeated at the 1922 election. MacDonald worked as a freelance journalist in the intervening years. Following the death of another Nationalist Senator, Thomas Givens, MacDonald was again appointed to the Senate on 1 August 1928 but was defeated again at the 1928 election. He then worked as chief compiler for the Queensland Tourist Bureau, promoting the state's tourist opportunities. MacDonald was finally elected in his own right in the election of 1931, taking his place in the Senate in 1932. He died in office in 1937 after suffering reported \\"heart trouble\\" and was cremated at Mount Thompson Crematorium. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1880 births Category:1937 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"John MacDonald (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20232924","text":"is a Japanese football player currently playing for Kashima Antlers. ==Club statistics== Updated to 23 February 2019.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"2016J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑\\", 10 February 2016, Japan, (p. 44 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑 2014 (NSK MOOK)\\", 14 February 2014, Japan, (p. 45 out of 290) {  center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Emperor's Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"J.

Hertha 03 Zehlendorf Hertha 03 website, accessed: 16 November 2008 By 1909, it had however changed its name to FC Hertha Zehlendorf. In 1913, the club moved to a new ground, Siebenendenweg, now called Ernst-Reuter-Sportfeld, away from the Tempelhofer Feld, where it was never entirely happy. The team was for a time part of BFC Hertha 1892 but by September 1914 the club became independent again, under the name of 'FC Hertha 06 Zehlendorf. After the end of the First World War, in January 1919, the club merged with local side VfB Zehlendorf 03 to form the current club, FC Hertha 03 Zehlendorf. It was from this union, Hertha derives its foundation date, too. For the next decade, the club did not particularly stand out of the ranks of Berlin football clubs. Only in 1933 could it finally win a championship in the local Kreisklasse but the change in the German football league system, the introduction of the Gauligas, prevented the team from being promoted. The club continued to struggle throughout this age and even had to form an on-the-field union with Union Lichterfelde to survive. During the Second World War, play came almost completely to a halt. 1945–1963 After the war, all previously existing clubs and associations were outlawed in Berlin and the former Hertha existed under the name of SG Zehlendorf for a while. It entered the Amateurliga Berlin (II) in 1947, a league that was played in a number of regional groups. It however became the first club in Berlin to receive a license in 1948 to revert to its original name by the allied occupation authorities. On the field, the club qualified for the single-division Amateurliga in 1950 and immediately became a strong side in this league, winning the championship in 1953. The club's youth side took out its first Berlin championship in 1950, a game played as a curtain raiser for a Germany versus Turkey friendly, in front of 60,000, on 17 June 1951.kicker Almanach Yearbook of German football, publisher: kicker, published: 1989, page: 54, accessed: 16 November 2008 Germany lost 1–2, but Zehlendorf beat Hertha BSC 3–2.

It found life at this level much harder and was immediately relegated again, finishing 11th out of 12 teams. Back in the Amateurliga, another championship was won and the club earned the right to return to the Oberliga. In this league, the team would stay until 1963, earning lower table finishes each season but surviving nevertheless.Germany – Oberliga Berlin 1946–63 RSSSF.com, accessed: 16 November 2008 Hertha in this time earned much more local success with its youth teams, a fact not much changed even today, winning Berlin championship in various age groups over the years. 1963–74: Regionalliga years In 1963, West German football was fundamentally changed with the introduction of the Bundesliga. Below it, five regional leagues, the Regionalligas, were formed. Hertha did not apply for a spot in the new Bundesliga as only one club from Berlin was admitted and the bigger names in local football, Hertha BSC and Tasmania 1900 Berlin far out qualified the little club.Deutsche Liga- Chronik seit 1945 Bundesliga qualification, page: B 11, accessed: 16 November 2008 Instead, the club qualified for the new tier-two Regionalliga Berlin, a league it would belong to until its disbanding in 1974. In this league, Hertha continued its existence as an average side, at least for the first couple of seasons. From 1965, the club's results improved and it developed into an upper table side. In 1968–69, the team achieved its greatest success so far, winning the Regionalliga and thereby qualifying for the promotion round to the Bundesliga. In this competition, the club came fourth out of five teams, when only the winner, Rot-Weiß Oberhausen, qualified for promotion. The following season, the team repeated its success; winning the league once more and getting another try at Bundesliga promotion. The club finished one rank better this time, coming third but the Bundesliga spot went to Kickers Offenbach.

Bundesliga Nord, the club had to be one of the two top clubs in its league but a fourth spot was not enough and it was demoted to the tier-three Amateurliga Berlin instead.Deutsche Liga-Chronik seit 1945 2nd Bundesliga qualification, page: C 3, accessed: 16 November 2008 1974–present Hertha missed out on the league championship there in its first season, coming second by a point to Spandauer SV, who won promotion to the second division. The next three seasons, the club spent in midfield but its youth teams once more impressed, reaching the final in both the under-19 and the under-17 German championships in 1978.kicker Almanach Yearbook of German football, publisher: kicker, published: 1989, page: 413 & 417, accessed: 16 November 2008 In 1978–79, it managed to win the league. This entitled the club to take part in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga. It had to play OSC Bremerhaven and beat the opposition 5–4 in Berlin. In Bremerhaven it held a 0–0 until four minutes from the end, seeing itself already in the second division but then OSC scored the winning goal and earned promotion on the away goal rule. Its Berlin title qualified the club for the German amateur football championship, too, where it went all the way to the final and lost to ESV Ingolstadt.kicker Almanach Yearbook of German football, publisher: kicker, published: 1989, page: 187, accessed: 16 November 2008 The club continued to be a driving force in what was now renamed Amateur Oberliga Berlin, finishing in the top five all but once in the next twelve seasons. In 1981–82, another highlight followed, coming second in the league to Tennis Borussia Berlin, on equal points but falling nine goals short. The team returned to the German amateur championship, where the FSV Mainz 05 proofed to strong in the semi-finals, winning both games. Thirdly, the club also qualified for the DFB-Pokal on the strength of a Berliner Landespokal win. It drew Hertha BSC for the first round and, in front of 12,000 spectators, the score was two all after regular time but then the big Hertha scored two more goals and knocked the little Hertha out of the cup. Little Hertha (German: Kleine Hertha) is the long-standing nickname of the club,FC Hertha 03 Zehlendorf e.V. – short history , author: Uwe Jentschura, accessed: 16 November 2008 referring to the fact that Hertha BSC was always the bigger and more successful of the two Herthas. The season after, the club came second in the league once more, this time to SC Charlottenburg, and earned another shot at the amateur championship but this time, the FC Bayern Munich II in the first round was as far as it went. In 1988, the club's under-17's finally took out the West German championship, beating southern powerhouse VfB Stuttgart 2–1 in the final with later German international Christian Ziege in Zehlendorf's line-up. The year after, wealthy FC Bayern Munich managed to beat the amateur club's youth team on penalties only in the final.kicker Almanach Yearbook of German football, publisher: kicker, published: 1989, page: 420, accessed: 16 November 2008 From 1988 to 1990, the Oberliga Berlin became the scene of Hertha's struggle with Reinickendorfer Füchse for the league championship but both times Reinickendorf won the upper hand. Each time, Hertha only earned the right to compete for the amateur championship again and each time it lost in the first round.Germany – Amateur Championship 1950–1995 RSSSF.com, accessed: 16 November 2008 1990–91 was the Oberliga Berlin's last season, the German reunion also affected football and the NOFV-Oberliga was established instead. Hertha became part of the NOFV-Oberliga Mitte, a league dominated by 1. FC Union Berlin in its short three-year existence and Zehlendorf managed only average performances. Nevertheless, it did qualify for the new tier-three Regionalliga Nordost in 1994. In a league full of former East German football powerhouses, the team struggled for four seasons before being relegated in 1998. The club managed to only survive two seasons in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV) before another relegation, now to the tier-five Verbandsliga Berlin. It played in this league, renamed the Berlin-Liga in 2008, until 2014 when a championship took the club back to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord. ==Honours== The club's honours: League *German amateur football championship ** Runners- up: 1979 *Regionalliga Berlin (II): 2 ** Winners: 1969, 1970 * Amateurliga Berlin (II): 1 **Winners: 1953 *Oberliga Berlin (III): 1 ** Winners: 1979 ** Runners-up: 1975, 1982, 1983, 1989, 1990 * Berlin-Liga (VI): 1 ** Champions: 2014 Cup * Berlin Cup: 3 ** Winners: 1977, 1982, 1989 ** Runners-up: 1968, 1969, 1974, 1975, 1990, 1996 Youth *German Under 19 Championship: 1 ** Winners: 1970 ** Runners-up: 1978 * German Under 17 Championship: 1 ** Winners: 1988 ** Runners-up: 1978, 1989 == Past managers == {  - center; background:#dfdfdf;\\"  Manager  From  Until - center;\\"  left;\\" Wolfgang Przesdzing  1 July 1983  10 November 1986 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  left;\\" Stefan Sprey  11 November 1986  7 January 1990 - center;\\"  left;\\" Adolf Remy  8 January 1990  30 June 1990 - center;\\"  left;\\" Gino Ferrin  1 July 1990  30 June 1992 - center;\\"  left;\\" Peter Ränke  1 July 1992  2 May 1994 - center;\\"  left;\\" Gerd Pröger  3 May 1994  30 June 1994 - center;\\"  left;\\" Thomas Grunenberg  1 July 1994  16 February 1996 - center;\\"  left;\\" Gerd Pröger  16 February 1996  25 March 1997 - center;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Gino Ferrin  26 March 1997  30 June 1997 } ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Hertha Zehlendorf at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leaguesDas deutsche Fußball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tables {  - center; background:#dfdfdf;\\"  Season  Division  Tier  Position - center;\\"  1999–2000  left;\\" NOFV-Oberliga Nord  IV  ffcccc\\" 14th ↓ - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2000–01  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  rowspan=8 V  8th - center;\\"  2001–02  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  5th - center;\\"  2002–03  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  4th - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2003–04  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  7th - center;\\"  2004–05  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  3rd - center;\\"  2005–06  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  3rd - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2006–07  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  7th - center;\\"  2007–08  left;\\" Verbandsliga Berlin  4th - center;\\"  2008–09  left;\\" Berlin-Liga  rowspan=6 VI  6th - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2009–10  left;\\" Berlin-Liga  3rd - center;\\"  2010–11  left;\\" Berlin-Liga  14th - center;\\"  2011–12  left;\\" Berlin-Liga  6th - center;\\"  2012–13  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Berlin-Liga  10th - center;\\"  2013–14  left;\\" Berlin-Liga  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - center;\\"  2014–15  left;\\" NOFV-Oberliga Nord  rowspan=5 V  9th - center;\\"  2015–16  left;\\" NOFV-Oberliga Nord  3rd - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2016–17  left;\\" NOFV-Oberliga Nord  4th - center;\\"  2017–18  left;\\" NOFV- Oberliga Nord  4th - center;\\"  2018–19  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" NOFV-Oberliga Nord  4th } * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

It is located on the Solway Plain, south west of Silloth, north of Maryport, and west of Carlisle. The B5300, known locally as the \\"coast road\\" runs to the west of the village. Mawbray serves as the hub of a community of several smaller hamlets, including Beckfoot, Goodyhills, Hailforth, Holme St Cuthbert, Jericho, Newtown, Salta, and Tarns. ==Etymology== The name \\"Mawbray\\" is believed to be derived from Latin, meaning \\"a maiden's castle or fort\\". This would be consistent with Roman mile-forts known to exist nearby on the coast, especially in the Maryport area. A Roman fortlet, known as Milefortlet 16, has been located at the west end of the village.MILEFORTLET 16, Pastscape, retrieved 26 November 2013 Alternatively, the early forms of the first element seem to be from Old English mæge, later replaced by Maw from the variant māge. The second element is burh, which means a \\"fortified place, town, or manor house\\", and the name means \\"the maidens' stronghold\\", or, \\"maidens' castle\\". The early form of the name was Mayburgh, and additional variants include Mayburg, Mawbrey, Malbrough, and Malbrew. Some variants, such as Olde Malbraw and Old Mawbery add an \\"Old\\" prefix, to distinguish the village from \\"New Mawbray\\", two miles to the north, today known as Newtown. ==History== Prehistory This part of the west Cumbrian coastline has a very long history. The area that today forms Mawbray would have been uninhabitable by humans until around 11,000 BC, as it was covered in ice sheets from the last ice age. Archaeological evidence from Mawbray and the surrounding area shows clear evidence of human activity and habitation as early as 4000 BC, as a ditched enclosure with large post-holes in an 'annexe' was excavated at nearby Plasketlands, as has been identified as being from the early Neolithic period. The archaeologist in charge of the expedition, R. H. Bewley, called the find their \\"best evidence for permanent settlement\\" on the Solway Plain.Bewley, R.H. (1993). \\"Survey and excavation at a crop-mark enclosure, Plasketlands, Cumbria\\". Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. 2 93: 1–18, quoted by Barrowclough, p.80. On the Moss at nearby Salta, a Bronze Age rapier (a kind of sword) was discovered in the 1980s, and is believed to have been crafted as early as 1100 BC, providing further evidence of pre-Roman occupation. Roman times During the Roman period, this part of the Cumbrian coastline was fortified, as coastal defences were constructed beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall to protect against incursions across the Solway Firth. Milefortlets 14, 15, 16, and 17 are all located nearby, with milefortlet 16 being the closest. However, centuries of coastal erosion have taken their toll, and today, only the rear eastern rampart of milefortlet 16 survives. By the 1820s, the nearby \\"Roman camp\\" – which is assumed to refer to either milefortlet 16 or one of its associated towers – had fallen into a state of disrepair. The vallum had been defaced, and the site of the camp was used for growing corn. However, it was noted that \\"some of the old inhabitants remember part of the wall standing.\\" By inference, the last remaining part of the Roman wall at Mawbray had collapsed or been removed during the latter part of the 18th century – over 1,600 years after it was built. An inscribed stone was also discovered in the Roman camp near Mawbray, and historians in the 19th century believed that the stone showed that it was likely that Roman soldiers from Hispania built the wall or edifice which contained it. However, given the term \\"Pannon\\" used in the inscription, recent analysis suggests that it is more likely that soldiers from Pannonia – modern-day Hungary – were responsible for the Mawbray stone. Roman inscription The following is the text of the inscription discovered on a stone from the Roman camp near to Mawbray: L. TA. PRAEF. COH. II. PANNON FECIT Middle ages The threat of raids and attacks from Scots across the sea didn't end with the departure of the Romans, however, and as late as the 1550s, Scottish raiders were still attacking Mawbray and the surrounding communities. A system called the seawake – a night watch along the coast – was instituted, and Mawbray participated along with other coastal communities in the area. Defence against Scottish raids was also important to the Lord and Steward of Holm Cultram when planning the settlement of New Mawbray, today known as Newtown, in the same period. The site of the present village had been established by the time Norman surveyors reached the Solway Plain in the 1150s. From the Anglo-Saxon period right up to the twentieth century, the majority of Mawbray's inhabitants are believed to have been fishermen and farmers. Farming and fishing still continue in the village in the present day, with more of the former than the latter, but the inhabitants today are more diverse, including \\"a journalist, an artist and a television presenter\\". Nineteenth and twentieth centuries Mawbray used to have many diverse shops and tradesmen operating in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but in the present day, these have been lost. Trades such as \\"bacon and ham curer, shoemaker, blacksmith, joiner and dressmaker\\" have long since disappeared from the village. However, in 2018 a new cheese company was founded in the village, bringing back a cottage industry that would've existed in the past. The village post office and shop closed in the 1980s. The local pub, The Lowther Arms, closed in May 2018 but was known to have been open as early as 1847. Directly opposite the pub is a small children's playground. The current play area was funded by the community and built by local woodworkers around the year 2000. Mawbray fisherman ==The Village Today== The Lowther Arms, which closed in 2018, is located roughly in the centre of the village. There is a play area for children located on the green opposite, and one of Mawbray's several farms in the background. Culterham Hall, known locally as the village hall, opened in 1951 and is the centre of activity in Mawbray today. An amateur dramatics group called the Mawbray Entertainers performed their own pantomime every year from 1988 to 2015 during the half-term break in February in Culterham Hall, and the money raised was donated to a range of local and national charities. The village hall also accommodates many other musical events, especially by performers on the Rural Touring Scheme throughout the year. In addition to these special events, members of the community run a wide range of clubs and activities at the hall, from sports like Tai Chi and bowls to dog training classes and a weekly children's club. In addition, the hall plays host to craft sales several times a year, including in the run-up to Christmas, where local craftspeople sell a range of items. Mawbray is served by a local bus service, running every couple of hours between Silloth and Maryport. This service has replaced an earlier bus service which ran between Silloth and Workington. Smaller roads besides the B5300 run northeast towards Abbeytown, and southwest towards Hailforth, Salta, and Dubmill. With the village hall, Mawbray serves as the centre of the community for these outlying settlements. However, Mawbray itself is not home to the local primary school, which is instead located at Holme St Cuthbert, as is the local church. The Lowther Arms pub closed in May 2018, and is for sale as of July 2019. One of the famous red telephone boxes is located in the village, and it has been converted to hold a defibrillator. Mawbray also retains a post box, and in the village hall there is a preserved example of a Victorian-era post box (though it is no longer in use). ==Governance== Mawbray is part of the Workington constituency of the UK parliament. The current Member of Parliament as of 2019 is Mark Jenkinson, a Conservative, who unseated former MP Sue Hayman at the 2019 General Election. The Labour Party had previously won the seat in every general election since 1979; the Conservative Party had only won the 1976 Workington by-election since the Second World War. Prior to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, Mawbray was in the North West England constituency for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament. For Local Government purposes it is in the Silloth + Solway Coast Ward of Allerdale Borough Council and the Aspatria Division of Cumbria County Council. Regarding its Parish Council, Mawbray is part of Holme St Cuthbert Parish Council. ==Climate== Mawbray, like the rest of Cumbria, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Compared with the mountainous Lake District and the southern part of the county, Mawbray, as is the case with the rest of the Solway Plain, tends to have milder winters with snowfall being relatively uncommon thanks to its coastal location. Rainfall is heavier in the autumn and winter months, but still occurs during spring and summer. Extremes of weather are almost unheard of; even during the 2009 Cumbria floods, Mawbray escaped unscathed. The biggest weather-related dangers come from the sea and predominantly effect Mawbray Yard rather than the main village. Thunderstorms accompanied by high winds can whip up large waves which risk flooding outlying houses nearer to the beach, and as this part of the beach lacks any serious coastal defences, a storm surge or even an unusually high tide has the potential to cause flooding. ==Location== The following grid shows Mawbray's location in relation to other nearby places: ==See also== *Listed buildings in Holme St Cuthbert ==ReferencesCumbria County History Trust: Holme St. Cuthbert (nb: provisional research only – see Talk page) Category:Villages in Cumbria Category:Populated coastal places in Cumbria Category:Holme St Cuthbert ","title":"Mawbray"},{"id":"20232978","text":"William George Thompson (2 March 1863 - 7 March 1953) was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was an Australian Senator. == Early life == William Thompson was born in Lurgan, County Armagh, Ireland, on 2 March 1863. When he was 14 months old, his family immigrated to Australia. Thompson was educated at North Rockhampton State School in Rockhampton in Queensland. At age 11, Thompson became an office boy for the merchant W. Jackson in Rockhampton. In 1881 he was the driving force to establish a branch of the Protestant Alliance Friendly Society at North Rockhampton and in December 1881, initiated a second branch in Rockhampton. In 1886, he established his own business called W.G. Thompson & Co, operating a bonded warehouse and other commercial activities. He was secretary of the Rockhampton General Hospital and of the Rockhampton Jockey Club. He became a colliery owner. == Military service == In 1889 Thompson joined the Queensland Infantry as a private. He had attained the rank of acting captain when placed in charge of troops in the Clermont district during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. In 1896 he was one of Queensland's two representatives sent in the Australian contingent to England with other colonial troops to commemorate the 60th year of Queen Victoria's reign.  Boer War  The Boer War broke out in 1899 and General Thompson (then captain) was placed second in command of the second Queensland contingent to go to South Africa. He left Rockhampton on Christmas night 1899 after an historic march through the city and a farewell dinner at the School of Arts. He was 13 times in action on the Veldt. There was no system of reinforcements at the time and wastage of war reduced the strength of the second Queensland to a subaltern's command. General Thompson was then appointed magistrate of the High Court of Pretoria, where, with two other magistrates, he administered martial law. Pretoria, at that time, was a Boer city.  World War I  When World War I broke out, General Thompson was 52, two years above the age for a field appointment. Instead he was put in charge of the largest training camp in Queensland at the Exhibition Grounds, Brisbane. He also spent 18 months commanding troops at sea in convoy work and sea transport. Before the outbreak of World War II he was retired with the rank of Brigadier General, only participating in ceremonial events from then on.  Decorations  His decorations include: * Queen Victoria's Decoration 1899 * the Queen's Medal with three clasps * two service medals for World War I * the King George and Queen Mary's Jubilee medal King Gustav, of Sweden, awarded him the decoration of Chevalier (1st class) of the Royal Order of Vasa. This was the equivalent in Sweden and on the Continent of a British knighthood, and was bestowed in recognition of services rendered by Thompson as vice-consul for Sweden at Rockhampton over many years. == Politics == Thompson was elected to the North Rockhampton Town Council and was mayor in 1890. In the 1918 Queensland state election, Thompson was a Nationalist candidate for the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Keppel, but was defeated by the sitting member James Larcombe (Labor), 1659 votes against 1130. Following the death of Nationalist Senator John Adamson in May 1922, the Labor-controlled Queensland Government appointed Labor's John MacDonald, to fill Adamson's vacancy. The Nationalists nominated Thompson at the December 1922 election and Thompson was elected, ousting MacDonald. Thompson remained in the Australian Senate until he was defeated in the 1931 election. == Later life == Thompson retired from his business activities in 1925 but continued to be involved in Rockhampton's civic organisations, including being President of the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce for 16 years and President of the Rockhampton branch of the Red Cross. He was one of the founding members of the Rockhampton Club. He was also Chairman of the Bluff Colliery Company and the Central Queensland Coal Board. Thompson moved to Sydney, New South Wales, in the 1940s where he died at Marrickville on Saturday 7 March 1953. He was cremated at Sydney's North Suburbs Crematorium on Tuesday 10 March 1953. ==References * Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1863 births Category:1953 deaths Category:United Australia Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"William Thompson (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20232990","text":"is a Japanese football player currently playing for Tokushima Vortis. ==Club statistics== Updated to end of 2018 season.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑ハンディ版 2018 (NSK MOOK)\\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 147 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./日本スポーツ企画出版社, \\"2017 J1&J2;&J3;選手名鑑 (NSK MOOK)\\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 156 out of 289) J.

There are several standardized methods of determining flame spread, ==Test methods== NFPA 255 Standard Method of Test of Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials, utilizes ASTM E84 Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials. This test method measures flame growth on the underside of a horizontal test specimen, using the Steiner tunnel test. The result is derivation of a Flame Spread Index (FSI), which is a non-dimensional number which is placed on a relative scale in which asbestos-cement board has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. Evaluation of a FSI by this test method does not provide a good understanding of how fire would propagate in full scale, such as in a room, for some materials.NFPA 255, Standard Method of Test of Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials, section D.8 In particular, the results for materials that drip, such as thermoplastics, are not indicative of the fire hazard as installed on walls and ceilings because they tend to melt and drip away from the underside of the horizontal ceiling in the test chamber. Because the test method measures how far down the test chamber the fire progressed, this type of \\"lack of fire progression\\" provides a misleading FSI. In order to address such restrictions, a new test method was derived, NFPA 286 Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Evaluating Contribution of Wall and Ceiling Interior Finish to Room Fire Growth. NFPA 286 Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Evaluating Contribution of Wall and Ceiling Interior Finish to Room Fire Growth, measures flame spread in a room configuration, including fire spread along walls, ceilings, and combinations of both. This method is more indicative of real world fire hazards, and is preferred over NFPA 255,NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, section A.10.2.4.1 but is more expensive. Also, test results for heat, smoke, and combustion product release from NFPA 286 are suitable for use as input into fire models for performance-based design, whereas results from NFPA 255 are not. Flame spread rating number is not the rate at which the flame actually spreads along the surface and is not an indication of the fire resistance of the material. UL 723 (ASTM E84) Test for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials ASTM E84 - 15a Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials UL 94 Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances ==Use== The Life Safety Code (NFPA 101)National Fire Protection Association and Section 803.1 of the International Building Code limit finishes for interior walls and ceilings to materials in three classes (A, B, or C, with A being the lowest flame spread and C being the highest) and gives greater restrictions for certain rooms: {  border=\\"1\\" - !

Lost Pig finished with 18.7% of the votes for the Audience Award in the interactive fiction category in the 2008 Jay Is Games Best of Casual Gameplay awards, placing it second after Violet. The game has been described as \\"hilarious\\" by reviewers for The Onion A.V. Club and Jay Is Games. Emily Short described it as \\"superbly crafted,\\" \\"insanely responsive,\\" and recommended it to new players of interactive fiction, noting, \\"The polish is so thorough that it avoids the sorts of parser frustrations that usually catch novice players off- guard....\\" A GameSetWatch review noted that \\"After only a few minutes of play, however, it becomes pleasingly obvious how much effort has gone into creating Grunk’s world.\\" The reviewer for Jay Is Games called Lost Pig \\"...stuffed to the rafters with personality.\\" The game's protagonist is Grunk, an orc who works at a farm. A pig under his care has escaped, and the game begins with Grunk looking for the pig. Chasing the pig, Grunk soon falls into an underground complex. To win the game, the player must get Grunk to capture the pig and find a way out of the complex. As interactive fiction, the player types English commands into the game and the game responds in English. However, the protagonist, Grunk, speaks broken English. This means that the game's responses are frequently in broken English. A reviewer for The Onion A.V.

After graduating from high school in Shenandoah, Driftmier taught school in Essex, Iowa. She moved to California to help care for aging relatives. While in California, Driftmier attended Los Angeles State Normal College, then taught school near San Bernardino for one or two years. On a visit to her hometown she met widower Martin Driftmier.

Helen left the show in 1926. Driftmier took over the show and renamed it Kitchen-Klatter. For the first four years, Driftmier broadcast from the station’s studio with her young children sitting quietly in the corner. When a back injury forced her to bedrest in 1930, she hosted the show from her bedroom. She used a wheelchair for the remainder of her life and broadcast thereafter from her kitchen. Broadcasting from the home became a trend followed by other homemaker hosts of the time.http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=15804&startpage;=page0000090&xml;=derek#folio=078 Stern, 1991. Kitchen-Klatter eventually moved to rival station KMA, also in Shenandoah, and was syndicated around the Midwest, reaching listeners in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and surrounding areas. Kitchen-Klatter was a \\"chatty\\" and \\"instructive\\" Des Moines Register show, a welcome “friend” for isolated rural women. Stern, 1991. Driftmier shared recipes, talked about her family, offered gardening homemaking and parenting tips. She was the most well known of Shenandoah’s popular homemaker hosts, and described as an “authoritative,” “regal presence” on the air. A fellow Shenandoah radio personality said that during World War II, Driftmier sent thousands of letters to parents who had lost their sons in the war. ==Kitchen-Klatter Magazine and products== Early in the life of the program, Driftmier started writing a newsletter as a way to respond to listeners’ correspondence. The publication expanded and took on the name Kitchen-Klatter Magazine. It featured a newsy letter from Driftmier, recipes, health hints, poems and book suggestions.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/99999999/FAMOUSIOWANS/50902011/-1/famousiowans/Driftmier- Leanna- Des Moines Register Driftmier wrote and published cookbooks and books on sewing. The name Kitchen-Klatter was attached to home products such as flavorings, seasonings, and cleaning products, sold out of Shenandoah. ==Later years== Driftmier was named Iowa Mother of the Year in 1954. She hosted Kitchen-Klatter until 1959, when her daughter Lucile Driftmier Verness took over the show and magazine. Driftmier appeared occasionally for another 17 yrs until her death on September 30, 1976.

He was President of the Senate from 1943 to 1951. == Early life== Brown was born on 11 February 1885, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. He was the son of Jane (née Woodcock) and William Brown; his father was a bootmaker and Methodist lay preacher. Brown attended Clay Cross Grammar School on a scholarship and was then apprenticed to a patternmaker at a steam-engine manufacturing company. He had a \\"restless disposition\\" and also briefly worked as a piano salesman and in a coal mine in the north of England. He was a member of the Social Democratic Federation where he was \\"steeped in Marxian theory\\". Canada In 1908, Brown moved to Canada where he became involved with the Socialist Party of Canada. He later recalled his first major political speech as a three-hour address in Victoria, British Columbia. He stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons in Victoria City at the 1911 federal election. Brown became disillusioned with the movement's lack of success and doctrinaire nature. He was briefly imprisoned for street agitation, and subsequently returned to England. Move to Australia Gordon Brown Brown arrived in Sydney in 1912, and within a few months was president of the Sydney branch of the Australasian Socialist Party. Shortly after he was arrested for illegal public speaking in Wollongong. He and a friend walked to Brisbane in April 1913, where he was again gaoled for speaking without a permit. He married Beatrice Agnes Hinchsliff in 1914, with whom he had three children. Brown became the organising secretary of the Brisbane branch of the Socialist Party, and was a regular contributor to The International Socialist. By 1917 he was involved with the Industrial Workers of the World, travelling around Queensland giving speeches. His activities drew the attention of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, which reported that he was involved with \\"the worst revolutionary elements of Brisbane\\". He applied for a passport to travel to Russia and study Bolshevism, but was refused. In the lead-up to the 1917 conscription plebiscite, Brown was employed as an organiser by the Anti-Conscription Campaign Committee. His radicalism waned, and he later found work as an agent for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and as a salesman for Finney Isles and Co., a furniture and drapery firm. He joined the Shop Assistants' Union, serving as an organiser and vice-president, and from 1925 to 1927 served as vice-president of the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland. ==Politics== Brown (left) in 1933 with Arthur Calwell and William Forgan Smith Brown joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1918 and was elected to the Senate at the 1931 federal election, to a term beginning on 1 July 1932. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1941 to 1943. On 23 September 1943, he was elected President of the Senate, succeeding the late Senator James Cunningham. He remained President until 19 March 1951, when the Liberal Party took control of the Senate and elected Ted Mattner to replace him. He retired in 1964, taking effect in 1965. From 1947 to 1950, he and Joe Collings were the joint Fathers of the Senate, and from 1950 until his retirement, Brown was the sole Father. He suffered a stroke in July 1951 while speaking on the Constitution Alteration (Powers to Deal with Communists and Communism) Bill, causing him to slump across his desk. However, he made a full recovery and served for another fourteen years, retiring on 30 June 1965 at the age of 80. == Later life == Brown published his memoirs, My Descent from Soapbox to Senate, in 1953. He died on Thursday 12 January 1967 at Royal Brisbane Hospital. A state funeral was held on Saturday 14 January 1967 at St Philip's Anglican Church in Annerley and then the East Chapel of Mount Thompson Crematorium. His ashes are kept in the church's columbarium. ==References Further reading == * Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1885 births Category:1967 deaths Category:20th- century Australian politicians Category:Australian trade unionists Category:Australian socialists Category:Socialist Party of Canada candidates in the 1911 Canadian federal election Category:English emigrants to Canada Category:English emigrants to Australia ","title":"Gordon Brown (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20233167","text":" Washtucna (YTB-826) was a United States Navy named for Chief Washtucna of the Palus tribe. ==Construction== The contract for Washtucna was awarded 9 August 1971.

Jack Lewis USMC retired (November 13, 1924 - May 24, 2009), was a former Marine, screenwriter, author of 12 books and an estimated 6,000 magazine articles and short stories,Lewis, Jack, Campbell, Robert K. and Steele, David (2007) The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons. Gun Digest.p. 7 He was the co-founder and editor of Gun World magazine and continued contributing articles to that publication until the time of his death. Lewis wrote under the name C. Jack Lewis due to four other writers with the name of Jack Lewis.http://www.usmccca.org/m/bios/lewis-jack ==Biography== Lewis was born in Iowa in 1924. He sold his first short story, \\"The Cherokee Kid's Last Stand\\", at the age of 14 for $5.00, which Lewis thought was better money than a field hand's wage, which was then a dollar a day. Buoyed by his success, Lewis submitted an unsolicited Andy Hardy screenplay that was rejected by MGM. He did not sell any more stories until he was 22. Lewis recalled being lost as a child in a Department Store and being found by two Marines in dress blues. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at 18 years of age in World War II and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1945. After the war, Lewis attended the University of Iowa, where he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism. After obtaining the degree, Lewis reentered the Marine Corps through the Marine Corps Reserve. He worked on a Marine training film, then was assigned as a technical advisor to the film Sands of Iwo Jima, where Lewis said he advised the cast how to lace up their leggings.http://www.marforres.usmc.mil/MFRNews/ConMar/Fall04.pdf ==Screenwriting== Lewis began his screenwriting career in 1950 with several Westerns, including the Lash LaRue feature King of the Bullwhip for Ron Ormond.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507289/ With the start of the Korean War, Lewis returned to active duty for six years in the Corps. He served as a combat correspondent and photographer, where he earned the Bronze Star during his second Korean tour, filming Marine aircraft bombing enemy positions. During the Korean War, Lewis had his first experience with the M1 carbine. He fired eight rounds at an enemy soldier before a Marine with a Thompson submachine gun felled the soldier. Lewis discovered that six of his rounds had hit his target with no effect; Lewis began to carry a Thompson.The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons, p. 206 Lewis submitted over two dozen magazine articles to Marine Corps Headquarters about the exploits of the Marines in Korea. Headquarters sent them back, saying that they sounded too much like Marine propaganda; Lewis then sent them to his civilian literary agent who had them published, with a payment for Lewis of $200 each. Lewis sent copies of the published articles to the Headquarters person who had rejected them. After Korea, Captain Lewis served as a company commander in the 4th Marines at Camp Pendleton, then was transferred to Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay as a Public Information Officer. During his Hawaiian tour, Lewis was assigned as one of the technical advisors to John Ford's Mister Roberts. When no one could find a stunt performer to drive a motorcycle off a pier, Lewis did the job himself. Lewis later appeared in Ford's film Sergeant Rutledge. In 1960, Lewis wrote the screenplay for Poverty Row filmmaker Edgar G. Ulmer's The Amazing Transparent Man. The only non-Western script by Lewis ever filmed, this poorly received American International Pictures release was later lampooned in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. ==Journalism== Though Lewis's commanding officer offered to get him a regular commission, Lewis wished to become a full-time writer and left the Corps. In addition to his screenplays, film work, and story writing, Lewis became an editor of a magazine and, after three years of observing the process, teamed up with that magazine's art director Dean Grennell to publish Gun World magazine in 1959. Lewis authored the monthly knife column in Gun World until his death. Lewis's writing on the capabilities of various weapons as well as his photos of \\"exotic\\" (military and law enforcement) weapons led several major firearms manufacturers to not advertise in Gun World. Lewis told the then Commandant of the Marine Corps Paul X. Kelley that the M16 rifle's effect was that \\"The United States used to be known as a Nation of Riflemen; now we've become a Nation of Sprayers\\". Lewis's continued contact with the Marine Corps led him to: * write the screenplay to Marshall Thompson's film A Yank in Viet-Nam that was filmed on location in South Vietnam in 1963. * have his first novel, Tell it to the Marines, published in 1966. * return to active duty in the Corps in 1969 with III Marine Amphibious Corps in the Vietnam War. Lewis earned his second and third Air Medals during his Vietnam tour. Lewis retired from the Marine Corps Reserve one day before his 60th birthday, November 12, 1984. In addition to nonfiction, Lewis wrote \\"Charlie Cougar\\" mysteries and Westerns as well as White Horse, Black Hat – A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row, his memoirs of Hollywood. Jack Lewis died on May 24, 2009, after a short bout with cancer. ==Quote== \\"I've been told that I'm not smart enough to realize I can't tilt windmills and win, but tenacity has a life and a way all its own, I've found.

He won the Milk Race twice, came second in the world amateur road race championship and fourth in the world professional championship.Cycling Weekly, UK, 12 October 1992 ==Early career== Born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, West's first ride was to Danebridge, when he was 15. He went with his uncle.Cycling Weekly 13 December 2007 The following year he joined the Tunstall Wheelers, a club in the Stoke- on-Trent conglomeration of towns in Staffordshire. He won the North Staffordshire 25-mile time-trial championship when he was 16. He beat one hour for 25 miles in 1961 and won North Staffordshire championships at 10, 25, 30 and 50 miles, won the area track league and became five-mile and 4,000m pursuit champion. His first international selection was for the Olympia's Tour, the amateur tour of the Netherlands, in 1964. He was unplaced. ==International amateur== West rode the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain for the first time in 1965, riding as a late selection for the Midlands. His local bike shop owner jokingly promised him a free bike if he won.Cycling Weekly, UK, 5 December 1992 West said: \\"I remember seeing my first Milk Race in Chester. I was about 16. It impressed me. And never did I imagine that I'd ride. My first one was in 1965 and I won it. Circumstances!\\" He won the points competition as well but he won overall, he says, only because several riders, including a leading Spaniard, were thrown out in the race's first positive dope tests.Woodland, Les (1980), Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, p112Luis Santamarina won the stage of the 1965 Tour of Britain which started at Scarborough and crossed Rosedale Chimney. He rode away from the race on one of the race's hardest climbs before colliding with the back of a car parked beside the road as an official waited to time him. He remounted and won the stage and led the race. Two days later he and three others were disqualified for doping, and the Spanish team went home. West's prizes for winning were a gold watch and a combined radiogram and cocktail cabinet.Daily Telegraph, 29 August 2004, Cycling news, West Still hooked on adrenalin, by Mark Hodginkson That year he beat the national hour record, set a 25-mile time-trial record, won the Tour of the Cotswolds next day, won the national road championship and came second in the Isle of Man International. In 1966 West lived in the Netherlands, riding round-the-houses races. He said: \\"Fantastic, that was. Very, very fast.\\" He rode Olympia's Tour, the amateur tour of the Netherlands, which he said averaged 29 mph. \\"But Holland left me legless for the climbs on the Milk Race\\" and he came sixth. \\"To me, that was nothing\\", he said. That autumn he finished second to Evert Dolman of the Netherlands in the world championship on the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. The two had slipped clear of the field but West cramped in the sprint. He has refused to speak further of Dolman, going little further than saying \\"Well, he didn't ride exactly clean. At the end he told me so. Let's just say things were not right.\\" Keith Bingham, writing in Cycling Weekly went further when he spoke of a rider so ill through the drugs he had taken that he no longer recognised journalists he had known for years. The description approaches Dolman, who was caught for doping as a professional. Dolman said \\"I couldn't win races without that stuff, that was obvious.\\"Te Fanatiek, Wielersport, the Netherlands, undated cutting. Dolman died in 1993, aged 47. West said an official from the British Cycling Federation approached him after the championship and said: \\"Good ride, son. What's your name?\\"Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, p122 West was to have joined Jacques Anquetil's Bic team, at the recommendation of British professional Vin Denson, but his contract did not arrive and he stayed in Britain. West won the Milk Race again in 1967, in what Keith Bingham of Cycling Weekly described as \\"astonishing style.\\" ==Professional== Professional racing had developed in Britain but West held on for the Olympic Games in Mexico in 1968. He punctured early, waited for the mechanics in the service car behind the last rider, changed bikes twice, chased for 30 miles and gave up. The writer Clement Freud said West was so depressed that he hadn't noticed he was sitting on his banana sandwiches.The Sun, UK, undated cutting He turned professional for the Holdsworth team, managed by a shopkeeper called Roy Thame in west London. It paid no more than he had been winning as an amateur, he said, but there were compensations. His first win was the Tour of the Isle of Wight, held over three days at Easter. \\"That's my first pro win and probably my last\\", he said.Cycling, 12 April 1969, p2 He had four more wins and came second nine times. His best international performance was fourth in the world championship in 1970, held in Leicester, England. West got into the winning break with Jempi Monseré of Belgium, Leif Mortensen and the Italian Felice Gimondi.Cycling Weekly, 12 December 1992, p34 Monseré won and West came fourth, troubled once more by cramp in the sprint. West won the British championship, broke the London-Portsmouth, London-Bath-London records, won the Tour of the Peaks and then in 1978 retired as a professional.The West Way, Winning, UK, undated cuttingCycling Weekly, UK, 17 February 1996, p16 The rule was that professionals had to have a season out of racing before the British Cycling Federation would consider a return to the amateur. West said: \\"The BCF punished you.... You'd be surprised by how much form and interest you lost. If you'd turned professional it was like you had a disease in them days. So that was it, such is life.\\" He regretted that amateurs and professionals had not been allowed to ride together. He said: \\"A few years after I'd packed up racing, they let the pros ride the Milk Race, which could never have happened in the 1970s. It seemed like my generation were punished in that way, and it's a shame because it would have been good all round if we could have ridden it.\\"Cycling Weekly, UK, 17 February 1996, p18 He started racing again, as an amateur, in 1980, rode for two years, then retired. ==Veteran cycling== West returned to cycling in the veteran class, and remarked on the fact that he was remembered by older neighbours in Stoke-on-Trent but not by others. In 2003 he dominated the national masters' championship in WarwickshireBritish Cycling, Archives, The Legend that is Les West -- Still a Champion In September 2006, West became national champion of the League of Veteran Racing Cyclists and rode for GS Strada-Afford Rent-a-Car-Pinarello team which is sponsored by Phil Griffiths.

Cristóbal de Villalpando (ca. 1649 – 20 August 1714) was a Baroque Criollo artist from New Spain, arts administrator and captain of the guard. He painted prolifically and produced many Baroque works now displayed in several Mexican cathedrals, including the cathedrals in Querétaro and Mexico City, as well as a depiction of the Zócalo (main square) in Mexico City, showing the damage of the 1692 riot to the viceregal palace three years earlier.Richard L. Kagan, Urban Images of the Hispanic World, 1493-1793, with the collaboration of Fernando Marías. New Haven: Yale University Press 2000. ==Life== Born in Mexico City to the influential Villalpando family, Cristóbal assumed duties in the local militia as an ensign, as well as painting with Baltasar de Echave Rioja (Echave the Younger) in the Echave workshop.Haces, Juana Gutierrez (2006) \\"Cristóbal de Villalpando\\" page 535 In Rishel, Joseph J. and Stratton- Pruitt, Suzanne (editors) (2006) The Arts in Latin America, 1492–1820 Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, In 1669, he married María de Mendoza and they had four children. He received several religious art commissions, both in Mexico City and in Puebla. Other paintings by his hand are found in the sacristy of the Mexico City Cathedral. Villalpando rose to the rank of captain and served several times as director (veedor) of the painters' guild. Villalpando included a self-portrait in his Apparition of Saint Michael on Mount Gargano in the sacristy of the Mexico City cathedral. His portrait is nested among the clergy at the bottom right.Bargellini, Clara (2006) \\"Painting in Colonial Latin America\\" pp. 322–334, page 330, In Rishel, Joseph J. and Stratton-Pruitt, Suzanne (editors) (2006) The Arts in Latin America, 1492–1820 Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, Villapando died in Mexico City in 1714 and was buried there. ==Style== The Virgin of the Apocalypse, Museo Bello y González, Puebla Villalpando's early works attest to the influence of Peter Paul Rubens; however, as his style continued to develop, he moved away from the extremes of vivid coloring and excessive robustness to a more measured style, using a broad palette and incorporating more of the New World painting traditions. In his later work he moved away from uniform luminosity, employing greater contrast and placing artificial light sources within his paintings to add a touch of drama. His work was much emulated. Villalpando tailored his style to the nature of the work and to its patron. He employed rough blots and smudges to good effect, but used meticulous brushstrokes when required. ==Works== Cristóbal de Villalpando. Our Lady of Sorrows. Between 1680 - 1689. Col. Museo Soumaya (Detail) Villalpando's early works include a number for the Puebla Cathedral. These cathedral works include a large painting of The Transfiguration, climaxing with the Assumption of the Virgin on the inside of the dome of the apse chapel, and incorporate themes from the eucharist. His large altar piece from the Puebla cathedral, Moses and the Brazen Serpent and the Transfiguration of Jesus (1683) was featured in a recent major exhibit in Mexico City and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/10/12/villalpando-moses-in-mexico/ For the sacristy of the Mexico City cathedral he painted *The Church Militant and the Church Triumphant, *The Triumph of Religion, *The Virgin of the Apocalypse, *Our Lady of Sorrows, *The Apparition of Saint Michael Archangel, and others. Most of Villalpando's portraits have been lost, as well as a number of his religious works. However, one of his religious masterpieces, The Adoration of the Magi (1683), was recently discovered by an art history professor to have been hanging in the president's office at Fordham University. It was subsequently featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Villalpando exhibition in 2017. ==View of the Zócalo of Mexico City (1695)== View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico city (1695) Villalpando's painting of the main square of Mexico City is an important work not only for showing the major buildings and architectural features surrounding the capital's main square (Metropolitan Cathedral, palace of the viceroy, the palace of the archbishop, the town council or ayuntamiento building, and the enclosed commercial area, the Parían Market, and the canal alongside the Portal de las Flores), but also the activities of Mexico City residents of all races and classes. An important historical feature of the painting is the depiction of the fire damage to the viceroy's palace by mob in 1692. The viceroy of Mexico, Don Gaspar de Sandoval Silva y Mendoza, Count of Gelve, commissioned the painting by Mexico City's foremost artist of the late seventeenth century. Gelves was returning to Spain after a decidedly mixed record as viceroy, which saw disorder culminating in the June 1692 riot and perhaps wanted the painting as a souvenir of his period as viceroy. It is notable that Villalpando paints the ruined façade of the viceroy's palace and does not take artist's license to paint out this major historical event in Mexico City's history. Obviously, from the commercial and social activity in the Zócalo that Villalpando paints in exceptional detail, the main appears to have gone back to its normal importance. Elites in their finery brought by carriage to the square, richly stocked shops, and a plethora of Indian and casta market sellers are depicted. The view has been considered metonymic, where \\"Villalpando equates the zócalo with Mexico City. The harmony and prosperity the scene evokes makes it almost possible to ignore the damaged façade of the viceregal palace.... The painting, now in the private collection of Lord Methuen at Corsham Court, UK, has been used as the cover illustration for two important books on colonial Spanish America.D.A.

It was a follow-up to the Chang'e 1 lunar probe, which was launched in 2007. Chang'e 2 was part of the first phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, and conducted research from a 100-km-high lunar orbit in preparation for the December 2013 soft landing by the Chang'e 3 lander and rover. Chang'e 2 was similar in design to Chang'e 1, although it featured some technical improvements, including a more advanced onboard camera. Like its predecessor, the probe was named after Chang'e, an ancient Chinese moon goddess. After completing its primary objective, the probe left lunar orbit for the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, to test the Chinese tracking and control network, making the China National Space Administration the third space agency after NASA and ESA to have visited this point.SpaceDaily. \\"China's second moon orbiter Chang'e-2 goes to outer space\\".

In April 2012, Chang'e 2 departed L2 to begin an extended mission to the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, which it successfully flew by in December 2012. This success made China's CNSA the fourth space agency to directly explore asteroids, after NASA, ESA and JAXA. As of 2014, Chang'e 2 has travelled over 100 million km from Earth, and is conducting a long-term mission to verify China's deep-space tracking and control systems. The probe is expected to return closer to Earth sometime around 2029. == Overview == The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is designed to be conducted in four Chang'e 4 press conference. CNSA, broadcast on 14 January 2019. phases of incremental technological advancement: The first is simply reaching lunar orbit, a task completed by Chang'e 1 in 2007 and Chang'e 2 in 2010. The second is landing and roving on the Moon, as Chang'e 3 did in 2013 and Chang'e 4 did in 2019. The third is collecting lunar samples from the near-side and sending them to Earth, a task for the future Chang'e 5 and Chang'e 6 missions. The fourth phase consists of development of a robotic research station near the Moon's south pole.China's Planning for Deep Space Exploration and Lunar Exploration before 2030.

Echo Huang, Quartz. 26 April 2018. ==Design== Chang'e 2 was the backup of the Chang'e 1 probe and it had been modified for its own mission. While Chang'e 1 operated in a 200-km orbit, Chang'e 2 flew at only 100 km, allowing for higher-resolution images and more precise science data. The probe also possessed a higher-resolution camera, being able to resolve features as small as across from orbit. According to Qian Huang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and Yong-Chun Zheng of the NAOC, the spacecraft also had a shorter Earth-to-Moon cruise time of 5 days, rather than 12. The probe's launch rocket had two more boosters to accomplish this more direct route to the Moon. Furthermore, its laser altimeter's footprint was smaller than Chang'e 1's, achieving 5-meter vertical accuracy in its estimate of the Moon's radius. It also pulsed more frequently – five times per second rather than just once per second, as Chang'e 1's altimeter did. Additionally, the probe's main camera had a spatial resolution of , rather than . The total cost of the Chang'e 2 mission was approximately CN¥900 million ($125 million). Late in the mission, Chang'e 2's orbit was lowered to an elliptical one, with the same apolune (100 km) as Chang'e 1, but with a perilune of only 15 km. Tracking for the mission was performed with an X-band radio capability, which was not available for Chang'e 1. Zheng remarked that \\"the mission goals of Chang'e 2 were focused into the high resolution image for the future landing site of CE-3 lunar lander and rover. The success of Chang'e 2 provided an important technical basis for the successful implementation of China's future lunar exploration,\\" and the Queqiao relay satellite was based on Chang'e 2 design.Future Chinese Lunar Missions: Chang'e 4 - Farside Lander and Rover.

Williams, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. 7 December 2018. ==Mission summary== Launch Chang'e 2 was launched on 1 October 2010 at 10:59:57 UTC aboard a Long March 3C rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Xichang, Sichuan. The launch of the probe coincided with China's National Day on 1 October, in a symbolic celebration of the country's 61st communist anniversary. Lunar mission The spacecraft entered an orbit with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 380,000 km, and separated from the carrier rocket as planned. It was the first time that a Chinese lunar probe directly entered an Earth-to-Moon transfer orbit without orbiting the Earth first. After the launch, Chang'e 2 arrived in its lunar orbit within 4 days and 16 hours. Later, the probe lowered its orbit to , with a perilune of . Chang'e 2 entered its 100 km working orbit on 9 October 2010 after three successful brakings. On 8 November 2010, the Chinese government announced the success of all of Chang'e 2's mission objectives, and published lunar surface images with a resolution of up to .\\"Chang'e 2 local image maps first published\\".

He also painted major works for the Jesuit church in Tepozotlan, Mexico (now the Museum of the Viceroyalty).

He was selected in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He played college football for the University of Maryland, where he was a starting running back. During the 2008 season, he was the second-leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference, behind Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech. Scott played interscholastic football as a running back and free safety at Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School. He was moderately recruited, but Scout.com thought he was more suited to the position of wide receiver or cornerback at the intercollegiate level. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on redshirt status. The following season, he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore. He also played on special teams as a kickoff returner, which was the coaching staff's attempt to get him on the field in some capacity because of his speed (4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash and sub 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters) In 2008, Scott took over as Maryland's starting running back and spent much of the season as the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He was eventually surpassed by Dwyer, although both players were named to the All-ACC first team at the season's end. Scott also became the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl most valuable player when he broke the University of Maryland bowl game rushing record, and he finished the season with 1,133 rushing yards, the seventh Terrapin player to surpass a thousand yards in a single season. ==Early life== Scott was born on May 26, 1988 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania to Gloria and Lee Scott Sr. He has two older brothers, Lee Scott Jr., who played football as a defensive back at La Salle, and James, who ran track at Saint Joseph's. When Da'Rel Scott was eight years old, his parents had a falling out, which prompted his father to leave the family. Thereafter, Lee Scott Sr. was no longer involved in raising his sons and would often miss scheduled visits. Da'Rel Scott said, \\"He just kept letting me down. Just day by day, I was thinking, 'I need a father figure in my life.'\\" In high school, his attitude changed, and he said, \\"I don't need him.\\" Despite the absence of his biological father, Scott grew up with the support of his mother, two brothers Lee and James, cousin Leroy, family friend and youth football coach Mike Shaw, and high school athletic director Charlie Forster. He attended Plymouth Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, where he was a four- year letterwinner in football, track, and basketball. In football, Scott was a three-year starter and played as both a tailback and free safety. During his senior year, he rushed for 2,523 yards and 38 touchdowns on 232 attempts. As both a junior and senior, he received the Maxwell Award for the conference player of the year. As a senior, The Times Herald named him the area player of the year, the Associated Press named him an all-state player, and he was invited to the Big 33 Football Classic all-star game. SuperPrep named him an all-region player.Player Bio: Da'Rel Scott , University of Maryland, retrieved November 16, 2008. Rivals.com rated him a four-star prospect and assessed him as the 21st-ranked \\"athlete\\" recruit in the nation.

Scott needs to get physically bigger to be a college running back; he may project better as a wide receiver or cornerback.\\"Da'Rel Scott Profile, Scout.com, retrieved August 3, 2009.

In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he studied kinesiology. Track and field Scott was also a standout track athlete. During his junior year, he won the state championship in the 100 meters, with a time of 10.56 seconds. He lettered four years in track and field. As a senior in 2010, he competed in the 60 meters, posting a personal best of 6.87 seconds. ==College career==  2006 season  Scott sat out the 2006 season as a redshirt. After summer training camp, the coaching staff moved Scott to wide receiver, a position that lacked depth, but head coach Ralph Friedgen said that Scott had some difficulty making the adjustment.Marc Carig, Lack of Receiving Depth A Concern for Friedgen, The Washington Post, p. E09, September 37, 2006. He was, however, named the offensive scout team player of the week for his performance in the practices before the Florida State game.  2007 season  During 2007 spring practice, Scott was third on the depth chart, but suffered a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp.Heather Dinich, Terps' Ball, Green have spring in step, The Baltimore Sun, April 26, 2007. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, \\"On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just a different type of animal.\\" Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101 yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, \\"I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us.\\"Marc Carig, Sputtering Offense Troubles Maryland, The Washington Post, p. E04, September 25, 2007.

On one return, Scott gained 60 yards and nearly broke away for a touchdown, but Maryland was unable to capitalize on the gain during the subsequent possession.Andrew Zuckerman, Terps Get Chopped By Seminoles , The Diamondback, November 19, 2007. The next week, Maryland secured bowl eligibility by winning its regular season finale against NC State. Scott returned the opening kickoff 36 yards and recorded 89 yards on eight carries to lead the team in rushing. In the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Scott had one carry for no gain and returned two kickoffs for 36 yards. Scott finished the season as the team's all-purpose yardage leader with 84.2 yards per game and kick return leader with 566 yards, which set a school record for a freshman. Rivals.com named him a freshman All-ACC all-purpose player.  2008 season  After the graduation of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At the conclusion of spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains.Heather Dinich, Green, Scott hope to form 1-2 punch for Maryland, ESPN, May 1, 2008. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.Patrick Stevens, Green's time may finally arrive, The Washington Times, April 22, 2009.

He was associated with the communist movement in Kerala and his play Ningalenne Communistakki (You Made Me a Communist) is considered to be a groundbreaking event in the history of Malayalam theatre. ==Early life== Born Thoppil Bhaskara Pillai, on 8 April 1924 at Vallikunnam in Alleppey district, Kerala, Bhasi was the eldest son of Thoppil Parameshwaran Pillai and Nanikkutti Amma.KPAC, Thoppil Bhasi  A Profile Education His elementary education was at the SNDP Sanskrit School, and later on at the Sanskrit School, Changankulangara, from where he graduated in the Sanskrit Shastri course. Knowing fully well his desire to learn indigenous medicine, his father had him enrolled at the Ayurveda College, Thiruvananthapuram. It was here that he spearheaded the Students' Agitation that led to installing many of the facilities and rights enjoyed by the current generation of students at the College of Ayurveda. He also graduated securing the Top Rank in the Vaidya Kalanidhi Examination. ==Social life== His deep and enduring friendship with Kambisseri Karunakaran that extended through all spheres of their lives, also saw them at the forefront of some of the most significant political agitations in central Kerala. Once a staunch supporter and activist of the Indian Congress party, Thoppil Bhasi soon distanced himself from the same on matters of principles and found his direction in the neo movement of Communism via the Communist Party of India. He was associated with the communist movements that took place in Kerala during the 1940s and 1950s. Branded a Subversive and a Wanted Man by the government, he was on the run and went underground during the period of 1948–52, as a top priority suspect in the infamous Sooranad Incident, with a Rs 1000 bounty on his head. He was later acquitted, and went on to contest the first Panchayat elections in Kerala. He won, becoming the first president of the Vallikunnom panchayat. He was elected twice to the state assembly contesting the State elections, from Bharanikkavu in 1954 and Pathanamthitta in 1957. KPAC, theatre and Malayalam films Thoppil Bhasi never contested any more elections post his 1957 win, to devote his entire energies to this new direction his life has set course on – theatre. He had written his first One-act play Munnettam (The Advance) while on the run from the state, and based on the feedback received from the underground collective, had revisited, refined and re-energised the plot from a different perspective, creating the historical Ningalenne Communistaakki, both under his pseudonym Soman, for fear of revealing his true identity. The drama helped KPAC to become a force to reckon with on Kerala's theatrical arena. Later,he wrote scripts for 110 Malayalam films starting from 'Mudiyanaya Puthran' in 1961,most of them mega hits. His association with KPAC started with the staging of Ningalenne Communistaakki, and the entire proceedings from the show were donated towards the attorney fees needed to free the rest of accused in the Soornad Incident. He wrote the play Ningalenne Communistakki while in hiding in connection with the Sooranad case, which resulted from a revolt by agricultural workers against a landlord. Bhasi had to write the play under the name, Soman. Ningalenne Communistakki was first staged (under the banner of KPAC) in Chavara in Kollam district on 6 December 1952. He wrote 16 plays, for KPAC, each more spectacular and socially relevant than its predecessor and it used to be said in the 60s and 70s that there wasn't a day where at least one of his plays was not staged at any part of Kerala! Such was the influence of his creative power. From KPAC, he slowly moved to the film industry (some say it was a natural progression), authoring over 100 Screenplays and turned to directing 16 movies in Malayalam language, most of them box-office successes. ==Personal life== Thoppil Bhasi's wedding with Amminiamma, the niece of C Shankaranarayanan – ex-Speaker of the Kerala Legislative Assembly was solemnised when he was on the run, a wanted man for the government! In a moving tribute, aptly titled 'My Comrade', Amminiamma, amongst other nuggets, shares her husband's principle of simplicity and frugality in every aspect of his life. She recalls Udaya studio's Kunchacko asking her to buy him a new shirt as he was fed up of seeing Thoppil Bhasi in the same shirt every time! Thoppil Bhasi seems to have famously remarked, \\"Chackochen, I have 8 shirts of the same colour and type, and all eight have the same 'beedi-burn' patch at the left side of my breast-pocket !\\" He was the quintessential socialist, according to her. Thoppil Bhasi has 4 sons – Ajayan, Soman, Rajan and Suresh, and daughter Mala. Ajayan went on direct the award-winning Malayalam film Perumthachan in 1991. ==Awards and recognition== Thoppil Bhasi's dramas, Mudiyanaya Puthran and Puthiya Akasham, Puthiya Bhumi were awarded the Kerala Sahithya Academy Awards, and the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy awarded him its Fellowship in 1981. He is also the recipient of the Professor N Krishna Pillai Award and the SovietLand Nehru Award. He also was awarded the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film for directing Sarasayya in 1971 and the Kerala State Film Award for Best Story for Mooladhanam in 1969. ==Literary works== Thoppil Bhasi was prolific in terms of his creative output during his active years in theatre and movies. He authored 16 full-length plays, screenplays for over 100 movies, directed 16 movies and his autobiography was titled, Oliviley Ormakal. He was a regular contributor to the Janayugom Magazine and short stories to various publications which are yet to be collated and archived. ==Death== Thoppil Bhasi died on 8 December 1992. ==Selected books== #Ningalenne Communistakki: a drama which has influenced the politics of Kerala. #Thulabharam and many screen plays. #Olivile Ormmakal: give light to the life of many communists who are not known outside. ==Filmography== ;Director *Ningalenne Communistakki (1970) *Sarasayya (1971) *Oru Sundariyude Katha (1972) *Eanippadikal (1973) *Madhavikutty (1973) *Chakravakam (1974) *Mucheettukalikkaarante Makal (1975) *Ponni (1976) *Missi (1976) *Yudhakaandam (1977) *Mochanam (1979) *Ente Neelakaasham (1979) ;Writer *Mudiyanaya Puthran (1961) *Aadyakiranangal (1964) *Adimakal (1969) *Thulabharam (1968) *Vivahitha (1970) *Anubhavangal Paalichakal (1971) *Chattakkari (1974) *Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu (1983) *Ente Upasana (1984) ==References *News on impact of Thoppil bhasi * Category:Screenwriters from Kerala Category:Malayali people Category:Malayalam-language writers Category:Malayalam-language dramatists and playwrights Category:Kerala State Film Award winners Category:Malayalam screenwriters Category:1925 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Indian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Malayalam film directors Category:20th-century Indian dramatists and playwrights Category:Kerala MLAs 1957–1959 Category:People from Alappuzha district Category:Dramatists and playwrights from Kerala Category:Members of the Kerala Legislative Assembly Category:Communist Party of India (Marxist) politicians from Kerala Category:20th-century Indian film directors Category:Indian Communist writers Category:Film directors from Kerala Category:Male actors from Kerala Category:20th-century Indian male actors Category:Male actors in Malayalam cinema Category:Indian male film actors ","title":"Thoppil Bhasi"},{"id":"20233631","text":"Felix Cyril Sigismund Dittmer (27 June 1904 – 29 August 1977)Dittmer, Felix Cyril Sigismund (1904–1977) — Australian Dictionary of Biography.

SS Wassaic was a steel-hulled, single-screw freighter built under a United States Shipping Board contract. She was launched on 14 April 1918 by the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. Subsequently, taken over by the U.S. Navy for World War I use by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and given Identification Number (Id. No.) 3230, she was commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, as USS Wassaic (ID-3230) on 14 October 1918 with Lieutenant Commander George H. Cooke, USNRF, in command. Wassaic loaded 7,468 tons of United States Army supplies and got underway for Bordeaux, France, on 10 November 1918, the day before the armistice with Germany was signed, ending World War I. En route to Europe, Wassaic encountered mechanical difficulties and was obliged to put into New York City on 16 November 1918 for repairs. Underway again on 29 November 1918, Wassaic, rerouted in light of the war's end, sailed for Brest, France, instead of Bordeaux. Arriving at Brest on 13 December 1918, Wassaic got underway for the United States on 31 December 1918. After a stop at Corona, Spain, for repairs to her damaged propeller, Wassaic got underway from Corona on 6 January 1919. Following stops at the Azores and Bermuda, she made port at Newport News, Virginia, on 7 February 1919. Wassaic took on a cargo of railroad supplies and departed the United States East Coast on her second NOTS voyage on 10 March 1919, bound for La Pallice, France. Arriving there on 23 March 1919, she discharged her cargo and returned to the United States, heavily ballasted partly with a cargo of steel rails. Putting briefly into Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 April 1919, Wassaic sailed for New Orleans on 23 April 1919, arriving there on 29 April 1919. Discharging her cargo of steel there, she shifted to New York. There, after final repairs and inventories, Wassaic was decommissioned, struck from the Navy List, and returned to the United States Shipping Board, all on 29 May 1919. Wassaic remained in Shipping Board ownership until she was abandoned due to age and deterioration in 1931 or 1932. == References == * == External links == * Category:Design 1013 ships Category:Design 1013 ships of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:1918 ships Category:World War I cargo ships of the United States Category:World War I auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"SS Wassaic"},{"id":"20233705","text":"Robert Duncan Sherrington (21 January 1902 - 16 March 1966) was an Australian politician.

Mooney (horse racing) John Joseph Mooney (April 6, 1930 – June 16, 2020) was an American chemical engineer who was co-inventor of the three-way catalytic converter, which has played a dramatic role in reducing pollution from motor vehicles since their introduction in the mid-1970s. ==Early life and education== Mooney grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, where he attended St. Georges Grammar School and then St. Joseph's High School, graduating in 1947. Mooney then spent ten years working for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G;) while attending Seton Hall University, where he completed his Bachelor of Science degree in 1955. He spent the next few years with the United States Army. He then continued his education at Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology), where he earned a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1960. Mooney also earned an MBA in marketing from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1992 while working at Engelhard. Mooney was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree (honoris causa) in 2007 by his alma mater New Jersey Institute of Technology for his outstanding achievements in the fields of environmental protection and automotive engineering.Honorary Degree \\"2007 Commencement Honoree: John J. Mooney '60\\" , New Jersey Institute of Technology. ==Career== While serving in the United States Army from 1955 to 1956, Mooney was assigned to a series of nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, which included 17 atom bomb and two hydrogen bomb tests. Mooney was as close as 7½ miles from fission bomb tests. Mooney came to Engelhard in 1960, after graduate school, as a result of a connection made in an electrochemical engineering course. He worked at the company's Gas Equipment Division. Among his first tasks there were purification of hydrogen, purification and catalysis of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen and a process for using a ruthenium catalyst to produce hydrogen from liquid ammonia for the United States Air Force. As a result, the Air Force was able to easily supply hydrogen for weather balloons, since it was more efficient to ship liquid ammonia to distant locations than cylinders of gas. The 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act required significant reductions in hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. The converters available at the time were oxidation catalysts, which could handle hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide, but were ineffective in reducing nitrogen oxides. Car manufacturers and catalyst companies were trying to develop a multiple step process that would address hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in one process while reducing nitrogen oxides in another. Chemist Carl D. Keith and Mooney with their team at Engelhard came up with the first production catalytic converter in 1973. The three-way catalyst developed by them allowed all three exhaust pollutants (hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides) to be remedied using a single catalyst bed. Their solution to addressing the variations in air/fuel mixtures was to combine rare-earth oxides and base metal oxide components in the catalyst together with Platinum and Rhodium in a ceramic honeycomb with tiny passages coated with the catalytic material. This design ensured that the oxygen needed in the reactions was absorbed when it was in excess and released when it was needed, allowing all three pollutants to be removed in a single catalytic component. The three-way catalytic converter reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen, oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water.An AIChE Mini History of John Mooney , New Jersey Institute of Technology. Accessed November 15, 2008. ==Accomplishments== Mooney was elected a Fellow of Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1990 for his efforts in exhaust emission control. In 2001, Keith and Mooney received the Walter Ahlstrom Prize, awarded in conjunction with the Finnish Academies of Technology, for their work in inventing and commercializing the three-way catalytic converter. Estimates were that by the time the award was received, the converters developed by Keith were installed in 80% of new cars manufactured worldwide and had prevented 56 million tons of hydrocarbons, 118 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 464 billion tons of carbon monoxide from being emitted as pollution in the 25 years since their introduction.Staff. \\"Engelhard Scientists Awarded Walter Ahlstrom Prize for Invention of Catalytic Converter Technology\\", Business Wire, November 15, 2001. Accessed November 15, 2008. Together with Keith, Mooney was honored by the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the 2002 National Medal of Technology, awarded \\"For the invention, application to automobiles, and commercialization of the three-way catalytic converter. Through their persistent efforts, this technology is the key emission-control component in all new light-duty vehicles in the United States and throughout the world.\\"National Medal of Technology Recipients for 2002, United States Patent and Trademark Office. Accessed November 15, 2008. Mooney was awarded a total of 17 patents, the latest being one for a catalytic converter for the small two-stroke engines, used in chainsaws, lawn mowers, and leaf blowers. His invention reduced hydrocarbon emissions by as much as 70%, improved fuel efficiency and added up to 40% more power while addressing the pollution of an engine that often produces large amounts of pollution due to the lubricating oil mixed with the fuel. As President of the Environmental and Energy Technology and Policy Institute, Mooney has worked with the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles of the United Nations Environment Programme to help end the use of leaded gasoline throughout the world. As of 2002, there were 51 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in which leaded gasoline was still in use.Staff. \\"John Mooney to Receive the 2005 Kazutoshi Fujimara Award\\", Chemical Engineering Process, July 2005.

The 78032 was used exclusively in DEC's VAX-based systems, starting with the MicroVAX II in 1985. When clocked at a frequency of 5 MHz, the 78032's integer performance is comparable to the VAX-11/780 superminicomputer, which was introduced on 25 October 1977. The microprocessor could be paired with the MicroVAX 78132 floating point accelerator for improved floating point performance. The 78032 represented a number of firsts for DEC. It was DEC's first single-chip microprocessor implementation of the VAX ISA and DEC's first self-fabricated microprocessor. The MicroVAX 78032 is also notable as it was the first semiconductor device to be registered for protection under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984. The MicroVAX 78032 contains 125,000 transistors on an 8.7 by 8.6 mm (74.82 mm2) die that was fabricated in DEC's ZMOS process, a 3.0 µm NMOS logic process with two layers of aluminum interconnect. The die is packaged in a 68-pin surface-mounted leaded chip carrier. ==MicroVAX 78132== right The MicroVAX 78132 (otherwise known as the DC337) is a floating-point coprocessor for the MicroVAX 78032 microprocessor. It interfaces to the MicroVAX 78032 via the DAL bus and a few control lines. The MicroVAX 78132 was responsible for executing 61 out of 70 floating-point instructions defined by the MicroVAX subset of the VAX ISA and accelerates nine integer instructions. The MicroVAX 78132 has a 100 ns microcycle divided into four 25 ns clock phases which is generated by a 40 MHz input clock. It was composed of five \\"elements\\": a 67-bit fraction processor, a 13-bit exponent processor, a 1-bit sign processor, a microsequencer and a bus interface unit. The MicroVAX 78132 contained 32,141 transistors on a die measuring 8.4 mm by 6.6 mm (55.44 mm2).

In four career games, Linde pitched 10⅔ innings and had a 6.75 earned run average (ERA). Born and raised in Wisconsin, Linde first played professionally with the Green Bay Bluejays. After a season with them, he enlisted in the armed forces for World War II, and joined the Greenville Spinners upon his return to baseball. During the next two seasons he spent some time with the Cleveland Indians, but mainly remained with the Indians' minor league teams. After a year each in Oklahoma City, Baltimore, and San Diego, he spent the last four years of his career pitching for the Portland Beavers. He retired at the end of the 1953 season and died in 1995. ==Early life== Linde attended high school at Beaver Dam High School in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. While there, he played basketball as well as baseball, and was part of the state champion Beaver Dam High School basketball team in 1937. After graduating, he played amateur baseball in Wisconsin for several years. In a state amateur baseball tournament in 1941, Linde, representing the Beaver Dam Beavers, pitched a one-hitter to help lead his team to a 9–1 win over the representatives from Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. Linde attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison on and off between 1939 and 1947. ==Minor leagues== Linde's first taste of minor league action came in 1942, when he signed with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League. His performances that season included a near-no-hitter that was lost in the ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II. After returning from military service, Linde joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried out for the Milwaukee Brewers, but was unable to make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. Linde pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, Linde was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the rule 5 draft. The following season, Linde pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians minor league affiliate of the Texas League. He spent most of the season with Oklahoma City, and in a pitching appearance in August, threw a no-hitter and narrowly missed pitching a perfect game. In 32 appearances for Oklahoma City, Linde won 14 games, lost 13, and had an ERA of 2.85 in 202 innings pitched. At the end of the minor league season, Linde was called up to the Indians' major league roster along with Ernest Groth in order to build up the end of the bullpen. ==Cleveland Indians and Portland== Linde made his major league debut with the Indians on September 11, 1947, which ended up being his only appearance of the season. In that one appearance, he pitched ⅔ of an inning and allowed two earned run, finishing the game and season with an ERA of 27.00. During the off-season, Linde played basketball with the Olo Soaps, a team located in his native Beaver Dam. He took part in spring training with the rest of the Indians roster for the 1948 Cleveland Indians season. In late March, however, he was struck on the chin from a line drive hit by Indians manager Lou Boudreau, causing him to be sidelined for several days. By the end of spring training, Linde remained a part of the Indians roster. He pitched three games for the Indians early on in 1948, pitching ten innings, allowing six earned runs and finishing the season with a 5.40 ERA. After three games, he was demoted to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He spent the rest of the 1948 season as a starting pitcher for Baltimore. His performances included a one-hit victory in his first appearance for the club. Linde finished the season with a 5–9 record and a 4.50 ERA. Linde spent 1949 with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He tried to earn a spot with the Indians during spring training but was unable to. He spent the season as a starting pitcher for San Diego, and threw three shutouts over the course of the season, allowing only three hits to the Los Angeles Angels in his third one. He finished the season with a 14–15 record in 35 pitching appearances (32 starts), a 4.41 ERA, 105 strikeouts, and 226⅓ innings pitched. He brought the Padres to the playoffs, and pitched in game six of the championship against the Hollywood Stars, where he earned the 8–4 loss as the Stars won the PCL pennant and the Governors' Cup. At the start of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new contract with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA. ==Later life== After the 1953 season, Linde retired from baseball to tend to his wife, who was seriously ill. He died in Beaver Dam on October 24, 1995. ==References Category:1920 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:People from Beaver Dam, Wisconsin Category:Baseball players from Wisconsin Category:Wisconsin Badgers baseball players Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers Category:Military personnel from Wisconsin Category:Sportspeople from the Milwaukee metropolitan area Category:Burials in Wisconsin ","title":"Lyman Linde"},{"id":"20233964","text":"The 2002 Appalachian State Mountaineers football team represented Appalachian State University in the 2002 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

It was introduced on 11 July 1989 with the introduction of the VAX 6000 Model 400, the first system to feature the chip set. Rigel was also used in the VAX 4000 Model 300 and VAXstation 3100 Model 76. Production Rigel CPUs were rated at 35 to 43 MHz. The Rigel chipset consisted of several devices: *REX520 central processing unit (also known as the DC520 or \\"P-chip\\") *DC523 floating- point unit (codenamed KIWI or \\"F-chip\\" during development) *DC592 cache controller (codenamed COW or \\"C-chip\\" during development) *DC521 clock chip In addition, two further devices implemented the VAX vector processor option; these comprised the DC555 Vector Register set chip (VERSE) and the DC556 Vector Data Path chip (FAVOR). Support chips for Rigel-based systems included the RSSC (Rigel System Support Chip) and Ghidra, the VAX 4000 system interface chip. == REX520 == DEC Rigel DC520 CPU die shot The Rigel architecture was based on the VAX 8800 processor. It has a six-stage microinstruction pipeline and 64-entry fully associative translation look-aside buffer. The Rigel chip set supported an optional vector processor and the REX520 decoded any vector instructions and passed on to the vector interface (VC) chip by the REX520. The REX520 has a 2 KB unified primary cache, configurable as an instruction cache and an external 128 KB secondary cache (backup cache) implemented with CMOS static random access memory (SRAM) chips. The REX520 has an external cache because the VAX 8800's 64 KB primary cache could not be integrated on the same die. The backup cache controller was located on the VC chip. The REX520 consisted of 320,000 transistors, of which 140,000 are for logic and 180,000 for memory. The die measures 12 mm by 12 mm (144 mm²). It was packaged in a 224-lead ceramic leaded package. == Fabrication == The chip set was fabricated by DEC in their second-generation complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process, CMOS-2. The process had a 1.5 µm minimum feature size and two levels of aluminium interconnect. == Mariah == Mariah was a revised version of the Rigel chip set fabricated by DEC in their 1 µm CMOS-3 process, with higher clock frequencies between 62 and 71 MHz. The Mariah CPU, FPU and cache controller were designated DC595, DC596 and DC597 respectively. Enhancements over Rigel included a 4 kB first-level cache and 32-bit physical memory addressing in the Mariah CPU, and write-back caching implemented in the cache controller chip. Mariah was used in the VAX 6000 Model 500, MicroVAX 3100 Model 80 and VAXstation 4000 Model 60. == References == * \\"Rigel\\" at The Computer History Simulation Project * \\"Mariah\\" at The Computer History Simulation Project * K.M.I. - the site * Durdan, W.

Harcourt Brace) Around the World with Auntie Mame (1958) is a novel by Patrick Dennis and sequel to his bestseller Auntie Mame.UIUC website ==Plot== Narrator \\"Patrick\\" is seventeen, and has left his private prep school. His Auntie Mame takes him with her on an extended tour of Europe, which becomes a round-the-world tour before his enrollment in college. They have adventures in Paris, London, Biarritz, Venice, Austria, Russia, Lebanon, and the high seas, meeting and dealing with British nobles, con men, embarrassing relatives, Nazis, and gunrunners before they arrive home again. Much of the action is a slyly satirical commentary on such things as the practice of \\"presenting at Court,\\" fashionable political activism, the naivete of some Americans abroad, and the ways in which small communities of expatriates often end up behaving. The main story is encased in a \\"frame\\" narrative, in which Patrick, now grown and married, tries to placate his wife with highly edited tales from his travels with his aunt. This takes up where the original novel, Auntie Mame, left off, with Patrick's son Michael going off to India with Mame promising to have him home by Labor Day. Two years have passed, with no word beyond a few random post cards. Each chapter begins with Patrick's reassuring, off-hand comments about his journeys with Mame, and then continues with him narrating what really happened. ==Critical reception== Critical reception for the novel in 1958: *“As extravagantly full of gags, slapstick comedy, and general hilarious confusion as its predecessor.” – New York Herald Tribune *“Indescribably funny.” – Chicago Tribune *“Funnier than the first book.” – New York Post *\\"There is no important difference between Auntie Mame, which sold 1,500,000 copies, and Around the World. Biggest change: in the starting novel Mame Dennis gets married; in the sequel she just gets around\\" – Time magazine (August 25, 1958) Dennis's novels fell out of fashion for many years, but his best sellers were reprinted in 2003, with forewords and other commentary by present-day humorists and the author's son. Around The World With Auntie Mame was reprinted with the restoration of a chapter that had been censored from the original edition. The chapter tells of Auntie Mame's and Patrick's time on a collective farm in the USSR. The publisher felt the chapter, however satirical, would not be acceptable coming, as the novel did, at the height of the Red Scare. The reprinted edition has sold well at Amazon.com, maintaining a four-and-a-half-out-of-five star rating. ==References== Category:1958 American novels Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:Sequel novels Category:Mame ","title":"Around the World with Auntie Mame"},{"id":"20234023","text":"Hamed Rasouli (born 18 January 1985) is an Iranian football player.

He played for the Cleveland Indians during the 1947 and 1948 seasons and the Chicago White Sox during the 1949 season. In four career games, Groth pitched 7⅓ innings and had a 4.91 earned run average (ERA). Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Groth began his professional career in the Wisconsin State League in 1942. After his rookie season, he spent the next three years serving in the military during World War II. After he returned, he spent more time in the minor leagues, then spent parts of the 1947 and 1948 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. After the end of the 1948 season, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox, and played with them in 1949. He spent the next seven seasons pitching in the minor leagues, retiring at the end of the 1956 season. After his retirement, he ran Groth's Nursery and worked for Standard Steel, and died in 2004. ==Early life and minor leagues== Groth was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania to William T. and Clara Court Groth. He played American Legion Baseball in East Palestine, Ohio in his teens, and attended Beaver Falls High School. He grew up pitching in the county league, and was both a right fielder and pitcher for the Chippewa Indians. After pitching for Chippewa in 1941, he was offered a contract for the 1942 season by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Groth turned down the offer instead signing with the Cleveland Indians, spending the 1942 season with the Indians' D-Class (Rookie League) affiliate, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League, where he played alongside future teammate Mike Garcia. In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA. After the 1942 season, Groth spent the following three years serving with the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. After the war, he returned to baseball, spending the 1946 season with the Wilkes-Barre Barons, a Cleveland Indians minor league team that played in the Eastern League. His performances that season included a one-hitter against the Elmira Pioneers in the second game of a doubleheader on August 19. In 29 games, Groth finished with a 13–7 record and a 2.98 ERA. Shortly afterward, he became engaged to Blanche Klein, a fellow graduate of Beaver Falls High. The two were married shortly after. ==Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox== In 1947, Groth was promoted to the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League, the Cleveland Indians' AA-class minor league affiliate. In 33 games with Oklahoma City, he threw 180 innings and finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 3.45 ERA. After the minor league season ended in September, Groth was called up to the Cleveland Indians major league roster, and made his debut on September 11, 1947. He pitched in one more game, finishing the season having pitched 1⅓ innings, striking out one batter and not allowing a run. Groth was looking to stay in the major league in 1948. He spent spring training on the Indians' roster, and originally made a great impression on the team. However, he was one of seven Indians stricken with dysentery in early April, causing him to miss some time. By the end of spring training, Groth was optioned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, the Indians' AAA-class minor league affiliate. He spent the season with the Orioles, and his pitching performances included a 13–0 victory over the Newark Bears, as well as a 1–0 victory where Groth limited the Bears to three hits. Groth finished the season with Baltimore having amassed 29 pitching appearances, 27 of them starts, a 12–12 record and a 4.48 ERA, while also pitching in two games for the Dallas Eagles. After Baltimore's season ended, he was promoted to the Indians' roster, and pitched in one game for the Indians that season. At the end of the 1948 season, on December 2, the Indians traded Groth to the Chicago White Sox along with Bob Kuzava for Frank Papish. After signing a contract with the White Sox, Groth took part in spring, training alongside many other newcomers to the White Sox, where his pitching performance earned him a place on the major league roster. He pitched in three games for the White Sox, losing one, and finished his tenure with the White Sox with a 5.40 ERA in five innings pitched. After his final game on May 4, the White Sox purchased Ed Klieman and sold Groth to the Kansas City Blues, a New York Yankees minor league team, ending his major league career. ==Return to minor leagues== Groth spent the 1949 season with the Kansas City Blues, finishing with a 12–9 record, a 4.28 ERA, and 162 innings pitched. When the 1950 season began, the New York Yankees had five holdouts (players who wanted more money and would not sign their contracts). Groth was one of them, and was the only minor leaguer to hold out. He eventually signed his contract with Kansas City, and after spring training ended, Groth was sent to the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, the Yankees' AAA minor league affiliate. The Yankees sent Groth to the Oaks to make up for sending over George Earl Toolson last season, who the Oaks had to return because his condition was poor. Groth finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 5.09 ERA. In January 1951, the Oaks sold Groth to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, now a farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled in ten appearances, finishing with an ERA of 7.58, and was sent to the Chattanooga Lookouts, the AA minor league team of the Washington Senators. He pitched in 26 games for the Lookouts, finishing with a 3–8 record and a 6.29 ERA. For the next five seasons, Groth played for the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League. He was sold to Oklahoma City by Baltimore in December 1951. In his first season with Oklahoma City, he finished with a 15–12 record, a 3.43 ERA, and 207 innings pitched. The following season, Groth started things off with a victory in an early appearance against the Dallas Eagles where he allowed only four hits. He finished the season with an 8–8 record and a 5.37 ERA. In 1954, Groth improved his pitching, finishing the season with a 14–11 record and a 3.75 ERA. After a 9–13 season in 1955, Groth split time between Oklahoma City and the Tulsa Oilers in 1956, finishing the season with a combined 9–16 record. He ended his professional career after the 1956 season. ==Later life== After retiring from baseball, Groth returned to his hometown of Beaver Falls. He and his family ran Groth's Nursery, and he worked for Standard Steel until his retirement. He and his wife had three daughters; Elizabeth, Constance, and Suellen. Groth was inducted into the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He also spent time playing in local golf tournaments. Groth died on December 27, 2004. ==References *Ernest Groth – Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame Category:1922 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:American military personnel of World War II ","title":"Ernest Groth"},{"id":"20234057","text":"The abbey in the 17th century (engraving by Israël Silvestre) Longchamp Abbey (), known also as the Convent of the Humility of the Blessed Virgin, was a convent of Poor Clares founded in 1255 in Auteuil, Paris, by Saint Isabelle of France. The site is now occupied by Longchamp Racecourse. ==Royal Foundation== Saint Isabelle, founder of Longchamp (Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, Paris) Though betrothed to Hugh, eldest son and heir of Hugh X of Lusignan, Isabelle refused to celebrate the formal wedding due to her fixed determination to remain a virgin, although she never became a nun. In furtherance of Isabelle's wish to found a nunnery of Poor Clares, her brother King Louis IX of France began in 1255 to acquire the necessary land in the Forest of Rouvray, not far from the Seine, west of Paris. On 10 June 1256, the first stone of the monastic church was laid. The building appears to have been completed about the beginning of 1259, because Pope Alexander IV gave his sanction on 2 February 1259 to the new Rule which was composed especially for this community by the Franciscan friar Mansuetus, based on the Rule of St. Clare. The less rigorous Rule of Mansuetus allowed the community to hold property. The abbey was named the \\"Convent of the Humility of the Blessed Virgin\\" and the nuns were called the \\"Sisters of the Humble Order of Servants of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary\\". They were subject to the Order of Friars Minor. Some of the first nuns came from the Poor Clares in Reims. Isabelle never joined the community herself, but did live in the abbey, in a room separate from the nuns’ cells. She suffered from illnesses during her life, which prevented her from following the rule of life for the nuns. Isabelle refused to become abbess, which allowed her to retain her wealth and resources, so she could support them and continue to give to the poor. She kept a discipline of silence for most of her day. Isabelle died at Longchamp on 23 February 1270, and was buried in the abbey church. ==Destruction== Ruins of Longchamp Abbey (engraving by Edmond Morin c. 1856) Longchamp Abbey underwent many vicissitudes. During the French Revolution, on 26 February 1790, the nuns were served with an order of expulsion; on 17 September 1792 the valuables and sacred objects were taken away from the chapel and by 12 October that year the nuns had left the abbey.Henri Corbel, Petite Histoire du Bois de Boulogne, Albin Michel, 1931, p. 42.. In 1794 the empty building was offered for sale, but, as no one wished to purchase it, it was destroyed. In 1857 the remaining walls were pulled down, except for one tower, and the grounds were added to the Bois de Boulogne. == Abbesses of Longchamp== * Agnès I d'Anneri 1259-1262 * Mathilde de Guyencourt 1262-1263 * Agnès II d’Harcourt 1264-1275 * Julienne de Toyes 1275-1279 * Agnès II d’Harcourt 1279-1287 * Jeanne I de Nevers 1288-1294 * Jeanne II de Grèce 1294-1303 * Jeanne III de Vitry 1303-1312 * Jeanne IV d’Harcourt 1312-13?? * Jeanne V de Gueux 13??-1328 * Marie I de Lions 1328-1347 * Jeanne VI de Boucheville 1347-1349 * Agnès III de Liège 1349-1357 * Marie II de Gueux 1357-1369 * Agnès IV La Chevrel 1369-1375 * Jeanne VII de La Neuville 1375-1390 * Laurence Jacob 1390-13?? * Jeanne VIII de La Godicharde 13??-1402 * Agnès V d'Issy 1402-1418 * Jeanne IX des Essarts 1418-1437 * Marie III de La Poterne 1437-1451 * Marguerite I Gentianne 1451-1467 * Jeanne X La Porchère 1467-1484 * Jeanne XI Gerente 1484-1500 * Jacqueline de Mailly 1500-1514 * Jeanne XII de Hacqueville 1514-1532 * Catherine I Picard 1532-15?? * Jeanne XIII de Mailly 15??-1540 * Georgette Cœur 1540-1550 * Louise de Cerasme 1550-1559 * Marie IV Lottin 1559-15?? * Charlotte de La Chambre 15??-1567 * Anne I de Fontaines 1567-1580 * Jeanne XIV de Mailly 1580-1604 * Françoise Potier 1604-1606 * Bonne d'Amours 1606-1608 * Catherine II Brûlart de Sillery 1608-1629 * Claudine I Isabelle de Mailly 1629-1634 * Isabelle II Mortier 1634-16?? * Madeleine Placain 16??-1653 * Catherine III de Bellièvre 1658-1668 * Claudine II de Bellièvre 1668-1670 * Claudine I Isabelle de Mailly 1670-1673 * Catherine III Marie Dorat 1673-1676 * Catherine-Elisabeth I de Gournay 1676-1679 * Marguerite II Isabelle de Flecelles, 1679-1683 * Catherine III Marie Dorat 1683-1685 * Marie-Anne I Dorat 1685-1688 * Anne-Marie de Bragelongne 1688-1691 * Catherine III Marie Dorat 1691-1694 * Marie-Anne I Dorat 1694-1697 * Catherine III Marie Dorat 1697-1700 * Marie-Anne I Dorat 1700-1700 * Elisabeth-Henriette Guignard 1700-1703 * Catherine III Marie Dorat 1703-1706 * Marguerite III Agnès Nolet 1706-1709 * Elisabeth-Henriette Guignard 1709-1712 * Marguerite III Agnès Nolet 1712-1715 * Catherine-Elisabeth II Le Cosquino 1715-1718 * Marguerite III Agnès Nolet 1718-17?? * Catherine-Elisabeth II Le Cosquino 17??-1721 * Marie-Anne II Le Jau 1721-1724 * Catherine-Elisabeth II Le Cosquino 1724-1730 * Marie-Anne II Le Jau 1730-1733 * Catherine-Elisabeth II Le Cosquino 1733-1737 * Catherine IV Thérèse de Tourmont 1737-1740 * Anne II Louise de Tourmont 1740-17?? * Marie V Jeanne Jouy 17??-1790 ==Further reading== *Gaston Duchesne, Histoire de l'abbaye royale de Longchamp, 1257–1789, Paris, 1904. * Gerturd Młynarczyk, Ein Franziskanerinnenkloster im XV.

Born in Cairns, Queensland, he was educated at state schools before serving in the military 1942–1947. He returned to become a grazier at Longreach. In 1967, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Country Party Senator for Queensland. He held the seat until his defeat at the 1980 election, taking effect in 1981. One of his most notable moments was his involvement in what became known as \\"The Night of the Long Prawns\\", in April 1974. He regularly brought a batch of prawns from his home base in Townsville to share with his parliamentary colleagues in Canberra, and on that night he used this generosity as a ruse to keep DLP Senator Vince Gair entertained in his office all night, thus delaying Gair's resignation from the Senate in order to take up an appointment as Ambassador to Ireland, which had been offered to him by the Whitlam Labor government as a strategy to increase Labor's numbers in the Senate. The timing was crucial, as the non-Labor forces were aware that the Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen was that very night arranging to issue writs for 5 Queensland senators for the forthcoming half-Senate election, but if Gair had resigned first, writs for 6 senators would have been required, thus improving Labor's chances. In the end, Whitlam decided to call a double dissolution instead of the half-Senate election he had previously announced; all seats in the parliament were up for re-election, and the Gair Affair became irrelevant. ==References== Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1922 births Category:2010 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Ron Maunsell"},{"id":"20234135","text":"Ciissinraq River is a stream in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, in the Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. ==See also== * List of rivers of Alaska ==External links== * Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of Bethel Census Area, Alaska Category:Rivers of Unorganized Borough, Alaska ","title":"Ciissinraq River"},{"id":"20234138","text":"Andreas Holmsen (5 June 1906 – 20 February 1989) was a Norwegian historian, author, and educator.

When Pingris was three years old, his father left for work in Morocco and separated from the family. Pingris idolized Michael Jordan. After his classes, he would study his lessons and do his homework then go to their barangay court to practice his \\"Jordan-like\\" skills in basketball. When he has no classes he would call up his friends and play basketball in other barangays. In high school, Pingris tried to play in their school try-outs but he was not accepted, but when he was in 2nd year he was finally accepted to their school's varsity team. During his collegiate years, he would go play for the varsity basketball team of the Philippine School of Business Administration. However, he started his career at the Far Eastern University, Manila where he was formally discovered. He also played for the Cebu Gems in the Metropolitan Basketball Association. ==PBA career== FedEx Pingris was selected by the FedEx Express with the 3rd overall pick in the 2004 PBA draft. The draft also featured two of his future teammates, Yap and Artadi from UE. Pingris played a few games with Air21 prior to the trade that sent him to the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs. Purefoods He was traded to Purefoods after having played a few games with the Express. He was traded along with Egay Billones. In the 2005–06 PBA season, he was awarded with the Finals MVP in the 2006 PBA Philippine Cup as Purefoods defeated Red Bull, 4-2. In Game 2 of the Finals of the 2006 season, he scored 21 points to lead Purefoods to a 93-82 win. In the 2007–08 PBA Philippine Cup Finals, he grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds, leading to his new nickname, The Rebounding Demon. Magnolia/San Miguel When Purefoods center Rommel Adducul was diagnosed with nasopharynx cancer, Pingris was shipped to the Magnolia Beverage Masters for center Enrico Villanueva at the start of the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference. Pingris played his first game for Magnolia as a starter, going up against his former team, Purefoods. Pingris-Santos trade Before the 2009–10 PBA season began, Pingris and Magnolia teammate Ken Bono were traded to the Burger King Whoppers for superstar Arwind Santos and San Miguel's (formerly Magnolia) 2010 first round pick. In a Manila Bulletin interview, Burger King team owner Lito Alvarez further explained the trade: “The reason lang natagalan itong negotiation is we want a draft pick, not a player sa package because we already have 17 players including the three picks we’ll have in this Sunday’s Draft.” Return to Purefoods Pingris (left) watches his teammate James Yap drive against Aaron Aban of Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters Barely 24 hours after being shipped to Burger King, Pingris was released to the Purefoods TJ Giants after Purefoods agreed to surrender its first and second round picks in 2010 to Burger King. Pingris' return to Purefoods was confirmed by board governor Rene Pardo in an interview with GMANews.TV: \\"We have agreed to trade our first and second round picks next year to Burger King for Pingris.\\" Burger King Whoppers' board representative and then-incoming PBA chairman Lito Alvarez said that he felt that the trade was good for both teams, as Purefoods needed Pingris more, while the Whoppers planned to rebuild with their future draftees. In the Llamados' second game during the 2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup, Pingris grabbed five rebounds, making him the 42nd member of the league's 1,000 Offensive Rebound Club. For all his hardwork and contributions in B-Meg's 2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup championship run, Pingris was aptly nicknamed \\"Pinoy Sakuragi\\". Star Hotshots On October 14, 2016 Pingris was recognized during the PBA Leo Awards Night as he was named to the PBA All- Defensive Team. ==Personal life== Pingris is married to actress Danica Sotto, daughter of Vic Sotto and Dina Bonnevie. They have two children, a son named Jean Michael, and a daughter named Anielle Micaela. Pingris considers Slam Dunk as his favorite anime and its protagonist Hanamichi Sakuragi his favorite cartoon character, from which he earned the nickname \\"Sakuragi\\". He and June Mar Fajardo, both of whom share a warm relationship on and off the court, are avid DotA players. ==PBA career statistics== Correct as of September 11, 2016Player Profile at PBA-Online!

At the time, the Airy's owned a full-service advertising agency in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of the agency's clients was Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group. In 1986, Pepsi-Cola was interested in reaching an African-American audience for its Mountain Dew product. Research indicated that gospel music was a possible area for Mountain Dew sponsorship. With no gospel music programming available nationwide on any existing network, the Airy's decided to launch a channel and Gospel Music Network (GMN) was born. A guiding tenet was that GMN would never ask for donations on-air but would rely on advertising sponsorships and license fees from distributors. Initially funded directly by the Airy's, GMN's format was similar to that of MTV, mostly featuring music videos. The network did not limit itself to particular styles of music, playing everything from southern and black gospel to the full spectrum of Contemporary Christian music. According to CCM Magazine it was the first network of its type. Later networks with similar programming include Z Music Television and the Gospel Music Channel. After one year the channel had a viewership potential of two million people. In 1988, GMN was in negotiations for carriage with Tele- Communications, Inc. (TCI), a large cable MSO based in Englewood, CO. During those negotiations, TCI broached the issue of broadening GMN's line up to include programming from a wide variety of faith traditions – Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish. TCI was interested in having one faith-based channel that would eschew on-air fundraising and that would serve the entire faith community as opposed to a channel for each individual denomination. In 1989, the Airy's sold their advertising agency, moved their family to Denver, and Bill Airy began working for TCI as president of VISN Group, Inc., a new TCI subsidiary formed to merge GMN with the television programming efforts of the National Interfaith Cable Coalition (NICC), a coalition of various leaders from the mainline faith community loosely affiliated with the National Council of Churches. TCI agreed to underwrite the development of the new network (initially known as Vision Interfaith Satellite Network or VISN) which combined GMN with the programming available from NICC. Ultimately VISN became the Faith & Values Channel in the mid 1990s and was eventually acquired by the Hallmark Channel. By the time Z Music Television was founded in 1991 there was no dedicated outlet for Christian music videos. ==References== Category:Evangelical television networks Category:Music video networks in the United States Category:Television channels and stations established in 1986 ","title":"Gospel Music Network"},{"id":"20234251","text":"Board Up the House Remixes Volume 3 is the third of five in the Board Up the House Remix Series by Genghis Tron.

This was proved in 1929 by John von Neumann, assuming the axiom of choice. It is based on the earlier Banach–Tarski paradox, which is in turn based on the Hausdorff paradox. Banach and Tarski had proved that, using isometric transformations, the result of taking apart and reassembling a two-dimensional figure would necessarily have the same area as the original. This would make creating two unit squares out of one impossible. But von Neumann realized that the trick of such so-called paradoxical decompositions was the use of a group of transformations that include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area-preserving transformations (whether the special linear group or the special affine group) contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using them. ==Sketch of the method== The following is an informal description of the method found by von Neumann. Assume that we have a free group H of area- preserving linear transformations generated by two transformations, σ and τ, which are not far from the identity element. Being a free group means that all its elements can be expressed uniquely in the form \\\\sigma^{u_1}\\\\tau^{v_1}\\\\sigma^{u_2}\\\\tau^{v_2} \\\\cdots \\\\sigma^{u_n}\\\\tau^{v_n} for some n, where the us and vs are all non-zero integers, except possibly the first u and the last v. We can divide this group into two parts: those that start on the left with σ to some non-zero power (we call this set A) and those that start with τ to some power (that is, u_1 is zero—we call this set B, and it includes the identity). If we operate on any point in Euclidean 2-space by the various elements of H we get what is called the orbit of that point. All the points in the plane can thus be classed into orbits, of which there are an infinite number with the cardinality of the continuum. Using the axiom of choice, we can choose one point from each orbit and call the set of these points M. We exclude the origin, which is a fixed point in H. If we then operate on M by all the elements of H, we generate each point of the plane (except the origin) exactly once. If we operate on M by all the elements of A or of B, we get two disjoint sets whose union is all points but the origin. Now we take some figure such as the unit square or the unit disk. We then choose another figure totally inside it, such as a smaller square, centred at the origin. We can cover the big figure with several copies of the small figure, albeit with some points covered by two or more copies. We can then assign each point of the big figure to one of the copies of the small figure. Let us call the sets corresponding to each copy C_1, C_2, \\\\dots, C_m. We shall now make a one-to-one mapping of each point in the big figure to a point in its interior, using only area-preserving transformations. We take the points belonging to C_1 and translate them so that the centre of the C_1 square is at the origin. We then take those points in it which are in the set A defined above and operate on them by the area-preserving operation σ τ. This puts them into set B. We then take the points belonging to B and operate on them with σ2. They will now still be in B, but the set of these points will be disjoint from the previous set. We proceed in this manner, using σ3τ on the A points from C2 (after centring it) and σ4 on its B points, and so on. In this way, we have mapped all points from the big figure (except some fixed points) in a one-to-one manner to B type points not too far from the centre, and within the big figure. We can then make a second mapping to A type points. At this point we can apply the method of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem. This theorem tells us that if we have an injection from set D to set E (such as from the big figure to the A type points in it), and an injection from E to D (such as the identity mapping from the A type points in the figure to themselves), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between D and E. In other words, having a mapping from the big figure to a subset of the A points in it, we can make a mapping (a bijection) from the big figure to all the A points in it. (In some regions points are mapped to themselves, in others they are mapped using the mapping described in the previous paragraph.) Likewise we can make a mapping from the big figure to all the B points in it. So looking at this the other way round, we can separate the figure into its A and B points, and then map each of these back into the whole figure (that is, containing both kinds of points)! This sketch glosses over some things, such as how to handle fixed points. It turns out that more mappings and more sets are necessary to work around this. ==Consequences== The paradox for the square can be strengthened as follows: : Any two bounded subsets of the Euclidean plane with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the area- preserving affine maps. This has consequences concerning the problem of measure. As von Neumann notes, :\\"Infolgedessen gibt es bereits in der Ebene kein nichtnegatives additives Maß (wo das Einheitsquadrat das Maß 1 hat), dass [sic] gegenüber allen Abbildungen von A2 invariant wäre.\\"On p. 85 of: :\\"In accordance with this, already in the plane there is no nonnegative additive measure (for which the unit square has a measure of 1), which is invariant with respect to all transformations belonging to A2 [the group of area- preserving affine transformations].\\" To explain this a bit more, the question of whether a finitely additive measure exists, that is preserved under certain transformations, depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations even when they do preserve the area of polygons. As explained above, the points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which we may call A and B. If the A points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area- preserving transformation and the B points by another, both sets can become subsets of the B points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the B points), and therefore there is no measure that \\"works\\". The class of groups isolated by von Neumann in the course of study of Banach–Tarski phenomenon turned out to be very important for many areas of mathematics: these are amenable groups, or groups with an invariant mean, and include all finite and all solvable groups. Generally speaking, paradoxical decompositions arise when the group used for equivalences in the definition of equidecomposability is not amenable. == Recent progress == Von Neumann's paper left open the possibility of a paradoxical decomposition of the interior of the unit square with respect to the linear group SL(2,R) (Wagon, Question 7.4). In 2000, Miklós Laczkovich proved that such a decomposition exists. More precisely, let A be the family of all bounded subsets of the plane with non-empty interior and at a positive distance from the origin, and B the family of all planar sets with the property that a union of finitely many translates under some elements of SL(2,R) contains a punctured neighbourhood of the origin. Then all sets in the family A are SL(2,R)-equidecomposable, and likewise for the sets in B. It follows that both families consist of paradoxical sets. == References == Category:Group theory Category:Measure theory Category:Mathematical paradoxes Category:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics ","title":"Von Neumann paradox"},{"id":"20234275","text":"Board Up the House Remixes Volume 4 is the fourth of five in the Board Up the House Remix Series by Genghis Tron.

Its catchment lies within the Gold Coast local government area and covers an area of . The river is approximately in length and provides a popular and tranquil setting for many rowing clubs, kayakers, jet skiers, boat-goers and fishermen. ==Course and features== Currumbin Valley, 2015 Creek mouth, 2015 The Currumbin Creek rises in the Gold Coast hinterland below Mount Cougal in the Springbrook National Park, west of the New South Wales settlement of Tomewin and north of the New South Wales/Queensland border. The creek flows generally north by east through the Currumbin Valley towards where it is crossed by the Pacific Motorway and the Gold Coast Highway, before reaching its mouth at Currumbin Alley and emptying into the Coral Sea. The creek descends over its course. Near the creek mouth at Currumbin Alley a -long and -wide swimming canal points northward. The demolition of the Palm Beach Bowls Club cleared way for a grass park and path to the shore of the canal, which is ideal for swimming, unlike many of the bull shark waters and canals further inland. Currumbin Creek has an extensive canal system similar to its cousin Tallebudgera Creek and the larger, further north Nerang River. The shores of these canals boast some of the Gold Coast's most prestigious housing. The lower estuary is a dynamic environment, strongly influenced by the processes of tidal flushing and infilling by coastal sands. This process leads to the natural constriction of the creek mouth, and requires intermittent dredging to minimise flood impacts. The lower estuary provides a significant aquatic and shore based recreational resource for the city, attracting fishermen, swimmers, surfers and boating enthusiasts. The City of Gold Coast runs a volunteer Beaches to Bushland restoration program. The Currumbin Creek Care Group established in 2008 helps restore native vegetation in parkland running on the lower areas of Currumbin Creek. ==History== View over Currumbin creek ca.1934 The first bridge across the creek was opened in 1926. The road was then known as the Main Ocean Road, later to be upgraded as the Pacific Highway and now known as the Gold Coast Highway. Dredging has taken place at Currumbin Creek informally between 1974–1997 and then on a yearly basis to date. Over the years, over of sand has been dredged from Currumbin Creek and used to nourish southern . During 2007, a dredging operation took place at the mouth of the creek, making the bottom of Currumbin Alley very shallow, creating a calm lagoon for families and children to play in. Due to a build-up of sand in the creek mouth, not even permitting a jet ski from the creek to the ocean, the Gold Coast City Council announced an operation beginning late in 2008 to deepen the mouth and move sand to the nearby Palm Beach so that beach sand reduced by erosion is replaced.

It originally ran on the Fox network from January 21, 2009, to January 31, 2011. In the show, Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) and his colleagues in The Lightman Group accept assignments from third parties (commonly local and federal law enforcement), and assist in investigations, reaching the truth through applied psychology: interpreting microexpressions, through the Facial Action Coding System, and body language. In May 2009, the show was renewed for a second season consisting of 13 episodes; season two premiered on September 28, 2009. On November 24, 2009, Fox ordered an extra nine episodes for season two, bringing the season order to 22 episodes.. On May 12, 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported that Lie to Me received a 13-episode third season pick-up... The third season of Lie to Me was originally set to premiere on November 10, 2010. On September 28, 2010, the date was moved up to October 4, 2010, because of the cancellation of Lone Star. On May 11, 2011, Fox canceled Lie to Me after three seasons. The show is inspired by the work of Paul Ekman, a specialist on facial expressions and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. Ekman has been an advisor to police departments and anti-terrorism groups. He was a scientific consultant in the production of the series. The lead character of Lie to Me, Cal Lightman, is based on Ekman. ==Cast and characters== Main Tim Roth, who plays the role of lead character Cal Lightman * Tim Roth as Dr. Cal Lightman, a brilliant expert in the science of body language, especially microexpressions, and founder of The Lightman Group, a private company that operates as an independent contractor to assist investigations of local and federal law enforcement through applied psychology. Though often confronted by people's skepticism, Lightman uses any technique he deems necessary to reach the truth, however elaborate or confronting. He is divorced and shares custody of his teenage daughter. He cares deeply about his colleague Gillian Foster; and there is a chemistry between them that has yet to develop into anything more although, in the Season 3 finale, he confesses to his daughter that he loves her. His mother committed suicide while he was still young, an event that led him to discovering and researching microexpressions. There is evidence he was involved with British Intelligence in Northern Ireland.. Lightman also mentioned interrogating militant suspects recalling his release of one suspect resulted in the shootings of 6 and the deaths of 3 in a murder operation the suspect subsequently carried out. He has also admitted to being an MI6 intelligence agent during the Yugoslav Wars (1994) in an attempt to gain the trust of an intelligence agent that he was interrogating. Lightman is a West Ham United supporter as he mentions himself in Season 2. He can also be seen wearing a Claret and Blue scarf in one of the later episodes of Season 2.. * Kelli Williams as Dr. Gillian Foster, Dr. Lightman's psychologist colleague in The Lightman Group who analyses patterns of voice, language, and behavior. She can be somewhat impulsive but is very professional with the clients and subjects in public. While she occasionally disagrees with some of Lightman's actions, she has an open pact with Lightman: not to let their professional skill interfere with coworkers' personal lives. Her husband's lack of candor often challenges this: When Cal believes her husband, Alec, is cheating on her, he simply ignores what he is seeing, much to Torres's dismay. It is later revealed that he was not cheating on her but was trying to overcome his drug addiction; they promptly divorce. Gillian had adopted a baby (Sophie) who was eventually returned to the birth mother. This character is based on Maureen O’Sullivan, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco. * Brendan Hines as Eli Loker, an employee of The Lightman Group. Unlike Torres, whom Lightman calls \\"a natural\\", Loker acquired his skills in \\"reading\\" people through academic education and practice. During Season 1, he also adheres to Radical Honesty and thus rarely lies, even if that makes him appear rude or undiplomatic. Lightman demoted him to an unpaid intern after, despite Foster's warnings, he divulged sensitive information to the SEC while working on a case. However, he is later promoted to Vice President, which makes a rift in any developing relationship between him and Torres. * Monica Raymund as Ria Torres, an employee of The Lightman Group and Dr. Lightman's protégé, who was recognized as a \\"natural\\" while she was still working as a TSA Agent. Torres was abused as a child, a common pattern among naturals. Though talented and loyal, she lacks academic training and sometimes lets her emotions cloud her judgment. She has a half-sister who was in juvenile prison and is now enrolled at a private school. Hayley McFarland, who plays the role of Emily Lightman * Hayley McFarland as Emily Lightman, Cal Lightman's teenage daughter. Her parents share custody of her, and, while she does not appreciate her father's ability to \\"read\\" her, she does not deny its merit for social screening. She has boyfriends over the series that her father scrutinizes. Though she sometimes gets into trouble and has fake IDs, and, to Lightman's chagrin, has been sexually active, she is generally well behaved and has a loving relationship with her father. (Recurring – Season 1, regular – Seasons 2–3) * Mekhi Phifer as Ben Reynolds, an FBI Agent who is assigned to and assists the Lightman Group in their investigations, offering armed assistance, practical insights, and access to FBI resources and connections. Reynolds doesn't always agree with Lightman's ways but stands behind him most of the time. (Recurring – season 1, regular – season 2) Recurring * Jennifer Beals as Zoe Landau, Cal Lightman's ex-wife and Emily's mother, occupied as an Assistant Attorney General. While engaged to another man, she also engaged in a tryst with Lightman, after he helped her in a case. (Seasons 1 & 2) * Tim Guinee as Alec Foster, Gillian Foster's ex-husband. He works at the United States Department of State and is a recovering cocaine addict. Throughout the series it was heavily hinted that he was having an extramarital affair until it was revealed that the woman was his CA sponsor. He and Gillian divorced. (Season 1) *Sean Patrick Thomas as Special Agent Karl Dupree. Dupree initially assisted the Lightman group on a case involving a controversial South Korean ambassador who is presumed to be an assassination target at his son's state wedding. Torres and Dupree are romantically involved later in season one. He also defends Torres against Loker when he divulged sensitive information to the SEC while working on a case. (Season 1) * Melissa George as Clara Musso. She was Zoe Landau's first big client, so Lightman helped her find out who really killed her husband and prove her innocence. She later inherited her husband's company, and showed interest in Lightman's work on deception detection, in that she paid him to teach her some techniques, and then invested in his firm. (Season 2) * Monique Gabriela Curnen as Detective Sharon Wallowski, a police officer who assists Lightman. She also engages in a romantic relationship with Cal Lightman, but ends it once Lightman finds out the truth about her past as a dirty cop. (Season 3) * Brandon Jones as Liam, Emily Lightman's boyfriend, a high school jock who is not intimidated by Cal Lightman. Emily breaks up with him because he does not believe in sex before marriage. (Season 3) == Episodes  Plot == Season one opens with Cal and Gillian hiring a new associate: TSA officer Ria Torres, who scored extraordinarily high on Cal's deception-detection diagnostic, and is in turn labeled a \\"natural\\" at deception detection. Her innate talent in the field clashes with Cal's academic approach, and he often shows off by rapidly analyzing her every facial expression. She counters by reading Lightman and, when he least expects it, peppers conversations with quotes from his books. It was gradually revealed that Dr. Lightman was driven to study micro-expressions as a result of guilt over his mother's suicide. She claimed to have been fine in order to obtain a weekend pass from a psychiatric ward, when she was actually experiencing agony (which parallels an anecdote in Paul Ekman's book \\"Telling Lies\\"). For a small number of the early episodes, Lightman would team up with Torres to work on a case, while Foster and Loker would team up on a separate case. Occasionally, their work would intertwine, or Foster and/or Lightman would provide assistance on each other's cases. As the first season progressed, the cases became more involved, and all four of the main characters would work together on one case for each episode. In addition to detecting deception in subjects they interview, Lightman and his team also use various interviewing and interrogation tactics to elicit useful information. Rather than by force, they use careful lines of questioning, provocative statements, theatrics and healthy doses of deception on their own part. In the show's pilot episode, Lightman is speaking to a man who is refusing to speak at all, and is able to discern vital information by talking to him and gauging his reaction to each statement. This approach is also taken in several other episodes (e.g., \\"Do No Harm\\"). == Principal crew == Samuel Baum (showrunner/head writer), Brian Grazer, David Nevins, Steven Maeda. Katherine Pope, former president of NBC Universal's TV studio, signed on as a consulting producer. Pope worked on the final four episodes of the first season. Shawn Ryan, creator of The Shield and The Unit, took over as show runner for the second season. ==Reception== Critical reception The show received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It gained a score of 64 on Metacritic from 24 reviews. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker awarded Lie to Me a B- rating and wrote \\"Lie to Me is derivative yet well crafted, predictable yet ever-so-slightly novel… it's no wonder that Fox thinks it's got itself a potential hit\\". However, he also commented \\"if this review were a face, Dr. Lightman would say it had a forced smile: hopeful, but dubious, about Lie's chances.\\" Tom Shales, writing for The Washington Post, said \\"Lie to Me seems an unusually meaty, thoughtful and thought-provoking crime drama – another police procedural, yes, but one with a dramatic and mesmerizing difference… easily one of the season's best new shows.\\" Ratings In the United States, the viewing figures declined as the series progressed. The Pilot was seen by 12.37 million; however, by the final episode of the first season, it was down to 8.46 million. The most viewed episode was episode three, \\"A Perfect Score\\", which attracted 12.99 million. The second season premiered on September 28, 2009, to 7.73 million viewers. The season two finale had 4.94 million viewers in the U.S. on September 13, 2010. The third season, which had its premiere moved forward to October 4, 2010, was viewed by 5.87 million people in the U.S. The series' official cancellation was announced by Fox on May 10, 2011.

He was one of the few gamblers not under the control of the many street gangs active in the city, supposedly due to his reputation, and generally ran his operations free of interference from more powerful underworld figures.Lewis, Alfred Henry.

(pg. 245) In May 1910, he was confronted by Johnny Spanish who attempted to intimidate Siegel into making him a partner. When Siegel refused, Spanish said that he would return the following night to \\"bump youse off tomorrow night\\". Indeed the following night Spanish returned with his partner Hyman Benjamin and confronted Siegel as he was leaving his Forsyth Street headquarters, between Hester and Grand Street, and called on him to fight. Spanish then pulled out his revolver and shot at Siegel, who ran off retreating into his stuss house, which instead hit 8-year-old Rachel Rooten which was playing across the street.

Fail-safe principles are governed by national standards and engineering practices, and are widely used in conventional engineering design. It is possible to scale down macro-scale fail-safe principles and devices for similar applications at the nano-scale.Whitesides, George M. and J Christopher Love. “The Art of Building Small.” Scientific American Reports Sep. 2007: 13-21. The use of fail-safes in nanotechnology applications supports social acceptance of those applications by reducing the risks to users; , there are both theoretical and practical ways to implement fail-safe designs in nanotechnology. A predominant challenge to the social acceptance of nanotechnology is concerned with the medical use of nanostructures in the human body. While any structure for medical use would be developed to be bio- compatible and harmless, sound engineering design must take into account all possibilities of failure. Thus, the design would include ways to manipulate the structures in the body in the event of failure. ==Ferrous nanoparticles== Many researchers are looking into creating nano-scale robots (“nanobots”), for the purpose of undertaking tasks where only robots on the nano scale can be used, such as inside the human body. These robots would have the ability to construct other nanostructures or perform medical procedures, and will be introduced into the body via an injection.Šafařík, Ivo, and Mirka Šafaříková. “Magnetic Nanoparticles and Biosciences.” Chemical Monthly 133.6 (2002): 737-759. The robots’ shells and circuits would be made of ferrous nanoparticles so that a magnetic field could be used to prevent or manipulate their movement. In case of failure or malfunction, a small EMP or an MRI could be used to deactivate the nanobots. Both techniques induce an electromagnetic field, corrupting the memory and shorting out the circuitry of any electronic device within range. ==Amino acids== Researchers are pursuing the building of nanostructures using amino acids. Nanostructures that are created using amino acids are constructed using only synthetic types of amino acids, which tags these structures with unique molecules. These engineered amino acids essentially form synthetic proteins that differ from the naturally occurring proteins in the human body. This difference in the engineered amino acids makes these proteins easy to isolate and target.Schafmeister, Christian E. “Molecular Lego.” Scientific American Reports Sep 2007: 22-29. In case of failure or malfunction, it is possible to identify these proteins using the specifically targeted molecules, which act as a flag to indicate the location of the target. Then, another mechanism would be used to isolate them and deactivate them. ==DNA== DNA within our bodies naturally breaks down, replicates itself, and rebuilds itself every time a cell divides. These processes are all controlled and completed by various enzymes. DNA molecules are composed of corresponding base pair nucleotides in a double-helix formation, which makes these processes very efficient, accurate, and predictable. Due to the ease with which DNA molecules can be fashioned, many publications in the academic society are geared towards creating nanostructures using DNA.Seeman, Nadrian C. “Nanotechnology and the Double Helix.” Scientific American Reports. Sep. 2007: 30-39. With a DNA-based nano- device, synthetic proteins could be created, designed to deactivate a nano- device. These synthetic proteins would be injected into the body to break down the DNA and render a nano-device harmless in the event of a malfunction. Biological proteins within the human body serve three main functions: they are structural building blocks, enzymes, and facilitate cellular signaling. Synthetic proteins could be developed as a form of indicator and attached to a DNA-based nano-device.May, Mike. “Nanotechnology: Thinking Small.” Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 107, No. 9 (Sep., 1999), pp. A450-A451 Published by: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Stable URL: . This indicator would then be used for the purpose of monitoring nano-devices in the human body. If all DNA-based nano-devices were closely monitored in the human body, they could be controlled quickly in the event of a malfunction. ==Programming== In nanotechnology, particularly in nanobots, the need for a sound programming architecture is very important due to a potentially higher risk of damage in the event of a malfunction. A two-layer approach can be used to control nano-devices: (1) by providing a preprogrammed fail-safe functionality in case of anticipated failures; and (2) a remote- controlled override for use in unforeseen situations.Shapiro, Ehud, and Beneson, Yaakov. “Bringing DNA Computers to Life.” Scientific American Reports Sep 2007: 41-47. The “remote”-controlled nano-device would require a specialist in the room, to guide the nanobot throughout the procedure. ==Cellular engineering== Many researchers are developing methods that use bacteria to deliver drugs.Knapp, Louise. “Bad Bacteria Key to Drug Delivery.” Wired. 28 Feb. 2003. CondéNet, Inc. 10 Oct. 2008. . These bacteria can be “programmed” to perform a specific task, and can be directed to go to targeted locations in the body.Cao, Guozhong. Nanostructures & Nanomaterials: Synthesis, Properties & Applications. London, UK: Imperial College Press, 2004. However, the bacteria may damage healthy organs or fail to deliver the medicine to the sick organ in the case of a malfunction. In such cases, a fail-safe mechanism is required to neutralize the bacteria and prevent damage. An antibiotic is generally suitable as the fail-safe agent. ==References== Category:Nanotechnology ","title":"Fail-safes in nanotechnology"},{"id":"20234415","text":"The name Rose has been used for ten tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific Ocean. * Typhoon Rose (1948) (T4808) * Typhoon Rose (1952) (T5215) * Typhoon Rose (1957) (T5702) * Tropical Storm Rose (1960) (T6007, 21W) * Tropical Storm Rose (1963) (T6303, 10W, Bebeng) – approached the Philippines and struck Japan. * Typhoon Rose (1965) (T6522, 27W, Unding) – approached the Philippines and struck China. * Tropical Storm Rose (1968) (T6808, 12W, Gloring) – struck the Philippines and Vietnam. * Typhoon Rose (1971) (T7121, 21W, Uring) – struck the Philippines and China. * Tropical Storm Rose (1974) (T7417, 21W, Oyang) – approached Ryūkyū Islands. * Tropical Storm Rose (1978) (T7804, 04W) – struck Taiwan.

Weraroa is a genus of mushrooms in the family Strophariaceae. The genus was initially described by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1958 to accommodate the single species Secotium novae-zelandiae reported by Gordon Herriott Cunningham in 1924.Cunningham GH. (1924). \\"A critical revision of the Australian and New Zealand species of the genus Secotium\\". Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales 49(2): 97–119. It has been suggested that the genus may represent an intermediary evolutionary stage between a hypogeous (underground) ancestor and the related epigeous (above ground) genus Stropharia.Singer R. (1958). \\"New genera of fungi, IX. The probable ancestor of the Strophariaceae: Weraroa gen. nov\\". Lloydia 21(1): 45–47.Theirs HD. (1984). \\"The secotioid syndrome\\". Mycologia 76(1): 1–8. == Description ==  Macroscopic  Weraroa species are secotioid fungi, meaning that the margin of the pileus never breaks free of the stipe, making them resemble somewhat a pouch on the end of a stem, or stalked-puffball. The peridium (outer wall), which at maturity is glutinous, may range in shape from fusoid to spherical to ovoid or ellipsoid. The gleba consists of elongated loculi that are various shades of brown. The stipe may also be glutinous, and is continuous with a columella reaching and merging with the upper peridium, often with a thin veil-like structure that joins the edge of the peridium with the top of the stipe. The context is fleshy and may be gelatinous in the outer portion of the peridium.Singer R, Smith AH. (1958). \\"Studies on secotiaceous fungi. III. The genus Weraroa\\". Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 85(5): 324–334. Cunningham was first to report that the mushroom takes a long time to mature, and specimens can also persist for long times.  Microscopic  Spores are typically from 10–20 µm in diameter, ellipsoid in shape, smooth, and pigmented ochre to brownish.

This phylogenetic research also demonstrated the close relationship between the type species W. novae- zelandiae to the hallucinogenic blue-staining group of Psilocybe, particularly P. subaeruginosa. Because W. novae-zelandiae is the type species for Weraroa, this information would suggest that the blue-staining Psilocybes should be transferred into this genus. However, the generic name Psilocybe was conserved (Redhead et al. 2007) with the type species Psilocybe semilanceata. Weraroa novae-zelendiae is, therefore, classified as Psilocybe under the new name (nomen novum) Psilocybe weraroa Borovička, Oborník & Noordel.

The band recorded the album in a near-derelict 1920s mess hall on Sydney Harbour, which they had rented from the local council at a rate cheap enough to allow them to take their time to develop the songs. Songwriter Toby Martin said the songs were only basic sketches in his head when the group entered the makeshift studio, with the idea being that the whole band would workshop the songs together. \\"We were very conscious of not losing spontaneity on this album,\\" Martin told the Sunday Herald Sun. \\"Even though we did a lot of overdubs, we spent a long time on this record because we didn't want to demo the songs first. We wanted to write and arrange the songs in the studio, so recording the album would be capturing the moment of creation rather than capturing the moment of recreation. So we had roughly a week per song—I normally had the lyrics and a bit of a rough idea, or Cameron would have a riff, and by the end of the week we would be putting it down.\\" The melancholy of the recording venue was reflected in much of the material, which tackled issues such as addiction, grief, desperation and death. Martin commented: \\"It's a fairly contemplative record, which might have something to do with being by the water, but it also has a slightly creepy or paranoid edge. It's a bit out of the way and there are owls and rats, and old falling down walls, so I think it did influence the record. When I finished recording the record I didn't think it had influenced us much at all, but listening to it later and hearing some of my friends' comments, I was beginning to see how it had rubbed off on to us in a way we hadn't really planned.\\"James Wigney, \\"Older and wiser,\\" Sunday Herald Sun, 29 June 2008. ==Track listingSingles== * \\"Two Sides\\" (April 2008) * \\"All This Will Pass\\" (September 2008) * \\"In My Dreams\\" (December 2008) ==Personnel== * Toby Martin – vocals, guitar * Cameron Emerson-Elliott – guitar * Patrick Matthews – bass * Danny Lee Allen – drums Additional personnel * Tim Kevin – string and horn arrangements, piano, organ, backing vocals, guitar * Danny Heifetz – trumpet * Sam Golding – trumpet, valve trombone, tenor horn * Ian Pieterse – baritone sax * Amanda Brown – solo violin * String trio: Amanda Brown and Jeremy Kong – violin; Sophie Glasson – cello * Jason Walker – pedal steel guitar * Johnno Lattin – squeeze box * Don Lennon – vocals (\\"What Is a Life?\\") * Chris Walla – extra guitar, backing vocals, noises (\\"Two Sides\\") ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Ivy League Records albums Category:Youth Group albums ","title":"The Night Is Ours"},{"id":"20234433","text":"The Amaranth Wind Farm, also known as the Melancthon EcoPower Centre, is a 199.5 megawatt (MW) wind farm in Amaranth and Melancthon Township, near Shelburne, Ontario.

It physically resembles the sticklebacks, but has a thinner, longer body, with 24 to 27 small spines in front of the dorsal fin. It also possess a slender snout, hence the common name. Like the sticklebacks, it feeds on small invertebrates and fish larvae. Also, like sticklebacks, it produces a sticky secretion from its kidneys when breeding. Whereas sticklebacks use this secretion to bind plant matter together to create a nest, the tube-snout simply attaches its eggs to a substrate. Aulorhynchus attaches its eggs to kelp, notably Macrocystis pyrifera. Spawning occurs throughout the year, and males guard nest sites by actively defending them from predators. The nests are found at depths of 10–20 m and have been recorded up to 38 m.Limbaugh, C. 1962.

In the horizontal method developed by Maritz, the solid-cast cannon itself was revolved horizontally, while the drill remained static, in a method similar to that of a lathe. The son of Jean Maritz, Jean Maritz II (1712-1790), who had worked with his father on the development of boring, became Inspector General of Gun Foundries in 1755.

His live performances have been described as innovative, engaging, funny and surprising. Musically his work is eclectic, combining acoustic guitar and hip-hop rhythms, with layers of sound supported by sampling and programmed loops. A few of his notable songs are \\"Sleep\\", \\">\\" (Greater Than), \\"What I Found\\", and \\"The Only\\". ==Musical career== Riley Armstrong moved to Vancouver at the age of 18 to pursue a career in music. He earned a degree in sound recording and soon became the sound engineer for the Christian rock band Hokus Pick. Riley was the engineer on the 1997 Hokus Pick album Snappy. A year later he released his own independent effort Novel Reason under the pseudonym Plain Edson. Riley persuaded the members of Hokus Pick to let him be their opening act, as well as being their sound engineer. While in Nashville on a Hokus Pick tour he befriended the members of the Christian rock band Audio Adrenaline. Soon thereafter three members of Audio Adrenaline founded a new record company. Riley was invited to be the first performer to release on their Flicker Records label. He then moved from Vancouver to Nashville, where he spent the next five years. Riley Armstrong became the opening act for Audio Adrenaline. During this period he released a follow up album, Whatever the Weather. Armstrong then asked to be released from Flicker Records and returned to Canada. Marriage followed, with the couple settling in Calgary. Riley and his wife Shannon have one son, Zeffren, who was born in 2005. Also that year Riley released the album La Loop on the 7 Spin Music indie label. His band members were Rick Enns on bass, Dan Kim on guitar and Jared Falk on drums.

In her fiction and non-fiction, Carroll wrote about what she knew and people that she loved, especially those in the Southern Maine rural community of Dunnybrook, located in South Berwick, Maine. Carroll believed that the history of common folk mattered most and her works presented their stories. Carroll's debut novel As the Earth Turns featured one year on a local family farm. In 1933 it was a blockbuster—released by Macmillan on May 2 with advanced sales of 20,000 and as the Book-of-the-Month Club selection for May.\\"Book Notes\\". The New York Times. May 2, 1933. Page 15. In 1996 it was \\"read and discussed by informal study groups and in classrooms throughout the state\\" as part of a Maine Humanities Council project on \\"the impact of modernism on Maine\\". == Life == Carroll was born June 26, 1904 in Rochester, New Hampshire. She grew up on her family's South Berwick farm, where she lived with her parents, Warren Verd Hasty and Emma Frances Dow, brother Harold, grandfather George Bradford Hasty, and a paternal aunt named Vinnie. As a child young Gladys Hasty attended a one-room school house. To keep her occupied after she finished assignments, teachers told her to write on any topic she wished. She graduated from Berwick Academy and then matriculated to Bates College, the first person in her family to pursue higher education. Bates friends nicknamed her \\"Sunny\\" because of her optimistic personality. On the day following her graduation in 1925, she married Herbert Allen Carroll in the Bates College chapel. The marriage lasted 58 years, until his death in April 1983. Herbert Carroll's career and pursuits of various degrees took the couple all over America including Massachusetts, Chicago, Minneapolis and Manhattan. They had two children, a son Warren Carroll born in 1932 and a daughter, Sarah, in 1942. (Warren graduated from Bates College in 1953 and died in July 2011; Sarah graduated from Bates College in 1962 and died in August 2011.Bates Magazine Retrieved 2018-06-24.) This period marked Carroll's emergence into international prominence as an author. She worked tirelessly, writing short stories, regular advice columns and her novels Cockatoo (1929) and Landspell (1930). In 1933 she wrote her Pulitzer Prize-nominated work of fiction, As the Earth Turns. It was a blockbuster success and the second best selling novel of 1933 according to Publishers Weekly, second only to Hervey Allen's Anthony Adverse and outselling such well-remembered books as Lloyd C. Douglas's Magnificent Obsession and Sinclair Lewis's Ann Vickers. A Warner Bros. film version of the novel starring Jean Muir and Donald Woods was a flop, however, and none of Carroll's other novels were ever filmed. The only other film adaption of any of her work was her story \\"Kristi,\\" which was made into an episode of Jane Wyman's 1950s anthology television series Fireside Theatre. The money from As the Earth Turns, along with her husband's job at the University of New Hampshire, allowed her to return to her hometown and build a home on the land of her family in South Berwick. She continued to publish novels and also worked to write the folkplay adaptation of As the Earth Turns. She helped produce the play each summer, using her neighbors in the Dunnybrook community and performing it in an open field. Towards the end of this interval, she wrote what some consider to be her greatest work, Dunnybrook, published in 1943. The folkplay was last performed in 1942, due to World War II. After the war Carroll continued to write, publishing a book every two years in the 1940s and 1950s and seven books in the 1960s. She was elected to the board of trustees of Bates College and traveled extensively for its alumni association. She eventually moved into the Hasty farmhouse and lived a simple life there. In the 1970s she published the novels Next of Kin and Unless You Die Young and the autobiographical Years Away from Home. In 1985, Carroll inspired the creation of the Dunnybrook Historical Foundation Inc, and was an original trustee. During summers she allowed visitors to come to her Maine home to visit, go on guided tours of Dunnybrook, and get books signed. Family and community members also displayed art, made music and performed historical skits. In the mid-1990s the Old Berwick Historical Society helped produce a professional audio recording of her book Dunnybrook. As Carroll was in her nineties at this point, it took supreme efforts on her part and could be considered the culminating event of a long career. Gladys Hasty Carroll died peacefully at age 94 on April 1, 1999, in a hospital in York, Maine. == Dunnybrook Historical Foundation == The Dunnybrook Historical Foundation was dedicated to preserving and sharing an extensive collection (some 8000 items) of material related to the history of Dunnybrook as well as the life and works of Gladys Hasty Carroll. The collection included many photographs, diaries, letters, and official records of those families who lived in Dunnybrook. The Foundation, which consisted entirely of direct descendants of Carroll down to her great-grandchildren, worked to preserve the stories of the people whom Carroll thought most important, and it once had a website which offered Carroll books for sale, but it let its 501(c)3 non-profit status lapse in 2012. However, in October 2016, the Chase-Jellison Homestead—a small group of people located in Dunnybrook and consisting primarily of Dunnybrook descendants—agreed to accept the Carroll collection, has reinstated the Foundation's 501(c)3 status with the state of Maine, and is working toward federal reinstatement. Once this happens, the Foundation should again be able to accept donations and, once funded, plans to re-establish a presence on the web along with an education program.Private communication received 2018-06-21 from Richard Stevens, Director of Collections; Chase-Jellison Homestead == Books == * Cockatoo (Macmillan, 1929), unpaged picture book illustrated by Robert Crowther, * Land Spell (Macmillan, 1930), illus.

Released on January 13, 2009, it is the band's fourth album on Suburban Noize. == Music and lyrics == New World Orphans was influenced by Suicidal Tendencies and Minor Threat. The album's sound fuses heavy metal, hip hop and punk rock; it also includes elements of hardcore punk, funk and reggae. The album's lyrics derive from the 9/11 Truth movement, criticism of George W. Bush, the existence of extraterrestrial life, the economy and the Iraq War. == Background == Hed PE had been working on the album since before the release of The D.I.Y. Guys with front man Jared Gomes notifying it through various MySpace posts. Three studio recorded tracks rumored to be on New World Orphans, \\"War on the Middle Class\\", \\"Ordo (ab Chao)\\", and \\"Bloodfire\\", were released via the live CD/DVD combo set, The D.I.Y. Guys on July 8, 2008. The tracks were rough versions of what would later appear on the album. On November 4, 2008 the band released the music video for \\"Ordo (ab Chao)\\" via the band's MySpace. The video showed a different mix than that of the version released on The D.I.Y. Guys, including new instrumentation such as a melodica during the verses. On November 25, 2008, New World Orphans second single, \\"Renegade\\", premiered online on the band's official Facebook account. A video for the song was produced, and premiered on December 20. It was directed by Philip Carrer and Chad Archibald and produced by Lee Hartney of the Smith Street Band for Guelph's premiere film production studio Black Fawn Film alongside film collective Bleeding Apple. Drummer Chris Hendrich appears in the \\"Renegade\\" music video with the band. On November 19, 2008 the official track listing and album artwork were revealed. The album was released in three different color variations of the cover: black, red and white. Each version features exclusive tracks corresponding to their version color. The artwork and final track listing were officially posted via the album's official promotional website. New World Orphans also features guest collaborations including Suburban Noize Records' Kottonmouth Kings and The Dirtball, and Strange Music's Tech N9ne. As with all post Jive Records albums, New World Orphans was produced by Jared Gomes. == Reception == New World Orphans debuted at 72 on the Billboard 200, their first inside 100 since Blackout.

It was localized in North America as Cat Girl Alliance by G-Collections on February 20, 2010. ==Gameplay== Cat Girl Alliance, in traditional fashion, is played by watching and listening to episodic sequences of the game and then selecting or ignoring actions when they are presented to the player. Choices are effectively plot twists, and are intricately linked so that the direction of the developing story changes moderately as each is made; ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of eight endings. In order for the player to watch all these possible endings, in this regard, he or she will have to replay through the game several times, making different selections than done before. ==Plot== Eiji Tachibana is a young Japanese transfer student beginning his first semester at an unmentioned, fictional junior college. Distant and unacquainted from the rest of the school, Eiji is, for the most part, a friendless and withdrawn boy. In fact the only person who seems to even acknowledge his presence is Shizuko Azumi, the girl who sits behind him. One morning after class, Shizuko invites Eiji to lunch; Rumi Takahata, the bubbly class representative, excitedly joins as well. As the three sit and eat, Eiji discusses his social predicament, to which both girls suggest he join an extracurricular club. Eiji accepts their advice, and dissatisfied with the athletics and cultural departments, finds comfort in the health committee; by assumption, he visits the infirmary to meet with the group. When he arrives however, he is shocked to find Rumi and another girl, Natsuki Misawa, having sex. Even more surprising is that Rumi is not entirely female; she is in fact, a hermaphrodite. Glued to the scene before him, Eiji furtively watches and leaves. The following day, things seem to have gone unnoticed. After class, as he reluctantly decides whether or not to visit the infirmary again, a fellow student name Masayoshi informs Eiji that his sister would like to see him there. Besides learning that the boy is her brother, Rumi is quite aware of yesterdays events and offers Eiji the chance to snag Shizuko in the same manner. Though plagued with a mixed conscience, he agrees. ==Characters== :Modest and nondescript, Eiji Tachibana is the unlikely protagonist of the game. A recent transfer student to his school, his lonesome life becomes convoluted when his curiosity leads him to become a part of a sexual, underground student group disguised as a harmless club. Despite his careless behavior, Eiji is an honest, friendly and especially introspective person, able to sense the mood of other people; though he himself is as easily readable. Eiji prefers the indoors and enjoys watching television. : :Rumi Takahata is a nineteen-year-old undergraduate who is on the student council as a class representative and serves as the most iconic character in the game. Besides her elected, academic status to her classmates, she is also the president of the health committee; an obscure clique that participates in explicit sexual practices. While Rumi is a naturally effervescent and outspoken co-ed, she can at times be particularly authoritative, sadistic and intolerant, especially during group activities. Rumi is a biological hermaphrodite and is, by extension, bisexual. She is most recognized for her titular cat apparel. : :Reticent and peculiar, Natsuki Misawa is a fellow nineteen-year-old undergraduate and member of the health committee. In spite of her noticeably indifferent outward image, Natsuki is meek, dependent, and masochistic. Having been orphaned as a child and brought in by the Takahata's, she is the rough equivalent of an adoptive sister to Rumi, who she expresses unconditional altruistic compliance toward. She is initially discontent with Eiji and his blossoming friendship with Rumi, viewing it as a rivalry; over the period of her acquaintance with him however, she grows fond of and closer to him herself. Given her openness to partners, Natsuki is also bisexual. : :Shizuko Azumi is a nineteen-year-old undergraduate who is the third and last female protagonist. She is seated directly behind Eiji and is the only one of all his classmates who genuinely welcomes him as a friend. A soft-spoken, gentle, focused and diligent girl, Shizuko is snared into the same dilemma that claims Eiji, and, despite her seemingly dignified person, humbly agrees to join the group. Of the entire female cast, Shizuko has the largest bust. : :Confident and well-mannered, Masayoshi Takahata is an eighteen-year-old undergraduate and the second, final, though minor, male cast member. A somewhat uninvolved character, Masayoshi is a delicate and hesitant individual noted for his unusually feminine appearance. As his last name suggests, he is the younger, affectionate brother of Rumi, who, having been questionably caught with her underwear in the past, doubles as her obedient footman. ==Development== G-Collections reportedly began work on Cat Girl Alliance, retitled from Koneko Doumei, as early as January 2008. The following year, license and distributor JAST USA announced via its website that it would be promoting the project at Anime Expo 2009. On July 10, JAST reported that it had begun work on Cat Girl Alliance, its next confirmed title, and had made plans to release it sometime that September. The project failed to meet its September release date but over a monthly course was continually covered. On September 16, JAST published a sneak peek of the game, adding that it was at work with Sekilala to put the finishing touches on the project, such as integrating the newly translated script; the game demonstrated full compatibility with Microsoft Windows Vista and 7. Cat Girl Alliance entered post-production and subsequent beta testing the following November, rescheduled for release in winter. That December, reporting that post- production was nearing an end and that Cat Girl Alliance would be going gold soon, JAST published an outline of the game's cumulative development, noting work on the graphics, scenes, and text. On December 31, New Year's Eve, the company reported that G-Collections had finished work on the game and that it was currently undergoing replication; Cat Girl Alliance was affirmed gold. Additionally, the official website for the game had also gone live. The following February, JAST announced that Cat Girl Alliance had finished replication and was stocked for shipping. Shortly after, on February 17, the company published that the download edition of the game had become available. Several websites reported on the game around this time. ==Reception== Considered by JAST USA and J-LIST.com, respectively, to be G-Collections most \\"ecchi\\" and \\"kinkiest\\" title to-date, Cat Girl Alliance was met with mixed reception. Industry aggregator Mania.com gave the game a B+, calling it a \\"solid release\\" that, while containing a friendly interface and decent soundtrack, suffered from mediocre visuals and translation. Shogungamer.com published a favorable review as well, praising the soundtrack and visuals. Following up to a pre-release review of the game, Japanator.com intern Jon Synder wrote \\"this game was little more than a string of pornographic images and accompanying text, barely held together by poor voice acting and something that could be called a 'plot'[...]\\" ==References * Official website * Cat Girl Alliance at Jast USA * Category:Eroge Category:Visual novels Category:Bishōjo games Category:2004 video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Cat Girl Alliance"},{"id":"20234600","text":"Givi Pyotrovich Chikvanaia (, , May 29, 1939 - August 2, 2018) was a Georgian water polo player who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1960 Summer Olympics and in the 1968 Summer Olympics.

It is on the Hutt Valley Line section of the Wairarapa Line and has two side platforms. The station is served by Metlink's electric multiple unit trains of the \\"Matangi\\" FP class. The double-tracking of the Wairarapa Line ends just north of Trentham station, with the line becoming single track as it continues north. However, in normal operation, southbound trains use the Ararino Street (western) platform and switch over to the down line south of the station. The Racecourse Road (eastern) platform is only used during race days and for other special occasions that occur at the adjacent Trentham Racecourse. As part of the 2020-2021 Wellington Metro Rail Upgrade and double tracking to Upper Hutt the low platforms will be raised and the east \\"racecourse side\\" platform will be replaced with one further west to increase clearance between the two main lines. It will be accessed by a new subway, and have a new station building similar to the Redwood station building. In 2010 the 20102035 Regional Rail Plan (RRP) had proposed duplicating the track between Trentham and Upper Hutt in the 20112012 year. Metlink tickets can be purchased from the Racecourse Dairy, opposite the railway station. ==History== The station was opened on 8 January 1907.* It was initially a single track station with a loop containing the racecourse platform, which served the recently opened Trentham Racecourse. Double track reached Trentham in June 1955, with electrification following in September. Trentham was originally controlled from its own signal box on the main platform. Following double-tracking of the line to Trentham, the southern crossover points (number 18, now 1) and the associated signals protecting the crossover and the single line north could be controlled from the signal box at Upper Hutt, requiring the Trentham signal box only to be used on race days to operate the other crossovers and signals. On 6 February 2007, the Trentham and Upper Hutt signal boxes were decommissioned and control of both stations was moved to Train Control in central Wellington, and all crossovers and signals were renumbered. There was a set of sidings in the Trentham Army Camp from 1941 to 1954, used for freight and for troop trains, with a shunting locomotive owned by the Army. Most of the track were removed in the 1970s. The siding was 0.53 km from Trentham Railway Station and 0.63 km from Heretaunga Railway Station. ==Accidents== On Saturday 22 March 1997, an evening northbound unit approaching Trentham passed the up home (29) signal at danger, which caused the alarms on the Sutherland Avenue level crossing immediately after the signal to only activate at the last second. The train hit a car on the level crossing, severely damaging the car but only causing minor injuries. While it is normal for a level crossing immediately after a signal to not activate if the signal is at danger to prevent needlessly delaying road traffic, the Sutherland Avenue crossing was the only level crossing in New Zealand that was approach-controlled, meaning the up home signal would be held at danger until the barrier arms were down. For an off-peak service when there was usually no conflicting traffic on the single line from Trentham to Upper Hutt, it was normal for the up home signal to change to clear once the barrier arms were down. However, the signalman at Upper Hutt had been distracted sorting out a drunken altercation at that station and had forgotten to clear the signal once the last southbound train had cleared Trentham, and the train driver was in the mindset the signal should clear as he approached the level crossing, not realising his mistake until he passed the signal. The approach controlled function was subsequently removed after the accident. ==Services== Trentham Railway Station serves the following Metlink bus services: {  - ! Previous timetabled stop ! Metlink Bus Services ! Next timetabled stop -  align=\\"center\\" Terminus  align=\\"center\\" 114 Poets Block  align=\\"center\\" Upper Hutt College towards Upper Hutt Station -  align=\\"center\\" Silverstream Station towards Pinehaven  align=\\"center\\" 115 Pinehaven  align=\\"center\\" Upper Hutt Station Terminus } In 2016 the provision of 40 additional parking places was announced at a cost of $200,000; an increase from 94 to 134 places. Work on upgrading the station in 2020 for the double-tracking of the line to Upper Hutt started with a ceremony in December 2019. The upgrading includes a second platform accessed by an underpass. == References  * Passenger service timetables from Metlink and Tranz Metro.

The language requires valid input XML documents to work. Facelets supports all of the JSF UI components and focuses completely on building the JSF component tree, reflecting the view for a JSF application. Although both JSP and JSF technologies have been improved to work better together, Facelets eliminates the issues noted in Hans Bergsten's article \\"Improving JSF by Dumping JSP\\" Facelets draws on some of the ideas from Apache Tapestry, and is similar enough to draw comparison. The project is conceptually similar to Tapestry's, which treats blocks of HTML elements as framework components backed by Java classes. Facelets also has some similarities to the Apache Tiles framework with respect to support templating as well as composition. Facelets was originally created by Jacob Hookom in 2005 as a separate, alternative view declaration language for JSF 1.1 and JSF 1.2 which both used JSP as the default view declaration language. Starting from JSF 2.0, Facelets has been promoted by the JSF expert group to be the default view declaration language. JSP has been deprecated as a legacy fall back.JavaServer Faces 2.0, The Complete Reference by Ed Burns and Chris Schal, page 55: 'The expert group decided to move forward with Facelets as the basis for new features while letting JSP remain as a backward compatibility layer'.JSF 2.0 (JSR 314, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314) specification, maintenance release 2, section 10.1: 'Facelets is a replacement for JSP that was designed from the outset with JSF in mind. New features introduced in version 2 and later are only exposed to page authors using Facelets. JSP is retained for backwards compatibility.' ==Element conversion== In Facelets, templates tags from a tag library can be entered in two forms: directly as a qualified \`xml\` element or indirectly via the \`jsfc\` attribute on an arbitrary non-qualified element. In the latter case the Facelet compiler will ignore the actual element and will process the element as-if it was the one given by the \`jsfc\` attribute. The following example shows the direct usage of qualified tags: Using the \`jsfc\` attribute, the same code can also be expressed as the example given below: The above code can be viewed in a browser, and edited with conventional WYSIWYG design tools. This is not possible when directly using the qualified tags. Nevertheless, directly using qualified tags is the most popular way of using Facelets in practice and is the style most used in books and examples.JavaServer Faces 2.0, The Complete Reference by Ed Burns and Chris SchalkCore JavaServer Faces (3rd Edition) by David Geary and Cay S. Horstmann == Templating == Facelets provides a facility for templating. A Facelets file can reference a master template and provide content for the placeholders this master template defines. The file that references such a template is called the template client. Template clients themselves can again be used as a template for other template clients and as such a hierarchy of templates can be created. The following shows an example of a simple master template: templates/master_template.xhtml Standard header text for every page. Standard footer text for every page. The above code contains a default HTML 'frame' and a single placeholder called body_content. A template client can use this template as follows: template_client.xhtml This is a template client page that uses the master template. The above code makes use of the template \`/templates/master_template.xhtml\` and provides content for the placeholder in that template. The final result will be a page called \`template_client.xhtml\` that has the content of \`/templates/master_template.xhtml\`, but with \`\` replaced by 'This is a template client page that uses the master template.'. == Content re-use == In addition to templating, Facelets provides support for re-use by letting the user include content that resides in a different file. Including such content can be done in three different ways: * Referencing a file * Custom tags * Composite components  Referencing a file  The simplest way to include the content of another Facelet is referencing it by name using the \`\` tag. This causes the content in the referenced file to be directly included in the calling Facelet by the Facelets compiler. Besides re- using content at multiple locations, this can be used to break down a large Facelet into smaller parts. The following shows an example: templates/master_template.xhtml Standard header text for every page. Standard footer text for every page. html_head.xhtml  Custom tags  Facelets supports indirection for including content via custom tags. Such a custom tag can be associated with a Facelet in a taglib file. Occurrences of that tag will then be replaced with the content of the associated Facelet. The following shows an example of this: templates/master_template.xhtml Standard header text for every page. Standard footer text for every page. The code above uses the tag \`\` to mark the point in the Facelet where content is to be inserted. Such a tag has to be declared in a Taglib file where it can be associated with a Facelet as follows: example.taglib.xml http://example.com/my spacer spacer.xhtml The following shows an example of what the actual content Facelet could look like: spacer.xhtml  Composite components  Besides including content directly, Facelets provides the composite component mechanism that makes content available as a first-class JSF component. Composite components do not need to be declared in a Taglib file, but instead have to be put in a special directory. By convention the content is then automatically assigned a namespace and a tag name. The namespace is constructed of the fixed string 'http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/' concatenated with the directory name in which the content file resides relative to the 'resources' directory.JSR 314, 10.3.3.1, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314 The tag name becomes the file name without the .xhtml suffix. The following shows an example of this: resources/my/spacer.xhtml The above Facelet is automatically available as a component in namespace 'http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/my' and tag name 'spacer' == Parameterized includes == To customize included content, Facelets allows parameters to be used. Via those parameters, objects can be passed into the included content, where they can be used as variables. For the \`\` mechanism the \`\` can be used for this, while for the custom tags and composite components, normal tag attributes can be used. Composite components require parameters to be declared in their interface section, while for custom tags there is no such requirement and values provided for arbitrary attributes are made available as variables with the same name as said attribute. == See also == * JavaServer Faces ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== * Facelets Developer Documentation * Facelets compared to Tiles * Facelets Home Page Category:Java (programming language) ","title":"Facelets"},{"id":"20234650","text":"The name Isa has been used for one tropical cyclone in the northwest Pacific Ocean. * Typhoon Isa (1997) (T9701, 02W) – damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $1 million (1997 USD, $1.3 million 2006 USD).

At the 2012 Census, there were 1033 registered Rover Scouts in Victoria, in roughly 100 Rover Crews. Rover Scouts is the fifth and final section of Scouting in Australia, and began in 1918. Rovers are aged between 18 and 26 years of age and are organised into local Crews, which are associated with a Scout Group. Rover Scout Crews accept anyone interested in taking up Rovering, whether or not they have been in Scouts before. The section is based on Baden-Powell's book Rovering to Success and the theme of knighthood. Rover Scouts are actively encouraged to become better citizens through taking part in Scouts Australia's nationally accredited training programs, developing leadership skills, participating in outdoor activities, attending, both as participants and staff, at national and international events, providing service to the community and generally building their life skills. Rover Scouts are distinguished from other sections of Scouting and leaders by a red panel on the blue uniform shirt across the arms and shoulders, with green \\"epaulette\\" badges on each shoulder, and the 'shoulder knot' of five ribbons (tan for Joeys, yellow for Cubs, green for Scouts, maroon for Venturers and red for Rover Scouts) on the left shoulder, symbolising the role of the Rover Section in helping and protecting their younger brothers and sisters. The Victorian Rover Scouts kick-started recreational skiing's popularity in Australia, at a time where they would often have to hike up the mountains after making their own skis; this was heavily influenced by W. F. Waters, the first Branch Commissioner for Rover Scouts in Victoria. ==Branch Organisation== There are eight Region Rover Scout Communities in Victoria and these Communities are responsible for the management and distribution of important information to Rover Scout Crews in their respective regions. They report to the statewide Branch Rover Council and Elect the Office Bearers of the Branch Rover Scout Council each May for the next financial year. the Communities are also elect/appoint the subcommittees for Victorian Rover Scouts assets and annual events. Rover Scout Motorsport Rover Scout Motorsport (RSM) is a subcommittee of the Branch Rover Council and oversees all Rover Motorsport events in Victoria, ensuring that they follow the strict speed, safety, alcohol and racing policies of the Confederation of Australian Motorsport. Rover Motorsport was briefly stopped for three years in the early 2000s when insurance was lost. It is the continued affiliation with CAMS that allows Rovers to continue racing. They were congratulated by the then Minister for Sport and Recreation, James Merlino, for their road safety programme targeted to scouts at the Australian Scout Jamboree Scouts Honour for Rover Motorsports Club Members, From the Office of the Minister for Sport and Recreation, Media Release, 14 March 2007 in 2007. ==Rover Assets== Mafeking Rover Park Mafeking Rover Park is a campground which is fully owned and operated by the Victorian Branch Rover Council and was originally anticipated as a home for Victorian Rover Scout Motorsport. Located 32 km from Yea, it is a 130 Hectares mix of open land and scrub.Mafeking Rover Park Although it is called a Rover Park, its use is open to all sections of the Scouting Movement, and any others who wish to hire it. Mafeking was named after the South African town of Mafeking, which was besieged for 219 days during the Second Boer War. The Garrison was commanded by Scouting Founder Lt General Lord Sir Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell, who with 2,000 British soldiers held off 8,000 Boer Soldiers until relieved, catapulting Baden-Powell to the status of a national hero. Mafeking's facilities include a 4-cargo-container-tall abseiling tower, commando, orienteering and 9-hole golf courses. Lake Surfmoot provides an area for canoeing, and there are numerous walking tracks. Accommodation is offered in the Troop Hall, Bunkhouses and on standard campsites. Mafeking also has numerous motorsport related facilities with well maintained tracks that are set up in compliance with the requirements of the Confederation of Australian Motorsport. Mafeking is home to a large variety of Australian fauna and flora, such as kangaroos, koalas, swap wallabies, possums, bats, as well as a multitude of lizards, frogs, birds and fish. Local indigenous plants are used at mafeking, both from propagated species collected from the local area, and through revegetation efforts. Alpine Rovering Alpine Rovering in Victoria takes place mainly in the W.F. Waters Lodge at Mt Baw Baw and the Bogong Rover Chalet, home to the Alpine Rover Crew and now also the Alpine Venturer Unit.www.bogongroverchalet.org The Alpine Rover Crew was formed in 1940 by W.F. \\"Bill\\" Waters, Branch Commissioner - Rovers during 1930 - 1965, to promote the Bogong Rover Chalet. All invested Rover or Leaders, who have completed a Bogong Winter Party, become a member during their first winter party. The Alpine Venturer Unit was formed in 2000, mostly by the hard work of Matt & Ian Franzke. It is used as many Venturers visit the chalet but cannot be invested into a Rover Crew. Before 1940 and the birth of the Alpine Rover Crew, the Bogong Rover Crew carried out the same purpose. However, since then, membership has become an award for services to Alpine Rovering. Members have displayed the of Rovering and are dedicated in their service to others. Roughly 200 members have since been invested, in a ceremony on skis that traditionally takes place at \\"Investiture Point\\" the closest place to the Chalet you can see Mount Bogong, where the ashes of W.F. Waters were scattered. Bogong Rover Chalet was one of the first ski lodges on the Bogong High Plains which is why it is so far from the village of Falls Creek. Similarly, the WF Waters Lodge is the closest to the carpark at Mount Baw Baw Village. ==Major Events== Mudbash Mudbash is an annual motorsport event run by the Rovers. The four-day event is held over the Queens Birthday weekend in June each year, and is now held at Mafeking Rover Park in Caveat, in country Victoria.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/photo- gallery/gallery-e6frf94x-1226073920814?page=1 Each year it is attended by more than 1500 people.http://www.mudbash.com Competitors at Mudbash build vehicles, known as buggies, to conform to CAMS regulations. These vehicles range from modified road cars to custom built dune buggies. Endeavor Rover Crew organised the first Mudbash in 1972, which was held at the Big River campsite in Marysville,\\"Here's Mud in your Eye\\" The Sun, Monday June 12, 1989 and was attended by 5 vehicles. In the years since, the event has boomed and has been attended by more than 70 vehicles in some years. Notable events at Mudbash include the Obstacle Course, Hill climb (now known as Quafftumbla challenge) and Motorkhana, which takes place in the main arena at night.Challenge Magazine, November 1972 edition, Page 8 Surfmoot Surfmoot is an annual camp run over the Australia Day weekend in January, and is held at Eumerella Scout Camp in Anglesea. One of Victorian Rovers longest running events, Surfmoot started in 1931 when a group of Geelong Rovers invited a number of Melbourne crews to Angleasea for a surfing camp.http://www.vicrovers.com/surfmoot/index.php/about/history Eumerella Scout Camp has played host to the event every year since 1953, except for three years when the Ash Wednesday Bushfires caused the event to be moved to Bay Park and then Phillip Island. Prior to being held at Eumerella, it was held at the Geelong District Campsite and also on the Anglesea Foreshore. Activities at Surfmoot include a waterslide, Super Tub racing as well as many others. Night entertainment often includes bands, djs and themed parties. There are also off site activities run in the surrounding areas. MARB The Metropolitan Area Rover Ball, or MARB, is an annual fancy dress Rover ball run by a committee of Rovers.http://www.marb2012.com/index.php?page=page1.php It is normally held on a Saturday night in September. The organising committee is composed of members from one of the Metropolitan regions, and rotates each year. ==Surrey Thomas Rover Crew== The Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew now Surrey Thomas Rover Crew (STR) is best known for its role in the development of the sport of rogaining.International Rogaining Federation Newsletter The Rover Scout crew was formed in 1971 in Brighton, Australia. Soon after forming, the crew undertook to run an annual twenty-four-hour cross-country navigation event. At the first Surrey-Thomas twenty-four-hour rogaine in 1972, forty starters, mostly from scouting, set off from Gembrook and circled the base camp at Basan's Corner via a series of loops along forest roads. True cross- country navigation was minimal, but the publicity from the event and the emphasis placed on quality base camp service and a friendly atmosphere was sufficiently popular that there was a demand for similar events over the next two years. These were followed by an important shift to an all cross-country score event set at Yea in 1975, the first such event in the world catering for the general public. The word rogaining is derived from the names of three of the founders, Rod Phillips, Gail Davis (née Phillips) and Neil Phillips (RoGaiNe, hence 'rogaining', 'rogainer' etc.) who were all members of the Rover Crew. The name was formally adopted by the Victorian Rogaining Association at its inaugural annual general meeting in August 1976 and accepted by Scouts Australia and University bushwalking groups to give the new sport an identity in its own right. The crew is still functioning today.Surrey Thomas Rover Crew Website == References See also== *Scouting and Guiding in Victoria Category:Scouting and Guiding in Australia ","title":"Rovering in Victoria"},{"id":"20234656","text":"Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, CIE, (26 February 1887 – 30 November 1953) was an Indian civil servant, jurist, diplomat and statesman known for his key role in drafting the Constitution of India. He was also India's representative to the United Nations Security Council from 1950 to 1952. His brothers were Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Benegal Rama Rau and journalist and politician B. Shiva Rao. One of the foremost Indian jurists of his time, Rau helped draft the constitutions of Burma in 1947 and India in 1950. As India's representative on the United Nations Security Council (1950–52), he was serving as president of the council when it recommended armed assistance to South Korea (June 1950). Later he was a member of the Korean War post Armistice United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC). A graduate of the Universities of Madras and Cambridge, Rau entered the Indian civil service in 1910. After revising the entire Indian statutory code (1935–37), he was knighted (1938) and made judge (1939) of the Bengal High Court at Calcutta (Kolkata). His writings on Indian law include a noted study on constitutional precedents as well as articles on human rights in India. He served briefly (1944–45) as Minister of Jammu and Kashmir state. From February 1952 until his death, he was a judge of the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Before his election to the court, he was regarded as a candidate for secretary-general of the United Nations. == Early life and education == Rau was born on 26 February 1887 in a Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin family of intellectuals.The Hindu Family and the Emergence of Modern India: Law, Citizenship and Community, Cambridge University Press His father Benegal Raghavendra Rau was an eminent doctor. Rau graduated from the Canara High School, Mangalore, topping the list of students of the entire Madras Presidency. He graduated in 1905 with a triple first degree in English, Physics, and Sanskrit, and gained an additional first in Mathematics in 1906.Rau, p. xv On a scholarship, he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, and took his Tripos in 1909, just missing the Senior Wranglership. He died of intestinal cancer at Zurich on 30 November 1953 and at that time he was a Judge of International court of Justice, Hague. ==Bureaucratic and judicial career== B. N. Rau passed the Indian Civil Service Examination in 1909 and returned to India, posted to Bengal. Doing well on the executive side, in 1909 he moved to the judiciary thereafter, and served as a judge in several districts in East Bengal. In 1925, he was offered a dual position by the Assam government, as Secretary to the provincial council as well as Legal Remembrancer to the government. He served in this position for about eight years. In addition to these duties, he occasionally fulfilled additional functions for the Assam government, such as drafting memoranda for financial support for the Simon Commission's tour of India in 1928–29, and presenting their case before the Joint Select Committee of Parliament in London after the third Round Table Conference in 1933.Rau, p. xvi He also worked with Sir John Kerr to prepare a note on how provincial legislatures in India might be designed to work better. On his return to India in 1935, Rau worked with the Reforms Office of the Government of India, on drafting the Government of India Act, 1935. At the end of this project, Sir Maurice Gwyer, the first Chief Justice of India's Federal Court, suggested that he gain the necessary five years' experience that would qualify him to serve as a judge on the Federal Court as well.Rau, p. xvii He served thereafter as a judge on the Calcutta High Court, but his tenure was interrupted by two additional projects that he was assigned to by the Government of India – he first presided over a court of inquiry concerning wages and working conditions on railways in India, and thereafter with a commission working on reforms concerning Hindu law. He also was reassigned to chair the Indus Waters Commission, which submitted a report on riparian rights on in 1942.Rau, p. xviii His distinguished work brought him a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1934 New Year Honours listLondon Gazette, 29 December 1933 and a knighthood in 1938.London Gazette, 9 June 1938 Rau retired from service in 1944, and was then appointed as the Prime Minister of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. He resigned from this position in 1945, following differences with the then-Maharaja of Kashmir, writing in his resignation letter that \\"...I have been conscious for some time that we do not see eye to eye on certain fundamental matters of external and internal policy. And that leads, as it must lead, to disagreement in many a detail. I have never questioned and I do not now question, the position that in all these matters Your Highness' decision must be final. The Prime Minister must either accept it or resign.\\" Following his resignation as Chief Minister of Kashmir, Rau was asked to serve in a temporary capacity in the Reforms Office of the Government of India, which he did so. He was also offered, and declined, the position of a permanent judge on the Calcutta High Court, preferring to stay in the Reforms office and work on constitutional and federal issues.Rau, p. xix He was consequently appointed as a Secretary in the Governor-General's office, working on constitutional reforms, until he became the Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly in 1946. While the Constituent Assembly was engaged in discussing the draft Constitution, Rau also worked on preparing a brief on the question of whether the United Nations Security Council could intervene in a dispute between the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Indian government, and was part of a delegation that represented India at the United Nations General Assembly, concerning this question as well as issued relating to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.Rau, p. xxiv ==Role in drafting the Constitution of India== B. N. Rau was appointed as the Constitutional Adviser to the Constituent Assembly in formulating the Indian Constitution in 1946. He was responsible for the general structure of its democratic framework of the Constitution and prepared its initial draft in February 1948. This draft was debated, revised and finally adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949. As part of his research in drafting the Constitution of India, in 1946, Rau travelled to the US, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, where he had personal consultations with judges, scholars, and authorities on constitutional law.Rau, p. xxii Amongst others, he met Justice Felix Frankfurter of the American Supreme Court, who famously advised him against the inclusion of a clause for 'due process' in the Indian Constitution as it would impose an 'undue burden' on the judiciary. The Constituent Assembly's resolution setting up the Drafting Committee on 29 August 1947, under the chairmanship of B. R. Ambedkar, declared that it was being set up to \\"Scrutinise the Draft of the text of the Constitution prepared by the Constitutional Adviser, give into effect the decisions taken already in the Assembly and include all matters ancillary thereto or which have to be provided in such a Constitution, and to submit to the Assembly for consideration the text of the Draft Constitution as revised by the Committee.\\" The draft prepared by the constitutional advisor was submitted in October 1947. Along with this draft, the proposals offered by the various other committees set up by the Constituent Assembly were considered and the first draft by the Drafting Committee was published in February, 1948. The people of India were given eight months to discuss the draft and propose amendments. In the light of the public comments, criticisms and suggestions, the Drafting Committee prepared a second draft, which was published in October 1948. The final draft of the Constitution was introduced by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on 4 November 1948 (first reading). The second reading was clause by clause consideration and took over a year. After three drafts and three readings, the constitution was declared as passed on 26 November 1949. Dr B. R. Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly on 25 November 1949 stated that: == Role in drafting the Constitution of Burma == Rau also assisted in drafting the early Constitution of Myanmar, or Burma, as it was then known. He met with U Aung San, Burma's Prime Minister, in New Delhi in December 1946, who invited him to assist in drafting Burma's Constitution. Burma's Constitutional Advisor was deputed to New Delhi in April 1947 where they worked together to collect research materials, and prepared a first draft that was taken back to Rangoon for modifications by a Drafting Committee. The Constitution was adopted on 24 September 1947. Rau went to Rangoon (now Yangon) to witness the final draft of the Constitution being passed by the legislature.Rau, pp. xix–xx ==Diplomatic career== Rau served India as a representing delegate in the United Nations. From 1949 to 1952 he was India's Permanent Representative to the UN, till he was appointed as a Judge of the International Court in The Hague. He also served as the President of the United Nations Security Council in June 1950.  Tenure on the Court of International Justice  Rau was invited by the Ministry of External Affairs to stand for election to the International Court of Justice towards the end of 1951, and began service towards 1952. He served for about a year, before succumbing to ill health while being treated in Zurich in 1953.Rau, pp. xxvii–xxviii In 1988, On the occasion of his birth centenary, the Govt. of India issued a postage stamp in honor of B.N.

Tui ) (born on May 7, 1983) is a Thai singer and actor. He first gained notice by winning Thailand's True Visions Academy Fantasia Season 3, a famous American Idol-liked reality show in Thailand. Due to the popularity of the show, people usually called the contestants' names followed by the term \\"AF\\"; as a result, Kiatkamol also became known as \\"Tui AF\\" () or \\"Tui AF3\\" (). ==Biography== Kiatkamol Lata was born in Bangkok, Thailand to a family as an only child. He graduated from Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon with a bachelor's degree of Business Administration (Majoring in Finance). After graduation, he worked at Thai Health Promotion Foundation, where he was part of the team to promote an \\"anti drink-drive\\" campaign – he worked there for three months, then decided to audition for Academy Fantasia Season 3. Academy Fantasia In 2006, Kiatkamol auditioned for Academy Fantasia Season 3 and became one of the final 12 contestants to participate in the show. His run on Academy Fantasia was considered one of the most successful runs in the history of Thailand's Academy Fantasia, as he was one of the three persons who never been at the bottom three (the others were Jeen AF1 and Good AF5) from 72 contestants of Season1-5. Kiatkamol is also considered one of the most successful artists from reality contests in Thailand. *Surprise of the Season Thailand's Academy Fantasia has always been famous for creating surprises for their fans. Surprise of Season 3 occurred on Week No. 6 when the host, Toi-Settha, announced that Kiatkamol was to leave the show. As Kiatkamol being one of the frontrunners of the season, this so-called elimination shocked the whole audience. However, Toi-Settha then revealed that Kiatkamol was to leave the show for a few days only and that was because he won the highest number of votes of the week. Kiatkamol was rewarded with a trip to Hong Kong with his mother, and to visit Hong Kong's major TV Station, TVB where he participated in a promotional event with Ron Ng Cheuk Hei, a Hong Kong actor and singer. ==Music career== After his successful run on Academy Fantasia, Kiatkamol released his first single \\"Aok Huk Mai Wa\\" – a pop dance song, which was on many music charts during its release. Half a year later, Kiatkamol released his solo album, Tui : A Rock On Earth, where he went back to his favorite genre, pop rock. From this album Kiatkamol was nominated and won some artist polls and awards. Popular songs from this album included, Takieng Kub Tawan, an ending theme song for Kiatkamol's lakorn debut \\"Phoo Kong Yod Rak\\", and Hai Krai Ma Rak Noi, which won Popular Songs of the Year 2007 from Virgin Hitz Award 2007. * Vocal Cord Surgery In 2008, before Jo Jo San AF the Musical began, Kiatkamol was diagnosed with a cyst on his vocal cord. Kiatkamol said that his voice often got hoarse after performances and as time went by his voice hardly came back to normal. He waited until the run of the play was over to have it removed on September 17, 2008 and was forbidden to speak for one month. ==Acting career== In addition to singing, Kiatkamol has also acted in many productions. His first TV series, Phoo Kong Yod Rak, which he paired up with Diana Chung, won the most popular TV-series from KomChadLuek Award#5. After the success of Phoo Kong Yod Rak, Kiatkamol also participated in AF's first musical production \\"Ngern Ngern Ngern\\", which he garnered a good review from Bangkok Post on his singing – calling his rendition of Classical love songs with his partner in the show both arresting and transporting. Kiatkamol's first participation with Channel 3 was \\"Tueng Rai Kor Rak\\" which he co-starred with Paul Pattarapol and Namfon Patcharin. He signed lakorn contract with Channel 3 and started having more lakorns with the channel. In 2008, he starred opposite Ploy-Chermarn Boonyasak in \\"Botan Gleeb Sud Tai\\" and had to take some lessons of Chinese Opera for the role. In 2009, Kiatkamol was back to work with Namfon Patcharin again in Look Sao Kam Nan, a musical lakorn where he played a new deputy trying to win the heart of a tomboy daughter of the mayor. Handle Me With Care In 2008, Kiatkamol was chosen by the producer, Jira Maligool to be in Kongdej Jaturanrasamee's Handle Me With Care (aka. Kod) and to co-starred with Kratae – Supaksorn Chaimongkol. Kiatkamol played Kwan, a three-armed man in search of his meaning of life. Kiatkamol gave an interview that this was a very challenging role for him and Kongdej had helped him a lot in understanding the role. As the filming progressed, he began to get comfortable with having two left arms and thought it looked special. By the time the filming ended, he became so engrossed with the role that when his \\"extra\\" arm was taken out, he felt something was missing. Kod did not do well at Thailand's box office at the time of its release and opened with mixed reviews, but was quite popular with the film festival circuits and was shown in various festivals such as Hong Kong International Film Festival 2008, Udine Far East Film Festival 2008, Munich Film Festival 2008, Montreal Fantasia Festival 2008, and 2008 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival. \\"Handle Me With Care\\" has been nominated for Best Foreign Film, The Arri-Zeiss Award at 26th Filmfest Munchen 2008 in Germany; and for Best Picture, in International Competition at 2nd Chungmuro International Film Festival 2008 in Korea.

A second edition, revised by Lodowicke Muggleton, was published in 1661 and from this a fifth edition (with more modern scriptural quotations) was published in 1846.John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton \\"A Divine Looking-Glass\\" Clerkenwell:Catchpool & Trent (1846) It claims to be a work of holy writ and is seen to be so in Muggletonianism. Specifically, it is part of the 'Third and Last Testament of Our Lord Jesus Christ'. The first two testaments are the Mosaic law and the gospels of Christ's apostles.Roughly, the Muggletonian canon comprises the Old and New Testaments less those books attributed to Solomon, plus Ethiopic Enoch Book of Enoch and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs. Reeve used a King James Bible of 1608 which preceded the Authorised version In the scriptural style, Reeve's book is divided into chapter and verse. \\"I, John Reeve, am the last commissionated prophet that ever shall declare divine secrets\\" (46.3). He received his commission from God \\"to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to his friend\\" (23.22) in February 1651. There were no visions or ecstasies. This commission identifies Reeve and his cousin, Lodowicke Muggleton, as the Two Witnesses referred to in the Book of Revelation at chapter 11 verse 3. The context means that both men saw themselves as given a power from God to expound scripture, God now decreeing the world to be ready to learn more of the divine secrets as the end of time draws near. This contrasts with a more usual prophetic tendency of the 1650s to identify the prophet as messenger, with the 'angel with a book' in chapter 10 of Revelation.Norman Cohn \\"The Pursuit of the Millennium\\" London:Granada Publishing, 3rd edition 1970 p. 316 - 330 (earlier editions do not have this section) cites Abiezer Coppe (1619-72) \\"A fiery flying roll\\" (1649) and also Laurence Clarkson who subsequently converted to Muggletonianism. ==Background== The doctrine in A Divine Looking-Glass is not systematic. Nor is it the working out of a single guiding principle through all areas of life. Instead, Reeve seeks to tackle what he regards as the burning issues of the day, at a time when individuals felt great anxiety as to their personal salvationT. L. Underwood \\"The Acts of the Witnesses\\" New York:Oxford University Press 1999 p. 35 sets out Lodowicke Muggleton's own spiritual struggles and many conflicting scriptural interpretations jostled for attention. In chapter 1 verse 4 he identifies four questions by which his book will seek to satisfy the curious. 1) Whether any creature was formed on purpose for eternal suffering? 2) Could any blame be attached to such a creature? 3) Would it not have been as advantageous to have formed all creatures for eternal happiness? 4) Whence came sin into man or angel? ==Creation, Angels and the three heavens== God, says Reeve, is an eternal, uncreated spiritual person, in form like a man (1.7). That man is Christ Jesus, who once walked this earth but is now glorified in heaven (1.8). This is the ancient Holy One of Israel who 'will not give his glory to another' (3.38). All other titles bestowed upon the deity are mere name-calling and refer to the divine qualities as perceived by humans. Even Reeve, though, cannot quite bring himself to say that \\"Father\\" is just another word for \\"Son\\". Most emphatically, what God is not, is an invisible spirit (1.18). That would be something Reeve considers an absurdity. To be able to act and intervene, God must possess a locus, a being. Just as God is eternal, so lifeless matter in the 'formlessness' of dust and water has existed since before time. The three heavens and our world were created from these, not from nothing-at-all. Creation is the word of God breathing life into the previously lifeless dust and water (2.8). Since Reeve is loath to say evil derives from God's creation he sees it as a primal force lying in wait amongst the lifeless dust - a surprising prototype for the Cthulhu mythos. The angels were the first created beings (3.1). They share the same form as human beings but possess spirits of pure reason (3.3). God's word creates creatures, not replica gods (3.12). Neither humans nor angels share in God's natural infinity (3.27). Sadly, whilst Reeve considers the relationship between God and angels, he ignores any general interaction between angels and humankind. Reeve states that he believes it was but a short time between the creation of the angels and the creation of man. Perhaps he wishes to avoid speculation like Laurence Clarkson's \\"Land of Nod\\" or the Jewish Lilith. The serpent which tempted Eve was one of these angels (3.4). There had to be an angelic reprobate so that the angels would know their innate goodness came from God, and not out of their own natures (3.6). Satan sins, not because of what he wills but because of what God wills for him. Just as there can be no perception of light without darkness, so there can be no glory for some without shame and misery for others (5.36). Reeve does not consider why this rather worldly psychology has to exist in heaven. The angels, although created perfectly pure, require continual infusions of divine inspiration in order not to degenerate (4.26). That degeneration was what happened to the reprobate angel, satan. Reeve does not follow the line that evil may be merely the misapplication of things intended for good. ==Reason and the right devil== Reeve takes the unusual step of condemning reason outright. There is never any tendency in his book to equate reason with the deity. Quite the contrary, he is certain there is no trace of reason in God because reason is just desire. Humans use reason, at least after the fall of Adam and Eve, because they see in it a technique, a trick, to obtain the satisfactions they feel they lack. Angels do likewise, although their desires are for pure things, not carnal ones. God lacks nothing, therefore he neither desires nor reasons. \\"all those men that call pure reason God's divine nature ... they shall find their imaginary reason nothing else but a dark tormenting fiery devil of burning envy in their own bodies\\" (1.23). If reason, instead of guiding humankind, constantly leads it astray, upon what can we rely? The law as written into our consciences (4.50). It is conscience that determines actions, not free-will (14.39). And, by the implant of conscience in us, we can comprehend immortal and infinite things although not being immortal or infinite ourselves. For Reeve, what eventually defeats the earthly tyrant is his own bad conscience (42.33). Only God is subject to no law (4.18). Law is to be found in faith alone because the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life (5.47). Faith is entirely within the gift of God (1.29). Reeve does not explore the problem of the wide differences of experience of conscience between individuals. What scripture contains is spiritual mysteries, accessible by faith, but not by reason (6.5). The gospels were not written by the learned but by the enlightened (6.11). Those who employ reason may see but do not perceive, hear but do not understand. Reason is devilishness within. A right appreciation of the devil is to see it as the turmoil within ourselves. Reeve displays little affinity for the mysticism which seeks oneness with an infinite majesty whilst still in this life. There is even less enthusiasm for moral reform. Instead, he advocates a realistic and fatalistic acceptance of the human condition as we find it (15.14). Questions like 'why do all my repentances lead to a craving to sin again' are just pointless self-recrimination (13.1). We are what we are and free-will is powerless to change this. \\"It is thou, O Lord Jesus Christ which wounds the souls of thy redeemed ones, through thy spiritual absence; and it is Thou who must heal them with thy glorious presence\\" (13.12). Why? Because that's the way divine love and free grace work. In heavenly affairs, points do not win prizes. Merit is merely worldly. ==The seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman== Spiritual conflict is not, as so often appears, between the ways of God and the ways of this world, but between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman (38.13). The woman is Eve, the first woman. The serpent is the reprobate angel who \\"was thrown down into this perishing world, where his desired kingdom of god-like government was prepared for him\\" (5.19). Eve was defiled by the serpent entering into her private parts there to make an end of himself by mixing with her womanliness and to launch a new career of evil in this world. As a result, a man-child was born to her, Cain, whose father was not Adam. The fall was none of Adam and Eve's fault. Had they possessed the power to preserve their original condition, they would have used it (30.20). Eve is to be considered as an exemplar of everything innocence should be, not as an easily deluded girl. What, then, is all the fuss about an apple? \\"You cannot be so weak,\\" says Reeve, \\"as to think that the law of eternal life and death depended on the eating of an apple from a natural tree.\\" (33.22). It is not what goes into a man that defiles him, but what comes out of his heart. Thus, the tale of the apple is a mere euphemism as ancient Jewish writers were pained by overt reference to the genitals. The curse upon Eve is temporal. That upon the serpent is eternal. The seed of the woman shall break the serpent's head. The sins of humankind are the frailties of free-will and are pardonable. That of the serpent is the sin against the Holy Ghost which is without absolution. But if Eve is not to blame, why is she cursed at all? Because that is what a knowledge between good and evil is. As to the serpent, what does it matter to him if he is cursed, seeing he was the devil in the first place? ==The reversal of time== John Reeve writes at a time when an interpretive understanding of the world as an order of Ideas and archetypes was giving way to something more analytical.see the essay \\"Aims of a new epoch\\" in Charles Taylor \\"Hegel\\" Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1975) Reeve has a foot in both old and new. But this tension is already present in the Jewish scriptures themselves. Mircea Eliade says \\"for the first time, the prophets placed a value on history, succeeded in transcending the traditional vision of the cycle (the conception that all things will be repeated forever) and discovered a one-way time.\\".Mircea Eliade \\"The myth of the eternal return\\" Princeton: Princeton University Press (1971 Bollingen paperback edition) p. 104. All the pieces are falling into place for history's end-game. The chastisement of Adam is reversed by Christ, our second Adam. The defilement of Eve is reversed by the immaculate conception which restores purity. For Reeve, God will surely make all things like new again. He will come as a thief in the night (47.7). And that time is now (22.12). The day of his appearing shall be like unto that of Noah (flood) and Lot (hail of fire and brimstone) (47.1). But why, if everything is to be made good again, has humanity's history of suffering been necessary? Because that is what creation means. A limitless deity creates limited creatures and knowledge is their limit. The apocalypse to come is when the awful truth to the phrase 'make the heart of this people fat' will have sunk in. Only faith saves. Following St Paul, Reeve says darkly, \\"who shall dare open his mouth on that day to say, Why hast thou made me thus?\\" (26.11) ==Scriptural Astro-physics== Reeve's system of astronomy is based upon scripture. It is also based upon a traditional view of matter in which earth, water, fire and air are the four elements and all substances interact according to how their 'natures' either repel each other in conflict or attract each other harmoniously. Our \\"visible heaven is all the firmaments that ever were created\\" (7.43). But there exist two other created heavens. One is said to be a \\"spiritual creation within natural bodies\\" (8.6). The other is the third heaven cited in scripture which is \\"the realm of the angels and glorified bodies of Moses and Elijah\\" (8.4). The bodies of the sun and moon were both formed out of water (7.45). Sun, moon and stars each possess only their own light (7.35). How, then may eclipses be explained? Reeve says \\"whatever men have long declared concerning the eclipse of the sun, through the near appearance of the moon, you may understand that the true occasion of the sun eclipsed, whether in part or whole, is according to their appearing at a further or nearer distance unto each other.\\" (7.49). \\"harken no more unto vain astronomers or star-gazers, concerning the bulk of the sun, moon and stars, for I positively affirm from the God that made them that the compass of their bodies are not much bigger than they appear to our natural sight\\" (7.33). What Reeve is describing is a sort of parallel universe (avoiding the pitfalls of reason) and a deeply psychedelic one. This is testified by the twelve beautiful plates, six illustrating the Newtonian system and six the Muggletonian, which accompany Isaac Frost's 1846 \\"Two systems of astronomy\\".Isaac and Joseph Frost \\"Two systems of astronomy\\" London: Simpkins, Marshall (1846) with the plates by George Baxter published separately as machine rendered oil-prints by W. P. Clubb & Co ==Conclusion== Reeve ends his work 'forget not that the wisdom of God seeth it most advantageous for his glory to choose base and despised things to confound the honourable and eloquent things of this vain glorious world' (51.11) amongst which things he counts 'conceited wise men which through an ambition of tongues or languages, have studied beyond all sober sense, reason or wit' (25.6). One topic which became important to subsequent Muggletonianism is no more than implicit in his book. This deals with the doctrine of immediate notice which says that God neither intervenes in, nor takes notice of, the everyday events of our world. Formal worship or private prayer is equally pointless. Nowhere does he give consideration as to what he means by terms like redemption or predestination. Reeve fails to stick to the story-line provided by the whole of the Book of Revelation and it may be this which prompted Muggleton's own two commentaries upon Revelation. ==References== Category:17th-century Christian texts Category:1656 books Category:Muggletonianism ","title":"A Divine Looking-Glass"},{"id":"20234819","text":"is a Japanese footballer who plays for JEF United Chiba. == Career == Kawamata joined Ehime FC as an apprentice professional in 2006, while studying at Komatsu High school.

Through both the Rover Scouts and Melbourne Walking Club, of which he was Chief Leader between 1934 and his ascension to the Club's Presidency in 1967, Bill introduced thousands of young people to the then-new sports of bushwalking and cross-country skiing. Bill would often contribute articles on his treks to the magazine of the Melbourne Walking Club, the Melbourne Walker, both on the treks themselves through the previously unexplored wilderness of Victoria and on the history of the areas he visited. Bill led the Australian Contingent to the 5th World Rover Moot and was Camp Chief of the 1961 Seventh World Rover Moot in Melbourne. He was a member of the party which a part of the first winter ascent of Mount Bogong, the highest mountain in Victoria in 1928, and began to take groups of Rover Scouts on week-long treks to explore the Bogong High Plains in 1932. The success of these treks would necessitate the construction of the Bogong Rover Chalet before winter 1940. Bill was presented with the Silver Acorn by Lord Baden-Powell himself in 1934, and received a Bar to the Silver Acorn 20 years later. Bill was presented with the highest award of The UK Scout Association, the Silver Wolf, at Surfmoot 1961, following the Seventh World Rover Moot. Bill's ashes were scattered at Investiture Point, a rocky outcropping on the Bogong High Plains and the closest place to the Bogong Rover Chalet at which it is possible to see Mount Bogong, in April 1969. In recognition of his unequalled contribution to Rover Scouting, Scouts Australia's Adult Recognition Award for service to the Rover Section is known in Victoria as the WF Waters Rover Service Award. == Personal life == Bill was an only child, born on 22 August 1897 in Traralgon, Victoria to Eva and Francis Waters. The family later relocated to Melbourne, where Bill attended the prestigious Melbourne High School. Bill joined the Australian Public Service in 1914 as a Naval Clerk in the Department of Defence. He transferred to the Department of Trade and Customs in 1926, where he worked in several roles, including supervisor, investigation officer and senior investigation officer; before retiring from the APS in 1962. He represented Victoria in Lacrosse and was an amateur heavyweight boxer. Bill was also a Freemason, and one of the founding members of Melbourne's Baden-Powell Lodge, the first Lodge to be named after Lord Baden-Powell. In 1933, Bill was appointed as an Honorary Ranger and an Honorary Forester by the Forestry Commission of Victoria. These appointments gave Bill the authority to act of behalf of the Forestry Commission. Also in 1933, Bill was gazetted as a member of the Committee of Management of the Kinglake National Park, another organisation that he would have a long association with. At the time of his death in 1968, Bill was not only a member of Scouts Victoria and the Melbourne Walking Club, but also part of a number of other community groups. Most notably, he was Chairman of the Kinglake National Park Committee of Management, a member of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and the Skiing Club of Victoria. == Melbourne Walking Club == He was a prominent bush walker in Victoria and held several offices in the Melbourne Walking Club, beginning in 1925 as a general committee member, before spending five years as secretary during the period 1927 to 1933 – when he assumed the position of Chief Leader. Bill would remain Chief Leader, responsible for overseeing the Party Leaders of all the Club's walks, until he became the Club's President in 1967. Due to his special knowledge of Mount Bogong, Bill was asked to join the rescue party that Howard Michell raised to try and save the other two members of his party, Mick Hull and Cleve Cole in August 1936 as they attempted the first crossing of the Bogong High Plains during winter. Hull was saved, but Cleve Cole died of hypothermia. In a sign of things to come, during the period of 1927–1930, a series of articles by Mr W.F. Waters of the Melbourne Walking Club appeared in the magazine Victorian Scout. == Rover Scout Commissioner == Bill was appointed as Headquarters Commissioner for Rovers in 1930 and continued in the role until 1965, when he was asked to step down and took up the newly created role of Commissioner for Rover Training, a position he held until his death three years later. Chief Commissioner Charles Hoadley gave Bill a simple brief: Get the Rovers out of their Dens and back into the outdoors, a goal that he would dedicate the remainder of his life to. With Bill's guidance, Victorian Rovers built three Chalets, ran the Seventh World Moot – the first World Scout event ever held in the southern hemisphere, mapped much of the land between Frankston and Warburton, pioneered skiing, began training their own leaders, maintained their organisation through the Second World War, and became the leaders of Rovering in Australia.  Alpine Rovering  With Bill's encouragement, Victorian Rovers built three Chalets and were amongst the pioneers of skiing in the state. These grand achievements grew from one simple session at Mooroolbark in May 1931, when Bill began teaching the Rovers the basics of cross-country skiing on a grassy hill. Bill had already gained much experience in the new sport, having been a part of the first party to reach the summit of Victoria's highest peak, Mt Bogong during winter, back in 1928.  Mt Donna Buang  Bill's first Rover Skiing trip was held at Mt Donna Buang on 25 July 1931, with 65 Rovers in attendance. Unfortunately, there was no snow that day, but the Rovers made the most of the opportunity, going on a bushwalk instead. However, the Rovers continued skiing in the area for many years until access to the better snowfields further from Melbourne improved. In 1945, with the end of the Second World War, The Rover Section wanted to construct a memorial to those Rovers who had been killed during the hostilities. By November, £110 had already been raised and so Bill purchased the land on the slopes of Mount Donna Buang and began the planning for the construction. By May 1946, funds had doubled, and the framework had been assembled by Rovers, however the postwar building restrictions prevented the completion of Rover Memorial Chalet, Warburton until 1949.  Bogong High Plains  The Bogong Rover Chalet in 2005 The first \\"Winter Party\\", as they would come to be known was held in 1932, based at Cope Hut. Nine people attended the two-week-long adventure on the Bogong High Plains. Over the coming years, the numbers attending the Winter Parties would increase, with participants from interstate also joining the Victorians in the early exploration of the area. By 1938, the size and number of the Rover Winter Parties were beginning to monopolise Cope Hut, as well as the nearby Wallace's Hut. Bill wrote to all Victorian Rover Crews and appealed for funds to construct a \\"Rover Hut\\" between the two huts. After raising £700, the Bogong Rover Chalet was constructed over five weeks in early 1940, in time for the ski season. The Rover Chalet is sometimes referred to as \\"the odd chalet out\\", because it is the only Ski Chalet outside the major Victorian Ski Resorts. This is for the simple reason that it predates the resorts, and at the time, the safest way to access the Bogong High Plain during winter was from Gippsland instead of Mt Beauty, as it has been since the construction of the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme in the 1950s.  Baw Baw Plateau  Bill also encouraged the efforts of the Yallourn and Moe Rover Crews, who were some of the first to ski the Baw-Baw Plateau, originally at Mt Erica. Beginning in 1934, the Rovers cut a number of ski runs and developed the area as a community service. In 1938, the Yallourn Rover Crew rescued two boys who had been lost in the snow overnight. Their parents arranged for financing for the Rover Crew to build a hut near Mushroom Rocks and it was officially opened by Bill Waters in 1940 on the King's Birthday public holiday. More and more Rovers began skiing in the area, until in 1946 the Rovers began to ski at Mt Baw Baw itself and the site of the current Alpine Resort. Bill negotiated with the owners of Neulyne's Mill for the use of some of their huts during the winter to accommodate the Rovers, although they still had to hike up to the snowfields from what is now the entry to the resort. From 1952, the Rovers were allowed the use of a cottage and the remaining huts. Public use of Mt Baw Baw increased over the next decade, leading to the establishment of the Mt Baw Baw Alpine Village. Bill's simple memorial on the Bogong High Plains As soon as the Alpine Village was announced, Bill was back at work and he negotiated for the Rover Scouts to build their own purpose built Ski Lodge. The site was granted in 1964, and the W.F. Waters Rover Ski Lodge was officially opened by the Chief Commissioner of Victoria in 1967, shortly before Bill's death.  Resting place  Because of Bill's passion and commitment to skiing and bushwalking in Victoria's Alpine areas, his remains were scattered at a place he named Investiture Point, the closest place to the Bogong Rover Chalet at which it is possible to see Mount Bogong. Over 250 people attended the memorial service on 26 April 1969. They were accommodated at the Rover Chalet, Wilkinson's Hut, Wallace's Hut, Cope Hut and in hundreds of tents along the Aqueduct between the three buildings. The service was led by Rover Scout Leader Ivan Stevens, and included the unveiling of a simple memorial to the \\"pioneer of bushwalking and ski-ing in this area\\", as well as an inspiring eulogy from Jim Blake of the Melbourne Walking Club A Fellowship of the Open Air When Chief Commissioner Charles Hoadley appointed Bill as Headquarters Commissioner for Rovers, he charged Bill to focus on building up the outdoor side of Rover Scouting, using his experiences with the Melbourne Walking Club and Ski Club of Victoria to develop the young men as leaders in the Victorian bush. In 1930, the Victorian Rover Scouts' outdoor activities were largely limited to the competition for the Matthew Evans Shield, which was awarded for \\"best hiking\\". That would soon change. Bill set about developing outdoor adventures by organising them himself. In the November 1930 edition of Victorian Scout, the journal of Scouts Victoria, Bill published a list of activities open to Rovers from across the state which were to be led by experienced activity leaders. This list of activities would become known as the Fixture Card, and it included activities like bushwalking, skiing, surfing and rock climbing; as well as working bees at Gilwell Park in Gembrook. Eventually the fixture card would include social activities and lectures to meet the demands of the Rovers. As the fixture card activities headed further afield, they became more popular, and would often attract Rovers and Rover Leaders from South Australia and New South Wales. Eventually, these trips became such a part of Rovering life that the minimum expectation was that each member would attend a minimum of six activities a year – including at least two hikes, one skiing trip and one working bee. Meanwhile, Rovers were also expected to attend their own local District and Crew events as well!  Frankston Jamboree  The 1934/35 Jamboree was the first Australian Scout Jamboree, and the only one to be attended by the Chief Scout of the World, Lord Baden-Powell. As this was during the Great Depression, Rovers were employed to prepare the site, and the Rovers also played an important part in the running of the Jamboree itself, but by far their biggest contribution was the post-Jamboree hikes through to Gilwell Park in Gembrook. 750 Scouts took part in the hikes, led by 108 Rovers, while other Rovers manned the expedition headquarters and field hospital at Powelltown, as well as their own fire observers on Mt Donna Buang and Spion Kop. Other Rovers were engaged full-time with providing communications between the parties and expedition headquarters, which was a serious challenge at the time. The major obstacle however, was that while some of the area had been mapped by the military or the Forestry Commission, around 30% of the area that the hiking parties were to travel through was uncharted. Every weekend for over four months, Rovers traveled out to the area with prismatic compasses and theodolites to survey this area. Their information, as well as the information from the existing government maps were combined at Rover HQ. The master Rover map was the basis of maps of the upper yarra valley for decades to come. During the hikes, Lord Baden- Powell resided at The Lodge in Gilwell Park and when the hike parties made it to the campground, he presided over a campfire. At the campfire, Baden-Powell praised the work of the Victorian Rovers in their contributions to the Jamboree, noting the hikes particularly, and saying that they were one of the best features of any Jamboree he had attended. Baden-Powell would later write that the Frankston Jamboree hikes were the biggest series hikes he'd seen organised outside the British Army, while Bill Waters also wrote that believed Baden-Powell had presented him with the Silver Acorn largely in recognition of the Jamboree hike program.  Hut Service Section  The Rovering community's interest in the outdoors grew, and beginning in 1936, they began to take an interest in maintaining the 20 abandoned huts at old sawmill sites in what in now the Yarra Ranges National Park, the forested mountains between Warburton and Powelltown. These 20 huts were within easy walking distance of each other and therefore were popular with Scouts and other bushwalkers as well. The scheme was well appreciated by the Forests Commission of Victoria and the mill owners; while the huts' visitors' books were full of praise as well. The Crews which took on responsibilities for these huts were expected to maintain their hut, visit it regularly, and report on its condition to the Chief Warden at Rover Scout Headquarters. They also provided visitors' books, firewood and some basic utensils for people staying at the hut. Unfortunately, most of these huts were soon to be destroyed during the Black Friday bushfires in 1939. The Rovers of the Ballarat area also maintained a hut in the Pyrenees during this time. == International Scouting == Bill's first experience with international Scouting came shortly before his appointment as Rover Commissioner, in 1929 at the 3rd World Scout Jamboree held at Arrow Park to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the publication of Scouting for Boys. In 1953, Bill embarked on his second overseas trip, leading Auatralia's first ever Contingent to a World Moot, the Fifth World Rover Moot at Kandersteg International Scout Centre, in Switzerland. Bill took 86 people to Kandersteg, including sixty Victorian Rovers. After the Moot, the Australians visited Gilwell Park and spent three weeks touring the British Isles. During this trip, Bill also represented Australia at the 14th World Scout Conference in Lichtenstein.  Seventh World Rover Moot Hosted by Victorian Rovers at Wonga Park between 27 December 1961 and 6 January 1962, the Seventh World Rover Moot was the first World Scout Event to be held in the southern hemisphere. The event was attended by 970 Rover Scouts from all Australian States and 15 other countries. Bill was the Moot Chief, the man responsible for overseeing the operation of the entire event. With a team of Leaders from across Victoria and Australia, Bill worked for two years to create an event that would set a new standard for Rover Moots in Australia and around the world. {  + Seventh World Rover Moot Council - !

Turner  } For the first time, the Moot program included a total of 48 different four-day expeditions to locations across Victoria, including Anglesea, the Bogong High Plains, the Buchan Caves, Lake Eildon, and Mount Buffalo. One whole day was set aside for participants to provide service to the community. Some of the service that was completed by the Moot included clearing the Puffing Billy Railway line from Belgrave to Menzies Creek, clearing the grounds of the Adult Deaf and Dumb Home in Blackburn, building kennels and runs at the Lady Nell Seeing Eye Dog School and painting the Guide Hut at Clifford Park. The 1962 Bushfires swept through the Moot site on January 16 (only nine days after the Moot ended) and many of the Rover Huts, other outbuildings and even the landowners' garden were destroyed in the blaze. Following the Seventh World Rover Moot, there was a worldwide downturn in the number of Rover Scouts, leading to an end to the Rover Scout section in the United Kingdom and many other countries. 30 years later, Victorian Rovers hosted the 8th World Moot at Gilwell Park, Gembrook over the summer of 1990–91. == Honours and Legacy == WF Waters Rover Service Award Certificate Bill served as Victorian Headquarters Commissioner for Rovers for 35 years (1930–1965). Under his guidance, Victorian Rovers built three Chalets, ran the Seventh World Moot and became the leaders of Rovering in Australia. Bill was invested with the Silver Wolf, the highest award of the UK Scout Association (of which Scouts Victoria was a part of at the time) at Surfmoot 1961. The simple ceremony took place at the main flagpole in the presence of his friends, and around 350 Rovers who had been a part of the Moot. Bill was presented with the award by then Chief Scout of the Commonwealth, Charles Maclean Bill remains a giant of Victorian Rovering to this day. In 1982, the Scouts Australia's National Council created a new Adult Recognition Award for outstanding service to the Rover Section by a Rover, Rover Advisor, or other person. These awards would be awarded on a state basis, and the Branch Rover Councils were authorised to name the award after a person who had contributed to the development of Rovering in their state. This award is known as the Henry Rymill Award in South Australia and Stan Bales Award in New South Wales. However, the numbers of WF Waters Rover Service Awardees dwarf the rest of the National Rover Service Awards, a testament to the high level that Bill raised Victorian Rovering to over many decades. Bill's name is also carried on by the WF Waters Lodge, a private ski lodge owned and operated by Victorian Rover Scouts at Mt Baw Baw Alpine Resort, and the Bill Waters Rover Crew in Nunawading. ==See alsoReferences== Category:People associated with Scouting Category:Recipients of the Silver Wolf Award Category:Scouting and Guiding in Australia Category:1897 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People educated at Melbourne High School Category:People from the City of Latrobe Category:Australian Freemasons Category:People from Traralgon ","title":"W.

The fire started as two separate fires on November 15, 2008. The Freeway Fire started first shortly after 9am with the Landfill Fire igniting approximately 2 hours later. These two separate fires merged a day later and ultimately destroyed 314 residences in Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda. ==Events== The Freeway Fire ignited at 9:01 a.m. PDT on November 15, 2008, along the Riverside Freeway (State Route 91, SR 91) in the riverbed of the Santa Ana River, located in Corona. The fire spread west and north into the hillsides of Yorba Linda and south into Anaheim Hills, where multiple businesses and residences were destroyed. It also burned homes in Olinda Ranch along Carbon Canyon Road in Brea, burned through much of Chino Hills, then spread north into Diamond Bar. The Landfill Fire, also known as the \\"Brea Fire,\\" was reported at 10:43 a.m. PDT on November 15, 2008, and started near the 1900 block of Valencia Avenue in Brea, just south of the Olinda Landfill. It quickly spread west and eventually jumped the Orange Freeway (SR 57). The Landfill Fire merged with the Freeway Fire at 3:30 a.m. PDT on November 16, 2008. At approximately 7:00 a.m. PDT the two fires were officially renamed the Triangle Complex Fire. Around 12:45 p.m. the Triangle Complex Fire had been renamed once again to the Freeway Complex Fire still using the OCFA incident number CA-ORC-08075221. According to the final cause report released by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) on January 4, 2010, it was confirmed that the Freeway Fire was caused by a faulty catalytic converter. ==Effects== Over a dozen schools were closed during the fire, including those in the Brea Olinda Unified School District, Chino Valley Unified School District, Diamond Bar schools in the Walnut Valley Unified School District, Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District and Walnut Valley Unified School District. About 40,000 residents were evacuated during the fire. Areas under mandatory evacuation during the fires included Anaheim, Carbon Canyon, Chino Hills, Corona, Diamond Bar and Yorba Linda As the fire spread, it forced the closure of the Riverside Freeway (SR 91), the Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71), the 241 Transportation Corridor and the Orange Freeway (SR 57) in northern Orange County. It was calculated that were burned during the fire, which included 90% of Chino Hills State Park. The calculated acreage burned would make the fire the fourth largest fire on record in Orange County History behind the 1967 Paseo Grande Fire, Steward Fire of 1958 and the Green River Fire of 1948. ==Causes== The preliminary cause of the Freeway Fire was thought to be the result of a vehicle exhaust system igniting roadside vegetation. The fire investigation report was completed by the end of March 2009. According to the final cause report released by CAL FIRE on January 4, 2010, the cause of the fire was a faulty catalytic converter. The Landfill Fire was investigated by the Brea Police Department, along with investigators from the OCFA. The fire was determined to have been caused by inadequate maintenance of power lines supplying electricity to equipment in the Brea-Olinda Oil Field. The electrical lines were owned by the BreitBurn Management Company in Los Angeles. Investigators believe arcing or a discharge of electric current from the power lines caused the brush near the lines in the fields northeast of Valencia Avenue and Carbon Canyon Road to ignite. ==See also== *November 2008 California wildfires ==References *Freeway Complex Fire After Action Report Addendum *Orange County Register Fire Central *CA-ORC- Freeway Complex *NASA - Natural-color image of the burned area *CBS slideshow of the fire Category:Wildfires in Orange County, California Category:Wildfires in Riverside County, California Category:2008 California wildfires Category:Anaheim, California Category:Yorba Linda, California Category:November 2008 events in the United States ","title":"Freeway Complex Fire"},{"id":"20235116","text":"Insignia Financial Group was a company that invested in apartments that were financially distressed, with the goal of increasing value via recapitalization.

Ambassador to Thailand from September 1991 until August 1995. Lambertson entered the U.S. Foreign Service in February 1963. He was assigned to Saigon from 1965 to 1968 as a member of the embassy’s political section, to Medan, Indonesia from 1969 to 1971, and to Paris as a liaison officer and press spokesman for the U.S. Delegation to the Paris Peace Accords, 1971-1973, on ending the Vietnam War. Lambertson returned to the State Department in Washington in 1973, first to the Office of East Asian Regional Affairs and then, in 1975, to the Office of Japanese Affairs as its Deputy Director. He was posted to Tokyo in 1977 as Deputy Chief of the political section, responsible for working with the Japanese Foreign Ministry on U.S.-Japan bilateral issues and cooperative US-Japanese approaches to multilateral questions. In 1980-1981 Lambertson attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, after which he returned to Washington as Director of the Office of Korean Affairs, 1982-84. He was Deputy Chief of Mission in the U.S. Embassies in Canberra, 1984–86, and Seoul, 1986-87. In 1987 Lambertson was named Deputy Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility for the ten countries of Southeast Asia. His work during his three years in that position focused on negotiations to end the war in Cambodia, support for the newly established democracy in the Philippines, and efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing in action in Indochina. During the 1990-91 academic year, Lambertson was Diplomat-in-Residence at the University of Kansas, teaching in the Political Science department. While at KU he was named by President George H.W. Bush in early 1991 as Ambassador to Thailand. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in July and arrived in Bangkok in September of that year. As Ambassador to Thailand, Lambertson led one of America’s largest embassies (500-plus U.S. employees, 26 USG agencies, more than 1500 Thai employees). He was responsible for all aspects of U.S. relations with Thailand during a period of significant political upheaval and change, burgeoning growth in US-Thai economic relations, intensified efforts to combat drug production and trafficking, and major refugee and displaced persons issues along Thailand’s borders with Cambodia, Laos and Burma. He also had oversight responsibility for U.S. government activities in Vietnam and Cambodia prior to the end of the Cambodia war and normalization of relations with Vietnam. Lambertson left Thailand in August 1995 and retired from the Foreign Service shortly thereafter. During his career, Lambertson was a member of numerous U.S. delegations to international conferences, beginning with the Paris Peace Talks, and including, inter alia, bilateral planning conferences with Japan, Korea and Australia, a United Nations conference on refugees in 1988 in Geneva, the 1989 Paris Conference on Cambodia (in which he led the U.S. delegation), and several conferences of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He was a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1980. Lambertson traveled to Hanoi three times, prior to normalization, as a member of delegations seeking progress on the POW/MIA issue. Lambertson had extensive experience in the foreign policy process in Washington, including Oval Office meetings during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations, chairmanship of inter-agency committees and more than 35 appearances before Congressional committees. He also had considerable media exposure, including appearances on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Nightline and NPR’s Morning Edition. He spoke on aspects of U.S. policy in many forums, including the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the Asia Society in New York and Washington, the Aspen Institute and numerous business organizations nationwide. During his Foreign Service career, Lambertson earned the State Department’s Meritorious, Superior and Distinguished Honor Awards as well as several Presidential awards. From 1996 through 1998, Lambertson was Director of International Development at KU, organizing business seminars and doing outreach for the University. Lambertson has taught in the Honors Program at KU and in the graduate-level International Studies program (MAIS), and has been a guest lecturer in the Anthropology, History and Political Science departments. At KU, Lambertson is also a member of the International Programs Advisory Board, the Honors Program Advisory Board, and the Advisory Board of the Biodiversity Institute/Natural History Museum, chairing the latter. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the Business School’s Center for International Business Education and Research, and for a time was co-Director of that center. Lambertson was active in the early years of the Dole Institute of Politics, as a member of planning groups and as a moderator in conferences on China MFN and the future of NATO, and has participated in a number of more recent programs. In 2007-2008, Lambertson established and was the first Director of the KU-Ft. Leavenworth Program (now the Office of Professional Military Graduate Education). In 2002, Lambertson was the Freeman Foundation Visiting Professor of Asian Affairs at Claremont McKenna College in California. Beginning in November 2000, and continuing through December 2005, he was American representative of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization in North Korea. In that capacity, he made eleven visits to North Korea, totaling nearly eighteen months in duration. Lambertson is a member of the International Relations Council of Kansas City, and the American Foreign Service Association. He is a past member of the Kansas International Trade Coordinating Council. He was a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the Command and General Staff College Foundation, and is a member of the Advisory Board of the Simons Center for the Study of Interagency Cooperation.

It was released on September 12, 2006 as their first mainstream release. The track later featured on the group's debut album, Uncle B, more than two years after the single was originally released. ==Background== \\"I Swear\\" was written, produced and released by N-Dubz during 2006. With Jamior Edwards being credited as the track's co-producer. The general style of the song is an upbeat hip-hop backing combined with the soulful vocals of Tulisa and the intensive rapping of Dappy forming an original British hip-hop grime track which's style is reflected in the forthcoming album tracks and singles that appeared on N-Dubz's debut album \\"Uncle B\\". The song prominently features the two more common participants of N-Dubz in the singing and rapping of their songs: Tulisa and Dappy, with Fazer featuring as backing vocals and/or grunting throughout the song as well as in the final verse where he raps about how he caught his girlfriend cheating on him when he arrived home from tour. The first verse is rapped by Dappy with Tulisa in backing. This follows onto a call and response chorus between both Dappy and Tulisa. Verse two is led by Tulisa with Dappy in backing and the track is called-out with N-Dubz's signatures call-outs \\"It's N-Dubz N-Dubz, what ye, it's N-Dubz N-Dubz, two thousand and sexy naa naa nii\\" - rapped by Dappy and \\"Uh-oh uh-oh\\" sung by Tulisa. The song's general theme involves infidelity, a theme which is later followed on by the group's 2008 single \\"Ouch\\". The song, through its lyrics, tells a story about how a man discovers that after his girlfriend starts regularly giving him the cold shoulder that she's in fact cheating on him. It's mentioned that he sees his girlfriend kissing another guy under a bridge and when he arrives home from tour he suspiciously finds a pair of Nike shoes that don't belong to him whilst his girlfriend is at home. The story of the lyrics goes on into an argument between the couple and the girlfriend admits that she didn't go chillin' with her girl-friends but did, as accused cheat on him. She states her reason for this as him not giving her enough love and she however consistently apologizes to him through the progression of the song and its lyrics. \\"I Swear\\" has also been featured as the concert opening track on N-Dubz's setlist for their Uncle B Tour. ==Critical reception== Metro.co.uk mentioned \\"I Swear\\" as one of the stand-out tracks on Uncle B, describing it as an \\"indefility anthem with a clever touch\\". Ukmusic.com reviewed the single \\"I Swear\\" is set to ignite both underground and commercial radio alike. The track is very in your face with both Dappy and Fazer threatening the so-called 'cheater'. Tulisa however, neutralises \\"I Swear\\" with her melodic harmonies that overall make it a great tune to listen to. It certainly becomes catchier after multiple listens. Dappy's voice is truly amazing and edits a very comical essence into the chorus. Ciao.co.uk also positively reviewed the song, claiming it had a great beat and fantastic sound. N-Dubz's sound really comes into its own in this track. Their slightly crazy voices work so well on the chorus. A perfect mix of rap and vocals mean you don't get bored of it and it tells a great story of infidelity. ==Music video== The music video for \\"I Swear\\" premiered on YouTube on November 22, 2006. As of June 15, 2009 the music video has received over 5,251,172 YouTube views. The music video begins with Tulisa lying in bed and Dappy strolling around the neighbourhood during the song's intro. It then moves onto Dappy being tied to a chair being teased by a girl, correlating with the lyrics \\"I miss the time when you would tie me to a chair, tease me from the back of my neck up to my ear\\". From this scene, which is repeated throughout the video in different ways, the video moves onto a scene under a bridge where a woman is kissing a man - correlating with the lyrics of Dappy's lines in the song. Furthermore, the scene then evolves into Dappy discovering the couple's secret at the scene of the crime, he is then angered by it and attacks the man. At the chorus of the song, the scene is shifted to in and around a city bridge. This is the setting for the majority of the video and mainly in the song's choruses. Tulisa then reappears wearing black sunglasses and white summer outfit. The scene is then shifted to a home for the second verse which is sung by Tulisa and features Tulisa pleading to her boyfriend and then also teasing him while he's tied to a chair. During Fazer's verse, the video showcases him walking into his home, arriving from tour, discovering a pair of Nike shoes which don't belong to him, whilst his girlfriend is in bed with another man. As Fazer walks up the stairs, his girlfriend tells the man in her bed to go hide. Just when she thinks her secret is safe, Fazer confronts her about the Nike shoes and an argument develops which later results in her secret being exposed. The chorus then features all three N-Dubz members performing on a bridge in a darker setting than that of the previous choruses in the video. ==Track listing== * CD Single # \\"I Swear\\" (Explicit Single Version) - 4:45 # \\"You Better Not Waste My Time\\" - 5:13 # \\"I Swear\\" (Clean Single Version) - 4:15 * Digital Download # \\"I Swear\\" (Explicit Single Version) - 4:45 # \\"I Swear\\" (Clean Single Version) - 4:15 # \\"You Better Not Waste My Time\\" - 5:13 # \\"Manufactured Bands\\" - 4:11 ==Chart performance== \\"I Swear\\" entered the UK Singles Chart in September 2006 at #91 on downloads only, selling over 1,000 copies through word of 'cybermouth' only, this was the last and only week the single spent on the chart due to it having limited promotion and funding under LRC at the time.

Locotrol is a product of GE Transportation (a Wabtec company) that permits railway locomotives to be distributed throughout the length of a train (distributed power). It is installed on more than 8,500 locomotives around the world, sending signals from the lead locomotive and via radio to the remote control locomotives. ==History== Locotrol was developed in the 1960s by an Ohio telephone and electronics manufacturer, North Electric Company. The technology was later purchased by GETS predecessor Harris Controls. The electronics were mounted in a separate railcar, but have since been miniaturised into relatively small cabinets with much of the functionality contained in software. Early Locotrol customers included the Southern Railway, Norfolk & Western RR, Canadian Pacific and Australia's Mount Newman Mining and Queensland Rail. Today numerous railroads use Locotrol, with systems deployed globally numbering in the thousands. Since 1975, both Queensland Rail (now called Aurizon) and Mount Newman Mining (now called BHP Iron Ore) in Australia have used the system on coal and iron ore trains, permitting the doubling in the size of trains without exceeding draw-gear strength, through the use of mid-train locomotives. Westrail, Western Australia's government-owned railway introduced Locotrol working in 1996, also with retrofitted equipment. In June 2001 BHP Iron Ore in the Australian Pilbara set a record for the longest train with 682 ore cars and eight distributed GE AC6000CW locomotives in a 2-168-2-168-2-168-1-178-1 configuration. The Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway are major North American Locotrol operators. ==Features== Originally an aftermarket product, the system is also available as an option on new locomotives. Distributed power itself was not a new concept, but it required an extra train crew to be located in the middle of the train. Two modes of operation can be used: synchronous where all locomotives operating in unison, or independent mode where part of the train heading upgrade can be powering, while the other half can be braking on the downgrade. Most systems use lead and middle of train locomotives, but up to four consists can be controlled from the lead unit. ==See also== * Distributed power * Remote control locomotive ==References== Category:Locomotives Category:Radio control Category:Rail technologies ","title":"Locotrol"},{"id":"20235270","text":"Fierzë is a village and a former municipality in the Shkodër County, northwestern Albania.

The route continues as main road N44 towards The Hague, providing an alternative link with Amsterdam for the A4 motorway. The A44 also serves Leiden and the Bollenstreek. The length of the A44 is , the N44 adds another making the total route long. Wegenwiki, A44 ==Overview== Near Leimuiden, the A44 motorway splits from the A4 at Burgerveen interchange. Until the 1960s, the A4 followed the route of the current A44 passing Leiden west. Then the new A4 was built east of the city creating a more direct route from Amsterdam to Rotterdam. The former A4 was eventually renumbered into A44. Both motorways are important arteries for The Hague, where the A44 is primarily focussed on the city centre. The A44 is one of the oldest motorways of the country with parts dating from the 1930s. Small dimensions of the carriageway, narrow bridges and tight junctions are signs of outdated design. It is also remarkable that the A44 is one of the very few busy Randstad-motorways not being equipped with active traffic management nor lit for the major part. When leaving the Burgerveen interchange in the province of North-Holland, the A44 runs through rural area known as the Bollenstreek. In Spring the fields fill up with coloured flowers. A few towns pass by and the motorway crosses the Ringvaart where it enters the province of South-Holland. The surroundings of the A44 become more populated when approaching Leiden. The motorway ends a few kilometers south of Leiden in Wassenaar at an at-grade junction with traffic lights. The route continues as major road N44, running through the wooded estates of Wassenaar towards The Hague. The N44 ends at the city limits of The Hague. Here, the route continues as city route s101 towards the city centre. A split-level interchange connects the N44 with the N14 (Ring Den Haag) towards Leidschendam and the S200 (Ring Den Haag) towards Scheveningen. ==Exit list== { class= !Province !Municipality !km. !# !Name !Roads !Notes - rowspan=3North Holland rowspan=3Haarlemmermeer 0 Image:AB-Kreuz-blau.svg Interchange Burgerveen A4 Southbound entrance, northbound exit - 1 Image:AB-AS.svg 1 Oude Wetering   - 5 Image:AB-AS.svg 2 Kaag (Dorp)   - rowspan=11South Holland rowspan=4Teylingen 7 Image:AB-AS.svg 3 Noordwijkerhout N208  - 10 Image:AB-AS.svg 4 Warmond   - 12 Image:AB-AS.svg 5 Sassenheim  Southbound entrance, northbound exit - 13 Image:AB-AS.svg 6 Voorhout N444  - rowspan=3Oegstgeest 15 Image:AB- AS.svg 7 Oegstgeest   - 17 Image:AB-AS.svg 8 Leiden N206  - 19 Image:AB-AS.svg 9 Leiden-Zuid  Southbound entrance, northbound exit - rowspan=4Wassenaar 21  Wassenaar   Traffic lights - !colspan=6Main road N44 - 22  Voorschoten N448 Traffic lights - 28  Leidschendam, Scheveningen  N14 S200  Split-level - !colspan=7The Hague city limits.

The A31 / N31 is a motorway and an expressway in the Netherlands. It connects the A7 near Zurich with the A7 near Drachten, passing close to Leeuwarden, the provincial capital. It is slightly unusual due to it changing from full motorway to normal 2-lane road along various sections of its 65 km length. == Route description == The short section between the Zurich interchange with the A7, and exit 15 for Zurich (approx 1.7 km) is designated as the A31 and is built to motorway standards. The next 7 km continues as a 4-lane expressway, until the road narrows to just a normal 2-lane road for the next 3 km while it passes over an elevated section through Harlingen. This section from Zurich to Harlingen is designated as the N31, but retains the motorway-style grade separated intersections. For the next 18 km, until exit 22 for Marssum, the road is once again designated the A31 and is built to motorway standards. This section of the A31 bypasses the towns of Franeker and Dronrijp. At exit 22 one has to take this exit to follow the N31 while continuing over the exit, the road reverts to an expressway and continues as the N383 into Leeuwarden. The remaining 35 km of the N31, until it meets exit 30 of the A7, is once again an expressway. Of this last section, the first 13 km around Leeuwarden is a just a 2-lane road with at-grade intersections and utilises traffic signals and roundabouts, while the final section opens out into 4-lanes with grade separated intersections. The widening of this last section to four lanes, was completed in 2008. History Harlingen-Port was supposed to be an exchanging point for mainly passengers, already in 1845-64, and so, supposed to be connected by three railway junctions. One of these was planned alongside the 'Afsluitdijk' (enclosure-Dam). Besides that, Harlingen was connected by road to the E-10 highway running from Barcelone to St.Petersbourg. In the opinion of the NL government, Harlingen-Port was/is doomed to be insulated but, Harlingens' and Friesland/Gronings isolation was decided politically and not on a geographical basis. The industry and transport connection of Friesland-Groningen provinces was also politically determined not to develop. The 're-numbering' of the E10 Highway onto 'N31' was determined with the political decision, to de-generate important Hinterland-connections out from Harlingen-Port. The highway was built without escape lanes, like the 'n31' connection Leeuwarden onto Drachten.... and therefore more dangerous, because of no entrance to emergency 112 vehicles in case of accidents. The real highways in NL and Northern NL are named 'A-highways' like A7, A1, A2. The railway along The Afsluitdijk was also planned along the trajectory of the now realized 4-lanes Motorway 'N31' Harlingen-Zurch-'Afsluitdijk.' The Railway along this enclosure-dike was discerned after WW II in 1940 to 1945, of cause by the decision, to electrify the railjoncton Statal Railway no.

The film portrays environmental and human health effects of toxic waste dump- sites in Niagara Falls, New York and other locations. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. == Synopsis == The film surveys several waste disposal sites in the United States.  Love Canal, New York  The documentary begins with the environmental disaster at Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York. Governor of New York Hugh Carey provided $10 million in funding for residents nearest the canal to leave. The state purchased the houses of some residents. The film features commentary on pollutant-linked birth defects by Dr. Beverly Paigen of the Roswell Park Institute (now the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center). Dr. Paigen collected statistics of diseases near Love Canal. Of 187 households still occupied near Love Canal, she documented \\"17 nervous breakdowns, 34 miscarriages, 20 birth defects, 41 cases of respiratory disease, and 3 suicides, all well above the national average.\\" Dr. David Axelrod, former health commissioner of New York, then expanded the evacuations to include households with small children or pregnant women. The film alleges that Hooker Chemical Company \\"never warned the state that dioxin was in the canal.\\" In response, Bruce Davis, executive vice president of Hooker Chemical Company, states that \\"the quantity of dioxin that was located in that entire large canal site was a very, very low quantity.\\" However, a review of Hooker Chemical documents, obtained by ABC News, shows a list titled \\"Types of Waste Category\\" that appears to state which chemicals were dumped, and directly contradicts some statements by Davis. The film also reveals compromising statements by a Hooker Chemical employee, John Gibson. Love Canal residents sued Hooker Chemical for \\"billions of dollars\\" in damages.  New Jersey   Kin-Buc landfill  ABC News applied the Freedom of Information Act to obtain footage from a 1976 United States government film showing trucks dumping \\"raw chemical waste\\" at Kin-Buc Landfill near Edison, New Jersey. Kin-Buc was allegedly subject to \\"frequent fires, which sent noxious smoke over the surrounding community.\\" The film further shows that the nearby Raritan River has been contaminated by PCBs, chloroform, benzene, and mercury. However, due to the shutdown of Kin-Buc, there were no legal toxic waste dumps available to direct new waste to, nor to use for cleaning up Kin-Buc.  Illegal dumping  The film investigates illegal \\"midnight dumping\\" practices near the New Jersey Turnpike. One tactic involved stealing trucks, filling it with toxic waste barrels for payment, then abandoning the truck. The film alleges that one firm, Chemical Control Company (CCC), \\"simply unloaded drums into New Jersey's Meadowlands, pumped waste directly out of tank trucks into waterways, and mixed it with soil at the foot of a street so that seemingly harmless dirt could go to an ordinary garbage dump.\\" The head of CCC, William Carracino, was facing two years in jail for illegal dumping when he gave an interview for the film. Carracino commented: > \\"Well, I'd say maybe 80 percent of most of the waste shipped is being dumped > illegal. The economics behind it is, is if you don't have to treat it, > there's no cost except transportation, and if you can get 20 and 30 dollars > a drum for a chemical, and you can take it from a customer or a generator > and carry it direct to a landfill or site, and dump it on the ground and > bury it.\\" When asked about the amount of money that can be made, Carracino responded: > \\"Millions. You can go out and rent a piece of property. Don't buy it. Rent > it. Rent ten acres, rent twenty acres. Get a permit to handle drums. Bring > them onto the property, and just store em. As soon as the heat gets too > great, just go bankrupt and get out. There's no law against it.\\" Carracino's Chemical Control Company remained on New Jersey's list of recommended waste disposal companies even after it was convicted of illegal dumping. A New Jersey chemical waste regulator was interviewed about CCC's tactics. Afterwards, the New Jersey Attorney General obtained a court order to close CCC. In addition, the documentary follows a truck from New Jersey that allegedly dumps concealed barrels of carbolic acid at a household dump in Pennsylvania. Footage filmed by WNEP-TV shows the dumping operation. Elsewhere, in the New Jersey Meadowlands, the improperly stored mercury waste of a former factory led to \\"the highest level of mercury contamination in the world.\\"  Student protests  Elsewhere, students in Bordentown, New Jersey demonstrate against a potential chemical dump across from their high school. The landfill application has been filed by SCA Services, Incorporated. SCA had already been fined for illegally dumping chemicals at a household dump in Bordentown. ABC News demonstrated via SEC filings that SCA and the company that owns Kin-Buc Landfill had a partnership. Afterwards, SCA was included as a defendant in a lawsuit brought against the owners of Kin-Buc.  Louisiana  Petro Processors of Louisiana was waste disposal company that served the petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River, including Exxon, Shell, Allied Chemical & Dye Company, and Dow Chemical Company. However, a Petro dumpsite overflowed, \\"flooding 500 acres with waste\\", including carbon tetrachloride and hexachlorobutadiene. The film includes an interview with Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, who said he was \\"close to the industrial complex because of its effect on the economy.\\" > \\"We've made tradeoffs, accommodations, or compromises, if you will, taking > the position that the need for jobs and industrial development and > stimulation to our economy justified the temporary tradeoffs, and in some > instances, some serious tradeoffs, where the environment became totally or > partially damaged, and in some instances permanently.\\" > \\"None of us, as far as I know, who are in positions of authority in the > state apologize for that. We did what we thought was best for the people and > the economy of Louisiana. We accommodated the industry where we thought we > could, in order to get the jobs and the development, and in some instances > we knowingly and advisedly accepted environmental tradeoffs.\\" Columbus Millet, resident of Bayou Sorrel, Louisiana, said that residents would occasionally wake up \\"choking\\" due to noxious air. Waste was supposedly being disposed via injection well, but was instead illegally dumped in open pits. A disposal worker died of asphyxiation after adding new waste into the pits, causing a chemical reaction.  Michigan  In Montague, Michigan, a Hooker Chemical plant allegedly caused \\"the worst environmental disaster in Michigan's history\\". Warren Dobson, former Hooker employee turned whistleblower, gives an interview.  Superfund  The film briefly mentions the attempts to pass the law that would become the Superfund. William Sanjour, branch chief of waste reduction within the United States Environmental Protection Agency, alleged that \\"the [Carter] administration doesn't want to implement this [Superfund] law,\\" and that the agency has been \\"systematically suppressing\\" environmental regulations. An EPA program administrator commented: > The Carter administration's number one policy, as explained to us by top > management, is to fight inflation. So, finding more sites where people are > being poisoned, could contribute, in their mind, to their fight against > inflation.  Future Superfund sites  A number of the polluted sites mentioned in the film became EPA Superfund sites after the documentary was published. *Shakopee, Minnesota *Lowell, Massachusetts *Valley of the Drums in Bullitt County, Kentucky *Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York *New Jersey Meadowlands *Kin-Buc Landfill near Edison, New Jersey; also affecting nearby Raritan River *Bayou Sorrel, Louisiana *Bordentown, New Jersey *Montague, Michigan, near White Lake Township, Michigan * Bloody Run Creek dump in Hyde Park, New York *Bridgeport, New Jersey == See also == * Superfund * Valley of the Drums * Hazardous waste * Pollution in the United States ==References * Category:1979 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about environmental issues Category:1979 documentary films ","title":"The Killing Ground (film)"},{"id":"20235356","text":"Schizomeria ovata, a medium to large Australian rainforest tree, is widespread in warm-temperate rainforest in coastal New South Wales north from Narooma (36° S) and southern Queensland south from Fraser Island (25° S).

It was first published in French as Le Jeu de la Guerre in 1987, but unsold copies were later pulped in 1991, along with other books by Debord, at his insistence when he left his publisher Champ libre. The book was reissued in 2006, with an English translation published by Atlas Press in 2008.A Game of War accessed 16 November 2008 In his 1989 book Panegyric, Guy Debord remarked: :So I have studied the logic of war. Indeed I succeeded long ago in representing its essential movements on a rather simple game-board… I played this game, and in the often difficult conduct of my life drew a few lessons from it — setting rules for my life, and abiding by them. The surprises vouchsafed by this Kriegspiel of mine seem endless; I rather fear it may turn out to be the only one of my works to which people will venture to accord any value. As to whether I have made good use of its lessons, I shall leave that for others to judge. Apart from the books which contain the game, free online versions of the game are available. London based group, Class Wargames have reproduced A Game of War and taken it on a campaign around the globe, at Belo Horizonte, pictured above, St. Petersburg and a variety of other locations. == Play == The basics of the game are close to those of chess, in that it is based on war and the strategy that surrounds it. Two players take turns moving troops across the board. Each player can move up to 5 troops each turn and is allowed 1 attack. Attacking is decided by summing all the offensive power in the range of an enemy target square. Then subtracting the total defensive power of the other player. If this number is greater than 2 then the attack is a success. Power is added from all the attacking pieces in a straight line either vertical horizontal or diagonally to the attacking square. The game board has natural obstructions that simulate the different terrain on a battlefield. The winner either defeats all their opponent's troops, or destroys their arsenals.Cabinet magazine When making the game Guy Debord said there were only three things that stopped his game from being 100% accurate and those were climate conditions and the cycles of day and night; the influence of troop morale; and uncertainty about the exact positions and movements of the enemy. The game and book of the same name did not receive much success but a copy can still be bought today.Board game geek ==ReferencesSee also== * Three-sided football ==External links== *Kriegspiel, Alex Galloway's on-line version of Le Jeu de la Guerre. *Battle of 1815 - Waterloo, another free online version of Guy Debort's Kriegsspiel *Game (article), Totality.tv, Sunday, April 13, 2008.

He soon became a regular player of youth tournaments, competing at the national, regional and international levels. His biggest junior success occurred at Duisburg in 1992, when he took home a bronze medal in the Under-16 category of the World Youth Chess Championship. By the mid-1990s, Fridman was recognised as a serious force in Latvian chess. He went on to win the national championship in 1996, having gained the International Master (IM) title in 1994. Leaving his junior status behind, he had some early international tournament successes at the Wichern Open in Hamburg in 1997 (joint second place, behind Sergei Movsesian) and Senden in 1998 (joint winner with Frank Holzke).

The album is made up of Christmas-themed songs, and was recorded in the middle of 2008. Shortly after the release, Pinnacle Entertainment, the United Kingdom distributor, went into administration. Despite this, the album had some success in Asia and the United States, and Talbot's third album, Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic, included many of the same tracks. Talbot appeared publicly to promote the album, including an appearance on ITV Central in December, and embarked on a tour, making stops around the world. Critics responded warmly to the album, describing Talbot's voice as \\"sweet\\". ==Recording and release== Talbot's voice was recorded near her home. Other parts of the album were recorded elsewhere in the UK, as well as in the US, Bulgaria and Hong Kong. Connie Talbot's Christmas Album contains \\"a mix of classics and modern Christmas tunes\\", and was produced by Simon Hill and Rob May, who produced her first album, Over the Rainbow. Big band arrangements on the album included music from Laurence Cottle Big Band, while the orchestral sections of the more traditional songs were performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra. The duet on \\"When a Child Is Born\\" was performed by Talbot and Ginger Kwan. Describing the recording of the album, Talbot said \\"I really liked it. I liked all the songs they picked and everything. It was really good and enjoyable.\\" Five tracks (\\"Let it Snow!\\", \\"Rocking Around the Christmas Tree\\", \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\", \\"Santa Clause Is Coming to Town\\" and \\"Frosty the Snowman\\") were recorded in the style of a big band, while the remainder were recorded in a \\"more traditional\\" style. Connie Talbot's Christmas Album was released on 24 November 2008. The album was difficult to obtain in Britain after the distributor, Pinnacle Entertainment, went into administration. Talbot's mother, Sharon, was quoted as saying, \\"We don't really know what's going to happen at the moment ... We think they'll probably wait and promote the album later this year. It's a shame, but they can still get the album in Asia and the US.\\" In 2009, Talbot's third album, Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic, was released in the United States, with many of the same songs as Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, but with rerecorded vocals. ==Publicity== Before the release of the album, Talbot recorded a \\"secret concert\\" at her primary school. The documentary, Christmas with Connie, was shown on ITV Central on 18 December. Talbot appeared at the HMV Walsall branch the day after the release to sign copies of the album and to meet fans. After the release, Talbot embarked on a promotional tour that made stops around the world, including a performance at Ewha Womans University in Korea, where Over the Rainbow had sold over 30,000 copies. Talbot also performed on the A Heart for Children television charity gala in Berlin, Germany, where her performance was described by Viktoria Schiller, writing for The Epoch Times, as \\"one of the highlights of the evening\\". Talbot returned home in mid-December, to have \\"a quiet family Christmas\\". Plans were made for a promotional trip to the US in 2009. ==Critical reception and sales== Ruth Harrison, writing for FemaleFirst magazine, gave the album 4/5, saying that Talbot has \\"a great voice when it comes to swing, but lets us down in parts\\". Harrison said that Talbot struggled with the \\"rock sound\\" associated with \\"Merry Christmas Everybody\\", but said that the vocals on \\"Ave Maria\\" are \\"incredible\\", and that the bonus tracks \\"really are a bonus\\". The Leicester Mercury published a review from a nine-year-old critic, Natasha Dattani, who said that Talbot \\"has a nice voice, it's very cute\\", and added that \\"older people, like grandparents, will really like\\" the album. James Whittle, writing for the South China Morning Post, described the album as \\"chock-a-block with old-time favourites\\", calling Talbot \\"sweet-voiced\\". Despite the problems in the United Kingdom, which left hundreds of copies of the album in warehouses, Amy Bowen of the Walsall Advertiser wrote that the album was proving successful in Asia. In its first week of release, Connie Talbot's Christmas Album sold 4,551 copies worldwide, and, as of December 2009, it has sold 14,913. ==Track listing== This is the main track listing as given by Allmusic.\\"[ Connie Talbot's Christmas Album]\\".

It was denied affiliation with the Stop the War Coalition due to questions raised over its support for regime change. ==Formation== The initiative for Hands Off the People of Iran came from a number of Iranian exile organisations in 2005. On March 16, 2006, Workers Left Unity - Iran wrote an open letter to the British anti-war movement, calling for genuine solidarity with the Iranian people. By 2007 HOPI was fully established, consisting predominantly of Iranian exiles who campaign for regime change in Iran but are against external military intervention, believing military occupation to be the worst condition under which liberation can be achieved. HOPI's founding conference was held in December 2007. At the Founding Conference, a National Steering Committee was established consisting of seventeen members from a range of different political organisations and political traditions. These include members of the Green Party of England and Wales, Labour Representation Committee, Jewish Socialist Group, Permanent Revolution, Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements at the University of Glasgow, Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), Workers Left Unity - Iran, Revolutionary Workers of Iran, Anarchist Federation (pc) and Women’s Campaign Against All Misogynist Laws in Iran. An Irish branch of HOPI, chaired by Anne McShane, organised a protest outside the Iranian Embassy in Dublin in June 2009. ==Expulsion from Stop the War Coalition== Shortly before Stop the War Coalition's 2007 AGM, HOPI, alongside another organisation Communist Students, was denied affiliation with the Coalition. ==Affiliates and Supporters== Prominent affiliates or supporters of HOPI include the Public and Commercial Services Union; ASLEF, the train drivers' union and Peter Tatchell,. ==See also== *Opposition to military action against Iran *Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran ==References *Hopi's website featuring news on the campaign * * *HOPI's YouTube channel Category:Organizations established in 2007 Category:Communism in the United Kingdom Category:Peace organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Hands Off the People of Iran"},{"id":"20235674","text":"Bushat is a village and a former municipality in the Shkodër County, northwestern Albania.

However, some have been all new content, not released before in novel format. The series, like the novels they are based on, are set in a future where mankind is facing annihilation by an aggressive alien society, an insect-like race known colloquially as \\"Buggers\\" but more formally as \\"Formics\\". The central character, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, is one of the child soldiers trained at Battle School (and eventually Command School) to be the future leaders of the protection of Earth. The year is never specified, although the ages of the Wiggin children are specified to change throughout space, also carefully taking in the relativity of space and time. ==Background== Format The series of comic books are adaptations of the novels in the Ender Saga and are released under the banner \\"Actual Ender's Game\\". The series began publication in October 2008 with the first issue of Ender's Game: Battle School, with a set monthly release that followed. Both Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow stories were told spanning ten issues each, with two different sub-titles. Orson Scott Card's name has been attached to every issue released.

Zeck Morgan was raised by his minister father to be a pious, God-fearing child, devoted to his church. Unfortunately, when the International Fleet decides Zeck is a candidate for training in Battle School, they tear him from his home and prepare him for war. Zeck refuses to participate in the school's war-games due to his pacifist religious beliefs. When he sees a Dutch student give a friend a small present in celebration of Saint Nicholas' Eve —seemingly violating Battle School's rules against religious practice—he raises an uproar that may tear Battle School apart. Can even Ender Wiggin calm this furor? http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13663 Mazer in Prison Released February 2010, this is a one-shot prequel based on the short story of the same name.

At the G8 Environmental Minister Meeting in Kobe on May 24–26, 2008, the ministers agreed about the Kobe 3R Action plan. It intends to improve resource productivity, to establish an international sound material-cycle society and to bring forward 3Rs capacity in developing countries. According to this plan, Japan also announced a New Action Plan towards a Global Zero Waste Society, aimed to establish material cycle societies internationally. The Japanese government set October as the official month for 3R promotions. This was done to specify and allocate deliberate time to encourage corporations and businesses to focus on the importance of reducing, reusing and recycling waste. During the promotion month, the government and other companies organise informative events and parties to publicise the ideas of a sound material- cycle society. == Scandals == In January 2008 five paper companies in Japan were accused of misleading customers about the recycled paper content of their products. Oji Paper, the largest paper company in Japan, admitted that its copy and print paper contained 5 to 10% recycled paper, instead of the 50% stated. The president of Oji Paper apologized to its customers, and the president of Nippon Pages, the second largest paper company in Japan, resigned to take responsibility. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission said it would investigate. == See also == * Recycling * Waste management in Japan * Electronic waste in Japan * Mottainai - common Japanese expression, often used in this context == References  External links == * The Japan Containers and Packaging Recycling Association * 3R Initiative on the Ministry of Environment homepage * Japan for Sustainability * PC 3R Promotion Association ","title":"Recycling in Japan"},{"id":"20235780","text":"The Community Services Appeal Tribunal was an independent tribunal established in the State of New South Wales to deal with breaches of community welfare legislation, as well as handling appeals against licensing decisions in respect of child care services, boarding houses, and foster carers. The tribunal provided the first forum in New South Wales for alternative dispute resolution in New South Wales for resolving disputes. The tribunal replaced the Community Welfare Appeals Tribunal which was known as CWAT.Law Reform Commission Report. The tribunal would hear matters in an informal manner in an attempt to do justice in the matter. The tribunal was abolished on 1 January 1999 and was replaced by the Community Services Division of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales. ==Establishment== The tribunal was established under section 92 of the Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW). The Governor of New South Wales could appoint a person to be the President of the tribunal.Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) This appointment is on the recommendation of the Minister after consultation with the Community Services Review CouncilThe Council was established under section 107. The appointment could be for up to five years, and the President could be re-appointedSection 101 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) and the position was a paid appointment.Section 102 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) The Minister could also appoint part-time members to the tribunal after consultation with the Council. One of those part-time members could be appointed as the Deputy President of the tribunal by the Minister. At least one of the members was to be a barrister or a solicitor. A part-time member could be appointed for up to five years and could be re-appointed again. Part-time members were paid a daily remuneration. In appointing the members, the following persons could be considered: (a) people with knowledge of and experience in administration, child care, community services, education, law, medicine, psychology and social work; (b) other people who the Minister considered had suitable qualifications or experience warranting their appointment. The appointment can be for up to seven years and the person can be re-appointed again for up to another seven years. In practice, the tribunal would advertise for expressions of interests in member positions, and would select applicants based on merit. The tribunal took the view that this ensured that members were drawn from a wide pool of qualified applicants. The President could only be removed from office for misbehaviour or incompetence, or if they obtained other full-time employment. Part-time members could be removed for any reason.Section 103 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) ==Jurisdiction== The tribunal performed merit reviews of government administrative decisions. In other words, the tribunal would review a decision based on how a government official should have made the decision. This is in contrast to a judicial review where a judge or a court would decide whether the decision was made lawfully. There was also no fees for filing an application in the tribunal.Ombudsman Report p 11 As a result, the tribunal had an important function in making government more “open and accountable” by providing an opportunity for affected people to challenge decisions. The tribunal had jurisdiction to hear appeals concerning Community Welfare matters.,Section 93 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) the Adoption Information Act 1990.,section 36 of the Adoption Information Act 1990 the Adoption of Children Act 1965,Section 67A, Adoption of Children Act 1990 and the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987,Section 112 Children(Care and Protection) Act 1987 Disability Services and Guardianship Act 1987 Section 97 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) and Home Care Service, Act 1988.Section 17A Home Care Service, Act 1988 Applications could be made by persons with a “genuine concern”. The tribunal took the view that any person directly affected by a decision, or a third party who wished to bring proceedings in the public interest, could bring a case in the tribunal. The concern had to be a concern greater than an ordinary member of the public. The tribunal would also exclude people if it considered that they were “unjustifiably interfering” with a decision. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and its purpose is to protect the public. The object is not punitive and the Tribunal is not there to punish the physiotherapist but is there to maintain proper standards in the profession.Austii Website. http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWPYT/2007/1.html at paragraph 21 ==At the hearing== The tribunal was required to have between three and five members present when hearing a case. At least one of the members had to be a barrister or a solicitor.Section 95 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) As far as possible, at least one of the members had to have some expertise in the area of the case before the tribunal. The presiding member on the case was the President, or if the President was not present, the Deputy President, or a member nominated by the President. The tribunal could make rules about the procedure to be followed in the tribunal. Additionally, the tribunal could determine any additional points of tribunal as necessary. When the tribunal was first established, the intention was to make it accessible to the general public who might be intimidated by the normal legal processes of a court. The tribunal as a result strived to be informal in its procedures. However, there was still some legalistic aspects of its procedures, and parties would engage lawyers and expert witnesses to appear in the tribunal. Decisions of the tribunal were to be determined by a majority of the votes of the members. However, any point of law was to be determined by the member who was either a barrister or a solicitor. Where the votes were tied, the presiding member had the casting vote.Section 98 Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW) Selected decisions are available on the internet at Austlii.Austlii Website http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/csat/ ==ReferencesSources== * Report 90.

He was educated at Eton and later Christ Church, Oxford. ==Political career== Llewellyn was High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1878 and Mayor of Swansea in 1891. In March 1888, Llewelyn contested the Gower by-election as a Conservative candidate. The Liberal ranks had been affected by divisions over the choice of candidate and Llewelyn ran a strong campaign. Unusually for a Conservative candidate he held meetings in nonconformist chapels, including one at Zoar, Ystalyfera which was said to have been well attended by the working men of the district. Llewelyn polled well although narrowly defeated by David Randell. In 1889 he was elected as one of the first members of Glamorgan County Council and was immediately made an alderman, to which role he was re-elected in 1895. He was created a baronet, 'of Penllergaer in Llangyfelach and of Ynys-y-gerwn in Cadoxton juxta Neath both in the County of Glamorgan', on 20 March 1890. In 1892, following the death of his uncle, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, Llewelyn was adopted as Conservative candidate for the Swansea Town constituency but was defeated by R.D. Burnie. However he reversed the result three years later when he was elected Conservative MP for Swansea in the 1895 general election, but lost the seat in 1900. Llewellyn's connections to sport included the position of captain of the South Wales Cricket Club and in 1885 he replaced the Earl of Jersey as the president of the Welsh Rugby Union; a post he would hold until 1906, when he was replaced by Horace Lyne. Lyne himself stated that 'they (WRU) had been singularly fortunate in getting a gentleman like Mr J.T.D. Llewellyn to act in that captaincy'.Smith (1980), pg 48. ==Family== Llewellyn married in 1861 Caroline Julia, daughter of Sir Michael Hicks Beach, 8th Baronet. Their younger and only surviving son Charles married the heiress of the Venables family and adopted the additional surname Venables. He became MP for Radnorshire and High Sheriff of that county. His eldest son, the cricketer Willie Llewelyn, committed suicide in August 1893. ==Later life and death== Llewellyn died in 1927 aged 91 and was buried with his wife and next to his father in St David's Church in Penllergaer. ==Legacy== Dillwyn Llewellyn Community School in Cockett, Swansea, was named for him – this was amalgamated with Dynevor School in 2001 to become Dylan Thomas Community School ==See also== *Spy Cartoon Vanity Fair ==Bibliography== * ==References External links == * Category:1836 births Category:1927 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:UK MPs 1895–1900 Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:People from Swansea Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Wales Rugby Union officials Category:High Sheriffs of Glamorgan Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Swansea constituencies Category:Directors of the Great Western Railway Category:Members of Glamorgan County Council Category:Mayors of Swansea ","title":"Sir John Dillwyn-Llewellyn, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"20235812","text":"John Murtagh Macrossan (12 March 1930 – 5 August 2008) was Queensland’s 16th Chief Justice and the third person from the Macrossan family to occupy that position. He was also a distinguished barrister, chancellor and judge. His grandfather John Murtagh Macrossan was Colonial Secretary for Queensland, his two uncles Hugh Denis Macrossan and Neal William Macrossan were also Chief Justice of Queensland. ==Early years== Macrossan was born on 12 March 1930 to Vincent and Dorothy Macrossan (née Brown). He was named after his grandfather of the same name who was member of the Queensland Parliament. He was educated at St Columban’s College in Brisbane by the Christian Brothers. After high school, he went on to study at the University of Queensland where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a LLB. His mother is said to have wanted Macrossan to be a doctor whilst his father wanted him to be solicitor like himself. It was said that Macrossan was widely read, elegantly dressed and immaculately mannered. ==Professional life== He was admitted to the Queensland Bar in 1951 but appeared in Court only once before going to the University of Oxford. It was at this appearance where he announced appearing for the wrong party. He attended Exeter College and obtained a Bachelor of Civil Laws. He returned to Queensland in 1954 to resume his career at the Bar. He shared chambers with James Archibald Douglas. He took Silk in 1967. He became the Queensland Government’s favoured senior counsel in industrial cases against the Australian Government. He was fortunate to have the privilege of appearing in the Privy Council. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Queensland as a judge in 1980. His appointment was merited. His courtesy on the bench is said to have been \\"legendary\\" and he never seemed to lose his temper. Macrossan was deputy chancellor of Griffith University from 1985. In 1988 he was appointed chancellor and continued as chancellor until 2000. He was made an honorary doctor of the university in 2001. In 1989 he was appointed Chief Justice of Queensland following the retirement of Sir Dormer Andrews. Whilst he was not the most senior judge at the time, Justices Kelly and Connolly were near retirement, and were happy for Macrossan’s elevation. In 1991 the Queensland Government created a separate Court of Appeal with a President. The court was created with opposition from the Supreme Court and without consultation of the Queensland legal profession. Macrossan was opposed to this course as a similar Court of Appeal set up in New South Wales led to many years of bitter feelings as judges' seniority was interfered with. The legislation setting up this court also removed some of the chief justice’s jurisdiction over that court. The work, which the new court performed, was work which the Supreme Court sitting as a Full Court traditionally undertook. Macrossan sustained a discreet battle with the Government to rectify this, which finally occurred in 1997 after the election of a new Government. Macrossan is said to have seen this as his most significant achievement. Another reform achieved was the termination of the creation of new Queens Counsel. Instead of the Crown appointing the leaders of the Queensland Bar, senior practitioners would be recognised by the title of Senior Counsel. In 1993 he was made a Companion in the Order of Australia (AC) in recognition of his services to law, education and the arts. In the same year he awarded honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Queensland. He was to be knighted in the 1990 New Years Honours List, but the new Queensland State Government blocked this. He was President of the Queensland Art Gallery Society from 1978 to 1982 and was Deputy Chancellor of Griffith University from 1985. He was Chancellor of that University from 1988 to 2000. He was also involved with the Churchill Trust. In 1997 he opposed the establishment of a Supreme Court in Cairns as he felt that there was a greater need in Brisbane for a new judge. He retired in 1998 two years before the statutory retirement age for judges.\\"Wind of change hits bench. \\"OBERHARDT MARK. 14 February 1998. Courier Mail At Macrossan’s retirement ceremony, he said that courts \\"must always be open to new ideas but not be driven by every wind that blows\\" and that the community expected stability from the judiciary. In 2001 he was made an honorary doctor of Griffith University in recognition for his service to the University. He married Margery Newton in 1961. Their son Mark is a barrister and playwright.

It is not certain whether the list is complete. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\\" - style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" !

He counted 40 banners on the right flank of the Polish–Lithuanian forces, 10 flying the Columns of Gediminas and 30 flying the Vytis. The flags varied in the colors of the background, horse and its harness. Długosz listed 18 lands that supplied the banners: Trakai, Vilnius, Hrodna, Kaunas, Lida, Medininkai (Varniai?), Smolensk, Polotsk, Vitebsk, Kiev, Pinsk, Navahrudak, Brest, Vawkavysk, Drohiczyn, Mielnik, Kremenets, Starodub. One land might have supplied more than one banner as evidenced by Smolensk which provided three banners. That is all information currently available from contemporary sources. However, it is unclear how complete or accurate Długosz's information is. Historians pointed out several notable absences from the list, including the banners from Volhynia (Lutsk and Volodymyr-Volynskyi) as well as Samogitia. It is unclear whether Medininkai mentioned by Długosz referred to Varniai in Samogitia or to Medininkai Castle near Vilnius. The absence of Samogitian forces could be explained by a diversionary maneuver: according to 27 June 1410 report from Königsberg, a Lithuanian force was attacking Skalva. Other historians argued that the Medininkai banner represented at least seven Samogitian banners based on the seven regions mentioned in the Treaty of Königsberg (1390). Długosz's list is also missing three banners from Moldavia and a Tatar contingent known from German sources. Historians stipulate that in addition to banners from territories there should have been banners presented by nobles, but Długosz mentioned only Sigismund Korybut whose banner he counted with Polish forces. Some Belarusian historians attempted to divide the 40 banners by nationality to Lithuanian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian banners. However, such analysis is fundamentally flawed as it is impossible to determine how many banners each territory provided, how many men were in each banner, or what was the ethnic composition in each land. For example, Smolensk had rebelled against Vytautas in 1404 and 1408 and therefore it is unlikely that the three Smolensk banners included just local soldiers. Historians express skepticism over the lack of heraldic diversity. Heraldic symbols of various lands, including of Trakai, Kiev and Navahrudak, are known from contemporary sources, to have included the great seal of Vytautas. Historians suggest that perhaps the two heraldic flags represented gonfalons, e.g. the 10 banners of Columns of Gediminas represented forces from domains of Grand Duke Vytautas and the 30 banners of Vytis represented different territories. == References == * Sven Ekdahl Die \\"Banderia Prutenorum\\" des Jan Długosz: Eine Quelle zur Schlacht bei Tannenberg 1410 : Unters. zu Aufbau, Entstehung u.

The Rules of Management of the State of Manipur, enforced on 14 September 1935, empowered the Maharaja to appoint the members of the Durbar, while a British officer acted as the president of the Durbar. After independence, for a brief period, the Manipur State Constituent Act 1947 provided for the formation of a Manipur State Appointment Board to be the \\"final authority\\" in all matters of appointments and promotions. The Chief Commissioner: Following merger into the Indian Union on 15 October 1949, Manipur became a centrally administered area, and remained so till 31 October 1956. During this period, the Chief Commissioner appointed the functionaries of Manipur, subject to the control of the Central Government. Territorial Council: Manipur became a Union Territory under the States’ Re-Organisation Act 1956 and Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956. Under the Territorial Council Act 1956 Manipur was allowed to constitute the Territorial Council with limited administrative powers over transferred subjects and appointment of officials thereto. The Chief Commissioner, however, continued to function as the Chief appointing authority of the territory. Subsequently, the Territorial Council was abolished, and Manipur was placed under the Chief Commissioner from 11 May 1963 onwards with a Territorial Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers to assist him. Manipur attained statehood on 21 January 1972 under the North- East Area (Re-organisation) Act 1971. Manipur Public Service Commission: Under Article 315(4) of the Constitution, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) agreed to function as the Public Service Commission of the State of Manipur till 21 October 1972. On 3 October 1972 the Governor of Manipur issued the order of constitution of the Manipur Public Service Commission under Article 318 with one Chairman and two Members. Shri B.K. Nehru, Governor of Manipur inaugurated the office of the Manipur Public Service Commission at a glittering function on 23 October 1972 at the Gandhi Memorial Hall, Imphal. Chief Minister, Shri Alimuddin presided over the function. The Pioneering Brains: Shri G.B.K. Hooja MA, IAS was the inaugural Chairman of the Commission, while Shri Laishram Gopal Singh BA(Hon.), IPS and Shri Sibo Larho BA were the premiere members. Shri Karam Gourakishore Singh was the first Secretary of the Manipur Public Service Commission. The Commission was housed in the Old Secretariat Building Complex for almost nine years; it was later shifted to the present location in January, 1981. Over the years, Manipur Public Service Commission have grown in stature with a senior IAS officer as the Secretary and an adequate number of officers and ancillary staff. == Functions of the Manipur Public Service Commission == Article 320 of the Constitution of India lays down the functions of the State Public Service Commission. The functions of the State Public Service Commission are : *It is the duty of the State Public Service Commission to conduct examinations for appointment to the services of the state. *The State Public Service Commission will be consulted by the State Government on the following issues. **on all matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and civil posts; **on the principles to be followed while making appointments, promotions and transfers to civil services and posts; **on all disciplinary matters of a person serving the Government of a state in a civil capacity, including memorials or petitions relating to such matters; **on any claim by a person, who is serving or has served the Government in a civil capacity that any cost, incurred by him in defending legal proceedings instituted against him in respect of acts done or purporting to have been done in the execution of his duty, shall be paid out of the consolidated fund of the state; **on any claim for the award of a pension in respect of injuries sustained by a person while serving under the Government in a civil capacity and any question as to the amount of any such award. The State Public Service Commission functions as an advisory body.

The play was Houghton's first professional full-length play which was written in 1908. Its first title was The Unemployed, but this was changed to avoid confusion with a one-act play with a similar title. It was chosen by Annie Horniman to open the second season at the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester, on 30 August 1909. It was an immediate success and was chosen to open the next two seasons, and it was published in 1911. It was broadcast by Granada Television in 1960. Otherwise the play remained unknown until it was \\"discovered\\" in the British Library by Chris Honer, artistic director of the Library Theatre, Manchester. It was decided to produce the play at the Library Theatre in 2008 to celebrate the centenary of the Gaiety Theatre. ==Plot== The play is set in the fictional town of Salchester (an amalgam of Salford and Manchester) in the 1900s. John and Sidney Forsyth have returned early from their honeymoon to John’s home where his parents, Edgar and Mrs Forsyth are surprised to see them. Jane the maid prepares a room for them, and Samuel Ritchie, a family friend and owner of a business retailing cars, visits for dinner. Edgar is a rich man, living on his investments and spending much time with friends in the club. One of his major investments has not been doing well recently but the other has been making up for it. John has been to university but has no specials skills, other than messing about with motor cars, and expects to become an MP. His courtship with Sidney had been only for three months and during that time he had not discovered that her political opinions were very different from his; he is a Conservative; she is a left-wing suffragette. They argue, and she is determined to have a life of her own, despite John’s strong objections. A year later, Edgar’s other investment has failed and he is a ruined man. Ritchie offers to help, but is rebuffed and vows never to enter the house again. Jane announces that she has been left a bequest of £20,000 from an uncle in Australia, and leaves her job. Three months later, despite Edgar’s desperate attempts to speculate, the house and its contents are up for sale. Jane appears, dressed in her finery. Edgar returns from the pub, drunk and argues with everyone. Ritchie calls in, says he has bought the house and offers Sidney a job as a shorthand typist, which she accepts. When John hears of this he forbids her to take up the job, but Sidney insists and she and John separate. Meanwhile, Edgar has collapsed and died. A further three months pass, Sidney is working for Ritchie and living in Jane’s house. John and his mother are in lodgings. John has been trying for months to get a job, without success. He goes to Ritchie, who gives him a job as a car salesman; then discovers that Sidney is also working there and is furious. Jane appears to buy a car. Sidney announces that she is pregnant; she and John are reconciled to return to live together and to both work for Ritchie. ==References== Category:English plays Category:1909 plays ","title":"Independent Means"},{"id":"20235903","text":"The Kokemeren 2 Hydro Power Plant is a future hydro power project in Kokemeren, Kyrgyzstan.

He encouraged the rediscovery of English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly Henry Purcell's music and English virginal music. He also propounded the notion of an English Musical Renaissance in the second half of the 19th century, particularly praising Charles Villiers Stanford and Hubert Parry. Fuller Maitland was criticised for his failure to acknowledge the talents of the English composers Arthur Sullivan, Edward Elgar and Frederick Delius, and later it was shown that he had falsified the facts in a critique of Sullivan. He was also slow to recognise the worth of contemporary composers from mainland Europe such as Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss. ==Biography== Fuller Maitland was born at 90 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, the son of John Fuller Maitland and his wife Marianne (née Noble). He attended Westminster School for three terms, but for most of his childhood he was educated privately, including musical instruction. Starting in 1875, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was active in the Cambridge University Musical Society. There he became friends with Charles Villiers Stanford and William Barclay Squire, whose sister Charlotte he married in 1885. He had intended to follow a career in the Church of England but decided to instead to pursue a career in music.Obituary, The Times, 31 March 1936, p. 11 After leaving Cambridge he studied the piano with Edward Dannreuther and other aspects of music with W. S. Rockstro, who encouraged him to explore early polyphonic music. Music journalism Fuller Maitland became a musical journalist, as a critic for the Pall Mall Gazette from 1882, later for The Guardian (1884–89) and The Times (1889–1911). He also wrote many entries for Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians and was appointed editor of the second edition. A later editor of the Dictionary wrote of him, \\"In particular, he added an important and substantial series of articles on medieval liturgical subjects … [he] was quite traditional in his own interests: he wrote a great deal on Bach and on the more conservative German music of the 19th century, and, as an active editor of the earlier music of his own country – the complete Purcell edition, English virginal music, and (again a child of his times) English folksong – he was in the mainstream of the scholarly activity of his day.\\"Sadie, Stanley, \\"The New Grove, Second Edition\\", Notes, Volume 57, Number 1, September 2000, pp. 11–20 More than a hundred of his articles survive, in revised form, in the online version of Grove available in 2010.List of authors, Grove Music Online, accessed 2 November 2010 In pioneering the revival of the virginals, Fuller Maitland published an edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (1894–99). He was a member of the editorial committee of the Purcell Society, for which he edited several of Purcell's works. With his relative Lucy Broadwood, he edited the collection English County Songs (1893), and he was on the original committee of the Folk Song Society, founded in 1898.F. Kidson, s. v. \\"Folk Song Society\\", Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, II (1906), 70. (Online transcription) Reputation as a critic At a time when music lovers generally admired either Richard Wagner or Johannes Brahms but not both, Fuller Maitland, according to the obituary notice in The Times, \\"worshipped\\" both Wagner and Brahms. As regards English music, he was the principal exponent of the doctrine that music had long been moribund in England until the second half of the 19th century when, he maintained, it experienced a renaissance led by his favoured composers. His book English Music in the XIXth Century is subdivided into two parts: \\"Book I: Before the Renaissance (1801–1850)\\", and \\"Book II: The Renaissance (1851–1900)\\". He used the phrase \\"English music\\" to include that of the Irish Stanford, whom, together with Hubert Parry, Fuller Maitland regarded as leading the \\"English musical renaissance\\". Stanford and Parry were both upper-middle-class Oxbridge graduates, like Fuller Maitland, and both were professors at music colleges. The writer Meirion Hughes describes Fuller Maitland's world as one of insiders and outsiders.McHale, Maria. Review: The English Musical Renaissance and the Press 1850–1914: Watchmen of Music by Meirion Hughes, Music and Letters (2003) Vol 84 (3): pp. 507–09. Fuller Maitland rejected British composers who did not conform to his template. \\"Sullivan's frequent forays into what was viewed as the questionable realm of operetta removed him from the equation at once. Elgar was never a contender, with his unacademic, lower-middle-class background coupled with progressive tendencies, while \\"Fritz\\" Delius was simply not English enough.\\" The same writer suggests that Fuller Maitland's aversion to Sir Frederic Cowen was due to anti-Semitism. Fuller Maitland's integrity as a critic came under scrutiny, notably by Elgar in a lecture in 1905. Fuller Maitland had published a denigrating obituary of Sullivan in the Cornhill Magazine,Fuller Maitland, J. A. , \\"Sir Arthur Sullivan\\", Cornhill Magazine, March 1901, pp. 300–09 which Elgar alluded to as \\"the shady side of musical criticism … this foul, unforgettable episode.\\"Moore, p. 479 Later, it was shown that Fuller Maitland had falsified the facts, inventing a banal lyric, passing it off as genuine and condemning Sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity.Burton, Nigel. \\"Sullivan Reassessed: See How the Fates\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 141, No. 1873 (Winter, 2000), pp. 15–22 Later years Fuller Maitland gave up journalism in 1911, retiring to Borwick Hall near Carnforth in Lancashire. He continued to write books, including an autobiography, A Door-Keeper of Music (1929), in which he admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss Sullivan's comic operas as \\"ephemeral\\".\\"Light Opera\\", The Times, 22 September 1934, p. 10 His aversion to modern music abated in his later years, and he recognised the importance of composers such as Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy.Dibble, Jeremy. \\"Fuller Maitland, J.A.\\" Grove Music Online.

The son of Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, Lord Howe's flag captain at the Glorious First of June, Lucius served during the Napoleonic Wars and was heavily involved in the Mauritius campaign of 1810. During this campaign, Curtis commanded the frigate HMS Magicienne with the blockade squadron under Josias Rowley and was still in command when the ship was destroyed at the Battle of Grand Port. Magicienne grounded on a coral reef early in the engagement and despite the best efforts of Curtis and his crew, the ship had to be abandoned, Curtis setting her on fire to prevent her subsequent capture. After Curtis was freed from captivity in December 1810, he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the loss of his ship and returned to his naval career. He later rose to become an Admiral of the Fleet. As his eldest son predeceased him, the baronetcy in 1869 passed to his second son, Arthur. ==Early career== 'The Admiral Sir Lucius Curtis' pub on Canute Road, Southampton. Born the second son of Captain Roger Curtis and his wife Jane Sarah Brady, Curtis joined the Royal Navy in June 1795, by which time his father was an admiral and a senior but controversial figure in the Admiralty. He was appointed to the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte in the Channel Squadron and then, having been promoted to midshipman, transferred to the second-rate HMS Prince also in the Channel Squadron in August 1798.Heathcote, p. 64 Promoted to lieutenant on 11 August 1801, he joined the third-rate HMS Lancaster, flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station, later that month. In 1802, Curtis' elder brother, also named Roger, died suddenly in naval service: as the remaining son, Curtis received strong patronage due to his family links. He transferred to the third-rate HMS Excellent in September 1803 and, having been promoted to commander on 16 November 1804, became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Jalouse in the Mediterranean Fleet later that month and then commanding officer of the sloop HMS Rose in June 1805. Promoted to post-captain on 22 January 1806, Curtis took command of the frigate HMS Magicienne, with orders to operate in the Indian Ocean as part of the squadron attempting to blockade the French held islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France (now Mauritius). Arriving during hurricane season in December 1809, Curtis had an immediate impact, sighting, chasing and capturing the East Indiaman Windham, previously captured by the French Commodore Jacques Hamelin at the Action of 18 November 1809.James, p. 203 The Southampton Docks foundation & commemorative plaque situated just inside Dock Gate 4. Sir Lucius Curtis laid the original foundation stone on 12 October 1838 In 1810, Magicienne remained off the islands, participating in the Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and subsequently supporting Captain Samuel Pym off Grand Port. Pym was intending to blockade the harbour to French shipping, but when a squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré arrived off the port on 20 August, Pym sought to lure them into coastal waters and engage them. Duperré successfully broke through Pym's ships however, and took shelter within the harbour. Pym gathered his frigates together and sailed directly into the harbour on 22 August to engage the French. Lacking harbour pilots, Pym's HMS Sirius, Henry Lambert's HMS Iphigenia and Magicienne were soon aground on the coral reefs that sheltered the bay, and the remaining British ship, Nesbit Willoughby's HMS Nereide, was forced to surrender by the French frigates in the port. Of the grounded ships, only Iphigenia sailed again, captured by Hamelin five days later. Sirius and Magicienne were burnt, their crews taking shelter on the tiny Île de la Passe. Without food or fresh water, the sailors were forced to surrender to Hamelin when he arrived and were held prisoner until Isle de France was captured by a British expeditionary force four months later.James, p. 281-295 Curtis was completely exonerated at the court martial convened to investigate the loss of his ship, given command of the newly re-captured fifth-rate HMS Iphigenia in January 1812 and given command of the fifth-rate HMS Madagsacar in February 1813.Heathcote, p. 65 He continued to rise in the navy, being appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815 and inheriting his father's baronetcy in November 1816. He also became a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire on 17 March 1817. ==Senior command== Promoted to rear-admiral on 28 June 1838, Curtis became Admiral Superintendent of Malta Dockyard, with his flag in the fifth-rate HMS Bombay, in March 1843. He was promoted to vice admiral on 15 September 1849 and to full admiral on 9 July 1855 and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 9 November 1862. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 11 January 1864. Curtis was an eminent freemason, serving as Provincial Grand Master for the Province of Hampshire from 1840 until his death. He died at his home at the foot of Portsdown Hill in Hampshire on 14 January 1869. His eldest son had predeceased him, and the baronetcy he had inherited passed to his second son Arthur. ==Family== In June 1811 Curtis married Mary Greetham; they had three daughters and four sons. ==Notes== Roger Curtis had been flag captain to Lord Howe at the Glorious First of June, and became closely associated with the perceived injustices in the distribution of awards in the aftermath of the battle. Curtis further infuriated some of his fellow officers by acting as prosecutor at the court-martial in which Anthony Molloy was criticised for his conduct during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. Molloy was effectively forced out of the Navy and Roger Curtis attracted a significant amount of criticism, especially from Cuthbert Collingwood, who took a personal dislike to him. ==See also== * ==ReferencesSources== * * - Category:1786 births Category:1869 deaths Category:Royal Navy admirals of the fleet Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Hampshire ","title":"Lucius Curtis"},{"id":"20235924","text":"Sello John Mametsa (born 10 March 1981 in Polokwane) is a South African rugby union player, the first black South African to have appeared in 100 Currie Cup games.\\"Blue Bulls star arrested, injured after brawl.\\" Cape Argus October 20, 2008.

It purports to also keep carbonation in the can, though that is disputed. The product is currently marketed by Telebrands, one of the leading direct-response marketing companies. == Background and \\"Snap Capp\\" == An early caddie of Snap Capps U.S. Army caps Originally named the Snap Capp, the product was invented in Medford, Oregon by David Gran and Carl Stufflet (a heating and air-conditioning service manager), who became frustrated over repeatedly spilling his beer during a Disc golf competition. While camping later that day, Mr. Stufflet took out a knife and cut off the top of his plastic Pepsi bottle and melted it onto his can with a lighter, thereby creating the first Snap Capp. The caps were one of the first PET plastics (polyethylene terephthalate) to ever be injection molded, and the first prototype was done by a company located out of Hemet, California named Ramko Manufacturing. Because of the extreme heating and cooling in the process, the molds were made with Beryllium inserts. pp. 2-4 The exclusive rights to market the caps were obtained by Allen Vallarta Wholesale, LLC in the summer of 2007, a company led by Bill Allen, a former Coca-Cola manager. Under Mr. Allen's directions, a handful of front line wholesalers such as Jeff Hammers, Steve Farrell, and Bill Banta took the product to thousands of stores, such as Walgreens, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Pilot Travel Centers. In the fall of 2008, the U.S. Army purchased 150,000 \\"Army Strong\\" logoed caps for their recruiters to use as a promotional tool, which gave the new product serious validity as a strong new product line. By early 2009, Allen Vallarta Wholesale was one of 50 U.S. companies to be invited to a prestigious Department of Commerce Trade Winds Forum in Warsaw, Poland, which Mr. Allen attended with his attorney, Eric Kaufman, and met with senior representatives of several European countries. == Telebrands takeover == By the summer of 2009, Snap Capps were becoming so popular that Telebrands, arguably the largest \\"as seen on TV\\" company in America took notice. By this time, over 5 million units had already been sold in less than two years out. Over a series of meetings and negotiations, including a meeting at 3:30 in the morning in southern Oregon with Mr. Allen and Telebrands' VP of new products, Raj Shahani, an agreement was made for Telebrands to take over marketing of the product and they renamed it \\"Bottle Tops\\" thereafter. == References  External links == * Snap Capp official website * Telebrands official website Category:Bottles ","title":"Bottle Tops"},{"id":"20235974","text":"Détraigne in 2015 Yves Détraigne (born 21 December 1954 in Reims, Marne) is a French politician and a member of the Senate of France.

In short, Postman meant to indicate the relationship between a piece of information and what action, if any, a consumer of that information might reasonably be expected to take once learning it. In a speech to the German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik) on October 11, 1990 in Stuttgart, sponsored by IBM-Germany, Neil Postman said the following: \\"The tie between information and action has been severed. Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it.\\" In Amusing Ourselves to Death Postman frames the information-action ratio in the context of the telegraph's invention. Prior to the telegraph, Postman says people received information relevant to their lives, creating a high correlation between information and action: \\"The information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives” (p. 69). The telegraph allowed bits of information to travel long distances, and so Postman claims \\"the local and the timeless ... lost their central position in newspapers, eclipsed by the dazzle of distance and speed ... Wars, crimes, crashes, fires, floods—much of it the social and political equivalent of Adelaide's whooping coughs—became the content of what people called 'the news of the day'\\" (pp. 66–67). A high information-action ratio, therefore, refers to the helplessness people confront when faced with decontextualized information. Someone may know Adelaide has the whooping cough, but what could anyone do about it? Postman said that this kind of access to decontextualized information \\"made the relationship between information and action both abstract and remote.\\" Information consumers were \\"faced with the problem of a diminished social and political potency.\\" == Cultural references == The term was referenced in Arctic Monkeys' song \\"Four Out of Five\\" off the band's 2018 album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, where the Information Action Ratio is the name of a fictional taqueria on the moon. == See also == *Information overload == References  External links == *The Neil Postman Information Page Category:Information theory Category:1990 introductions ","title":"Information–action ratio"},{"id":"20236085","text":"Mari Beyleryan (; 1877, Constantinople - 1915) was an Armenian feminist activist, writer and public figure and a victim of the Armenian Genocide. == Biography == She finished the Esayan college of Constantinople, then studied at the studio of Bera.

Facing arrest for her participation in the 1895 Bab Ali demonstrations, Beyleryan was forced to flee to Egypt from her native Constantinople. During her time in Alexandria she taught at a local Armenian school and between 1902 and 1903 she published the Artemis, an Armenian women's journal. Beyleryan accepted submissions not only from famous writers but from Armenian women throughout the diaspora. She was especially interested in the role Armenian women would play in the development of national identity. Editorals authored by Beyleryan explored several women's rights themes, including motherhood. She believed women's education and employment were central to Armenian national development. Beyleryan returned to Constantinople only after the Ottoman Constitution of 1908 was put in place following the Young Turk Revolution.

Focusing on the People's Vigilance Committee for Human Rights (PVCHR), a member-based human rights movement in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, the paper aims to tell the unique story of PVCHR's work to combat custodial torture through an innovative method called \\"testimonial therapy.\\" The testimonial therapy process is aimed at producing both legal testimony and cathartic release of suffering among torture survivors. In underscoring the importance of attention to narrative practices, the paper, while not overlooking narrative's risks, focuses on the practical opportunities that narrative practices create for peace builders. *Book on anti-caste work of TBM, BAMCEF, and PVCHR written by Jeremy Rinker, Ph.D : Elaborating the significance of each of these organizations, Rinker writes that as \\"the vanguard of turning all of India into Buddhists\\" the TBM activists promote Ambedkar Buddhist identity among Dalits, seeing this as the first step towards re-establishing Buddhism in postcolonial India. In contrast, the author points out that PVCHR stands for a range of civil rights in the localities it serves. Rinker notes that PVCHR was founded by \\"an educated upper-caste Kshatriya,\\" Dr. Lenin Raghuvanshi, and his wife, Shruti Nagvanshi. For the author this has its own advantages. That is, \\"a high caste working for the low-caste rights places him [Lenin Raghuvanshi] in a socially complicated position with both elites and the less fortunate downtrodden.\\" In fact, for Rinker PVCHR is a \\"neo-Dalit movement,\\" although he does not explain what he means by neo-Dalit vis-a-vis the category Dalit (which means \\"oppressed\\" or \\"broken\\"). Even as PVCHR functions as a \\"neo-Dalit\\" organization, it has an inclusive focus by working with communities that are \\"Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims, and other excluded segments of the Indian population.\\" Cultural, religious, and historical aspects and identities are not part of PVCHR's agenda, the author explains. In Rinker's analysis, the BAMCEF, in divergence to TBM and PVCHR, stands for \\"Phule-Ambedkarite ideology.\\" That is, BAMCEF aims to combine the thoughts and practices of anticaste leaders from Maharashtra, those of Jotirao Phule (1827-1890) and Ambedkar (1890-1956), to spread their relevance in the all-India political transformation. *Testimonial therapy. A pilot project to improve psychological well-being among survivors of torture in India published at Torture Journal: Although this small pilot study without control groups or prior validation of the questionnaire does not provide high-ranking quantitative evidence or statistically significant results for the effectiveness of our version of the testimonial method, we do find it likely that it helps improve the well being in survivors of torture in this particular context. However, a more extensive study is needed to verify these results, and better measures of ICF activities and participation (A and P) functions should be used. Interviews with human rights activists reveal that it is easier for survivors who have gone through testimonial therapy to give coherent legal testimony.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40908122_Testimonial_therapy_A_pilot_project_to_improve_psychological_wellbeing_among_survivors_of_torture_in_India *Testimonial Therapy: Impact on social participation and emotional wellbeing among Indian survivors of torture and organized violence: Traumatizing events, such as torture, cause considerable impairments in psycho-social functioning. In developing countries, where torture is often perpetrated, few resources exist for the provision of therapeutic or rehabilitating interventions. The current study investigated the effectiveness of Testimonial Therapy (TT) as a brief psycho-social intervention to ameliorate the distress of Indian survivors of torture and related violence.https://irct.org/assets/uploads/1018-8185_2015-2_22-33.pdf *From Hunger Deaths to Healthy Living:A Case Study of Dalits in Varanasi District, Uttar Pradesh, India: The success story presented in the article provides insight to learn and theorize working models of Dalit empowerment and checking caste-based discrimination. * Conscientisation of Untouchables in Indian Society: The practice of untouchability, though constitutionally outlawed, has been deeply ingrained in the socio-cultural contours of India. It has its roots in the caste system, a traditional form of apartheid, which is still widely prevalent in various spheres of Indian social life. ‘Dalits’ who are at the lowest rung of caste hierarchy, have been typically experiencing discrimination and social exclusion in myriad of ways. Some expressions of untouchability are – the Dalits are invariably having thatched houses at the periphery of the village; their infants did not receive immunization, their children did not get supplementary nutrition, as upper-caste healthcare functionaries do not touch Dalits to maintain their ‘purity’; and children were denied enrolment in schools. There is no dearth of pro-poor programmes, but their benefits hardly reached the impoverished Dalits. Located at the villages of Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India, Dalit inhabitants for generations together have been living in deplorable conditions. People’s Vigilance Committee on Human Rights (PVCHR), an NGO, worked extensively in these villages for several years. As both upper-caste perpetrators and Dalit- victims had internalised their respective superior-inferior status as part of their identity since early childhood, breaking the psychological barriers was the most difficult challenge. With the framework of rights based approach, awareness generation, reflection and conscientisation were the strategies used to deal with intra-psychic barriers. The paper highlights the process of mobilization of the Dalits to voice their concerns, fight for justice and pave way to their own empowerment and to build an egalitarian and just social order. *Margin to Center stage: Empowering Dalits in India: This book is an attempt to fulfill a widely felt need for documenting the process of empowerment of marginalized and oppressed groups and communities at the grassroots. It has traced and recorded consistent and rigorous efforts of a group of individuals who have brought positive change in the lives of disadvantaged and downtrodden people. Located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, this book sketches the plight, struggle for survival, and fight for decent living, dignity and rights among the downtrodden and marginalized Dalits who learnt to raise their voice against the injustice and tyranny. It highlights the efforts for an egalitarian social order by people who ordinarily are resource-less and powerless. ==ReferencesLegal Holder of PVCHR * Blog of the PVCHR * Film about the history and the work of PVCHR * Podcast on anti-caste work of PVCHR * Congratulation message of Indo-German Society,Remschied,Germany on 25th Anniversary of PVCHR foundation * Collaboration between PVCHR and DIG,Reschied,Germany Category:Organisations based in Uttar Pradesh Category:Human rights organisations based in India Category:Organizations established in 1996 ","title":"People's Vigilance Committee on Human Rights"},{"id":"20236116","text":"The Ķegums Hydro Power Plant is the oldest hydropower plant on the river Daugava and the third largest in Latvia located in Ķegums.

In 1828, O'Conor Don of Belanagar was a member of the Grand Panel of county Roscommon. At the time of Griffith's Valuation, Charles Owen O'Conor was one of the principal lessors in the parishes of Kilcorkey and Kilkeevin, barony of Castlereagh.  Charles O'Connor  Charles O'Conor, of Belanagare, was a scholar and antiquary who was born in 1710.Library Of Ireland - Charles O'Conor In 1754 he published a work on Irish mining, and in 1766 he published the work for which he is best known, Dissertations on the History of Ireland. O'Conor died at Belanagare on 1 July 1791, and his collection of manuscripts (containing the only then known original of the first part of the Annals of the Four Masters), passed into the hands of the Marquis of Buckingham. These were later purchased as part of the Stowe manuscript collection by Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham.  Bellanagare Castle and Hermitage House  Bellanagare Castle was the home of the O'Conor family, including the historian Charles O'Conor. He later built Hermitage House some distance away, and Bellanagare Castle fell into ruin. Hermitage House was built by Charles O'Conor circa 1760. It was a smaller Georgian house which he called his \\"Hermitage\\". At Hermitage House, he devoted the remainder of his life to the collection and study of Irish manuscripts, to the publication of dissertations, and to the cause of Irish and Catholic emancipation. He was a co-founder of the first Catholic Committee in 1757, (along with his friend Dr. John Curry and Mr. Wyse of Waterford). In 1788 he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy. His great great grandson Charles O'Conor was leasing the property at Ballaghcullia, valued at £10, to Honoria O'Conor at the time of Griffith's Valuation. In 1749 the Census of Elphin records Denis O'Conor as being of \\"Ballinagar\\".

It is located in Aizkraukle on the Daugava River. It has ten individual water turbines with an installed total capacity of 894 MW. The construction aroused an unusual wave of protest in 1958. Most Latvians opposed the flooding of historical sites and a particularly scenic gorge with rare plants and natural features, such as the Staburags, a cliff comparable in cultural significance to the Lorelei in Germany. The construction of the dam was endorsed in 1959, however, after the purge of relatively liberal and nationally oriented leaders under Eduards Berklavs and their replacement by Moscow-oriented, ideologically conservative cadres led by Arvīds Pelše. The plant was put into full operation in 1968. In 1991–2001, six additional turbines were added to the original four, thus increasing the capacity to 868.5MW. Reconstruction and overhaul of the units between 2007 and 2010 increased both the efficiency of the plant and its power output. The complex is operated by Latvenergo. ==References Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Latvia Category:Hydroelectric power stations built in the Soviet Union Category:Dams in Latvia Category:Dams completed in 1965 Category:Aizkraukle ","title":"Pļaviņas Hydroelectric Power Station"},{"id":"20236154","text":"Felice Pedroni (April 16, 1858 – July 22, 1910), known best to Americans by his Hispanicized alias Felix Pedro, was an Italian immigrant whose discovery of gold in Interior Alaska marked the beginning of the 1902 Fairbanks Gold Rush. ==Early life== Pedro was born April 16, 1858 to a family of subsistence farmers in the small village of Trignano administrated by Fanano. This village is in the Apennine Mountains into the Province of Modena. He was the youngest of six brothers. Pedroni fled home in 1881 following the death of his father. He arrived in New York City and quickly assumed the name Felix Pedro. He traveled to New York City, Ohio, Washington, British Columbia, and the Yukon, working in each place until he earned enough to travel again. Once in Alaska, Pedro panned for gold in the Fortymile, the Piledriver Slough near present-day Salcha, and various other waterways, including the \\"Lost Creek\\" in which Pedro and his partner Tom Gilmore claimed to have found a sizable amount of gold in 1898, but were forced to abandon due to food shortage. Despite marking the spot and searching the next three years for it they were unable to find it again. ==Gold== On August 26, 1901, prospector E. T. Barnette and Captain Charles W. Adams ran the steamer Lavelle Young aground up the Chena River which they mistakenly believed to be a distributary which would allow them to detour upstream from the unnavigable Bates Rapids to their intended destination in Tanacross. In accordance with their agreement, Barnette, his wife Isabelle, five hired hands, and 130 tons of supplies were unloaded onto the riverbank. The crew quickly built two log cabins and a series of tents, establishing a trading post named Chena City. Adams returned downstream, and Barnette had his first visitors only hours later. Pedro and Gilmore, still in search of the Lost Creek, were perched on a nearby slope and had seen the plumes of smoke from the departing steam-boat. They stumbled into the camp, bought supplies, and headed northward into the hills. At the request of James Wickersham the camp was renamed Fairbanks, after Senator Charles W. Fairbanks (R-Indiana), in March 1902. Pedro Creek in Tanana, Alaska. Felix Pedro's discovery of gold here in 1902 began the Alaskan gold rush. Felix Pedro discovered gold in the Tanana Hills northeast of Fairbanks on or about July 22, 1902 in a small unnamed stream (now known as \\"Pedro Creek\\") northeast of Fairbanks, prompting him to exclaim \\"There's gold in them there hills\\", and triggering a full-scale gold rush. Business was booming for Barnette, but he wanted more. He sent letters to Dawson City, which arrived in the dead of winter and were published in the Dawson Daily News January 3, 1903. This triggered an influx of over 1,000 more prospectors in temperatures. Fairbanks continued to grow, and by 1908 it was the largest city in Alaska. ==Death== Felix Pedro died July 22, 1910 at age 52 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Fairbanks, reportedly of a heart attack. However, this was disputed by his business partner Vincenzo Gambiani who denied that Pedro was suffering any heart problems, and suspected Pedro's widow Mary Doran of foul play. Years later on his own death bed, Gambiani was asked once again about the death of Pedro. Unable to speak, he wrote only two words (\\"wife-poison\\"). Pedro's body was embalmed and shipped to San Francisco and buried in nearby Colma. On October 12, 1972 Pedro's body was found, exhumed, and moved by Cortelloni Amato to Italy where an autopsy was performed, and the hair samples reportedly supported the conclusion that Pedroni was murdered. His remains were buried again in a small cemetery in Fanano. ==Legacy== In 1947 a Felix Pedro monument was erected at mile 16.1 of the Steese Highway near Pedro Creek. His original claim site, where the marker is located, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Pioneer Park in Fairbanks The Alaskaland park in mid-town Fairbanks was opened in 1967 to commemorate 100th anniversary of the Alaska purchase. However, on July 22, 2002, the presumed 100th anniversary of Pedro's gold discovery (noted in Alaska as \\"Felix Pedro Day\\"), the Alaskaland park was officially renamed Pioneer Park. Pioneer Park's annual Golden Days festival at Pioneer Park includes a Felix Pedro look-alike contest. Also on this date, Fairbanks and Fanano became sister cities. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *Felice Pedroni (Felix Pedro), an Italian immigrant into the Alaska gold rush (Italian language, some sections are in English language) * Category:1858 births Category:1910 deaths Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American gold prospectors Category:People from Fairbanks, Alaska Category:People from the Province of Modena ","title":"Felix Pedro"},{"id":"20236157","text":"Catherine Dumas (born 13 July 1957) is a French politician.

Its last assignment was with the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group, based at Salinas Army Air Base, California. The unit was inactivated on 31 March 1944. The squadron was the first dedicated Night Fighter Operational Training Squadron of the Air Force. The squadron trained newly activated night fighter squadrons who were deployed overseas into combat until its inactivation in March 1944 due to a re-alignment of training unit designations.Northrop P-61 Black Widow—The Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. ==History== The squadron was formed in October 1942 from elements of the 81st Fighter Squadron as part of the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) Fighter Command School at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. Its personnel being veteran American pilots trained by the Royal Air Force in night interception operations. It was initially equipped with three Douglas DB-7s and twenty-three Douglas P-70s. Shortages in operational flying aircraft, spare parts and other issues kept flying training very rudimentary for the squadrons first classes that graduated in December 1942. As 1943 progressed additional aircraft and equipment arrived and the program expanded. In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter began to arrive, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow and a few production P-61As. In January 1944 the entire program moved to Hammer Field, California and was placed under IV Fighter Command. The move placed the squadron near Northrop manufacturing facility at Hawthorne, California and most programmed P-61 squadrons were planned for operations in the Pacific and China Burma India Theaters. In March 1944 the 348th was disbanded when the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit during a reorganization of units in the United States. The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to Squadron A of the 450th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Night Fighter Replacement Training Unit).

He published his first book of poems, Լքուած քնար (Abandoned Lyre), in 1902, followed by two new volumes, Երկունք (Birth) and Նոր քնար (New Lyre), in 1906 and 1912, respectively. He was one of the first literary critics of contemporary Armenian poets like Misak Medzarents, Daniel Varujan and Siamanto. During the Armenian genocide, he stayed in Scutari (Üsküdar) on 24 April 1915. He was then arrested on 28 July 1915 and severely beaten at the Müdüriyet.

It was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Bushat, Hajmel, Shllak, Temal, Vau i Dejës, and Vig-Mnelë, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the town Vau i Dejës. The total population is 30,438 (2011 census), in a total area of 499.35 km2. The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 8,117. Vau i Dejës (or Vau Dejës or Vau- Dejës) also refers to the city center for the municipality, which is sometimes referred to as Laç or Laç-Vau i Dejës. Located in the northern region of Zadrima, Vau i Dejës is intersected by the Drin and Gjadër rivers. It is also strategically about 41 kilometres from the Adriatic Sea. Settlements in the area can be dated back to the 15th century, while the main city of Vau i Dejës was developed to house workers during the construction of the Vau i Dejës hydroelectric dam from 1971- 73. After the completion of the dam, families displaced from the floodwaters began to inhabit the city. Today Vau i Dejës is composed of 8 villages and a city center. The population in 2008 was 12,345. The municipality covers a total of 31 km and is composed of 1 city center and 8 villages. The villages of Vau i Dejës are Mjedë, Spathar, Shelqet, Kacë, Narac, Dush, Gomsiqe and Karmë. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sapë. ==History== The history of Vau i Dejës dates back to the old city center Deja (also known as Danja), established around the year 1127. Deja, an Albanian medieval town, was built at the point where the Drin River leaves the highlands. Deja was a strategic area because it was the crossing point of ancient roads connecting the east and the west. From Lissus, an old Roman road travelled through Nenshat and Hajmel, passing through Laç at the \\"Stone Pass\\" and continuing on to Gomsiqe and Pukë. The city was a customs point for merchant caravans passing through. From the early thirteenth century, the feudal lords remained under Serbian rule. It was attacked during the Mongol invasion of 1242. Here was enacted Zaharia feudal family. After the formation of the principality of Balsha, Deja became part of it. In 1396, George Balsha II passed the city to Republic of Venice. In the years 1423-1443, Deja passed twice over to the Ottomans in 1443 to be released after the general anti- Ottoman insurrection. Possession of Deja was contested between feudal lords Lekë Zaharia and Nicholas Dukagjini in 1445. After the assassination of the latter, the city was returned by his mother to Venice. Skanderbeg claimed the area to be delivered to League of Lezhë, which caused the fight between Albanians and Venetians. Skanderbeg besieged the fortress in 1447-1448 but did not succeed in taking it. The city remained under Venice until 1479 when the Ottomans recaptured it. The ruins of St. Mark's castle and the church, which dates back to the early 15th century, are still present today. According to historians, each year in this area a big fair was organized and attended by the inhabitants of the Zadrima region. This fair took place on the 25th of April and continued late hours of the morning. Agricultural goods, livestock and primitive tools that could not be found any other day of the year were available for sale. Danja Castle The Danja Castle, located in the Deja village, was a prominent center in the Zadrima region. The biggest battle in the war against Venice was fought at Danja Castle and is where Leke Zaharia was killed. He is buried in Saint Maria Church in Vau i Dejës, which has been rebuilt from when it was destroyed in 1965. With the death of Lekë Zaharia, the castle was taken by Venice, which left after military pressure from Gjergj Kastrioti - Skenderbeg. After the Danja Castle fell, a great part of the population left for Italy (see Arbëresh people). ==Geography== Vau i Dejës lies along the national road connecting Shkodra to Kosovo. Located at the foot of a mountainous woodland, it is situated at the exit of a gorge between the hill of Laç with an elevation 367 m and Boka with an elevation 464 m. Through this gorge flows the Glina brook which divides the city's urban area into two visible parts until it meets the Gjadër River. The vegetation of these hills is dry largely because their geological composition does not favor the growth of vegetation. Geology The rocks of the eastern and northern territory of Vau i Dejës are characterized by formations of karst and flysch magmatic rocks similar to those found in Mirdita. The moderately strong rocks are mostly composed of flysch from Krasta with small amounts of siliceous clay from the volcanic-sedimentary series from the Mirdita area. Soils of these areas are not cohesively related, while the gravel brook of Gomsiqe is characterized by small stones and very little clay. Geo-dynamic processes of this area are caused by tectonic movement along the Mirdita and Krasta-Cukal region. Tectonic parting is less developed. Landslides are common in the flysch formations. Massive landslides have been identified along the Vau i Dejës - Koman highway, especially in the area of Karma. Surface erosion is common along the Gomsiqe brook as it flows into the Vau i Dejës Lake. Rockslides have been observed in the vicinity of the Gomsiqe bridge and the Karma school. The rock formations of the southern and western parts of the municipality may be divided into two groups by their complex rock properties and water-permeability. The first group contains alluvial deposits, alevrite, sand, QH-QPH grit. These compounds have a high to medium level of water permeability. The second group contains compact rocks with permeability ranging from divided into three groups. The first sub of carbonate rocks contains to CR2, J3 J3-CRL and featuring a high permeability. The second subgroup contains ultrabasic rocks and volcanic sedimentary featuring a non- uniform medium permeability. The third subgroup contains rocks with low to virtually no permeability and contains limestone, shale, clay and alevrolite content as well as the paleocene flysch-Neocene (pgl-2) and mastrikcianit (Crm2-PG2). Water relief in this area ranges from 150-300 l / hour. Underground aquifers surface from exploits in the ultra basic flysch rocks. The southern part of the area has plentiful water containing hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons, sometimes calcium and calcium-magnesium and Mp = 398 mg / l; fp = 13.6 ° k, Ph = 2.72. This water meets the hydrochemical parameters for use for drinking. Productive horizon for water supply in case of need is the old bed of the Drin river. Hydrography The Drin river and Vau i Dejës Lake The hydrographic network is represented by an artificial lake (Vau i Dejës Lake), Drin River and several streams, the most important being the Gomsiqe brook and the Zazlli brook. All these flow from the mountain of Gomsiqe. Vau i Dejës Lake has an area of 26 km², while the water surface is 25 km². Its depth ranges up to 50m. The volume of water for 75 m above sea level is 600 million m³. The average level above sea level is 75m. Maximum level above sea level is 76m. The volume of usage is 220 million m³. The length of the lake 10 km while its width is 1.2 km In the southern part of the city, the urban structure is intersected by the Glina brook, which separates the neighborhood named \\"Kapedani\\" from the rest of the city. This is a short stream that emanates from the hills to the east of the territory and flows into the Gjadër River. During the winter season, the brook's water flow increases considerably during periods of heavy rainfall and the southwestern part of the city is threatened by flooding. Drin River Originally, Drin flowed southwest from the gorge of Vau i Dejës where it joined the Gjadër River 1.5 km below, in the field of Zadrima. It passed Lezhë and emptied into the Adriatic, in the Drin Bay. In 1846, the Drin river formed a new branch that ran towards Shkodra and joined the Buna River. The Drin river was divided into two parts, flowing southwest towards Lezhë, and the other flowing towards Shkodra. This caused a disruption to the water system of Lake Shkodër, impacting on water levels and the flow of the Buna river, which became the river with the greatest water capacity. Gjadër River Since its separation from Drin in the South- West town of Laç (Qyrsaç), the river heads south. Gjadër River itself is a branch of Drin. There are many characteristics of river torrential. Surface of its watershed is mountainous relief 199m2. The average altitude is 422m above sea level. The average amount of precipitation falling in the pond is about 1900mm per year. Climate ==Culture== Cultural Center Cultural Center for Children in Vau i Dejës was founded in 1995. Reconstruction of the Cultural Center in 2006 was funded by KFV Germanic Bank. The objectives of the Cultural Center are: * Educating the next generation of culture, our history and folklore. * Preservation of cultural heritage. * Revival of social and cultural life. * Knowledge and instruction musical instruments new generation. * Knowledge and instruction of games and dances. * Knowledge to folk costumes. Sports There aren't any public sport organizations in the municipality. The only recreational facilities are a couple privately owned football fields and a Judo training facility. In the future, the municipality has plans to establish its own football team and create recreational spaces. Judo The first official presentation of Judo in Albania was made in 1993 in Vau i Dejës by Anton Shkoza. Judoists were trained in the Cultural Center from 1993 until 1997. In 1997, Anton was able to build a small gym in his home until a proper gym was constructed in 2010. There are 3 Judo groups that train in Vau i Dejës and belong to the Federation of Judo Albania – (Vau-Dejësi, Vllaznia, and Klub Judo \\"Anton Shkoza\\"). Judoists from Vau i Dejës have competed in various youth tournaments in Kosovo and Montenegro,the World Cup in Rome, the German Super cup, European Championships in Belgrade, Tournament of Italy and Niksic as well as various other international competitions. In 2008, Edmond Topalli of Vau i Dejës represented Albania in the Beijing Olympics. He lost his first match to João Neto of Portugal. His other notable achievements include a bronze and silver medal at the Tournament of Tuscany. Points of Interest Island of Shurdhah The medieval ruins of Shurdhah (also known as Vau i Dejës Castle) lie 35 km east of Shkodra along the Koman road. Once strategically guarding the Shkodra-Kosovo road, leading up the valley to Prizren, Sarda was founded in the 6th-8th century BC. Much of the ancient town is submerged in the artificial lake created by the Vau i Dejës hydroelectric dam. The ruins of an 11th-century medieval castle, which includes two rings of defensive walls and towers (some sadly submerged in the lake), the remains of a Byzantine church and other early medieval walls, are still visible above the waters. The setting on the steep rocks rising from the lake is especially impressive. Vau i Dejës Lake Lake of Vau i Dejës with Shurdhah Island, Albania Vau i Dejës Lake is an artificial lake formed by the Vau i Dejës hydroelectric dam. Some sites along the lake include Ragam, the island of Shurdah (or Sarda), and the Cave of Doves. Much of the lake is undeveloped but there are a few bars and restaurants along the lake. \\"Qafa e Gurit\\" () is the local access point to the lake. ==Economy== 1000 Lek banknote, issued in 1997. Under communism, the main employers were the state operated hydro electric power plant and copper factory as well as agricultural cooperatives. Currently, economic development is based on small private economic activities such as services and commerce positioned along the Shkodër-Pukë national road. There are 105 private business currently registered in the Vau i Dejës. Most of the private business are small bar/cafes and small grocery stories. Other commercial activities include, a photo studio, bakery, light industrial supplies, dentistry, and various other basic services. Vau i Dejës Hydroelectric Power Station In the villages outside of the city center, there are small production, processing, agriculture and stock breeding activities. Due to agricultural and land fragmentation caused by the privatization of state property in 1990, the municipal administration has no data on agricultural land being cultivated or the number of agricultural business in operation. The main agricultural products are crops and fodder for farming. Currently, the municipality has 1.141 ha of agricultural land with different productive capacity. After the privatization of land, livestock number increased within the municipality. Estimates from 2006 place the number of livestock at 1,350 and the number of cattle at 7,345. There are also eight dairy farms using local stock breeding products. The products are sold locally and in Shkodër. There currently, is not a specific place for the collection, processing, and trading of agricultural products. ==Demographics== As noted in the table below, populations in several of the outlying villages such as Dush, Gomsiqe, and Karmë are dwindling due to lack of utilities, services, and accessibility. The displaced residents are being relocated within the Laç-Vau i Dejës settlement. Out of the whole municipality, 1,202 residents are from 0–6 years old, 2,943 are 7–18 years old, 6468 are from 19–64 years old, and 3,052 are over 65 years old. Thirty four percent of the municipality is under the age of 18 and 53% of the population is of working age. {  - !

His great-grandfather had come to India and the family had lived there ever since. In 1728, he began his career at fourteen years old. As everyone had to start as a soldier, he began as a \\"soldaat van de penne\\", then became an \\"assistent\\" in 1731, and \\"boekhouder\\" (bookkeeper) in 1732. He had to move house in 1736 to take up a new job as \\"onderkoopman\\" (underbuyer/undermerchant), and at the same time \\"collectionist\\" (collector) and \\"boekhouder\\" to the General Secretary at Batavia/Jakarta. He became \\"koopman\\" (buyer/merchant) and \\"geheimschrijver\\" (secrets secretary) in 1739. He became Second Secretary to the High Government (Hoge Regering), becoming First Secretary in 1747. He became Counsellor-extraordinary of the Indies later that year (November) and in 1751 became a regular Counsellor. In 1752 he became President of the College van Heemraden (in charge of estate boundaries, roads, etc.). He was later a member of the \\"Schepenbank\\" (the local government and court in Batavia), a Regent (a board member) of the hospital and in 1755 he became First Counsellor and Director-General (Eerste Raad en Directeur- Generaal) On 15 May 1761, following the death of Jacob Mossel he became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Confirmation of his appointment by the Heren XVII (the Seventeen Lords, who controlled the Dutch East India Company) came in 1762. He held a lavish inauguration on his birthday on 29 September. Subsequently, his birthday was a national holiday in the Indies. During his time as Governor-General, he overthrew the Prince of Kandy, in Ceylon, though with difficulty, and he conquered the sultanate of Siak in Sumatra. Contracts were entered into with various regional leaders in Bima, Soembawa, Dompo, Tambora, Sangar and Papekat. Van der Parra favoured his friends and gave out well-paid posts if he could get anything in return for them. It was said he was a typical colonial ruler, idle, grumpy but generous to those who fawned upon him and recognised his greatness. It was a golden time for the preachers in Batavia, who got gifts, translations of the New Testament and scholarships from Van der Parra. They worshipped and eulogised him. Although the Heren XVII knew about his behaviour, as five Counsellors had written to them about his pretensions to kingly behaviour, they did nothing about it. In 1770, Captain James Cook had to ask for his help to proceed on his journeys on HMS Endeavour (See s:Captain Cook's Journal, First Voyage/Chapter 9). At the end of the 19th Century, a steamship, trading to the Indies, was named after him. After over fourteen years in power, he died on 28 September 1775 in Weltevreden, the imposing palace built for him outside Batavia. and He apparently left a great deal of his fortune to the widows of Colombo and a smaller part to the poor of Batavia. He was followed as governor by Jeremias van Riemsdijk He was married to Adriana Johanna Bake. ==ReferencesSources== * Comprehensive Dutch website on the history of the Dutch Eat Indies * Biographical Dictionary (in Dutch) * L.

It comprises two brothers, Jimmy and Johnny, who between them contribute guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, vocals and many other instruments. ==History== Jimmy and Johnny began playing guitar in the late-1960s, at the ages of 14 and 12 respectively. Influenced by their parents --mother Virginia was a pianist, father Edward was a vocalist--they received no formal music training and had joined bands by 1971. After hearing progressive rock band Wishbone Ash (notable for featuring two lead guitarists) on the radio in 1973, the brothers formed a similar band with local musicians by the name of Westfall. They progressed from playing local clubs to having their first studio session and recording their first two tracks, \\"Everything I Could Ask For\\" and \\"Sunshine Daydream\\", in a short space of time, developing their double lead style along the way. Other bands they played in through the 1970s include Axis, Nutcracker and Freeze, opening for such famous acts as Kiss, Styx, Survivor, Head East and The Beach Boys. During the 1980s, as the music scene was changing to focus on disco, the brothers began to work separately as session musicians, solo artists and with other bands. It was during this time that Jimmy recorded his solo album Finally and Johnny began building his own studio, known as The Garage, where he also began recording his own music. After some years the brothers reunited, and in 1996 released their debut album, Sibling Revelry, which featured guest appearances from guitarists Michael Angelo Batio and Tommy Dziallo. The Brothers' second album, Colorama, was released in 1999, which featured more guest musicians (in addition to Batio and Dziallo), namely vocalists Jim \\"Mudpuppy\\" Wiley, Nick Cortese and Johnny Mrozek. The band's official website was created in February 2000, a process which Johnny values highly, claiming \\"The internet saved us ... without it, we could have never hoped for more than a regional awareness of our music ... we've established contacts and expanded our fan base across the entire planet.\\" Legacy was released in 2002, followed by Blue Marble and Totality in 2005 and 2008 respectively. ==Discography== *Sibling Revelry (1996) *Colorama (1999) *Legacy (2002) *The Chaos Sampler (2003) *Blue Marble (2005) *Totality (2008) *Under The Influence (2012) ==References== * ==External links== *Official site Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Progressive rock musical groups from Illinois Category:Streamwood, Illinois Category:People from Cook County, Illinois Category:Sibling musical duos ","title":"The Flyin' Ryan Brothers"},{"id":"20236384","text":"Puhuangyu Station () is an interchange subway station between Line 5 and Line 14 of the Beijing Subway.

It is possible that this diptych, honouring the bond between the two aristocratic and pagan families of the Symmachi and Nicomachi, was issued in occasion of Memmius' marriage with a woman of the Nicomachi in 401. Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus (383/384 – after 402) was a politician of the Roman empire, member of the influential family of the Symmachi. == Biography == He was son of the orator and politician Quintus Aurelius Symmachus and of Rusticiana; he was born in 383/384. Memmius had an elder sister, Galla, who married Nicomachus Flavianus, son of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus. At the age of ten, he became quaestor, celebrating the public games connected with his office in December 393. Memmius was well educated, and studied Greek language; his father approved his style in writing letters and, in 401, he studied with a Gallic rhetor as his tutor. The year 401 marked several important events in Memmius' life: he married the granddaughter of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus;Alan Cameron, \\"The Antiquity of the Symmachi\\", Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte, 48 (1999), p. 503It was probably in this occasion that the bond between the two aristocratic, pagan families was celebrated with the issue of a diptych, whose valves are entitled one Nicomachorum and the other Symmachorum (Serena Ensoli, Eugenio La Rocca, Aurea Roma. Dalla città pagana alla città cristiana, L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, , p. 467). he also celebrated the games connected with the second step in his cursus honorum, the office of praetor (these games were postponed from 400 in order to allow Aurelius Symmachus to be present and cost 2000 pounds of gold). It was probably Memmius who, belonging to a family practicing the old Roman religion, built a temple devoted to Flora in Rome; he is also the author of a dedicatory inscription in honour of his father-in-law Flavianus (CIL, VI, 1782). After Aurelius Symmachus' death, Memmius edited his correspondence. == Notes  Bibliography == * Arnold Hugh Martin Jones, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, \\"Q.

For example, b4 = 1 because the binary representation of 4 is 100, which only contains one block of consecutive 0s of length 2; whereas b5 = 0 because the binary representation of 5 is 101, which contains a block of consecutive 0s of length 1. Starting at n = 0, the first few terms of the Baum–Sweet sequence are: :1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 ... ==Historical motivation== The properties of the sequence were first studied by L.E. Baum and M.M. Sweet in 1976. In 1949, Khinchin conjectured that there does not exist a non-quadratic algebraic real number having bounded partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion. A counterexample to this conjecture is still not known. Baum and Sweet's paper showed that the same expectation is not met for algebraic power series. They gave an example of cubic power series in \\\\mathbb{F}_2((X^{-1})) whose partial quotients are bounded. (The degree of the power series in Baum and Sweet's result is analogous to the degree of the field extension associated with the algebraic real in Khinchin's conjecture.) One of the series considered in Baum and Sweet's paper is a root of :f^3 + x^{-1}f + 1 = 0.Graham Everest, Alf van der Poorten, Igor Shparlinski, Thomas Ward Recurrence Sequences AMS 2003, p 236. The authors show that by Hensel's lemma, there is a unique such root in \\\\mathbb{F}_2((X^{-1})) because reducing the defining equation of f modulo X^{-1} gives f^3+1, which factors as :f^3+1 = (f+1)(f^2+f+1). They go on to prove that this unique root has partial quotients of degree \\\\le 2. Before doing so, they state (in the remark following Theorem 2, p 598) that the root can be written in the form :f = \\\\sum_{k \\\\ge 0} f_i X^{-k} where f_0 = 1 and f_k = 1 for k \\\\ge 1 if and only if the binary expansion of n contains only even length blocks of 0's. This is the origin of the Baum–Sweet sequence. Mkaouar and Yao proved that the partial quotients of the continued fraction for f above do not form an automatic sequence.Allouche and Shallit (2003) p 210. However, the sequence of partial quotients can be generated by a non-uniform morphism. ==Properties== The Baum–Sweet sequence can be generated by a 3-state automaton. The value of term bn in the Baum–Sweet sequence can be found recursively as follows. If n = m*4k, where m is not divisible by 4 (or is 0), then :b_n = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } n = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } m \\\\text{ is even} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{(m-1)/2} & \\\\text{if } m \\\\text{ is odd}. \\\\end{cases} Thus b76 = b9 = b4 = b0 = 1, which can be verified by observing that the binary representation of 76, which is 1001100, contains no consecutive blocks of 0s with odd length. The Baum–Sweet word 1101100101001001..., which is created by concatenating the terms of the Baum–Sweet sequence, is a fixed point of the morphism or string substitution rules :00 → 0000 :01 → 1001 :10 → 0100 :11 → 1101 as follows: :11 → 1101 → 11011001 → 1101100101001001 → 11011001010010011001000001001001 ... From the morphism rules it can be seen that the Baum–Sweet word contains blocks of consecutive 0s of any length (bn = 0 for all 2k integers in the range 5.2k ≤ n < 6.2k), but it contains no block of three consecutive 1s. More succinctly, by Cobham's little theorem the Baum–Sweet word can be expressed as a coding \\\\tau applied to the fixed point of a uniform morphism \\\\varphi. Indeed, the morphism :\\\\varphi(A) = AB, \\\\varphi(B) = CB, \\\\varphi(C) = BD, \\\\varphi(D) = DD and coding :\\\\tau(A) = 1, \\\\tau(B) = 1, \\\\tau(C) = 0, \\\\tau(D) = 0 generate the word in that way.Allouche and Shallit (2003) p 176. ==NotesReferences== * Category:Binary sequences ","title":"Baum–Sweet sequence"},{"id":"20236434","text":"Synej () is a village and administrative unit in the municipality of Tirana, central Albania.

He won a bronze medal in 1948, scoring six goals in seven matches. Four years later he played all nine matches and scored at least five goals (not all scorers are known). Though beating all their opponents, except for a 4:4 draw against the eventual winner Hungary, the Dutch team took fifth place through a dubious incident: after Yugoslavia lost to the Netherlands 2:3, it challenged the result based on a supposed partisanship of a referee, and won the replay 2:1. Braasem won the European title in 1950. After retiring from competitions in 1953 he worked in Barcelona, coaching both the Barcelona team and the Spanish national team. From 1959 to 1962 he was the coach of the Dutch national team, which placed eighth at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He also was active as a sports commentator, among other at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico.

The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season's first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Allison, formed on June 5 while the season's final system, Hurricane Olga, dissipated on December 6. The season produced seventeen tropical depressions, of which fifteen intensified into tropical storms, nine became hurricanes, and four strengthened into major hurricanes. The two most significant storms of the year, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Michelle. Forming over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, Allison produced widespread heavy rainfall along its path (most notably across Texas and Louisiana), killing 41 people and inflicting $9 billion (2001 USD) in damage. Until Tropical Storm Erika in 2015, Allison was the only tropical storm to have its name retired by the World Meteorological Organization. Hurricane Michelle was the most intense cyclone of the 2001 season, with winds reaching 140 mph (220 km/h). The storm's impacts extended from the Caribbean Sea to the Bahamas and were most severe in Cuba, cementing its status as one of the costliest cyclones on record there. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included. ==Timeline of events== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/2001 till:01/01/2002 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2001 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0–62_km/h)_(TD) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h)_(TS) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h)_(C1) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h)_(C2) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–130_mph_(178–209_km/h)_(C3) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131–155_mph_(210–249_km/h)_(C4) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_≥156_mph_(≥250_km/h)_(C5) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:04/06/2001 till:18/06/2001 color:TS text:\\"Allison (TS)\\" from:11/07/2001 till:12/07/2001 color:TD text:\\"Two (TD)\\" from:02/08/2001 till:07/08/2001 color:TS text:\\"Barry (TS)\\" from:14/08/2001 till:22/08/2001 color:TS text:\\"Chantal (TS)\\" from:22/08/2001 till:28/08/2001 color:TS text:\\"Dean (TS)\\" from:01/09/2001 till:15/09/2001 color:C3 text:\\"Erin (C3)\\" from:07/09/2001 till:19/09/2001 color:C3 text:\\"Felix (C3)\\" from:11/09/2001 till:19/09/2001 color:C1 text:\\"Gabrielle (C1)\\" barset:break from:19/09/2001 till:20/09/2001 color:TD text:\\"Nine (TD)\\" from:21/09/2001 till:27/09/2001 color:C2 text:\\"Humberto (C2)\\" from:04/10/2001 till:09/10/2001 color:C4 text:\\"Iris (C4)\\" from:06/10/2001 till:08/10/2001 color:TS text:\\"Jerry (TS)\\" from:12/10/2001 till:15/10/2001 color:C1 text:\\"Karen (C1)\\" from:27/10/2001 till:31/10/2001 color:TS text:\\"Lorenzo (TS)\\" from:29/10/2001 till:05/11/2001 color:C4 text:\\"Michelle (C4)\\" from:04/11/2001 till:06/11/2001 color:C1 text:\\"Noel (C1)\\" barset:break from:24/11/2001 till:06/12/2001 color:C1 text:\\"Olga (C1)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/2001 till:01/07/2001 text:June from:01/07/2001 till:01/08/2001 text:July from:01/08/2001 till:01/09/2001 text:August from:01/09/2001 till:01/10/2001 text:September from:01/10/2001 till:01/11/2001 text:October from:01/11/2001 till:01/12/2001 text:November from:01/12/2001 till:01/01/2002 text:December TextData = pos:(568,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale)\\" June June 1 *The 2001 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.

It was established by the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, and began operations in 2008 by the merging of Postwatch, Energywatch and the Welsh, Scottish and National Consumer Councils under the Consumer Focus brand. Following the UK Government's 2010 Spending Review, funding from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) for Consumer Focus was redirected to the Citizens Advice Bureau service, and in May 2013 Consumer Focus was renamed Consumer Futures. It was abolished as a non-departmental public body on 1 April 2014, when it was merged into Citizens Advice. ==History== The National Consumer Council was established by the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, which merged Postwatch, Energywatch and the Welsh, Scottish and National Consumer Councils as a single organisation under the Consumer Focus brand. The Act gave Consumer Focus the right to investigate any consumer complaint if it is of wider interest, the right to open up information from providers, the power to conduct research and the ability to make an official super-complaint about failing services. The Government announced in October 2010 that as part of its spending review, Consumer Focus would be abolished, and the Consumer Direct helpline would be taken over by the Citizens Advice Bureau network. The Government announced that some Consumer Focus' functions would transfer to Citizens Advice, Citizens Advice Scotland and the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland following the Public Bodies Act 2011 and any necessary secondary legislation. ==Areas of work== One of the first causes taken up by Consumer Focus after its establishment was fuel poverty. In 2010, Consumer Focus examined payday loans in the United Kingdom, as the number of people taking out payday loans in the UK in recent years has increased four-fold, to 1.2 million in 2009.Consumer Focus, 14 August 2010, Number of payday loan users has quadrupled – Consumer Focus research revealsMarie Burton, Consumer Focus, Keeping the plates spinning: Perceptions of payday loans in Great Britain == Predecessor organisations == Energywatch Energywatch was charged with protecting and promoting the interests of all gas and electricity consumers in England, Scotland and Wales. Energywatch was created in November 2000 under the provisions of the Utilities Act 2000. The last Chief Executive was Allan Asher. The organisation offered consumer information and advice, and pursued certain complaints which the energy suppliers have failed to resolve. In March 2005, Energywatch made a super-complaint to OFGEM about suppliers' billing practices. In response, OFGEM reduced the period within which suppliers could back-bill customers, and required suppliers to introduce a Billing Code of Practice on billing and an ombudsman scheme to resolve difficult complaints. Other issues tackled by Energywatch included energy mis-selling, customer transfers, debt issues, and disconnection. In 2008, Energywatch was disbanded and replaced with Consumer Direct. Whilst Consumer Direct retained the primary function of Energywatch, to give advice over the telephone on energy related issues, it ceased to take on individual cases to resolve them. Postwatch Postwatch (officially: the Consumer Council for Postal Services) was a non- departmental public body set up in January 2001 – by Section 2 of the Postal Services Act 2000 to help customers with any issues or complaints they had with any Postal Service (including the Royal Mail) in the United Kingdom. It was funded by, and was accountable to, the Department of Trade and Industry and from 2007 the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Postwatch worked to ensure customers receive the best possible postal service.

Chapter 121 §§ 2701–2712) is a law that addresses voluntary and compelled disclosure of \\"stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records\\" held by third-party internet service providers (ISPs). It was enacted as Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA). The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the people's right \\"to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\\". However, when applied to information stored online, the Fourth Amendment's protections are potentially far weaker. In part, this is because the Fourth Amendment defines the \\"right to be secure\\" in spatial terms that do not directly apply to the \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\" in an online context. The Fourth Amendment has been stressed as a right that protects people and not places, which leaves the interpretation of the amendment's language broad in scope. In addition, society has not reached clear consensus over expectations of privacy in terms of more modern (and developing, future) forms of recorded and/or transmitted information. Furthermore, users generally entrust the security of online information to a third party, an ISP. In many cases, Fourth Amendment doctrine has held that, in so doing, users relinquish any expectation of privacy. The Third-Party Doctrine holds \\"that knowingly revealing information to a third party relinquishes Fourth Amendment protection in that information.\\"Kerr, Orin S., \\"The Case for the Third-Party Doctrine\\", Michigan L. Rev., Vol. 107, 2009; GWU Legal Studies Research Paper No. 421. While a search warrant and probable cause are required to search one's home, under the third party doctrine only a subpoena and prior notice (a much lower hurdle than probable cause) are needed to subject an ISP to disclose the contents of an email or of files stored on a server.Kerr, Orin S., \\"A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator's Guide to Amending It\\", George Washington L. Rev. (2004). Available at . As per request by the House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice, as well as the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs asking the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to create a report about protections surrounding electronic communications, it was found that individuals were at risk. This risk identified current protections for electronic mail as being \\"weak, ambiguous, or nonexistent.\\"Orin S. Kerr, \\"A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator's Guide to Amending It,\\" 72 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1208, 1211–12 (2004). 6 For further discussion of statutory protections afforded to private messages and wall posts, see infra Part II.B.1–2. The report concluded that \\"[t]he existing statutory framework and judicial interpretations thereof do not adequately cover new and emerging electronic surveillance technologies.\\"For a defense of this doctrine, see Orin S. Kerr, \\"The Case for the Third-Party Doctrine,\\" 107 MICH. L. REv. 561 (2009). OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, OTA-CIT-293, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND CIVIL LIBERTIES (1985) Congress acknowledged the fact that traditional Fourth Amendment protections were lacking. As a result, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act was enacted in 1986 as an update on the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed protections on telephone (land) line privacies. The provisions are distributed into 3 titles, with Title II being the Stored Communications Act. The SCA creates Fourth Amendment-like privacy protection for email and other digital communications stored on the internet. It limits the ability of the government to compel an ISP to turn over content information and noncontent information (such as logs and \\"envelope\\" information from email). In addition, it limits the ability of commercial ISPs to reveal content information to nongovernment entities. == Overview == Section 2701 (18 U.S.C. § 2701) of the SCA provides criminal penalties for anyone who \\"intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided or … intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility; and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system shall be punished ... .\\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701 Section 2702 (18 U.S.C. § 2702) of the SCA targets two types of online service, \\"electronic communication services\\" and \\"remote computing services.\\" The statute defines an electronic communication service as \\"any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.\\" A remote computing service is defined as \\"the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.\\" This section also describes conditions under which a public ISP can voluntarily disclose customer communications or records. In general, ISPs are forbidden to \\"divulge to any person or entity the contents of any communication which is carried or maintained on that service.\\" However, ISPs are allowed to share \\"non-content\\" information, such as log data and the name and email address of the recipient, with anyone other than a governmental entity. In addition, ISPs that do not offer services to the public, such as businesses and universities, can freely disclose content and non-content information. An ISP can disclose the contents of a subscriber's communications authorized by that subscriber.18 U.S.C. § 2701(c)(2) Section 2703 (18 U.S.C. § 2703) of the SCA describes the conditions under which the government is able to compel an ISP to disclose \\"customer or subscriber\\" content and non-content information for each of these types of service:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 * Electronic communication service. If a \\"wire or electronic communication\\" has been in electronic storage for 180 days or less, the government must obtain a search warrant. There has been debate over the status of opened emails in storage for 180 days or less, which may fall in this category or the \\"remote computing service\\" category. * Remote computing service. If a \\"wire or electronic communication\\" has been in electronic storage for more than 180 days or is held \\"solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services\\" the government can use a search warrant, or, alternatively, a subpoena or a \\"specific and articulable facts\\" court order (called a §2703(d) order) combined with prior notice to compel disclosure. Prior notice can be delayed for up to 90 days if it would jeopardize an investigation. Historically, opened or downloaded email held for 180 days or less has fallen in this category, on the grounds that it is held \\"solely for the purpose of storage.\\" This section also addresses the requirements for a court order for disclosure. It also addresses that no cause of action shall lie in any court against the provider under this chapter. Section 2704 (18 U.S.C. § 2704) of the SCA describes backup preservation such that an entity operating under 2703(b)(2) may ask for a backup copy of the electronic communications in order to preserve the communications. This backup may be included in the subpoena or court order requirement requested from the ISP.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2704 Section 2705(b) () also provides for gag orders, which direct the recipient of a 2703(d) order to refrain from disclosing the existence of the order or investigation.In Re: Application of the United States of America for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d) of January 25, 2013, p. 4, from the Wikileaks-related Twitter subpoenas The court will be able to delay the notification for ninety days if it determines that there is a reason that the court order could have adverse results.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2705 Section 2706 (18 U.S.C. § 2706) of SCA addresses cost reimbursement such that a government entity obtaining communications and records under 2702,2703, or 2704 of the title should pay the party providing the information for incurred costs. The amount should be mutually agreed upon. This requirement is exempt when section (a) does not apply to the records held by the communications carrier.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2706 Section 2707 (18 U.S.C. § 2707) of SCA describes cause of civil action under this title, reliefs in a civil action, damages assessed in a civil action, administrative discipline, defence, limitation, and improper disclosure.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707 Section 2708 (18 U.S.C. § 2708) of SCA states that the remedies and sanctions are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violations of the chapter that are not constitutional violations.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2708 Section 2709 ()Is in regards to counterintelligence access to telephone toll and transactional records. Subsection (a) says that a wire or electronic communication service should comply with any request for information, records, electronic communications made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director with required certification (b).https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709 Section 2710 (18 U.S.C. § 2710) of SCA describes wrongful disclosure of videotape or sale records and resulting civil action in district court in the event of a violation under this section.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2710 Section 2711 (18 U.S.C. § 2711) of SCA provides definitions for the chapter. The terms defined are those in section 2510 of the title, \\"remote computing service,\\" \\"court of competent jurisdiction,\\" and \\"government entity.\\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2711 Section 2712 (18 U.S.C. § 2712) of SCA discusses civil actions against the United States. Any party who has claims violation of the chapter or chapter 119 of the title may take action against U.S. District Court to recover money damages.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2712 == Constitutionality of compelled government disclosure == With respect to the government's ability to compel disclosure, the most significant distinction made by the SCA is between communications held in electronic communications services, which require a search warrant and probable cause, and those in remote computing services, which require only a subpoena or court order, with prior notice. This lower level of protection is essentially the same as would be provided by the Fourth Amendment—or potentially less, since notice can be delayed indefinitely in 90-day increments. Orin Kerr argues that, \\"the SCA was passed to bolster the weak Fourth Amendment privacy protections that applied to the Internet. Incorporating those weak Fourth Amendment principles into statutory law makes little sense.\\" In Warshak v U.S. (2007)Warshak v United States (2007) this point of view found fleeting support from a panel of the Sixth Circuit, which ruled that a reasonable expectation of privacy extends to emails that would otherwise fall under the SCA's lower level of protection: \\"Where the third party is not expected to access the e-mails in the normal course of business, however, the party maintains a reasonable expectation of privacy, and subpoenaing the entity with mere custody over the documents is insufficient to trump the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.\\" Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit en banc vacated the panel's ruling and remanded for dismissal of the constitutional claim, reasoning that, because the Court had \\"no idea whether the government will conduct an ex parte search of Warshak's e-mail account in the future and plenty of reason to doubt that it will,\\" the matter was not ripe for adjudication.Warshak v. United States, 532 F.3d 521 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc) Zwillinger and SommerMarc Zwillinger, Jacob Sommer. \\"Warshak Decision: Sixth Circuit's En Banc Reversal in Warshak Sidesteps Constitutionality of Stored Communication Act's Delayed Notification Provision,\\" , BNA Privacy & Security Law Report, Vol. 7, No. 31, (Aug. 4, 2008). observed that this decision erected a barrier to \\"prospective\\" challenges by individuals with reason to believe they will be targets of surveillance. While Warshak's civil case ended without a resolution to this issue, his criminal case provided another opportunity. In United States v. Warshak (2010)United States v. Warshak, No. 08-3997 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010). the Sixth Circuit found that email users have a Fourth Amendment-protected reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their email accounts and that \\"to the extent that the SCA purports to permit the government to obtain such emails warrantlessly, the SCA is unconstitutional.\\"Kevin Bankston, Breaking News on EFF Victory: Appeals Court Holds that Email Privacy Protected by Fourth Amendment, EFF DeepLinks (Dec. 14, 2010). In In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data, 724 F.3d 600 (5th Cir. 2013), the Fifth Circuit held that court orders under the Stored Communications Act compelling cell phone providers to disclose historical cell site information are not per se unconstitutional. However, in Carpenter v. United States the Supreme Court ruled that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing such information without a search warrant or exception to the warrant requirement such as exigent circumstances. == Extraterritoriality == Many ISPs have server farms and data centers where their users' electronic data is stored, with locations chosen globally to bolster server performance. As a result, data could potentially be outside of U.S. Jurisdictional reach.MLAT: A Four-Letter Word in Need of Reform, ACCESSNOW. The application of SCA to extraterritorial jurisdiction became a point of contention, as the statute is debatably applicable to conducting searches outside of the United States, even over parties not physically in the United States. In support of this, the Bank of Nova Scotia Doctrine, or BNS, allows for \\"a grand jury subpoena ... used to compel a company subject to U.S. jurisdiction to produce evidence stored outside of the United States if the evidence is within the company's possession, custody, or control.\\"In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Bank of Nova Scotia), 740 F.2d 817 (11th Cir. 1984) With these applications come arguments for the use of an appropriate Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).U.S.-Ire. MLAT, supra note 20, art. 1(2)(b). It is ultimately the interpretation of the courts on which dictates how the warrant is carried out. In light of an earlier ruling upholding extraterritorial application of the SCA in In Re Warrant of a Certain E-mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corporation, a new bill called the LEADS Act, was introduced.n re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5; Transcript of July 31 Order, supra note 11; In re Warrant II C.J., supra note 11. The bill \\"preclude the use of U.S. warrants to obtain communications content stored outside the [United States] unless the content is in the account of an American.\\" This means that disclosure of private communications on servers abroad through a judicial warrant can only occur if the user of such emails is a U.S. Citizen.Greg Nojeim, LEADS Act Extends Important Privacy Protections, Raises Concerns, CTR. FOR DEMOCRACY & TECH. (Sept. 18, 2014)  Microsoft Corporation v. United States of America  On December 4, 2013, government authorities obtained a SCA warrant from Magistrate Judge Francis in the Southern District of New York's case In re Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled & Maintained by Microsoft Corp.In re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5, at 468. Microsoft identified that the requested account was served on a server in Ireland. Microsoft filed a motion to quash the warrant based on the extraterritorial application of the warrant. This motion was denied by the court and the SCA warrant was explained as a \\"hybrid order\\", which is \\"executed like a subpoena in that it is served on the ISP in possession of the information and does not involve government agents entering the premises of the ISP to search its servers and seize the email account in question.\\"In re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5, at 471. The court also confirmed that a call to utilize MLAT would not be necessary in the case. The case resulted in Microsoft voluntarily being held in contempt for non-compliance with the SCA warrant. This was meant to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit as soon as they could.Zach Wittaker & Larry Seltzer, \\"Microsoft Refuses to Comply After Judge Revives Overseas Data Search Warrant,\\" ZDNET (Aug. 31, 2014) Microsoft claimed that they would not comply unless an appellate review was conducted, at minimum.Michael Lipkin, Microsoft Admits Contempt, Sets Up Appeal On Email Warrant, LAW360 (Sept. 8, 2014) On July 14, 2016 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided in favor of Microsoft that the SCA warrant cannot be seen as \\"hybrid order\\" and the SCA's warrant provisions do not apply extraterritorially.http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ea15ef5-3b7c-476b-9c80-bfed8029ebf7/4/doc/14-2985_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ea15ef5-3b7c-476b-9c80-bfed8029ebf7/4/hilite/ A 4-4 split decision on an en banc rehearing by the full Second Circuit left the panel's decision for the case. The U.S. Department of Justice appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which has heard the case. A decision was expected by June 2018, but the CLOUD Act may render the question moot. The case is considered to highlight issues related to the antiquated nature of the SCA compared to modern Internet technologies. == Social media == At the time of the SCA's creation, social media platforms were not present in the context in that the legislation addressed. The SCA's limits are that of electronic communications that are not supposed to be available to the public.S. REP. NO. 99–541, at 35 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3589 Despite this, court's decisions like Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc evidence that SCA granted protections can be allocated to certain social media communication channels. ECS and RCS identification is necessary in a decision regarding the SCA's social media application. The courts in the Crispin c. Christian Audigier, Inc. stated \\"messages that have not yet been opened ... operate as ECS providers and the messages are in electronic storage because they fall within the definition of \\"temporary, intermediate storage\\" under § 2510(17)(A) ... messages that have been opened and retained ... [on social networking websites] operate as RCS providers providing storage services under § 2702(a)(2).Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 982. Wall postings and comments are not considered protectable as forms of temporary, intermediate storage. Wall posts and comments are stored for backup protection purposes, which means they are covered under SCA subsections (B). Wall posts and comments have been court- classified as electronic bulletin board service, or BBS. BBS, terminology used in the 1986 history of the SCA, defines BBS as communication networks by computer users to transfer information among computers that may be noncommercial systems being operated by users with shared interests.S. REP. NO. 99-541, at 8–9 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3572– 73. BBS available to the public is not covered by the SCA due to public access granted by the facilitator. However, if a user is restrictive of access to these communications on the account, then those communications are subject to SCA coverage.Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 991. It is unknown the level of specific BBSs privacy is sufficient for SCA protection. A numerical upper limit to the number of users, or \\"friends\\" a profile is connected to would be \\"arbitrary line drawing\\" leading to \\"anomalous result(s).\\"Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 990. In 2017, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found that the SCA did not prevent the personal representatives of a deceased person from accessing his emails.. == Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc. == In May 2010, a federal district court applied the SCA, for the first time, to data on social networking sites.Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 971 (C.D. Cal. 2010) The case intended to determine if the defendants could subpoena the plaintiff's electronic communications from the social media platforms Facebook, Media Temple, and MySpace. Buckley Crispin, the plaintiff, filed action against Christian Audigier, Christian Audigier, Inc., and their sublicensees. Crispin claimed that the defendants used his art in violation in which the defendants served subpoenas on the three aforementioned social media platforms. Crispin argued that these subpoenas sought electronic communications that ISPs do not have the authority to disclose under the SCA. When the judge claimed that social media platforms are not subject to the SCA, Crispin filed a motion to reconsider in the Central District of California.See Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 972 (C.D. Cal. 2010) Following this, determination of ECS or RCS had to be made for Facebook, Media Temple, and Myspace. The courts in this case held Facebook and MySpace to be RCS providers in regard to comments and wall posts as open messages.See Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 982 (C.D. Cal. 2010) Though these communications are not temporary or intermediate storage under subjection (A), the courts found that comments and wall posts are stored for purposes of backup protection. This means that they are covered by subsection (B) of the title.See Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 981-82 (C.D. Cal. 2010) == Robbins v. Lower Merion School District == The Act was invoked in the 2010 Robbins v. Lower Merion School District case, where plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools with secretly spying on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, violating their right to privacy. The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.\\"Initial LANrev System Findings\\" , LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services – prepared for Ballard Spahr (LMSD's counsel), May 2010. Retrieved August 15, 2010. == Criticisms == The language and provisions set during the 1986 year of the SCA do not comprehensively apply to modern day technology and the advancements. The SCA has led to ambiguity in compliance for ISPs as the legislation is outdated. This causes technology companies to take risks and alter their businesses to appease both domestic and international users who wish to access servers. Courts have become unsure of the way that SCA can apply to modern service providers, being given flexibility of interpretation. The result could be little protection actually offered.http://law.loyno.edu/sites/law.loyno.edu/files/Sossamon-FE-printer- ready-02.pdf Flexibility dictates that a court decision may come down to a rhetoric, like if a server is a storage site or a communications center (which could happen in the case of Gmail.) This makes it so that broad principles and interpretations are meant to keep pace with technology. A societal criticism of the SCA is that the courts should be looking at the intents of parties, rather than access to communications. This brings into question the role of service providers as neutral repositories for content.O'Grady v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 88 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006). In the modern space, service providers are unclear as to whether applying the SCA would be a violation of user privacy rights or not. As a result, non compliance to subpoena could have a legal and economic impact on service providers. The SCA is driven by case law and court interpretation. This can be criticized as an unstable grounds for an established standard. The SCA becomes less applicable as interpretations are stretched to meet new technology. Individual case law interpretations have the potential to leave undesirable political, social, and economic impacts both in the U.S. and globally. Absence of Congressional legislative SCA reform since its 1986 enactment has been its biggest criticism due to historical and projected technological growth. == References == Category:United States federal computing legislation Category:United States federal defense and national security legislation Category:1986 in law Category:Privacy of telecommunications Category:Privacy law in the United States ","title":"Stored Communications Act"},{"id":"20236653","text":"Liqeni i Hykajve në Baldushk Baldushk is a village and a former municipality in the Tirana County, central Albania.

While playing as a professional in Kazakhstan, Talgat Baysufinov called him \\"the little scoundrel\\", referring to his playing style on the field. ==Club career== Early career Kojašević signed his first professional contract with Montenegrin club Dečić at the age of 16. At the age of 18, he completed his first international transfer to Polish team Jagiellonia Białystok in 2008. At the age of 19, he was named the best foreign player in the Ekstraklasa. He left after a season due to a disagreement with the coach. He then returned to Montenegro and joined Zeta, with whom he played for three months. Sarajevo In 2010, Kojašević joined Bosnian team Sarajevo after being scouted by the club president at the time, Zijad Blekić. Over the course of two seasons with Sarajevo, he was considered to be one of the best players in the Premijer Liga. After the club told him they could not afford to pay his salary, Kojašević voluntarily terminated his contract. He subsequently joined Budućnost in a free transfer in January 2012, but played for them for only three months. Astana After only a brief period with Budućnost, Kojašević joined Kazakh side FC Astana in the spring of 2012. During his time with Astana, he enjoyed clubbing after games. In February 2015, Kojašević moved from Astana to Lokomotiv Tashkent on loan. Mladost Podgorica In August 2015, Kojašević turned down clubs from other countries to join Mladost Podgorica, citing family reasons. At Mladost his coach was Nikola Rakojević. In November 2015 he suffered a calf injury. Although he only spent a half-season at Mladost, Kojašević contributed to Mladost winning the league that season with seven goals. Soccerway: Montenegro First League 2015/16. Retrieved 5 August 2019. Vardar In December 2015, Kojašević signed with Vardar. He contributed in Vardar's first ever successful qualifying campaign to the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, and played in their historic upset of heavily favored Fenerbahçe in front of an audience of 45,000 at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium on 24 August 2017. Despite Vardar entering the Europa League group stage for the first time, Kojašević left the team before the group stage allegedly due to financial issues with club owner Sergey Samsonenko. Vardar ended up without a single win in Europa League Group L that season. Vojvodina In September 2017, Kojašević signed a one-year contract with Serbian club Vojvodina. On 29 September 2017, he scored two goals against Mladost Lučani. On 28 October 2017, he scored an olympic goal in a 3-0 win against Rad. On 3 December 2017, Kojašević scored a goal in a 1-1 tie against Partizan at their stadium in snowy conditions. In the half-season he played for Vojvodina, he scored four goals over the course of 14 matches. He was a teammate with Dušan Jovančić. Although he allegedly agreed to remain in Vojvodina for the remainder of the season, he terminated his contract in late January 2018. Shakhter Karagandy On 12 February 2018, Shakhter Karagandy announced the signing of Kojašević. At the time he joined, the team was coached by Uladzimir Zhuravel, with whom Kojašević worked well and got playing time. However, the team's record under Zhuravel experienced a period of losses in addition to Zhuravel's health problems. Later in 2018 Zhuravel was replaced by Nikolay Kostov, with whom Kojašević also saw playing time in addition to a significantly improved record during the season. In August 2018, Kojašević went to the coal mine in Karaganda with the rest of the team. Although he was initially scared, the mine left a strong impression with him, as he had never gone down a mine before. Radnički Niš On 16 January 2019, Kojašević joined Serbian club Radnički Niš. Coach Nenad Lalatović had insisted on Kojašević's signing, referring to him as one of the best playmakers in the Serbian SuperLiga. On 29 January 2019, he scored his first goal for Radnički Niš in a 3-0 friendly win against Russian club Avangard. On 7 April 2019, he scored two goals in a 5-1 win against OFK Bačka. Sutjeska Nikšić On 14 June 2019, Kojašević signed a one-year contract with Montenegrin club Sutjeska Nikšić. FK Sutjeska Nikšić: Damir Piksi Kojašević novo pojačaje Plavih . 14 June 2019. On 10 July 2019, he scored a goal in a 1-1 tie against Slovan Bratislava in the first leg of the first qualifying round for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. On 6 August 2019, he scored from a free kick in a 1-2 loss against Linfield in the first leg of the third qualifying round for the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League. ==International career== Kojašević was called up to the senior Montenegro squad for a friendly against Turkey in June 2016. However, he did not make his debut until substituting Marko Vešović in a match against Romania on 4 September 2016. Less than 10 minutes after coming on the field, Kojašević made an assist for teammate Stevan Jovetić, whose goal tied the game 1-1. On 27 March 2017, he made another assist for teammate Stefan Mugoša in his goal against Poland, although Montenegro ended up losing 1-2. As of September 2020, he has earned a total of 9 caps, scoring 1 goal. ==Career statistics== {  - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  OtherIncludes other competitive competitions, including the Kazakhstan Super Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

Cariaso is a Filipino-American coach and retired professional basketball player. He is the head coach of the Alaska Aces of the Philippine Basketball Association. He also played for various PBA teams, mostly with Alaska, for 15 seasons. He is known as The Jet. He is also the basketball operations director of Slam Magazine Philippines. ==Player profile== Alaska He was first drafted by the Alaska Aces (then known as the Alaska Milkmen) during the 1995 PBA draft as the sixth overall. During his rookie year, he won the Rookie of the Year Award. And in only his second year in the league, he achieved a rare Grand Slam with the Aces where he was instrumental in that majestic championship run, scoring the winning free throws in the All- Filipino Cup final against the Purefoods Hotdogs. Mobiline and Tanduay years Before the start of the 1997 PBA season, Cariaso was traded to the Mobiline Phone Pals (now known as the TNT Tropang Texters) where he was a primary offensive threat for the team. They won the special 1998 Centennial Cup. After his tenure with Mobiline, he was again sent to the expansion team Tanduay Rhum Masters. He bannered the team alongside Sonny Alvarado, Eric Menk and Rudy Hatfield. Reunion with Johnny Abarrientos After Tanduay folded in 2001, he was then picked by the Coca-Cola Tigers where he got reunited with Johnny Abarrientos. They won a couple of championships which include the 2002 All-Filipino Cup against his former team Alaska and the 2003 Reinforced Conference against San Miguel. He last tasted a championship with Talk 'N Text prior to this. He also received the most number of awards in his career during his tenure with the Tigers. Also, Coca-Cola was the only team that made it to the finals of all three conferences in 2003. Return to Alaska and twilight years In the middle of the 2004–05 PBA season, he along with Reynel Hugnatan were traded back to the Alaska Aces in exchange for all-stars John Arigo and Ali Peek. Cariaso was the last active player remaining on that Alaska Grand Slam team of 1996. In the semifinals of the 2010 PBA fiesta conference, he announced his retirement after playing 15 seasons in the league. His number 22 was also retired by the Alaska Aces and the Coca-Cola Tigers. ==Coaching profile== On April 29, 2014, Cariaso was named as the new head coach of Barangay Ginebra, replacing Ato Agustin.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/358796/sports/basketball/pba- jeffrey-cariaso-named-new-ginebra-head-coach-slam-ph Prior to this, he has no high-level head coaching experience. In fact, he has little coaching experience apart from San Mig Coffee, joining the team in 2011, one year after retiring as a player, to assist his former coach at Alaska, Tim Cone. At San Mig, he emerged as the top assistant, often taking over the reins when Cone was ejected, or when the team was getting blown out and the American coach wanted to send a message to his players. His tenure as coach of the Gin Kings did not produce much success, as the team failed to go beyond the quarterfinal rounds in the 2014 Governors' Cup and in the 2014-15 Philippine Cup. Moreover, the triangle offense system he uses did not sit well with the players. At the end of their Philippine Cup campaign, he was relieved of his coaching duties and was replaced by Ato Agustin. He still has one year and two conferences left in his contract, which was bought out, paving the way to his return to Alaska as assistant coach and camp director. ==Career statistics== http://www.pba-online.net/profile/Jeffrey-Cariaso/57/ -  align=\\"left\\"  1995  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  73  27.6 .484  .207  .803  3.9  1.5  .7  .1  11.4 -  align=\\"left\\"  1996  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  69  29.6  .493  .125  .807  4.3  2.0  .5  .3  11.8 -  align=\\"left\\"  1997  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  39  38.6  .425  .208  .766  7.0  4.0  1.0  .1  18.7 -  align=\\"left\\"  1998  align=\\"left\\"  Mobiline  23  42.3  .449  .091  .729  6.8  5.1  .9  .4  18.2 -  align=\\"left\\"  1999  align=\\"left\\"  Mobiline  35  36.1  .398  .318  .789  5.2  3.8  .7  .3  13.2 -  align=\\"left\\"  2000  align=\\"left\\"  Tanduay  44  37.0  .383  .222  .771  5.2  4.5  .7  .2  14.6 -  align=\\"left\\"  2001  align=\\"left\\"  Tanduay  35  36.3  .427  .299  .812  5.1  3.1  .7  .2  18.4 -  align=\\"left\\"  2002  align=\\"left\\"  Coca-Cola  12  28.0  .422  .392  .679  3.3  3.3  1.0  .2  19.2 -  align=\\"left\\"  2003  align=\\"left\\"  Coca-Cola  65  33.0  .405  .232  .841  4.3  3.7  .8  .1  15.4 -  align=\\"left\\"  2004-05  align=\\"left\\"  Coca-Cola/Alaska  71  34.0  .418  .377  .866  4.6  3.9  .7  .1  15.8 -  align=\\"left\\"  2005-06  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  49  34.7  .414  .288  .797  4.7  3.1  .6  .1  12.5 -  align=\\"left\\"  2006-07  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  45  34.2  .445  .308  .866  4.6  3.0  .6  .0  13.1 -  align=\\"left\\"  2007-08  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  45  29.6  .400  .349  .763  4.3  3.0  .6  .1  10.4 -  align=\\"left\\"  2008-09  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  40  21.6  .399  .275  .774  2.9  2.1  .3  .0  7.1 -  align=\\"left\\"  2009-10  align=\\"left\\"  Alaska  41  10.8  .356  .111  .696  1.3  1.1  .1  .1  2.8 -  align=\\"left\\"  Career  align=\\"left\\"   686  31.3  .426  .296  .802  4.4  3.0  .6  .1  13.1 ==Personal life== Cariaso is engaged to sports news reporter Erika Padilla, who was two months pregnant with her first child when he proposed.

He was educated at Lewis School, Pengam, and later at University College, Cardiff. Rocyn-Jones gained his MB in 1897 from the University of Edinburgh and then returned to Wales to become a general practitioner in Abertillery where he also held the post of chief surgeon at the Powell CollieriesSmith (1980), pg 310. and Honorary Surgeon to Abertillery RFC.Thomas, Irene and Thomas, Keith. 1983 Abertillery Rugby Football Club, the Centenary Book, Barry, Wales Stewart Williams. After passing his DPH qualification in Oxford, he was appointed the first Medical Officer for Health for Monmouthshire in 1908, responsible for ill-health prevention strategies within the county, with a yearly salary of £600. Retiring from this post in 1946, he was succeeded by his son, Gwyn. He was one of the founders of the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association, an organisation set up in 1911 to prevent and treat tuberculosis. Rocyn-Jones continued his relationship with University College, Cardiff, becoming its vice-president, and would later become involved in the creation of the University of Wales College of Medicine. In 1920 he was appointed a CBE, and in 1948 was knighted. ==Association to professional bodies== Rocyn-Jones served on many professional bodies, including the British Medical Association and St. John Ambulance. Outside of medicine, he also had a deep love and knowledge of rugby football and in 1947 became President of the Welsh Rugby Union, taking over from Horace Lyne, holding the post until his death in 1953. In 1964, his son Nathan would follow his father in also becoming President of the WRU. ==Private life== Rocyn Jones married Alla Jones in 1901. They had four sons, two of whom, Gwyn and Nathan, continued the family tradition of entering the medical profession. Nathan would not only follow his grandfather's profession, of working with bones, by becoming an orthopaedic surgeon, but would also continue the family links to rugby by representing Wales in 1925.

It was built in the 1960s on the site of St Alfege's Hospital, Greenwich. ==History== The hospital had its origins in St Alfege's Hospital in Greenwich which by the 1960s was in need of replacement. In order to build a hospital with a large enough capacity for the requirements of the local population (up to 800 beds) on a small site (less than 8 acres), a single large building was designed - Pevsner described it as \\"an unusually large enterprise to be undertaken by the Department of Health and Social Security (chief architect: W. E. Tatton Brown)\\". The new hospital was fully open by 1972, and it also absorbed services previously provided at the Miller General Hospital in west Greenwich, which finally closed in 1974. The wards were located around the outside of the building, to receive natural light, while other departments such as operating theatres and laboratories were situated in the centre. The engineering services were contained in gaps between the floor and ceiling of each pair of storeys, so that maintenance work could be carried out without disruption to the running of the clinical areas of the hospital. The interior design was based on large, open areas which maximised the use of the available space, and which could be altered to match changing demands. The entire hospital was ventilated artificially to improve air quality. The hospital closed in 2001, and its services were moved to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London. Some scenes from the film About A Boy, and the music video for Chain Reaction by the pop group Steps, were filmed in the closed hospital prior to its demolition in 2006. An adjacent health centre - described by Pevsner as \\"an ugly A-frame with forceful raking struts\\" has also since been demolished. ==See also== * List of hospitals in England ==References External links == * Greenwich District Hospital Category:Defunct hospitals in London Category:NHS hospitals in London Category:Former buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Greenwich Category:Hospitals disestablished in 2001 Category:2001 disestablishments in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2006 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London ","title":"Greenwich District Hospital"},{"id":"20236815","text":"Charles Guené (born 6 April 1952 in Puteaux) is a French politician and a member of the Senate of France.

It has a large base in Madhya Pradesh. The organization is believed to be the revived form of the pre-Independence era Abhinav Bharat Society. The activities of the organisations came into sharp focus after Maharashtra Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) arrested its member for Malegaon blast case. It has no relationship to the Mumbai-based charitable trust of the same name. ==History== Abhinav Bharat was named after the Abhinav Bharat Society, an organisation founded by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1904. The original organization believed in armed revolution, and was responsible for the assassinations of some officers of the ruling British government before being disbanded in 1952. The current Abhinav Bharat was founded in 2006 by Retired Major of Indian Army Ramesh UpadhyayHistory of LT COL involved in Bomb BlastsWho is Shrikant Purohit and Lt.Col.Prasad Shrikant Purohit. The first few meetings of the new group took place in 2007. Himani Savarkar, the niece of Nathuram Godse and the wife of Vinayak Savarkar's nephew, was elected president of the group in 2008. During the first few meetings of the organisation, the members discussed the idea that Hinduism was in danger, and needed to be defended. In 2008, several of its members were arrested on the suspicion of being involved in the 2006 Malegaon bombings, and its official website was closed down. ==Relationship with Sangh Parivar groups== Sangh Parivar representatives have distanced themselves from Abhinav Bharat (AB). Dr. Praveen Togadia, the former head of the VHP, fears that Abhinav Bharat is weaning away radicals from the VHP, from where much of the Abhinav Bharat membership originates. Among these included Sameer Kulkarni, the points-man for Abhinav Bharat in Madhya Pradesh, who was expelled from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in June 2008 for not following protocol within the organization. Abhinav Bharat has also been accused of plotting to kill senior RSS leaders including RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat who they thought weren't doing enough for Hindutva. The Caravan news magazine conducted interviews of to publish an exclusive profile, in which he named RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in relation to 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, Ajmer Dargah attack and Mecca Masjid bombing. Later, Swami Aseemanand called the magazine article \\"fabricated\\" and threatened to launch legal action against the Caravan journalist. However, the Caravan defended its report and released tape recordings and transcripts of the interviews. National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case against Aseemanand, said he never named any RSS leader during questioning. The RSS, too, has rubbished the allegations. The Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde seems to believe the report. ==Allegations of involvement in bombings== Following the arrest and investigation of Abhinav Bharat members Swami Aseemanand, Lt Col Shrikant Purohit, Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Lokesh Sharma, Kamal Chauhan, Sunil Joshi and Rajendra Choudhary in connection with the 2006 Malegaon blasts, the organization has been investigated for its alleged role in 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, Malegaon blasts, Mecca Masjid bombing, Ajmer Sharif Dargah blast and Jalna mosque bomb attack. In all these bombings 147 people were killed. Anti-Terrorism Squad Investigations have revealed that serving and retired army officers associated with Abhinav Bharat hijacked the organisation and motivated the youth to take up armed struggle against Muslims. Swapan Dasgupta notes that the group seemed little more \\"than a letterhead or part of a fantasy world\\". Praveen Mutalik, who was arrested for his alleged role in the 2008 Malegaon blasts, is alleged to have received more than Rs 300,000 from Prasad Shrikant Purohit, a co-founder of the Abhinav Bharat. Anti Terrorist Squad (India) has alleged that Ajay Rahirkar the treasurer of Abhinav Bharat received Rs 1 million from various Hawala sources. ==See also== * 2006 Malegaon blasts * 2007 Mecca Masjid bombing * 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings * 2008 Malegaon & Modasa bombing * Saffron Terror ==References== Category:Hindutva Category:Religiously motivated violence in India Category:Hinduism-motivated violence in India Category:Nationalist terrorism Category:Far-right politics in India ","title":"Abhinav Bharat"},{"id":"20236838","text":"Hubert Haenel (20 May 1942 – 10 August 2015) was a French politician and a member of the Senate of France.

Cambell, \\"Biographical Sketch of Charles C. Trowbridge,\\" read June 3, 1883, published in Pioneer Collections: Report of the Pioneer Society of the State of Michigan, 1907, pp. 478 - 491 was an explorer, politician, businessman, and ethnographer of Native American cultures who lived in Detroit during the 19th century.Charles Trowbridge House from the city of Detroit He was one of the first businessmen who emigrated to what was then the Michigan Territory. ==Early life== Charles Trowbridge was born on December 29, 1800 in Albany, New York; the youngest of six children born to Luther Trowbridge and Elizabeth Tillman Trowbridge. His father was a Revolutionary War veteran who had fought at the battles of Lexington and Saratoga, among others. Luther Trowbridge died in 1802, and Charles grew up with his mother. In 1813, Charles apprenticed to the businessman Horatio Ross of Owego, New York, who trained him as a merchant. In 1818, economic troubles bankrupted Ross, and Trowbridge, then not quite eighteen, was charged with closing up the business. Trowbridge continued independently in the merchant trade, but quickly decided to move west. In 1819, he secured a position with Major Thomas Rowland of Detroit as Deputy United States Marshal and deputy Clerk of the Court. ==Early career in Detroit== Historic Charles Trowbridge House (1826), Detroit's oldest known structure. Rowland encouraged Trowbridge to study law, and the young man quickly picked up a great deal of legal knowledge, and assisted in recording the 1820 census. In 1820, Trowbridge served on the Lewis Cass expedition, led by Lewis Cass, that officially explored the section of the Northwest Territory between the Great Lakes and the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Cass was impressed by Trowbridge, and made him his private secretary. In 1821, Trowbridge helped negotiate a treaty between the US government and the Winnebago and Menominee Indians. With this experience, and his knowledge of the Cherokee language, Trowbridge was appointed assistant secretary in the local Indian department, and soon after was also made interpreter. Around this time, Trowbridge was made secretary of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan. In 1823, Trowbridge was tasked with determining the relationships among the languages and customs of the indigenous tribes in the Northwest Territories. He worked at this, as well as his interpreter duties, through 1825, when he resigned his post in favor of becoming cashier of the newly established Bank of Michigan. In 1826, Trowbridge married Miss Catherine Whipple Sibley, oldest daughter of Solomon Sibley. That same year, he built his own home, the Charles Trowbridge House, on Jefferson Avenue on what was then farmland far from the heart of the city. At the time, it was considered to be the finest frame house in the Michigan territory. Trowbridge lived in this house for over 50 years, and it currently still stands as likely the oldest existing home in the city of Detroit. Trowbridge lived in the house until his death in 1883. ==Later career== In 1831, Lewis Cass was appointed Secretary of War, and invited Trowbridge to accompany him to Washington, D.C.. After much soul-searching, Trowbridge declined, preferring to stay in the private sector. He engaged in other enterprises over the next few years, including extensive land purchases. He was one of the original platters of the village of Allegan, Michigan. In 1833, Trowbridge became an alderman of the city of Detroit, and briefly served as Mayor during the cholera epidemic of 1834, resigning his position soon after. In 1837, he ran as the Whig candidate for governor of Michigan, and was defeated by Stevens T. Mason. Thereafter, he did not seek public office again. In 1844, he became president of the Michigan State Bank, leading that institution until its dissolution in 1853. He became secretary-treasurer, and later president, of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway Company and was one of the directors of the Detroit and St. Joseph Railway Company. Trowbridge also served on the boards of several charitable institutions, including as president of the Board of Public Charities, various bible and missionary societies, and the Historical and Algic Societies. ==See also== *Charles Trowbridge House ==References== Category:1800 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Politicians from Albany, New York Category:Detroit City Council members Category:Mayors of Detroit Category:Regents of the University of Michigan Category:United States Marshals Category:Michigan Whigs Category:19th-century American politicians Category:History of Detroit ","title":"Charles Christopher Trowbridge"},{"id":"20236964","text":"I Used To Be An Animal is an album by Eric Burdon from 1988.

Later Buckley teamed with drummer Ted Vining and pianist Don Wilde with Don Bennett as host to run the Cool Cats Show on Channel 7 for two years. For several years in the early 1960s Buckley dropped out of the Jazz scene to establish Buckley-Hutton laboratories, which would become one of the biggest dental labs in the southern hemisphere, and to devote time to family. He emerged in the late sixties teaming up with Brian Brown, Tony Gould and Ted Vining to form the Brian Brown Quartet. After a few years Gould left the group, replaced by a young Bob Sedergreen. Around 1969 the trio of Buckley, Sedergreen and Vining formed and played together for the next 37 years. The Quartet disbanded in 1979 when Vining moved north to Sydney then Brisbane. In the 1980s Buckley joined Martin Jackson (one of the founders of the Melbourne Jazz Co-operative) in his group Odwala and also participated in Sedergreen's Blues on the Boil, and performed with Bernie McGann.

She was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Following an early career as an Earth or Land artist, she became a Public Artist with commissions in Seattle, Washington, USA and then rose to international artistic significance (curated by Sarat Maharaj) with her post-conflict, post-colonial artist-as-witness / peace project: The Linen Memorial. Trouton has held visiting lectureships or done presentations at several higher education institutions, including Malmo Art School of Lund University, FLACSO Ecuador, University of Tasmania and Sheridan College, Toronto. In 1999, after a visit to Northern Ireland, Trouton received a $5,000 research grant from Canada Council of the Arts to begin researching a textile memorial to those killed in The Troubles of Northern Ireland. After several renamings, the piece would be called the Linen Memorial. The Memorial is a list of almost 4,000 of those who died in 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 2009 in a chronological Names List, embroidered on Irish Linen handkerchiefs. The Memorial was publicly unveiled in Ireland at a peace and reconciliation centre on the first Private Day of Reflection, 2007, on the sectarian violence. It formed the basis of Trouton's graduate thesis. It was also shown in Canberra's Design Centre, CraftACT, Australia, 2004, and in 2011 in Portneuf, Quebec, Canada as a part of Quebec's International Biennale of Flax and Linen (BILP). ==Early life== Dr Lycia Danielle Trouton is a sculptor (who also had youthful aspirations as an actress) and the daughter of an architect and an artist who became a special education teacher. She has an older sister Dr Konia Trouton MD and grew up in the tree-lined Dunbar- Southlands neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Lycia’s father reportedly named his daughters after the most beautiful cities in the ancient Asia Minor worlds, Lycia in Anatolia . She attended Crofton House School but, while becoming a model student and prefect, privately rebelled as a creative student. At the age of 13, Lycia studied painting, drawing and ceramics at one of the first classes for teenagers at the emerging Arts Umbrella on Granville Island and Speech Arts/Drama with the mother of CBC’s David Wisdom, (Gaye was a Canadian former-British WWII-era repertory theatre actress, Gay (Gladys) Scrivener Wisdom).See page 6 of The history of the Vancouver Little Theatre Association by Speech Arts teacher and Vancouver actress, Carol Nesbitt, UBC Master’s Thesis,1992. Trouton later went onto pre-college at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and Otis-Parsons, early 1980s, one of the major art institutions in Los Angeles, California, USA. She also studied at Carnegie Mellon—where Andy Warhol went to school—and under Sculptor Michael Hall, mid-west USA and with Tapestry Weaver Dr Diana Wood Conroy , Australia (2000s) – both published authors and cultural theorists. ==Education== Trouton obtained her BFA in sculpture at Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania, U.S.A in 1988 and then her MFA, at Cranbrook Educational Community School of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, U.S.A in 1991. She moved to Australia in 2001 and completed her doctorate in 2005 at the age of 38 at the University of Wollongong,Thesis: An intimate monument: re-narrating 'the troubles' in Northern Ireland 2001-5.

Alfredson has received the Guldbagge award for Best Direction twice; in 2005 for Four Shades of Brown, and in 2008 for Let the Right One In. He is the son of director and actor Hans Alfredson and the brother of director Daniel Alfredson. ==Early life== Alfredson was born in 1965 in Lidingö, Stockholms län, Sweden, the son of Gunilla and comedian, writer, and director Hans \\"Hasse\\" Alfredson. Tomas was used to being treated differently from an early age. \\"[A small] number of people were public property, and he was one of them,\\" Alfredson said of his father. Hasse was seldom home, and Tomas was mostly raised by his mother. \\"But I participated in [Hasse's] film productions every summer, it was probably a way for us to reach each other (...) I thought it was great fun.\\" Alfredson would often have minor roles in the Hasseåtage series of popular films, that featured the comedy-duo of his father and Tage Danielsson – such as the role of the \\"Count\\" in The Apple War (1971), his sole line of dialogue being \\"Adieu, mon plaisir\\" (\\"Goodbye, my pleasure\\"). ==Directing career== Alfredson's career started at Svensk Filmindustri, where he worked as an assistant. He was involved in the creation of the Swedish television channel TV4, where he worked in the entertainment department. One of his successes was the Swedish adaptation of Fort Boyard, \\"Fångarna på Fortet\\". Alfredson then moved on to Sveriges Television, creating television series such as Ikas TV- kalas, a children's television show starring Ika Nord, who would later appear in Alfredson's 2008 film Let the Right One In. According to Nord, Alfredson was \\"only 25, but already extremely knowledgeable\\". In 1994 Alfredson directed Bert, another tv production based on the Bert diaries, a popular series of teenage novels written in the diary form. A feature film, Bert: The Last Virgin, based on the series was made in 1995, for which Alfredson received a Guldbagge nomination for Best Direction. Alfredson joined the Swedish comedy group Killinggänget as a director in 1999. \\"I saw that they were a little funnier than the others, and a little more thorough\\", he said. His first collaboration with the group was a 1999 series of four television films, including the mockumentary Screwed in Tallinn, which depicts a group of Swedish bachelors who travel to Estonia by bus in the hopes of finding Estonian girlfriends. The 2004 film Four Shades of Brown, directed by Alfredson, is Killinggänget's only feature film to date. The film intertwines four unrelated stories with a common theme of betrayal, in particular parents betraying their children. The film received four Guldbagge awards, including Best Direction for Alfredson. Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist released his debut horror novel Let the Right One In in 2004. After reading the novel, Alfredson wanted to get involved in a film adaptation, and approached Lindqvist: \\"They was a crowd banging on his door to make a movie, so I was #40 or something. When we met, he knew of me and he liked what I'd done previously, and we got along together very well.\\" The film tells the story of a 12-year-old bullied boy who befriends a child vampire in early 1980s Blackeberg, Sweden. In addition to directing, Alfredson edited the film in collaboration with Dino Jonsäter. Let the Right One In premiered on 26 January 2008 at the Göteborg International Film Festival, where Alfredson won the Festival's Nordic Film Prize. The film went on to win additional awards, including the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film quickly became an international success, with the rights being sold to more than forty countries before its theatrical release on 24 October 2008. Domestically, the film won five Guldbagge Awards, with Alfredson receiving his second Guldbagge Award for Best Direction. International career After finishing the work on Let the Right One In, Alfredson publicly announced that he would not be making any more films in the \\"foreseeable future\\". He stated that he had grown tired with the Swedish film and television industry, which he considered \\"drained of power, courage, and gravity.\\" While he had received several offers from Hollywood producers, he was reluctant to leave his \\"home, children and all the colleagues I depend on to be good.\\" However, in March 2009 he announced that he would partake in a big international film production. In July 2009, Alfredson signed to direct a film adaptation of John le Carré's 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Produced by Working Title Films' Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, it premiered in September 2011 at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. In 2012, it was announced that Alfredson had acquired the rights to make a film adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's novel The Brothers Lionheart, with Alfredson planning to direct and John Ajvide Lindqvist to write the screenplay. In 2017, Alfredson directed the widely panned The Snowman. Despite the all-star cast and popular book series by Jo Nesbø, the movie was derided by critics and received a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_snowman_2017#contentReviews ==Personal life== Alfredson is the brother of film director Daniel Alfredson. He has two children with his ex-wife Cissi Elwin Frenkel, who was managing director of the Swedish Film Institute.
