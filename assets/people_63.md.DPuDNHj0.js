She's never been able to establish her biological parents' identities and accepted the day she'd been found as her birthday. Her foster mother Elizaveta Ivanovna was an amateur actress and singer who worked at the popular Shepelev Theatre, and from an early age Polina made up her mind that she'd follow her footsteps. Strepetova started to perform at the Nizhny City theatre from age seven and was recognized as an exceptionally gifted child, but failed to receive any formal education. She made her major debut in 1865 on stage the Rybinsk Theatre and in the course of the next three years undertook more than one hundred parts, moving from one provincial city theatre to another: from Rybinsk to Yaroslavl, then Simbirsk, Murom, Novgorod, Samara, Oryol and Kazan. 1882 portrait by Repin She enjoyed her first success in Yaroslavl, as Lizaveta in A Bitter Fate by Alexey Pisemsky, then repeated this triumph in Samara, aged nineteen. Exceptionally well received here were also her performances as Verochka in A Child by Pyotr Boborykin and Sofia in All Will Be Well, by Ivan Samarin. Total lack of education at that stage apparently did not bother Strepetova: she was learning fast, from her better-known colleagues, mostly Lyubov Nikulina- Kositskaya and Alexandra Schubert, as well as Modest Pisarev, her future husband. It was only in the 1880s that it became obvious that Strepetova's artistic palette was limited, and her inability to develop it or adapt to the changing public tastes started to undermine her reputation of a great actress. Strepetova's success story continued in Kazan, where in 1871 she starred as Marya Andreyevna in The Poor Bride, by Alexander Ostrovsky, as well as Anneta in The Family Schemes, by Nikolai Kulikov. The latter (taken in its development over the years) came later to be regarded as her most profound achievement on stage, next to Lizaveta, which continued to be her trademark part for thirty years. Her other notable roles of the time were Liza (Woe from Wit, Alexander Griboyedov), Dunya (Stay in Your Own Sled) and Katerina (The Storm), both by Alexander Ostrovsky. –ü–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –ê–Ω—Ç–∏–ø—å–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –°—Ç—Ä–µ–ø–µ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ at the St Petersburg Funeral site Strepetova as Lizaveta. 1881 portrait by Repin In 1873 Strepetova started to enjoy her first triumphs in Moscow where she joined the Moscow Public Theatre, ran by Urusov and Taneyev. Later, in 1880, she had a stint with Anna Brenko's Pushkin Theatre where she became the prima to a very strong troupe, but had to leave for Petersburg after the theatre went bust. Before that she became hugely popular with the Moscow artistic and literary elite, Ivan Turgenev, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and Pyotr Chaykovsky counting themselves among the admirers of her talent. The portraits of her were painted by Ilya Repin, Viktor Vasnetsov and Nikolai Yaroshenko. The journalist, editor and memoirist Alexandra Jacobi became a friend, and later published memoirs on Strepetova. In 1876 she appeared on stage the Alexandrinsky Theatre for the first time, as Lizaveta again, but was invited to the troupe only five years later. Her nine year stay at the leading Imperial theatre was marred by conflicts with her more successful and versatile rival Maria Savina, petty scandals regarding wages and much intrigue on the parts of both her detractors and followers. Besides, her passionate, overemotional manner of playing was considered provincial and old-fashioned among the Petersburg theatrical society. She had more than thirty parts in Alexandrinka between 1881 and 1890, but of the 22 new ones only three were later recognized as consistent with the level of her scenic gift: Kruchinina (Guilty Without Fault, Ostrovsky), Stepanida (Close to the Money, Viktor Krylov) and Sarra (Ivanov, Anton Chekhov). In 1886 Ostrovsky, who invariably supported Strepetova in her feuds with the theatre administration, died. Unpopular with the troupe, she found herself in isolation, and in 1890 had to leave Alexandrinka. Her final success was Matryona in Lev Tolstoy's Power of Darkness, at the Literature and Art Circle theatre, in 1895. Strepetova spent the last years of her life in Petersburg, where in 1896-1897 she played at the Maly Suvorinsky Theatre and later worked on a book of memoirs called Minuvshiye dni (–ú–∏–Ω—É–≤—à–∏–µ –¥–Ω–∏, Days Long Gone), which remained unfinished. Strepetova died in Saint Petersburg on 17 October 1903, of stomach cancer, and was interred in the Nikolskoe Cemetery. In 1936 her ashes were relocated to the Masters of Arts Necropolis. == References == Category:Imperial Russian actresses Category:1850 births Category:1903 deaths Category:People from Nizhny Novgorod Category:Burials at Tikhvin Cemetery ","title":"Polina Strepetova"},{"id":"56849917","text":"The 1956 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Women's Doubles was the 22nd edition of the women's doubles championship.

Its surviving archives‚Äîin Cape Town, Colombo, Chennai, Jakarta, and The Hague‚Äîhave been measured (by a consortium applying for a UNESCO grant to preserve them) in kilometers. In innumerable ways, the VOC both expanded the world and brought its far-flung regions together. It introduced Europe to Asia and Africa, and vice versa (while its sister multinational, the West India Company, set New York City in motion and colonized Brazil and the Caribbean Islands). It pioneered globalization and invented what might be the first modern bureaucracy.

(SAGE Publications Ltd., 2012) , p. 431 As an early pioneering model of the modern corporation, the VOC was the first corporation to be ever actually listed on a formal stock exchange. In the early 1600s the VOC became the world's first formally listed public company (or publicly listed company) by widely issuing bonds and shares of stock to the general public. In many respects, modern-day publicly listed multinational corporations (including Forbes Global 2000 companies) are all 'descendants' of the 17th-century VOC business model. For almost 200 years of its existence (1602‚Äì1800), the Company played crucial roles in business, financial, socio-politico-economic, military-political, diplomatic, legal, ethnic, and exploratory maritime history of the world. In the early modern period, the VOC was the driving force behind the rise of corporate-led globalization, corporate power, corporate identity, corporate culture, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, corporate finance, corporate capitalism, and finance capitalism. It was the VOC's institutional innovations and business practices that laid the foundations for the rise of giant global corporations to become highly significant and formidable socio-politico-economic forcesIn John Kenneth Galbraith's words, \\"The institution that most changes our lives we least understand or, more correctly, seek most elaborately to misunderstand. That is the modern corporation. Week by week, month by month, year by year, it exercises a greater influence on our livelihood and the way we live than unions, universities, politicians, the government.\\" (\\"The Age of Uncertainty\\", 1977)Macleod, Sorcha; Lewis, Douglas (2004). ‚ÄúTransnational Corporations: Power, Influence and Responsibility‚Äù, Global Social Policy [4:1], pp. 77‚Äì98.

(Intereconomics 18.3 (1983): 130‚Äì136) These pioneering innovations allowed a single business enterprise like the VOC to mobilize financial resources from a large number of investors and create ventures at a scale that had previously only been possible for monarchs. The Company also played a major role in the rise of Amsterdam as the first modern model of international financial centres. With its pioneering institutional innovations and powerful roles in world history, the Company is considered by many to be the first major, first modern,Wilson, Eric Michael: The Savage Republic: De Indis of Hugo Grotius, Republicanism and Dutch Hegemony within the Early Modern World-System (c.1600‚Äì1619). (Martinus Nijhoff, 2008) , p. 215‚Äì217. Eric Michael Wilson (2008): \\"The defining characteristics of the modern corporation, all of which emerged during the Dutch cycle, include: limited liability for investors, free transferability of investor interests, legal personality and centralised management. Although some of these characteristics were present to a certain extent in the fourteenth-century Genoese societas comperarum of the first cycle, the first wholly cognisable modern limited liability public company was the VOC.\\" first global, most valuable, most important, and most influential corporation ever seen. In terms of military and political history, along with the Dutch West India Company (WIC/GWIC), the VOC was seen as the international arm of the Dutch Republic and the symbolic power of the Dutch Empire. The VOC was historically a military-political- economic complex rather than a pure trading company or shipping company. The Company's activities had seminal influence on the early modern history of many countries and territories around the world such as the Dutch Republic (United Provinces of the Netherlands), New Netherland (North America), Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Mauritius, Taiwan, and Japan. In the Golden Age of Dutch cartography (c. 1570s‚Äì1670s), VOC navigators and cartographers helped shape cartographic and geographic knowledge of the modern-day world. The commercial network of the VOC provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. In terms of exploratory maritime history of the world, as a major force behind the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s), the VOC-funded exploratory voyages such as those led by Willem Janszoon (Duyfken), Henry Hudson (Halve Maen), and Abel Tasman revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. The VOC's navigators and explorers were the first non-natives to undisputedly discover, explore and chart coastlines of mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga. Australia was the last human-inhabited continent to be methodologically explored and mapped. In the 17th century, VOC navigators and explorers charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast. In spite of the VOC's historic roles and contributions, the Company has long been criticized for its monopoly, violence, colonialism, slave trade, exploitation (including use of slave labour), and environmental destruction. In Graham Harman's words (2016), \\"One of the paradoxes of the Company [VOC] is that the Dutch were the most liberal and humane nation in Europe at that time, and yet they created in the Company a very efficient monstrosity.\\" The Company's alternative names that have been used include the Dutch East Indies Company, United East India Company, United East Indian Company, United East Indies Company, Jan Compagnie, or Jan Company.

On July 7, 2015, the wreck of the Lakeland was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The Lakeland (official number 126420) was built in 1887 in Cleveland, Ohio, by the Globe Iron Works Company as the first generation steel Great Lakes freighter Cambria. She was originally built for the Mutual Transportation Company which was controlled by the Federal Steel Company that was owned by Elbert H. Gary. She had an overall length of , which made her the first 300-foot vessel on the lakes; she also had a length of between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a 1,200 horsepower triple expansion steam engine which was fueled by two coal burning Scotch marine boilers. She had a gross tonnage of 1878.10 tons and a net tonnage of 1377.33 tons.The earliest known photograph of the Cambria The Cambria was launched in Cleveland on February 1, 1887, as hull number #12. At the time of her construction she was only the second lake freighter built by Globe Iron Works Company to have a steel hull. She was also the first lake freighter equipped with a triple expansion steam engine. She was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain, salt and later automobiles. In June 1888 the Cambria ran aground southwest of Peninsula Point Light on Lake Michigan with a cargo of iron ore weighing 2,334 tons. The grounding tore a hole in her hull. The Lakeland as a passenger steamer circa 1915 In 1910 the Cambria was taken to the Milwaukee Dry Dock Company to be converted to a passenger vessel, but the Milwaukee Dry Dock Company was unable to complete the conversion. Eventually the wrecking tug Favorite towed her to Cleveland for the conversion to be finished. In May 1910 she was renamed Lakeland. In September 1910 the Lakeland collided with the steam barge John Smeaton in the St. Marys River. She ran aground after the collision. In early 1920 the Lakeland was converted from a passenger ship to an automobile carrying vessel. The Lakeland did not sail for the 1923 season because she had a major overhaul. She had her boiler room moved; she also had a brand new watertight bulkhead installed. The other new things included two new Scotch marine boilers, and a new pilothouse. She also had her ballast pump repaired, and several cracked frames replaced. In the fall of 1924 the Lakeland went into a dry dock in Detroit, Michigan, to have a twisted rudder stock repaired; the inspectors also examined her entire hull and her rudder. ==Final voyage== On December 3, 1924, the Lakeland was sailing in calm conditions across Lake Michigan from Chicago, Illinois, to Detroit, Michigan, with a cargo of 22 Nash and Kissel, and 1 Rollin automobile in her hold. She had been experiencing some minor leakage, but it was manageable. At around 11:30A.M., the Lakeland sprang a serious leak. When her crew discovered the leak, they tried to keep the water out of her hull by turning her pumps to their full speed; but eventually the leak got so bad that Captain John McNeely was forced to turn the Lakeland around in an effort to reach shallow water. When the Lakeland was about 9 miles from shore it became obvious that the effort to keep her afloat was futile. Some of her crew abandoned ship via the lifeboats. Eventually the Ann Arbor No.6 came alongside the Lakeland, but Captain McNeely allegedly refused a tow from her. By the time the coast guard arrived, the Lakeland was listing to port at a dangerous angle. Eventually Captain Robert Anderson ordered the remaining men on the Lakeland to climb onto his cutter. Meanwhile, the steamer Signus stood by. The Lakeland sank stern first and broke in two. Her lights flickered until her deck disappeared beneath the surface. As she sank, the radio operator on the Ann Arbor No.6, Elliot Jacobson took some photographs of her. In mid-1925 the insurance company that owed the Lakelands owners $450,000 started a search for her wreck to investigate the circumstances of her loss. Eventually the fishing tugs Albert C. and the Four Brothers discovered her wreck. Technical divers using new helium and oxygen technology were the first people to dive the wreck; this was also the first time mixed gas diving suits were put to a practical test on the lakes. The divers made several dives from the deck of the steam barge Chittendon. They made the discovery that all of the Lakeland seacocks had been opened prior to her sinking. The Thompson Transportation Company, the company that owned the Lakeland was taken to court by sixteen insurance companies; the insurance companies tried to prove that the Lakeland captain scuttled her because of financial problems the Thompson Transportation Company was having. The case of her sinking went to court twice, but the insurance companies made a third attempt to take the case to court: eventually the findings went to the Lakeland owners. It is believed that eventually the insurance companies came to an out of court agreement with the owners of the Lakeland. ==The Lakeland today== The wreck of the Lakeland was rediscovered in 1960. She rests upright, in of water. Her steel hull is almost broken in two aft of the cargo elevator, and her wooden deckhouses are missing. This is because when she sank, the air that trapped in the upper deck structures blew the wooden deck houses off her hull. The passenger deck on her bow has several cracks which allow divers to access her interior. In the 1970s a 1924 Rollin car was salvaged, but problems that occurred while salvaging led to the car being taken to a scrapyard. Another artifact that was retrieved was the Lakeland brass steam whistle which is on display in the Door County Maritime Museum. Her anchor was also salvaged. There are still Nash and Kissel automobiles in her hold. Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the large wooden bulk carriers Australasia and the Frank O'Connor, the wooden steamer Louisiana which was lost during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, the schooner Christina Nilsson and the steamboat Joys. ==References Historic photos of the Lakeland Category:1887 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1924 Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Door County, Wisconsin Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Michigan Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Door County, Wisconsin Category:Shipwrecks of the Wisconsin coast Category:Ships sunk with no fatalities Category:Ships built in Cleveland ","title":"SS Lakeland"},{"id":"56850226","text":"Jumber Jikia (; b. 1950) is a sculptor from Georgia.

She was an autodidact who worked in a variety of media prior to creating the visual works for which she is known. She was a precocious writer of poems and stories, which were never published, and also wrote for several daily papers, working as a journalist. She enjoyed organizing poetry evenings and befriended well known Uruguayan poetess Juana de Ibarbourou She began painting intermittently in the early 1950s but it wasn't until 1965, after a period of severe depression, that she began to paint regularly. This activity became central to her existence with periods of intense creative work during which she would paint day and night. Depression, occasionally so intense that it resulted in suicide attempts, continued to plague her and in 1992 she took her own life. ==Collections and exhibits== Magali Herrera's work is primarily held in the Collection de l'Art Brut museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her works have been featured in Collection de l'Art Brut exhibitions including a 1996 retrospective and the Art Brut Biennial II: Architectures, in 2015 for which an accompanying catalog of the exhibition Architecture: Art Brut the Collection, published by 5 Continents Editions, was produced A selection of her work was presented by Galerie Christian Berst (wiki fr) at the 2010 Art Paris.

He creates acrylic paintings using a combination of digital and analog techniques including silk-screening; digital painting; and the manipulation of photocopies, photographs and PDFs through smartphone applications. His practice has been described as its ‚Äúown distinctive kind of post-digital abstraction.‚Äù Lund's work concerns the ‚Äúmodularity and scalability‚Äù of analog painting. As described by critic and art historian Alex Bacon, Lund's paintings evoke an uncanny ‚Äúscreen-space‚Äù that is produced in an ‚Äúanalog-mode‚Äù via a silk-screening process, a concept that the artist refers to as ‚Äúanalog.jpg‚Äù. In his recent work, this process involves imprinting the palette knife through a silk screen onto the warp and weft of raw, coarse canvas. The result is a dappled or ‚Äúpixelated‚Äù miasma of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Thea Ballard describes Lund's regimented technique as ‚Äúascetic‚Äù: > ‚ÄúThis method is perhaps ascetic, following strict parameters of both process > and dimension; most of his works conform to the dimensions of 8.5 x 11 > inches (such economical tendencies nod to Lund‚Äôs roots in hardcore punk and > zine-making). His initial experiments were rendered in black and white, but > Lund also uses cyan, magenta, and yellow ink, a nod to CMYK printing, method > commonly used reproduce photographs in print, in which these colors overlap > to create a spectrum.‚Äù Working within a set of specific material constraints, Lund pushes painterly abstraction to its absolute limit. Ballard continues: ‚ÄúThe canvas itself is less an endpoint than several (or maybe infinite?) portals or nodes through which these images are transferred.‚Äù The artist's background in hardcore punk, according to Ballard, brings a sense of musicality to bear on his work: ‚ÄúLund is fond of the term noise, which here stands in well for texture, inscribing the work with a dissident musicality.‚Äù Laura McLean-Ferris alternately describes this aural quality as ‚Äúthe snow crash of white noise.‚Äù She writes: ‚ÄúWhat the noiselike qualities of Lund‚Äôs paintings, scatterings of buzz and drag, also powerfully resist is translatability, another historic signifying system that has classically been attached to painting.‚Äù == Exhibitions == Israel Lund's work has been shown at The Rachofsky Collection, The Warehous, Dallas; David Lewis, New York; Lumber Room, Portland; Base Arte Contemporanea Odierna (BACO) in collaboration with Galleria d‚ÄôArte Modernae Contemporanea di Bersgamo (GAMeC); White Flag Projects, St. Louis; and The Power Station, Dallas; among others. == Collections == Lund's work is featured in the collections of the Base Arte Contemporanea Odierna (BACO), Bergamo, Italy; Bienecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale, New Haven; Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick; Cincinnati Art Museum, Cincinnati; Cleveland Museum of Art; Dallas Museum of Art; Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; MoMA Library, New York; Phoenix Art Museum; Princeton University Art Museum; and the UBS Art Collection, Z√ºrich. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1980 births Category:People from Bellows Falls, Vermont Category:Artists from Brooklyn Category:American male painters ","title":"Israel Lund"},{"id":"56850292","text":"Alec Brook (1911-1986), was a male English international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won a bronze medal in the 1933 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Adrian Haydon, David Jones, Andrew Millar and Edward Rimer for England.

It served in Home Defence and provided heavy artillery support to the armies on the Western Front and Italian Front in World War I. In the interwar years it became 204 (Warwickshire) Battery serving in various regiments and formations before being expanded into a full regiment. In World War II it served in the heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) role defending its home area of the West Midlands against German air attack (particularly in the notorious Coventry Blitz), and then defended Calcutta against Japanese attacks. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1955. ==Origins== 4.7-inch gun on 'Woolwich' carriage, ca 1914 When the Territorial Force (TF) was created in 1908 as part of the Haldane Reforms,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. each of its infantry divisions included a heavy artillery battery in its establishment.Conrad, British Army 1914'. For the South Midland Division a new battery was raised in Birmingham, under the title of South Midland (Warwickshire) Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The battery was equipped with four Boer War-era 4.7-inch guns. It was based at the Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company works at Saltley, and was organised as follows:Frederick, p. 696‚Äì9.Litchfield, pp. 237‚Äì41.South Midlands (Warwickshire) RGA at Regiments.orgArmy List.Saltley at Drill Hall Project.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 77‚Äì83. * HQ at Metropolitan Works, Saltley * Heavy Battery at Saltley * Ammunition Column at Wednesbury ==World War IMobilisation=== The South Midland Division mobilised on the outbreak of World War I and took up its war stations around Chelmsford in Essex as part of Central Force. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. Hence the South Midland RGA formed 1/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery) for overseas service (usually referred to as 1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Battery in army documents) and the 2/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery for Home Defence and to provide drafts to the 1st Line.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2. === 1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Battery=== Western Front The South Midland Division was ordered to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France on 13 March 1915, and the artillery embarked at Southampton for Le Havre, the 1/1st Battery disembarking on 31 March. By 4 April the division had taken over a section of the front line near Cassel. However, artillery policy in the BEF was to withdraw heavy batteries from the divisions and group them into dedicated heavy artillery brigades, so on 16 April the battery left the South Midland Division to join Second Army Artillery in time for the Second Battle of Ypres. At this time the practice was to move batteries between heavy brigades (later heavy artillery groups or HAGs) as required, so the 1/1st Warwickshire Bty moved to XVI Brigade RGA on 10 June, to VIII Brigade RGA on 3 July, to III Corps Artillery with First Army on 21 August, and IV Heavy Bde on 10 November.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E. 4.7-inch gun on the Somme, 1916 In early 1916 the battery was moved again, to 12th HAG with Second Army (10 April), to 'Loring's Group' with I ANZAC Corps (19 May), then to 44th (South African) HAG (5 August), and on to 34th HAG (27 August), which joined Fourth Army on the Somme in September. After the Somme fighting died down, the battery moved within Fourth Army to 7th HAG (30 November) and back to 44th (SA) HAG (23 December).'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. By the end of 1916 the obsolete 4.7-inch gun had been largely superseded on the Western Front by the modern 60-pounder. On 28 February 1917 the battery was made up to a strength of six guns when it was joined by a section from the newly-arrived 199th Heavy Bty. It then moved north on 13 March to join 15th HAG with First Army, arriving on 21 March. Soon afterwards (15 April) it was switched south again to Fifth Army where it joined 9th HAG on 20 April. Through the early summer the battery continued to be switched rapidly from one HAG to another: 42nd (arriving 19 May), 16th with Third Army (5 July), 52nd with Second Army (9 July), 99th (12 July), then back to 52nd (6 August), and finally 11th (7 September). RGA manhandling a 60-pounder gun at Ypres, 1917 By now, Second Army was involved in the Third Ypres Offensive, taking the lead at the Battles of the Menin Road Ridge, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde, which were notable artillery victories. The 60-pounders were used for counter-battery (CB) fire before the attack, and then as part of the creeping barrage that led the infantry onto their objectives.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 205‚Äì11.Wolff, pp. 191‚Äì5, 199, 207‚Äì8. However, the subsequent attacks (the Battles of Poelcappelle, First Passchendaele and Second Passchendaele) were failures. The British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and suffered badly from counter-battery fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 211‚Äì13.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì35, 249‚Äì51. While the Ypres offensive was still continuing, the German and Austrian victory at Caporetto on the Italian Front led to British forces being rushed from Flanders to shore up the Italian Army. Even before their defeat the Italians had asked for the loan of heavy artillery, and now a number of units were hurriedly sent by rail, including 1/1st Warwickshire Battery, which went on 14 November.Campbell, pp. 91‚Äì104.Falls, pp. 73‚Äì5, 89‚Äì91.John Turner, 'Lloyd George, the War Cabinet and High Politics', in Liddle (ed), p. 21.Wolff, pp. 252‚Äì3, 274. Italian Front On arrival, 1/1st Warwickshire Bty joined 24th HAG (renamed 24th Bde RGA in February 1918), with which it remained for the rest of the war. The battery was the only 60-pounder unit in the brigade, the rest being the 105th, 172nd, 229th and 247th Siege Btys. By 6 December its guns went into action on the Montello Hill, supporting the Italian army, which had been critically short of heavy artillery. The situation was stabilised by the end of the year, but 24th HAG remained in Italy.Falls, pp. 89‚Äì92, 131‚Äì2, 143.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 176‚Äì7.Shepard's summary, in Campbell, pp. 122‚Äì5.Thompson, pp. 328‚Äì30. Apart from some CB shoots, there was little activity through the winter months.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, p. 183. At the end of March 1918, 1/1st Warwickshire Hvy Bty moved to a position south of the Asiago plateau supporting VIII Italian Corps. The gunsites were in wooded mountainous terrain and the guns had to be manhandled into position. They carried out trench bombardment while awaiting the next Austrian offensive (the Second Battle of the Piave River). This finally came on 15 June. Despite some initial Austrian gains, 48th (South Midland) Division held its main positions. The British heavy batteries systematically destroyed the Austrian guns on the Asiago, notwithstanding poor visibility early on (Royal Air Force observation aircraft were able to direct the fire later) and the Austrian offensive failed all along the front.Falls, pp. 157‚Äì67.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 184‚Äì8.Thompson, pp. 344‚Äì7.Kurt Peball, 'The Piave: Austria's last Throw', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 6, pp. 2833‚Äì8. Preparations then began for the final battle on the Italian Front, the stunning success of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. The British were relieved in the Asiago sector and moved to join the British-commanded Tenth Italian Army near Treviso. 24th HAG supported a number of British and French raids during September and October, then on 23 October the preliminary attacks began, supported by 24th HAG's guns. The main British assault crossed the River Piave on 27 October, with the heavy guns engaging all known Austrian gun positions and providing a protective barrage on either flank. A bridge was ready by 29 October and the heavy guns crossed the river. By 1 November the Austrian army had collapsed and the pursuing British troops had left their heavy guns far in the rear. Austrian signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November, ending the war in Italy.Falls, pp. 169-77.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 189‚Äì92.Thompson, pp. 356‚Äì64.Franco Velsecchi, 'Vittorio Veneto', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 14, pp. 3064‚Äì71. After the Armistice, 24th HAG was involved in securing prisoners and captured enemy guns. Demobilisation of the batteries in Italy began at Christmas 1918 and by March they were down to cadre strength. 1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Bty passed into suspended animation in 1919.Campbell, pp. 106‚Äì19. === 2/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery=== The 2/1st Battery served in 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, first at Northampton in First Army, Central Force, then at Chelmsford when it replaced the 1st South Midland Division in coastal defence. In February 1916 the battery left the division and took over the old 4.7-inch guns of 117th Heavy Battery RGA, which was preparing to move to France.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 33‚Äì39. For the rest of the war 2/1st Battery served in Home Defence, from September 1916 to August 1917 with 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division at Ramsgate and Sandwich in Kent, and from January 1918 until the Armistice with the Cyclist Division at Ramsgate.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 35, 77, 82.Farndale, Home Base, Annex 7. ==Interwar204 (Warwickshire) Medium Battery=== ::Not to be confused with the present day 204 (Tyneside Scottish) Battery The battery was reformed on 7 February 1920 at Saltley as 204 (Warwickshire) Medium Battery, forming part of 7th (Cornwall and Warwickshire) Medium Brigade, RGA , which became 51st (Cornwall and Warwickshire) Medium Brigade, RGA when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921. This was an awkward arrangement, Saltley being many miles from the brigade HQ at Truro and the other batteries at Padstow, Par and Penzance.Frederick, pp. 723, 733.Titles & Designations, 1927.Litchfield, p. 34. On 1 October 1932 the brigade was broken up: the Cornish elements were separated to form a new 56th (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft (AA) brigade, while a new 51st (Midland) Medium Brigade was formed in which 204 (Warwickshire) Bty was brigaded with geographically closer batteries from Staffordshire and Shropshire. ===204 (Warwickshire) Anti-Aircraft Battery=== During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of existing TA units into AA units. On 1 October 1937, 204 (Warwickshire) Bty was converted and transferred to a new 73rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Wolverhampton.Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì9, 774, 778.95 HAA Rgt at Regiments.org.4 AA Division 1939 at British Military History ===95th (Birmingham) AA Regiment=== On 1 April 1939 the battery was transferred yet again, this time to provide the experienced cadre for a newly formed 95th (Birmingham) AA Regiment (RA 'brigades' became 'regiments' on 1 January 1939): * RHQ at Washwood Heath, Birmingham * 204 (Warwickshire) AA Bty at Saltley * 293 AA Bty at Washwood Heath ==World War IIMobilisation=== The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations ahead of the declaration of war.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 95th AA Regiment formed part of 34th (South Midland) AA Brigade, based at Coventry and responsible for the air defence of Birmingham and Coventry in 4 AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. At that time the three heavy AA (HAA) regiments in 34 AA Bde had only 24 guns (four of them out of action) at Birmingham and 12 at Coventry.Routledge, Table LIX, p 377. By the start of the Battle of Britain this had risen to 64 guns at Birmingham and 44 at Coventry.Collier, Appendix IX. From 1 June 1940, AA gun regiments manning 3-inch, 3.7-inch or 4.5-inch guns were officially designated as HAA to distinguish them from the newer light AA or LAA units that were being formed. ===Battle of Britain=== Although most of the Luftwaffe air raids during the Battle of Britain and the early part of the night Blitz concentrated on London and the South and East Coasts, the West Midlands also suffered badly, with Birmingham and Coventry experiencing heavy raids in August and October.Collier, Chapter 13.Collier, Chapter 16. A new 340 HAA Bty was formed on 1 August 1940 and regimented with 95th HAA Rgt on 25 September 1940. The regiment sent a cadre to 210th Training Regiment at Oswestry to provide the basis for a new 401 Bty; this was formed on 12 December 1940 and later joined 122nd HAA Rgt. With the continued expansion of AA Command, 34 AA Bde came under the command of a new 11 AA Division, which took over responsibility for the West Midlands on 1 November 1940.Pile's despatch.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.95 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì4511 AA Division 1940 at British Military History ===Coventry Blitz=== Coventry city centre following the 14 November air raid The new division was still being formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November.Collier, Chapter 17. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Ger√§t beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that broke out in the congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. The HAA batteries fought on in isolation. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19‚Äì22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.Routledge, p. 391.Walker, pp. 72‚Äì3. Formation sign of 11 AA Division The change in enemy tactics led to additional HAA guns being moved from London to the West Midlands.Walker, pp. 73‚Äì81. By March 1941, a new 67 AA Bde had been created in 11 AA Division by splitting 34 AA Bde: 95th HAA Rgt transferred to the new formation.Walker, pp. 86‚Äì8.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. ===Birmingham Blitz=== Birmingham was bombed again during December (3, 4, 11) and on 11 March 1941, but the full Birmingham Blitz came in April 1941, with heavy raids on the nights of 9/10 and 10/11 of the month, causing extensive damage and casualties.Collier, Appendix XXX.Walker, p. 90. The Blitz is generally held to have ended on 16 May 1941 with another attack on Birmingham. By now the HAA sites had the advantage of GL Mk I* radar with an elevation finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment, and several attackers were turned away by accurate fire and their bombs scattered widely, some on nearby Nuneaton.Walker, pp. 77, 92‚Äì3.Routledge, pp. 98‚Äì9, 393. The city was attacked again in July, but the Luftwaffe bombing offensive was effectively over.Collier, Chapter 19. The West Midlands had been the hardest hit area of the UK after London and Merseyside.Collier, Appendix XXXI. Another newly-raised battery, 405 HAA Bty, joined the regiment on 5 March 1941; this had been formed on 16 January 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield from a cadre supplied by 98th HAA Rgt. 95th HAA Regiment sent a further cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry to form 449 HAA Bty on 12 June 1941; this joined 130th HAA Rgt 405 HAA Battery left on 2 August 1941 and joined 3rd HAA Rgt of the West African Artillery (WAA) in the Gold Coast. The battery later served in the Burma Campaign.Frederick, p. 991.Farndale, Far East, Annex P.Joslen, p. 490. 198 HAA Battery joined on 7 October 1941 from 122nd HAA Rgt, but its stay was short as the regiment was converted to the three-battery establishment of units deploying overseas and it transferred to 136th HAA Rgt on 4 November 1941. That month 95th HAA Rgt left AA Command and joined the War Office Reserve. Before the end of the year the regiment had embarked for overseas service with 204, 293 and 340 HAA Btys.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. ===India=== The regiment was among reinforcements sent to India following the Japanese invasion of Malaya. It arrived at Bombay on 11 April 1942 and moved to Barrackpore outside Calcutta where it came under the command of 1 Indian AA Bde. It spent the whole of 1943 in the Calcutta area.Joslen, p. 521.Farndale, Far East, Annex K. Calcutta was just within range of bombers operating from Burma and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service began raiding the city during December 1942, in an attempt to disrupt the operation of the docks and to create panic among the population. Attacks resumed in November 1943.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 259‚Äì60.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 120‚Äì1.Routledge, p. 237.'Bombs on Calcutta' at Calcutta 1940s'In the skies of Calcutta' The air threat to Calcutta declined in 1944 and on 1 April 95th HAA Rgt the regiment with 204, 293 and 340 HAA Btys was 'placed in suspended animation' on 14 March 1944 and their personnel dispersed to other assignments for the rest of the war. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Sheldon as 495th (Birmingham) (Mixed) HAA Rgt, RA ('Mixed' indicating that some of its personnel were drawn from the Women's Royal Army Corps).Frederick, p. 1018.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on It formed part of 80 AA Bde at Sutton Coldfield, but that formation was disbanded in September the following year.AA Bdes 67‚Äì106 at British Army 1945 onLitchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. (A new 95th HAA Regiment was formed in the Regular Army on 1 April 1947 by the redesignation of the war-formed 135th HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 960.) In 1954, 495th HAA Rgt absorbed 320th (South Midland) HAA Rgt at Dashwood Heath.320 HAA Rgt at Regiments.org.Frederick, p. 1005.414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, a wholesale reduction of AA units in the TA followed. 495th HAA Regiment amalgamated with 623rd (Warwick) LAA Rgt to form 443rd (Warwickshire) LAA Rgt, with Q and R Btys derived from 495th HAA Rgt. In 1961 there was another round of reductions, with Q Bty joining 268th (Warwickshire) Field Rgt and R Bty joining with part of 442nd LAA Rgt to reform 7th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment and the batteries' individual identities were lost.Frederick, pp. 1014, 1026. ==NotesReferences== * Maj A.F.

He had one younger brother, Richard Thornton Wilson III, who married Florence Magee Ellsworth. His maternal grandparents were William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, leader of the \\"Four Hundred\\". His paternal grandparents were Richard Thornton Wilson Sr., a banker who invested in railways following the end of the U.S. Civil War, and Melissa Clementine Johnston. Wilson prepared at the Browning School in New York. He graduated from Harvard University in 1907. ===Family=== Through both sides of his family, he was related to many prominent people. On his paternal side, his aunt Grace Wilson was married to Cornelius Vanderbilt III; his uncle was Richard Thornton Wilson Jr.; another aunt Belle Wilson, was married to the Sir Michael Henry Herbert, the British Ambassador to the United States; and another aunt, Mary Wilson, was married to New York real estate heir, Ogden Goelet. Through the latter, he was a first cousin of Mary Goelet, who married the Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe and became the Duchess of Roxburghe. On his maternal side, his aunts were Emily Astor, who married James John Van Alen; Helen Schermerhorn Astor, who married diplomat James Roosevelt Roosevelt, half-brother of Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Charlotte Augusta Astor, who married James Coleman Drayton and George Ogilvy Haig. His only maternal uncle was John Jacob Astor IV, who married socialite Ava Lowle Willing and later, Madeleine Talmage Force. He died aboard the RMS Titanic in 1912. ==Career== After graduating from Harvard, Wilson traveled abroad considerably and then became a \\"banker and manufacturer\\" with an office at 14 Wall Street in New York City. In 1913, he joined the firm R. T. Wilson & Co., which was started by his grandfather and run by his uncle, Richard Thornton Wilson Jr., where the young Wilson became the New York Stock Exchange board member for the firm. Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War I, Wilson began a long career diplomat with the United States Department of State. He first served in Brussels, then Berne, and in Buenos Aires, Argentina where he was second secretary and first secretary, before serving as the assistant chief of the division of Latin American affairs at the State Department. In 1933, Wilson was made first secretary to the Embassy in Berlin. The following year, he was transferred to Prague as Consul General. ===U.S. Ambassador to Haiti=== On March 21, 1944, Wilson was appointed the United States Ambassador to Haiti by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He presented his credentials on June 2, 1944 and terminated his mission by leaving his post on August 22, 1946. While in Haiti, Wilson was a frequent writer to Cordell Hull, the U.S. Secretary of State regarding the escalation of tensions in Haiti. Wilson recommended that unless \\"the Department of State views with disfavor a policy which might tend to keep President Lescot in office, there would appear to be no objection to supplying the small amount of equipment contemplated by the War Department.\\" ==Personal life== In 1910, Wilson was married to Alice Elsie \\"Ella\\" Borland, a Brearley School graduate. She was the daughter of John Nelson Borland and the granddaughter of George Griswold Haven. Together, they had a son Orme Wilson in 1920.

It has two or three leaves and up to nine whitish and mauve flowers with darker markings and unusually long lateral sepals. ==Description== Diuris callitrophila is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between three and nine white, purple or mauve flowers with darker markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are ear-like and held erect above the rest of the flower, with an elliptic blade long and wide. The petals have a dark-coloured stalk long that gradually expands towards the blade. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is fan- shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There are two broad callus ridges long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in November and December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris callitrophila was first formally described in 2003 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Oaklands and the description was published in The Orchadian. ==Distribution and habitat== The Oaklands doubletail is only known from a few locations between Oaklands and Urana where it grows in small groups in grassy places in Callitris woodland. ==Conservation== Diuris callitrophila is classed as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. The main threats to the species are its restricted distribution and small population, weed invasion, grazing and inappropriate fire regimes. Steps are being taken to conserve the species by collecting the seed and its associated fungus, growing the orchid and reintroducing it to its natural habitat. ==References== callitrophila Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 2003 ","title":"Diuris callitrophila"},{"id":"56850501","text":" The Ecofly M160 is a German aircraft engine, adapted by Otto Funk from a Smart Car engine and produced by Ecofly of B√∂hl-Iggelheim for use in ultralight aircraft.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, pages 256-257.

Released in March 2018, it is her fourteenth studio album and her first since Wilde Winter Songbook in 2013. It contains the singles \\"Pop Don't Stop\\", \\"Kandy Krush\\" and \\"Birthday\\", while a deluxe edition released in October housed the single \\"Amourese des Reves\\". The album was produced by her long-time producer (and brother) Ricky Wilde. In the UK, the album became her first charting album for 25 years, peaking at No.21. == Overview == Kim Wilde released her fourteenth studio album on 16 March 2018, over four years since her last. According to Wilde, the theme of the album was inspired by her seeing a UFO in her back garden in Hertfordshire in 2009. Written by her, her brother Ricky Wilde, niece Scarlett, and sister Roxanne Wilde, it was her first album to chart within the UK top 100 albums since 1993, peaking at No.21 during a two- week run. It charted well around Europe also, peaking at No. 10 in Switzerland, No.11 in Germany, No.34 In Austria, No.68 in France, No.74 in the Netherlands and No.48 in Belgium. In promotion for the album, Wilde toured the UK during March and April 2018 and later in Europe. The album met mixed to positive reviews, with MusicOMH saying that the album was powerful, but at times was a bit too much, stating: \\"...the pop machine continues churning out track after track, proving that Wilde certainly does still have a knack for writing pleasing songs. But, flowing like a thick, melodic river that threatens to drown you every so often, it borders on being too much.\\" TheArtDesk said that \\"the production falls somewhere between Def Leppard‚Äôs Hysteria, Pat Benatar and Wilde‚Äôs own early Eighties back catalogue.\\" A deluxe edition of the album was released in October 2018, containing two new tracks and live versions of her former singles \\"Kids in America\\", \\"Cambodia\\" and \\"You Came\\". == Track listing == # \\"1969\\" (Kim Wilde / Ricky Wilde) - 4:04 # \\"Pop Don't Stop\\" (K.

Journalist Jazz Monroe analyzed Future Brown as having a \\"transcultural discord,\\" where it \\"toys with an unconscious web of associations, partly generated by our casual consumption of cross-continental music.\\"Monroe, Jazz (February 26, 2015). \\"Future Brown interview: \\"When things are definable, it‚Äôs less exciting.\\"\\" Dummy. Retrieved March 11, 2018. Fitzgerald described the musical content as \\"the manifestation of our post-modern obsession with a universal social uplink, a record prophetic of a global future where world cultures converge and evolve as one, thereby representing the progressive ideals of contemporary life.\\" Writer Alex Macpherson, however, opined the album actually appropriated musical styles in a negative review of Future Brown for Red Bull Music Academy titled \\"Is Future Brown‚Äôs Shtick 4Real?,\\" which was published on February 17, 2015.Macpherson, Alex (February 17, 2015). \\"Is Future Brown‚Äôs Shtick 4Real?\\". Red Bull Music Academy. Retrieved March 11, 2018. Both Macpherson's review and an article for Pitchfork by writer Meaghan Garvey suggested Future Brown had art school-level concepts behind it and criticized the album based on that. While Garvey acknowledged that Future Brown claimed themselves to be \\"a free-form, vibes-based passion project, steered by the unrestricted contributions of the featured collaborators as much as the producers‚Äô whims,\\" both reviews used the album's promotional material (particularly the music video for \\"Vernuculo\\"), the group members' previous experiences in the modern art community, and the fact that postinternet art magazine DIS Magazine was responsible for the cover art as evidence the LP was something more than that. Macpherson suggested the band intended to make a record promoting \\"cultural hybridity, to make, so says their press release, ‚Äúconnections between global street sounds‚Äù,\\" and that \\"articles about them tend to reel off the names of these global genres in an awed tone ‚Äì footwork, cumbia, reggaeton and grime, among them.\\" He criticized the instrumentals for being \\"weirdly detached, uncanny-valley version[s]\\" of these styles: \\"[Future Brown's] relationship to both these genres and the guest appearances brought into the fold is a top-down one rather than ground-level; no wonder these beats sound so pristinely lofty juxtaposed with their vocals.\\" He also battered the quartet for using art school-level ideas to gain a huge amount of attention from the press, given that the LP's featured artists had been receiving far less popularity: \\" This is both telling with regards to issues of class and privilege, and also an immense shame. [...] Future Brown has failed to recognise their collaborators as innovators of long standing in their own right.\\" Garvey wrote that \\"it‚Äôs about everything and nothing, partying and post-postmodernism, global street music and the New York art world, commodity fetishism and basketball,\\" but these concepts were unidentifiable when listening to the music itself, and the songs are actually \\"weirdly unremarkable.\\" Garvey and Macpherson's reviews of Future Brown garnered negative attention from members of Future Brown as well as several readers, Dummy claiming that they \\"rippled fast and divisive through the caverns of music Twitter.\\" The band claimed that they weren't making Future Brown based on a high-level thesis. Al Qadiri called the reviews \\"attacks\\" in a Facebook post, reasoning that they were \\"proliferating theories and false notions of a malicious nature that have no factual bearing.\\" She summarized the following: \\"Writers who see fit to assert a theory or thesis on behalf of an artist when there isn‚Äôt one, or posit a privilege or claim of appropriation without access, proof or knowledge, create a hostile environment for artists and readers who demand credible journalism, filled with genuine criticism and facts, good or bad.\\" In a 2015 interview with Future Brown, Dummy asked questions about sources stating the album was appropriating foreign musical styles. J-Cush said that he was frustrated by the responses, reasoning that the group simply wanted to \\"bring people together on a record and make something special.\\" He also had a reason for the album's accidental appropriation: \\"When you're making music and thinking about who you want to spit on the tune, that affects what comes out. If you wanna have somebody like Riko or [Prince] Rapid or Skepta come do a tune, you should think about how they're gonna fit on it.\\" Stereogum sided with the reviewers in this conflict, reasoning that \\"[The critics] seems correct in [their] assertion that Future Brown, not the critical community, are the ones who affixed high-concept baggage to their music via Art Basel exploits and loaded graphic design.\\" The source also stated, \\"musicians don‚Äôt get to dictate how their music is perceived, and human beings in general aren‚Äôt always aware of how they might strike other people.\\" Tim Wilson of The Ransom Note, on the other hand, stated that while the modern art associations with Future Brown were \\"unavoidable,\\" an album \\"should be judged on its own merits and underpinnings, not past or peripheral ones.\\"Wilson, Tim. \\"View From The Side: Never Assume ‚Äì The Future Brown Debacle\\". The Ransom Note. Retrieved March 13, 2018. Wilson stated Future Brown were not entirely to blame for their appropriated representations of other styles, nor for the lack of success of the featured artists: \\"The collective have previously revealed that the project comes with no manifesto and all of the collaborations were conducted in a studio. It doesn‚Äôt appear that the collective remained anonymous, lofty outsiders to those involved [...] Macpherson and Garvey should look to critiquing the prejudices of their colleagues before firing barbs at young bands.\\" Because Red Bull Music Academy had a long previous history of promoting members from Future Brown, the publication had to remove Macpherson's review from the website by having the link for it redirect to a positive interview with the group. Gawker writer Jordan Sargent claimed it to be an example of issues that result from most music publications developing \\"coherent, identifiable taste, which becomes a problem when artists you once stumped for begin to suck.\\"Sargent, Jordan (February 28, 2015). \\"What Happens When a Soft Drink Brand Is Scared By Its Own Journalism?\\". Gawker. Retrieved March 11, 2018. He reasoned that \\"artists are the ones who, theoretically, attract readers. So while most editors and writers would love to write as bluntly as possible about the music they cover, the truth is that the health of every magazine and website depends, to varying degrees, on which artists‚Äîand PR firms and labels‚Äîfeel comfortable enough with your coverage to continue to play ball.\\" ==Accolades== {class=\\"sortable  plainrowheaders\\" - !

It was demolished in 1899. The new building was constructed from 1899 to 1901 by Fellner & Helmer, with participation of the Lviv architects Iwan Lewi≈Ñski and Julian Cybulski. The new hotel was inaugurated on January 8, 1901. At the time, it had 93 rooms, including 32 luxury-class rooms. The hotel was extended by two floors in 1906.

Some describe Balich√£o as a fish sauce. Balich√£o is noted for having a distinct odor that some find foul. Some, however, find Balich√£o's smell and taste milder and mellower than shrimp pastes from Southeast Asia. ==History== There are at least two theories on where the word Balich√£o originated. One theory states the word is believed to have evolved from the Portuguese word for Whale (baleia). Another theory states the word is a corruption of the word belachang, which is one of a number of Malay words for shrimp paste. Balich√£o is noted as originating from shrimp pastes that were brought to Macao by Portuguese sailors who discovered it during their voyage to the city, and later developed by locals as a special variant. Balich√£os are noted to have a tradition of being home made, and can take up to a month to mature. In 2009, Balich√£o is described as an almost extinct condiment, as people look for its substitute among other, more readily available ingredients. ==Ingredients== Besides krill, Balich√£o contains bay leaves, chili, clove, lime, peppercorn, and is laced with fortified wine. ==Culture== Balich√£o is noted to be so central to Macanese culture, that Macanese people call themselves balichung as an affectionate demonym.

His research focuses on numerical weather modeling and prediction, the role of topography in the evolution of weather systems, regional climate modeling, and the weather of the Pacific Northwest. He is a fellow of the American Meteorological Society, past-president of the Puget Sound American Meteorological Society chapter, and past chair of the College of the Environment College Council. His book The Weather of the Pacific Northwest is one of the best-selling titles from the University of Washington Press. He maintains a popular weather blog and gives frequent public lectures on topics ranging from Washington State weather history to the impact of climate change on global and regional weather patterns. He formerly had standing engagements to speak on Seattle-area public radio stations KUOW and KNKX before each of these stations chose to discontinue their relationships with Mass due to Mass's comments on non-weather-related topics. == Education == Mass received a B.S. in Physics from Cornell University in 1974. As an undergraduate, Mass performed research on Martian weather with astrophysicist Carl Sagan, and on the role of sun spots and volcanic eruptions on historical climate conditions with climatologist Stephen Schneider. He received his PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Washington in 1978 with a dissertation on the role of African wave disturbances and climate variation in the Sahel region. == Academic career == Before joining the faculty of the University of Washington, Mass was a professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland from 1978-1981. He leads the University of Washington Mesoscale Analysis and Forecasting Group and is the chief scientist of the Northwest Modeling Consortium. He has published over 120 articles in peer-reviewed scientific venues, and served on the board of over a dozen regional and national meteorological committees, conferences, and scientific journals. == Outreach and scientific advocacy == Mass maintains a popular weblog in which he posts regular articles on meteorology, Pacific Northwest weather history, and the impacts of climate change written for the general public. According to Mass, \\"Global warming is an extraordinarily serious issue, and scientists have a key role to play in communicating what is known and what is not about this critical issue.\\" Mass has stated publicly that he shares the scientific consensus that global warming is real and that human activity is a major cause of warming trend in the late 20th and 21st centuries. He has been critical of the Paris Climate accord for not going far enough to address the negative impacts of climate change. However, Mass is frequently critical of and has expressed concern that when media and environmental organizations make exaggerated claims about the current impacts of climate change, or cite climate change as the cause of specific weather events. He is concerned about misinforming the public about a key societal issue, distracting public and governmental attention from more immediate environmental concerns, and stifling opportunities for effective bipartisan policy-making to slow climate change and mitigate its effects. His statements on the severity and progression of anthropogenic global warming have elicited condemnation from The Stranger as well as members of activist environmental organizations due to concerns that Mass's scientific approach to understanding and communicating the risks associated with global warming could result in public apathy or be used by climate change deniers to bolster their claims. Mass advocated for the acquisition and installation of the Langley Hill Doppler weather radar in 2011, the first on the Washington coast. In 2016, Mass advocated in favor of Washington Initiative I-732, which would have been the first carbon tax measure in the United States. Mass later advocated against a different initiative to enact a carbon fee, Washington Initiative I-1631, in 2018, suggesting it was highly regressive and ineffective. Both measures were rejected. His 2018 opposition was used by the \\"No on 1631\\" campaign, and drew condemnation from some alternative publications. ==Opinions on non-weather-related topics== Mass has used numerous media, including radio shows, Twitter accounts, and a personal blog, to broadcast opinions about numerous topics not related to the weather. These have sometimes generated controversy. Starting around 2008, KUOW warned Mass to stop voicing his opinions about subjects such as math education on his weather segment on the show Weekday. The show's host, Steve Scher, noted that holders of opposing viewpoints complained to the station that they deserved equal time. Scher in 2011 removed Mass's segment from Weekday, prompting hundreds of emails to be sent to the station and a protest at the station. Mass later wrote an article defending his actions in The Stranger. On his personal blog on August 5, 2020, Mass likened the persistent riots and vandalism in downtown Seattle months after the George Floyd protests in Seattle to Kristallnacht, calling photos of the damage \\"eerily similar to those of 80 years ago.\\" He subsequently defended the comparison in the comments to that entry. The next day, KNKX announced that it would stop airing Weather with Cliff Mass effective immediately citing \\"offensive and inaccurate\\" rhetoric in that personal blog post. Mass temporarily removed the words \\"Kristallnacht\\" and \\"Brownshirts\\" from his post, describing the passage that contained them as \\"a source of distraction to some,\\" before restoring them. ==Personal life== Mass, who is Jewish, has stated the value of tikkun olam has informed his approach to science. ==Bibliography== * == References  External links == * Cliff Mass Weather Blog * Faculty profile at the University of Washington Category:American meteorologists Category:University of Washington faculty Category:University of Washington College of the Environment alumni Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Scientists from New York (state) Category:Scientists from Washington (state) Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Far Rockaway, Queens Category:Fellows of the American Meteorological Society Category:University of Maryland, College Park faculty ","title":"Cliff Mass"},{"id":"56851744","text":"Beatriz is a barrio in the municipality of Caguas, Puerto Rico.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Beatriz has a total area of 15.89 km¬≤, of which 15.89 km¬≤ is land and (0.03%) 0.01 km¬≤ is water. Beatriz is located in the Sierra de Cayey, an extension of Cordillera Central mountain range. ==Demographics== According to the 2010 Census, there were 4,353 people residing in Beatriz. The population density was 27,391 inhabitants per km¬≤. Of 4,353 inhabitants, Beatriz was composed of 68.76% Whites, 13% were Black, 0.62% were American Indian, 0.05% were Asian, 0.02% were Pacific Islanders, 12.27% were of other races and 5.28% belonged to two or more races. In all, the population was 99.47% Hispanic or Latino. ==History== Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Beatriz barrio was 868. The area was mostly made up of subsistence farms in the 19th century. Botanist William Edwin Safford visited Beatriz in 1898 to document the local plant life. The 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane devastated Beatriz, and many farmers began working for the newly established military government of the United States of America building roads. At the time, a store owned by wealthy landowner Don Ram√≥n √Ålvarez was the center of economic life in Beatriz. In 1900, one of the store's cashiers Don Demetrio L√≥pez was elected alcalde and comisario of Beatriz.

He has released two studio albums to date: One Way (2010) and Gravity Always Wins (2017). == Early career == Born in Milan, Italy as Francesco Dell'Orco, Bryan grew up listening to a range of folk, rock and roll, soul, and his father's classical music collection. Moving around the world as a child, he took influence from American and British songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Beatles and Cat Stevens. Steven started playing regular gigs in his hometown with various cover bands around 1999, however he soon realised that the only way to get a career in the music business was to play original songs. But to do that, he needed a change. \\"I felt like Milan had nothing left to offer, I was feeling a little cramped and unmotivated, so I decided to move to London\\". == One Way (2010‚Äì16) == Steven Bryan landed in London in 2007 and played the acoustic circuit intensively for a couple of years while writing over 25 songs for his debut album, \\"One Way\\". The album caught the attention of a few record labels, and Bryan signed a worldwide deal with Right Track Records/Universal Music Operations in 2011 for his first single Puppets On TV. Puppets On TV has been featured on BBC Radio 2, BBC London 94.9 and Cool FM in the UK and IHeartRadio in the US. Bryan and his band played a series of sold-out UK shows in 2012, but after difficulties with the record label and his manager they eventually decided to part ways in 2013. \\"It wasn't as peaceful as I would have liked, and it left a deep scar to be honest. At one point I almost thought I was done with music, and frankly didn't mind. I even went all the way to Australia, I just wanted to be far away from that world! But then something happened.. as soon as I said \\"Screw this!\\" I found myself writing songs like never before, probably out of anger and frustration. I went back to London in 2015 and started working on my new album almost immediately\\". == Gravity Always Wins (2017‚Äì19) == Steven Bryan performing in London, 2017 Gravity Always Wins revitalised Bryan's passion for songwriting, by deciding to go away from the full band formula present on One Way and instead shine the spotlight of just his voice and acoustic guitar. Produced by Francesco Lo Castro, the album was released on 27 June 2017 and consists of 11 tracks, including a new version of Lights, already on the previous album One Way. The first two singles off Gravity Always Wins are Sing To Me, released on 3 June 2016, and Dolled Up, released on 16 February 2018. == Discography == * One Way (Album ‚Äì 2010) * Puppets On TV (Single ‚Äì 2011) * One Way Deluxe Edition (Album ‚Äì 2013) * Sing To Me (Single ‚Äì 2016) * Gravity Always Wins (Album ‚Äì 2017) * Dolled Up (Single ‚Äì 2018) == References  External links == * Official Website Category:Living people Category:People from Milan Category:21st-century Italian male musicians Category:English male musicians Category:Italian songwriters Category:Male songwriters Category:1982 births Category:English male singer-songwriters Category:Italian male singer- songwriters Category:Italian singer-songwriters Category:21st-century English singers Category:21st-century Italian singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Steven Bryan"},{"id":"56851809","text":"Jamie Becker-Finn (born October 20, 1982) is an American politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives.

He is best known for his role in the development of the Polaris, Poseidon and Trident missiles for ballistic missile submarines. ==Biography== Levering Smith was born in Joplin, Missouri, on 5 March 1910 to Aaron Levering and Ethel (McClellan) Smith. He entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, from which he graduated with the class of 1932. He served on the battleship from 1932 to 1936, and the destroyer from 1936 to 1938, before returning to Annapolis as an instructor. He then attended the Naval Postgraduate School from 1939 to 1940. During World War II, Smith was posted to the aircraft carrier , serving on it until it was sunk in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942. He then served on the cruiser until it, too, was sunk in the Battle of Tassafaronga the following month. He later participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on the fleet flagship . After the war, Smith was posted to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California, where he worked with rockets as the head of first the Explosives Department and then as associate technical director. He came to the conclusion that solid-propellant rockets were the best solution for shipboard and submarine use. In 1954, he became the head of the Explosive Department at the Naval Ordnance Missile Test Facility at White Sands, New Mexico, concurrently serving as the Navy deputy to the Army general in command of the White Sands Missile Range. In 1955, the Navy became involved in a joint intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) project with the Army to develop the Jupiter missile. Dissatisfied with liquid-propellant rockets, the Navy pulled out of the project. The head of the Special Projects Office, Rear Admiral William F. Raborn, Jr., brought in Smith to help develop a solid-fuel missile, which became the Polaris missile. The improvement in safety could be compared to a family taking a bag of charcoal on vacation instead of a can of gasoline. He went on to work on the Poseidon and Trident missiles, serving as director of the Special Projects Office from 1966 until his retirement in 1974. Rear Admiral Robert A. Wertheim recalled that In addition to his work on the US Navy's ballistic missile projects, he provided crucial support to the UK Polaris missile program. According to The Daily Telegraph, \\"... it was no small measure due to him [Levering Smith] that the British Polaris programme was completed on time and on budget ‚Äî an unprecedented feat in British naval history.\\" For this, he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire on 7 January 1972. Smith died of cancer at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, California, on 5 April 1993, and was buried in San Marcos District Cemetery in San Marcos, California. He was survived by his wife, Beulah Weymouth Lewis Smith (1913‚Äì2007). Since 1986, he had been honored by the Vice Admiral Levering Smith Award for Submarine Support Achievement. Presented by the Naval Submarine League, it \\"recognizes specific or continuing submarine support actions which have most contributed to the furtherance of the spirit or fighting mettle of the Submarine Force.\\" His awards included three awards of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the American Defense Service Medal with one star, and the Asiatic‚ÄìPacific Campaign Medal with eleven stars. His received the L.T.E. Thompson Award from the Naval Ordnance Test Station and the C. N. Hickman from the American Rocket Society in 1957; the American Society of Naval Engineers' Gold Medal and the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award from Navy League of the United States in 1961; the Gold Knight of Management Award from the National Management Association in 1972; and an honorary doctor of laws degree from New Mexico State University. In 1965, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. ==Notes== Category:1910 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Military personnel from Missouri Category:Naval Postgraduate School alumni Category:People from Joplin, Missouri Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:United States Navy vice admirals Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:United States Naval Academy faculty ","title":"Levering Smith"},{"id":"56852044","text":"Pedicinus is a genus of sucking louse, the only genus in the family Pedicinidae.

(NPG) was a Liverpool based real estate developer. With a head office in Edward pavilion (Salthouse quay), it was established in 2015 primarily to develop one of the regions around Liverpool's docks off Great George street. However, it filed for bankruptcy in 2018 leaving its Chinese investors in the lurch. ==New Chinatown development (Liverpool)== Though the group had not completed any housing project in the UK, it announced plans in December 2015 to develop a so-called \\"New Chinatown\\" near Liverpool docks for ¬£200m, consisting of glitzy glass buildings and sky scrapers, a hotel, a business center and 280 homes. The development was planend over three sites - two owned by the Liverpool City Council and a third site owned by Urban Splash under the Tribeca scheme. It marketed these houses to middle class individual buyers and investors in Hong Kong and tier 1 cities of China in expo exhibitions, advertising guaranteed returns. The first phase of the project was promised to be completed in 2017 and the entire project completed by 2019. In an interview in July 2016, its chairman David Chowles told reporters that 46 of its 127 residential units had already been sold by July 2016, with most of the shops on leaseholds. Its commercial spaces were built to allow small investors from China to take advantage of the Tier 1 entrepreneur's visa programme. Most investors consisted of individual families who had paid ¬£40,000 each as 30% downpayment for their apartment. Some prospective investors paid up to 50% of their share upfront as a deposit.. The site is current being demolished and awaiting designs for a new development. However, other than the inauguration program in 2016, no development took place at the site. The NPG group sold the development rights in 2017 to another shell company called \\"Your Housing Group\\". At around the same time, Bilt, the subcontractor who was planned to carry out its construction developed financial problems and was closed down. In February 2018, Bloomberg reported that North Points projects had been stalled and put up for sale, leaving hundreds of Hong Kong and Chinese purchasers in the lurch. In 2018, the Liverpool Echo reported that construction had still not started at the site which was now filled with garbage and infested with rats. ==Other developments in Liverpool and Manchester== As of October 2017, five projects of North Point in Liverpool were suspended due to a paucity of funds and financial problems, without any repayments to investors. These were new China Town, Baltic house, North Point Pall mall, The Paramount and The Quadrant. Some in the press suspected the group to be involved in money laundering, but this was never proven. In March 2018, an expos√© by The Guardian revealed that North point was just one of the many fraudulent real estate development schemes floated in the UK to lure in individual Chinese small investors. At least one of the them was promoted by the ex chancellor George Osborne. One was Pinnacle Angelgate, the company behind the Angelgate project in Manchester, went into administration in 2017. It was a sister company of North point global. Many of the proposed 344 apartments in that project were also sold off-plan to Chinese and Hong Kong investors, who paid deposits of more than ¬£31m to secure the properties. ==References *Official Website *Engel & V√∂lkers Estate Agents Category:Property companies of the United Kingdom Category:Real estate companies established in 2015 Category:Real estate companies disestablished in 2018 Category:Defunct companies of the United Kingdom Category:British companies disestablished in 2018 Category:British companies established in 2015 ","title":"North Point Global"},{"id":"56852057","text":"Map of Buncannia Lake, New South Wales Bancannia Lake is an Endorheic lake in the Bulloo-Bancannia drainage basin of Far West New South Wales.Bancannia Lake - NSW.Ruth Sandow, Bancannia Lake - NSW Bancannia Lake, Corner Country.

Hauken√¶s was born at the Haukanes farm on the Granvin Fjord between Granvin and Folkedal in Hordaland county. Hauken√¶s initially worked as a shepherd, and then spent several years fishing for herring and also traveling around as a book seller. He married Kristi Gjerdsdotter Aalvik (1849‚Äì1914) from Indre √Ölvik in 1871 and then settled down as a trader in Granvin. He went into business with his friend Rikoll Eide. Hauken√¶s then became the manager of the Graven Consumer Association (Gravens Forbrugsforening), which developed to operate mail services, a coaching inn, and a hotel. The association experienced economic difficulties, and so Hauken√¶s took it over at book value and then continued it as a private operation. ==Folklore collector== After meeting Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen during a collection expedition in Hardanger in the summer of 1870, Hauken√¶s also started gathering folk material in the district. In 1882 he published a request in several newspapers in Western Norway for people in Hardanger, Voss, and neighboring villages to send him manuscript collections with oral traditions. In 1883, Hauken√¶s's business went bankrupt, and at the same time he lost his entire private library. This combination of material distress and poor prospects led Hauken√¶s to embark on a new endeavor that attracted him; namely to cultivate his new hobby of collecting and publishing folk material. Hauken√¶s was extremely productive, but did not trust his own writing skills, and so he sought help from the more experienced writer Jon Nilsson Skaar from Botnen at the head of Fykse Sound. He paid Skaar to help him write out and arrange the available material. In 1890, Hauken√¶s visited the well-known folklore collector Peder Fylling at his home in Skodje. A travelogue from his trip was published in the newspaper Sunnm√∏rsposten. ==Author and publisher== In a series of books, Hauken√¶s presented information about nature, folk life, and folk belief in Hardanger, Sunnhordland, and Voss. He also wrote an autobiography. The print runs were quite small; this, combined with some mishaps‚Äîsuch as some boxes of books that burned during a fire in Granvin in 1885 and a large shipment of books that went down with the steamer Ole Bull when the ship was wrecked outside Volda in 1888‚Äîhas resulted in many of Hauken√¶s's titles being very rare and hard to obtain. Hauken√¶s was successful as an author, and on May 17, 1899 he and his family were able to move into his attractive new home at the Solbakken farm at Eide in Granvin, named after Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson's 1857 peasant novel Synn√∏ve Solbakken. By the time he turned 60 the next year, Hauken√¶s had been able to write no fewer than 30 books in 16 years. ==Bibliography == * \\"Om en Jernbane fra Voss til Ejde i Graven\\" (A Railway from Voss to Eide in Granvin, in Vossingen, 1872) * \\"Telegraf fra Voss til Ejde i Graven\\" (A Telegraph from Voss to Eide in Granvin, in Vossingen, 1873) * \\"Merkelige Kirker i Begen under Katolicismen\\" (Notable Churches in Bergen under Catholicism, in Hardangeren, 1875) * \\"Ein Tur til V√∏ringsfossen\\" (A Tour to V√∏ring Falls, in S√∏ndre Bergenhus Folkeblad, 1878) * \\"Historiske Notiser og Bygdefort√¶llinger fra Graven\\" (Historical Notes and Village Tales from Granvin, in S√∏ndre Bergenhus Folkeblad, 1879) * Natur, Folkeliv og Folketro i Hardanger, Voss og S√∏ndhordland (Nature, Folk Life, and Folk Belief in Hardanger, Voss, and South Hordaland), I: Eidsfjord (Eidfjord; Bergen, 1884); II: Graven (Granvin; Bergen, 1885); III: Ulvik (Bergen, 1885); IV: Voss (Bergen, 1887); V: Vik√∏r (Bergen, 1888); VI: Kvindeherred (Kvinnherad; Bergen 188?); VII: Ullensvang (Bergen, 1891); VIII: Strandebarm (Bergen 1894); IX: H√•landsdalen (Bergen 189?); X: R√∏ldal (Bergen, 1891); XI: Gammelt og nyt fra Voss og Vossestranden (Old and New From Voss and Vossestrand; Bergen, 1896) * Livsskildring eller f√∏debygd, slegt og selvbiografi.

Myers, 128 U.S. 617 (1888), was a United States Supreme Court ruling dealing with copyright. The firm of Eugene B. Myers & Chandler, composed of Myers and Horace P. Chandler, purchased the copyright of the arrangement of a number of Illinois Supreme Court records compiled by Norman L. Freeman. They printed these works, the Illinois Reports volumes 32 through 38, from 1865 to 1867. Myers alone held the copyright to Freeman's arrangements of volumes 39 through 46 and printed those as well. The conflict began when Myers made some changes to the arrangement of volumes 37 and 38 and published them, observing the procedure to procure copyright on these alternative works. The defendants, Callaghan & Company, offered to purchase licenses to publish these new versions of 37 and 38, but would not pay Myers's price. Instead, they made very minor changes to Myers's version, copying essentially verbatim the portions of the book that were actually copyrightable, and published it as their own work. Myers sued them for copyright infringement and the case eventually went to the Supreme Court. The Court upheld earlier case law, such as Banks v. Manchester, that said court documents belonged to the public domain. In regards to the case at hand, they ruled that the elements of the books that organized or summarized those judicial works constituted intellectual effort and therefore Myers did hold the copyright because he did follow the copyrighting procedures in all cases except one. The Court found that the copies of Volume 32 required for formally copyrighting the work had arrived late, so that volume was not copyrighted. Nonetheless, the plaintiff, Myers, was entitled to compensation in full for the infringement damages, if he chose to collect them.. ==References * Category:1888 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States copyright case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court ","title":"Callaghan v.

Hosted by Valve, the game's developer, TI8 followed a year-long series of tournaments awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), with the top eight ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament. In addition, ten more teams earned invites through qualifiers that were held in June 2018, with the group stage and main event played at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver in August. The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3‚Äì2. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the open qualifiers and were not favored to win throughout the competition. As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the Dota 2 community via its battle pass feature, with the total being over 25 million, making it one of the largest for any esports tournament. Other events took place during the tournament, including a cosplay competition and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize pools, as well as two live demonstration games of a team of professional players playing against a team of five OpenAI- curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, to showcase the capability of machine learning. In addition to nearly 20,000 spectators at the Rogers Arena, the tournament was livestreamed and seen by over 15 million people online. A documentary film following OG and PSG.LGD through the grand finals was released in January 2019. OG would later win The International 2019 the following year, becoming the first repeat champion of the International. ==Overview== Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve. In it, two teams of five players compete by selecting characters known as \\"heroes\\", each with a variety of innate skills and abilities, and cooperate to be the first to destroy the base of the other team, which ends the match. The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the player sees a segment of the game's map near their character as well as mini-map that shows their allies, with any enemies revealed outside the fog of war. The game's map has three roughly symmetric \\"lanes\\" between each base, with several defensive towers protecting each side. Periodically, the team's base spawns a group of weak CPU-controlled creatures, called \\"creeps\\", that march down each of the three lanes towards the opponents' base, fighting any enemy hero, creep, or structure they encounter. If a hero character is killed, that character respawns back at their base after a delay period, which gets progressively longer the farther into the match. As with previous years of the tournament, a corresponding battle pass for Dota 2 was released in May 2018, allowing the prize pool to be crowdfunded by players of the game. Known as the \\"Compendium\\", 25% of revenue made by it was sent directly towards the tournament's prize pool, which Valve started at a base 1.6 million. At the time of event, Dota 2 featured 115 playable characters, called \\"heroes\\". Prior to each game in the tournament, a draft was held between the opposing team captains to select which heroes their teams use, going back and forth until each side has banned six and selected five heroes. Once a hero is picked, it cannot be selected by any other player that match, so teams used the draft to strategically plan ahead and deny the opponent's heroes that may be good counters or would be able to take advantage of weaknesses to their current lineup. The first pick in a match is decided by a pre-game coin toss, and then alternates between each game in that series. The team that does not get first pick gets the option of which side of the map to play on, a strategic benefit. ===Format=== A change from previous Internationals, The International 2018 featured a series of tournaments running from October 2017 until June 2018, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), that awarded qualifying points with the top eight ranking teams receiving direct invitations. For the first time since The International 2013, the main event was not held at the KeyArena in Seattle, due to it undergoing renovation construction at the time, and was instead held at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada from August 20‚Äì25, 2018. The event was also broadcast on a number of livestreams, such as on Twitch and Steam.tv, with the latter being introduced specifically for the tournament. As with most major Dota 2 tournaments, the event had English, Chinese, and Russian-language broadcasting crews, with all of them having a large group of dedicated analysts and game casters. The eight DPC teams to earn invites were Virtus.pro, PSG.LGD, Team Liquid, Team Secret, Mineski, Vici Gaming, Newbee, and VGJ.Thunder. In addition, twelve open qualifier single-elimination playoff brackets, two from each region, were held from June 14‚Äì18, 2018, with any eligible team able to participate in them, including non-professional ones. Winners of them advanced to the main qualifiers, which were held from June 18‚Äì25 and consisted of six regional brackets where an additional ten teams, Team Serenity, Invictus Gaming, Winstrike Team, OG, VGJ.Storm, Evil Geniuses, OpTic Gaming, paiN Gaming, Fnatic, and TNC Predator, earned invites by winning their respective regions. To seed the elimination bracket for the main event, two separate round robin group stages featuring all 18 teams were played from August 15‚Äì18. Each of the teams played each other within their group in a two- game series. The top four placing teams of each group advanced to the upper bracket, while the fifth through eight advanced to the lower bracket. The lowest placed team from both groups were eliminated from the competition. The main event featured two brackets, an upper and lower, in a double-elimination tournament format. Winning teams of the upper bracket, played in a best-of- three match format, advanced to the next round, while the losing team would then be placed in respective rounds of the lower bracket. The winner of the upper bracket moved to the grand finals. Teams who were seeded into the lower bracket from the group stage played best-of-one games, with the loser being immediately eliminated. All later round matches in the lower bracket were played to best-of-three, with the winner of the lower bracket advancing to the grand finals, played as a best-of-five series, to face the winner of the upper bracket. ;Direct invitation (DPC) * Virtus.pro * PSG.LGD * Team Liquid * Team Secret * Mineski * Vici Gaming * Newbee * VGJ.Thunder ;Regional qualifier winners * Team Serenity (China) * Invictus Gaming (China) * Winstrike Team (CIS) * OG (Europe) * VGJ.Storm (North America) * Evil Geniuses (North America) * OpTic Gaming (North America) * paiN Gaming (South America) * Fnatic (Southeast Asia) * TNC Predator (Southeast Asia) ==ResultsGroup stage=Main event=== Upper bracket Lower bracket Grand Finals OG inside the playing booth during the hero drafting phase before one of their games The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3‚Äì2. While PSG.LGD earned an direct invite to the tournament by finishing third in the 2017‚Äì2018 Dota Pro Circuit standings, OG earned theirs by playing through and winning the European open qualifiers, which they were required to do per tournament rules following a roster shuffle after three members, Tal \\"Fly\\" Aizik, Gustav \\"s4\\" Magnusson, and Roman \\"Resolut1on\\" Fominok left the team in May 2018. Needing three new members just two weeks before the qualifiers began, OG quickly signed Topias \\"Topson\\" Taavitsainen, a newcomer to the scene who had never performed at a major LAN event prior to the event, Anathan \\"ana\\" Pham, a former member of the team who had taken a year-long break following their previous elimination at The International 2017, and S√©bastien \\"Ceb\\" Debs, who had previously served as the team's coach. Following their win at the European qualifiers, OG were then placed into group A, finishing fourth with a record of 9-7, which seeded them into the upper bracket. There, OG won every series to advance to the grand finals. Facing the lower bracket winner PSG.LGD in it, whom OG had just defeated in the upper bracket finals, OG won the game one, but lost the next two games. Needing another win to avoid losing the series, OG forced a late- game comeback in game four, and subsequently won game five, making them International champions and winning them over 11 million in prize money. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the open qualifiers and had beaten some of the more favored and accomplished teams along the way. Their win also broke the historical trend of Chinese teams winning the International in even years. OG would also later win The International 2019 the following year, becoming the first repeat champion of an International. ===Winnings=== Note: Prizes are in USD {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Place ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Prize money -  style=\\"text-align:center; background:gold;\\"  1st   style=\\"text-align:right\\"  $11,190,158 -  style=\\"text-align:center; background:silver;\\"  2nd   style=\\"text-align:right\\"  $4,069,148 -  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#c96;\\"  3rd   style=\\"text-align:right\\"  $2,670,379 -    4th   style=\\"text-align:right\\"  $1,780,252 -   rowspan=\\"2\\" 5th‚Äì6th   rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:right\\" $1,144,448 -  -  style=\\"text- align:center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 7th‚Äì8th   rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:right\\" $635,804 -  -   rowspan=\\"4\\" 9th‚Äì12th   rowspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text-align:right\\" $381,483 -  -  -  -   rowspan=\\"4\\" 13th‚Äì16th   rowspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text- align:right\\" $127,161 -  -  -  -   rowspan=\\"2\\" 17th‚Äì18th   rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:right\\" $63,580 -  - } ==Legacy== Valve founder and president Gabe Newell giving a speech at the opening ceremony At the time, The International 2018 set an crowdfunded esport prize pool record by eclipsing the previous years' record, finalizing at 25,532,177. Other related events took place during the tournament, such as a cosplay and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize pools. In addition, two live demonstrations of a team of professional players playing against a team of five OpenAI-curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, took place to showcase the capability of machine learning. Although the bots lost both games, the first against paiN Gaming and the second against an all- star team of former Chinese players, they were considered a success by OpenAI who stated that due to the bots playing against some of the best players in Dota 2, it allowed them to analyze and adjust their algorithms for future games. Attendees of the event at the Rogers Arena were given a free copy of Artifact, a then-upcoming Dota 2-themed digital collectible card game. New content for the game itself was also revealed during the event, including two new playable heroes and a Gabe Newell voice pack. The tournament was seen by over 15 million people online, with nearly 20,000 attending the matches at the Rogers Arena. The tournament, alongside OG's upset win over PSG.LGD, were respectively nominated for \\"best esports event\\" and \\"best esports moment\\" at The Game Awards 2018 ceremony. An episode of True Sight, Valve's documentary film series on the professional Dota 2 scene, was filmed during the event. It followed OG and PSG.LGD during the grand finals, documenting a number of behind the scenes moments for both teams before and after matches. It was released online for free on January 15, 2019, and also premiered to a live audience, with members of OG as special guests, at the Palads Teatret in Copenhagen. ==References * 2018 Category:2018 in British Columbia Category:2018 in Canadian sports Category:2018 in esports Category:2018 multiplayer online battle arena tournaments Category:August 2018 sports events in Canada Category:Sports competitions in Canada ","title":"The International 2018"},{"id":"56852370","text":"This following is a list of Telugu-language songs recorded by Indian playback singer K.

The album was released on May 13, 2014 and is the band's first studio album to feature bassist Dan Kelly, formerly a member of the punk rock band The Frisk and guitarist Matt Hoffman, formerly of the punk band Modern Life is War. Pursuance is the band's first album to be released on Rise Records, having the previous two studio albums released on Fat Wreck Chords. The album was produced by Bill Stevenson and was recorded at Stevenson's own recording studio The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. == Critical reception == Pursuance received positive reviews from critics, with the website Dyingscene praising the album for its more melodic sound it showcases compared to the previous studio albums, but still with plenty of anger. Dyingscene also stated in the review that with the band's first two albums being more focused on hardcore punk, this album was \\"both a natural progression and a bit of a departure\\". The review also mentioned the album's \\"bitter lyrics collide with almost metal guitar riffs\\" and that the \\"discordant riffs tie the album together in a very satisfyingly pissed off package\\". Richard Cocksedge of Punknews wrote \\"Where To The Nines failed to ignite my passion, Pursuance is full of fire and brimstone, bringing to the fore the qualities that you would expect from the five members of the band. I still don't like the term 'supergroup' but Only Crime have shown that the bringing together of a variety of people, skilled at their chosen field, can bear fruit.

It contains a planetary torque multiplier or a gearbox. A reaction device that absorbs the torque rather than the tool operator. The torque output is adjusted by varying the voltage on the motor. The battery torque wrench is used to remove stubborn nuts, or to apply accurate torque. The gearboxes can have multiplication ratios up to 125:1. The battery torque wrench is sometimes confused with a standard impact wrench, due to their similar appearance. A battery torque wrench is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. A battery torque wrench has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy. The benefit of a battery torque wrench is its capability to operate independently of an outside power source, making them useful for applications that require work in tight spaces such as oil or gas pipelines. They also come with electronic features not found on pneumatic wrenches. In addition, newer wrench models weigh much less than older battery- powered tools and feature an automatic release function which activates once torque is applied to the bolt. Meanwhile, advancements in battery technology have doubled the life of the batteries used in these wrenches. Newer battery- powered wrenches also allow for brushless motors, leading to a longer motor life. Torque capabilities of battery torque wrenches range from 115 Nm, up to a maximum of 6,500 Nm. (84 Ft lbs - 4794 Ft lbs) The first large-capacity brushless battery torque wrench was invented in Germany in 2013. Before the brushless motor with micro electronics was introduced, the battery torque wrench was not as accurate as it could be. Because of the power limitations of the accurate motor, the tool has 2 speeds: one for speed, and one for power. ==Battery requirements== A brushless battery motor using lithium-ion battery is the most common source of power for battery torque wrenches. The voltage required is designated by the amp hours of a battery. A complete battery with lower ampere hour must have higher voltage, and a physically larger size, to make up for loss of capacity, and vice versa. Manufacturing a battery motor that can handle higher-Ampere hour batteries are more costly, and the internal electronics are more complicated. The more complex the electronics, the more accurate the motor is when shutting off at a desired torque value. A very common battery combination would be compact 18 volt with a 5.2-ampere hour capacity. This combination varies by manufacturer. ==Torque verification== Torque can be verified by a transducer mounted on the outside of the gearbox, connecting to the output shaft of the tool. This transducer can wireless talk via Bluetooth to a mobile smartphone app. This allows the creation of reports, to export incredibly accurate bolting data. In addition, these battery torque wrenches come with a certificate of calibration. The output of these tools can be adjusted by a potentiometer at the calibration facility. ==See also== *Torque multiplier *Electric torque wrench *Pneumatic torque wrench *Socket wrench *Torque wrench *Hydraulic torque wrench *Transducer ==References *Battery Torque Wrench Demonstration *Electrical & Hydraulic Tools Website Category:Hand-held power tools Category:Wrenches ","title":"Battery torque wrench"},{"id":"56852432","text":"\\"Sugar Shuffle\\" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue.

It is based upon the Citro√´n C3 road car and is built to R5 regulations. The car made its d√©but at the 2018 Tour de Corse where it was driven by the French crews of St√©phane Lefebvre and Gabin Moreau, and Yoann Bonato and Benjamin Boulloud. ==Background== In early 2017, Citro√´n began the development of the C3 R5. The C3 would be designed to improve on the previous offerings of Groupe PSA in the R5 discipline, the Peugeot 208 T16 and the Citro√´n DS3 R5, both of which proved problematic and unpopular with R5 customers. The C3 had little relation to its predecessor, the DS3. ===Development=== Throughout summer 2017, Citro√´n Racing Technologies employed factory Citro√´n drivers St√©phane Lefebvre and Craig Breen as part of the development team for the C3, along with Yoann Bonato, who was hired for the project.https://www.lequipe.fr/Rallye/Actualites/Rallye-du-var-yoann-bonato- lance-la-c3-r5/853741 The first working model was completed in September of 2017, and a month later the test C3 made its public debut at the Rallye du Var, with Bonato driving a few stages as a non-competitive entrant to the rally. ===Competition=== The Citro√´n C3 R5 passed international homologation on 1 January 2018, and was now ready for competition. It made its competitive rallying debut at the Tour de Corse in April of that year, with Yoann Bonato taking second place in the WRC-2 class, and 10th overall in the rally. Including the original test cars, a total of 26 C3s have been constructed as of 1 May 2019, with 22 having been sold to independent teams. In the hands of Yoann Bonato, the C3 won the French Rally Championship in 2018, and continues to be used by the Citro√´n World Rally Team in the WRC-2 Pro class of the World Rally Championship, in the hands of Mads √òstberg. Mads √òstberg would give the C3 its first World Championship-level victory at the 2019 Rally Argentina. ==Rally resultsWorld Rally Championship-2 Pro victories=== { style=\\"font-size: 85%; \\" !

Born in Poplar, London, Morgan was active in the Congregational Church, and was appointed as its minister in Greenhithe, Kent, in 1894. Morgan was appointed as chairman of the West Hill Hospital Board in 1910, serving for twenty-five years. His particular interest lay in mental health, and when, in 1921, the National Asylum Workers' Union (NAWU) and the Poor Law Workers' Trade Union decided to appoint a London and Southern Regional Organiser, he took the post. Although the Poor Law Workers' union withdrew from the arrangement the following year, the NAWU kept him on, and he remained in post until 1937, when he retired. Morgan also became active in the Labour Party, representing Dartford on Kent County Council for many years. He was appointed as an alderman, but when the council was restructured in 1949, he decided instead to stand for his old Dartford seat again, and was successful. Morgan contested numerous Parliamentary elections for the Labour Party: in Faversham at the 1918, 1922, 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections, and then in Epsom at the 1929, 1931 and 1935 general elections. He was never elected, his best result being 47.9% of the vote in Faversham in 1923. After retiring from trade union work, Morgan continued in his religious post. During World War II, he led services in a chalk tunnel at Greenhithe, which was being used as an air raid shelter. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Members of Kent County Council Category:English Congregationalist ministers Category:English trade unionists Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:People from Poplar, London ","title":"Stanley Morgan (politician)"},{"id":"56852562","text":"is the assistant coach of the Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball in the NCAA. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Hyogo Storks  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2013-14  54945 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"5th in Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Hyogo Storks  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2014  18108 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Fired---  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"- - - ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Nishinomiya Storks coaches Category:San Francisco Dons men's basketball coaches Category:Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball coaches Category:UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball coaches Category:University of California, Davis alumni ","title":"Danny Yoshikawa"},{"id":"56852584","text":"Camponotus fragilis is a species of ant in the genus Camponotus.

Hernando de Alarc√≥n and Melchior Diaz were Spanish Conquistadors who in 1540 visited the area during the Spanish colonial expeditions. They believed that the narrow crossing of the Colorado River would be ideal for the establishment of a city.Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 , p.15Thomas Edwin Farish, History of Arizona, Volume I. The Filmer Brothers Electrotype Company, San Francisco, 1915. pp. 252-253Yuma Tribe At first the relations between the Yuman and the Spaniards was cordial, however the relation between the two became hostile and the Yuman were forced to submit to the rule of the Spanish government and most were enslaved. In 1853, Yuma ceased to be part of Mexico and became a United States Territory (New Mexico Territory) as a result of Gadsden Purchase. The United States established Fort Yuma and an influx of settlers and farmers of European descent invaded the area. The Yuma Crossing was ideal during and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s. It was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail. The Yuma tribe fiercely resisted the invasion of their homelands and fought against the US in the Yuma War (1850‚Äì1853). They were defeated and were forced to move to Indian Reservations such as the one in western Yuma County in what eventually become the State of Arizona. In 1853, Arizona City, a small settlement was established on the high grounds across Fort Yuma. The settlement continued to grow and the government established the Yuma Quartermaster Depot. From 1864, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, today a state historic park, supplied all forts in present-day Arizona, as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became a separate territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, replacing La Paz County, the first seat. Arizona City was renamed Yuma in 1873. ==Yuma County Historical Society== 1926 Kress Building sign The mission of the Yuma County Historical Society is to preserve the structures of historic significance in the city and county of Yuma.

(9 July 1582, Cologne ‚Äì 1 April 1639, Vienna) was a Cistercian and Benedictine, Abbot of Wilhering then Kremsm√ºnster, Prince-Bishop of Vienna, and President of the Hofkammer. ==Biography== Anton Wolfradt was the son of a tailor. He first began studying Philosophy at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome in 1599. He entered the Cistercian Order in 1601, and in 1604 made solemn profession at Heiligenkreuz Abbey. He then studied Theology in Rome, graduated with a doctorate in Theology and was ordained a priest on 21 October 1607. In 1608 he taught at the Rein Abbey near Graz and was consecutively from 1609 the parson of Gratwein. By the recommendation of Cardinal Khlesl he was confirmed on 21 November 1612 to be Abbot of Wilhering in Upper Austria. Since the monks of the Benedictine Kremsm√ºnster Abbey chose him as their abbot, Pope Paul V allowed a transfer to the Benedictine Order and Wolfradt took to the new office on 15 December 1613. He began with the reform of the monastery and also took on the neighboring abbeys Schlierbach, Gleink and Spital am Pyhrn. Because of his skills in administrative and financial matters, Emperor Ferdinand II appointed him in 1620 to his council and in October 1623 President of the Court Chamber (). Together with the Imperial coin merchant Vinzenz Muschinger, he was commissioned by Emperor Ferdinand to counteract the coinage that had been created in the Kipper und Wipper era. He was also used as a negotiator with the rebellious farmers in Upper Austria and Albrecht von Wallenstein. In 1628, Wolfradt, with Heinrich von Salburg-Falkenstein and Johann Spindler von Hofegg, served as the provisional governing body of Upper Austria, this was forfeited after eight years of negotiations with Bavaria. The office of Hofkammer president, stressful due of the enormous debts of the Emperor, kept Wolfradt until 1630. In 1630, Cardinal Khlesl proposed him as coadjutor in Vienna. On 15 February 1631, the Emperor appointed him Bishop of Vienna; the Papal confirmation took place on May 26. On the 2nd of August, the Emperor raised him to the rank of Imperial prince, and the following day he was consecrated bishop. Neither Ferdinand II nor Ferdinand III had succeeded in their efforts to obtain the cardinalate for Wolfradt. In 1633 he belonged, together with Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg and Maximilian von und zu Trauttmansdorff, to those who considered Wallenstein a conspirator and advised Ferdinand II to arrest him. As a bishop, he sought by religious instruction and preaching to achieve a reconciliation of the Protestants with the Catholic faith. For this he promoted the Jesuit Order both in Vienna and Bohemia. His motto, \\"If the Lord does not will it, there is no use,\\" became very popular, a well-known Viennese song made use of this line. He is buried in the Katharinenkapelle of Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral. The self-written epitaph reads: \\"In my life I was abbot, bishop, prince ‚Äì now I am dust, shadow, nothing.\\" In 1894 the Wolfrathplatz in Vienna-Hietzing was named after him. ==Bibliography== * * Benedict Gsell: Beitrag zur Lebensgeschichte des Anton Wolfradt.

It is next to the river L√®ng and is a part of P·∫Øc Ng√≤i village, Ba B·ªÉ district, B·∫Øc K·∫°n province. The cave could be found in the middle of the mountain, with an altitude of about 350m above sea level, there is a strange cave deep in the mountain in the south-east direction. Local people called it Ca Po - Hua Mak cave. Hua Ma cave has a length of over 700m, with a wide and 40‚Äì50m high ceiling, containing many walls, stalactites shimmering. Visitors climb up to the mountains for about 300 meters to Hua Ma cave, 3 meters wide, 5 meters high. The surface of the cave is flat, dry, clean, occasionally there are rocky terraces, curving stone like winding terraces. Dozens of large stone columns 10‚Äì15m high in the middle of the cave, the hands are hand-carved very delicate like the pillars in ancient temples. Compared to the caves that have been discovered in Vietnam such as Huong Tich, Thien Cung, Phong Nha - Ke Bang, the Hua Mak cave is no worse than the stalactites of stalactites millions of years old. Hua Ma is also known as \\"Suspension Cave\\" because it lies in the middle of the mountain, with an entrance to the east and a passageway to the south. The cave looks down into the waters of Ba Be Lake. From 2003 to 2004, Hua Ma cave was surveyed and put into operation tourism since 2007. Bac Kan province has invested in lighting systems and roads to the cave. Along with Ba Be lake, Pac Ngoi village, Hua Ma cave is determined to form a key tourism complex of Bac Kan province. ==Legend of the cave Huama== According to the people living here, the old Forest Ghost is the place where the devil reigns. In the afternoon, the cries from the cave of Hua Ma hope to shock the whole area until late at night, the people in the area no one dared to travel in that time. On that day a royal general went on a march through here, when it came to the river Leng, it was nearly dark. The horse was about to turn to the side to rest, but strangely, when crossing the Leng River, down to the water, the horse turned his head back, echoing as if signaling something unusual. At the same time from the cave Leo, the howling, the oan soul cry out. Seeing strange things, the officer called the villagers to know that the cry is the soul of the soldiers trapped in the cave, were attacked by the cave door to die but souls are not escaped. Understanding the situation, the chieftain camp right next to the banks of the river Leng and slaughter horses, horse head to worship heaven and earth. Strangely, when the sacrifice was finished, the inanimate voice of the deceased and then gradually disappear, where over the years have sprung up the stalactites are very special, there are places like stone flowers, there are places like Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara teaches the Tripitaka teacher to go to business, there is a place like a palace, palace in the \\"Palace\\".

In MO theory, electrons are portrayed to move in waves. When more than one of these waves come close together, the in-phase combination of these waves produces an interaction that leads to a species that is greatly stabilized. The result of the waves‚Äô constructive interference causes the density of the electrons to be found within the binding region, creating a stable bond between the two species. == Diatomic molecules == The MO diagram for dihydrogen In the classic example of the H2 MO, the two separate H atoms have identical atomic orbitals. When creating the molecule dihydrogen, the individual valence orbitals, 1s, either: merge in phase to get bonding orbitals, where the electron density is in between the nuclei of the atoms; or, merge out of phase to get antibonding orbitals, where the electron density is everywhere around the atom except for the space between the nuclei of the two atoms. Bonding orbitals lead to a more stable species than when the two hydrogens are monatomic. Antibonding orbitals are less stable because, with very little to no electron density in the middle, the two nuclei (holding the same charge) repulse each other. Therefore, it would require more energy to hold the two atoms together through the antibonding orbital. Each electron in the valence 1s shell of hydrogen come together to fill in the stabilizing bonding orbital. So, hydrogen prefers to exist as a diatomic, and not monatomic, molecule. The MO diagram for helium When looking at helium, the atom holds two electrons in each valence 1s shell. When the two atomic orbitals come together, they first fill in the bonding orbital with two electrons, but unlike hydrogen, it has two electrons left, which must then go to the antibonding orbital. The instability of the antibonding orbital cancels out the stabilizing effect provided by the bonding orbital; therefore, dihelium's bond order is 0. This is why helium would prefer to be monatomic over diatomic. == Polyatomic molecules == The MO diagram for a pi bond === Bonding MOs of pi bonds === Pi bonds are created by the ‚Äúside-on‚Äù interactions of the orbitals. Once again, in molecular orbitals, bonding pi (œÄ) electrons occur when the interaction of the two œÄ atomic orbitals are in-phase. In this case, the electron density of the œÄ orbitals need to be symmetric along the mirror plane in order to create the bonding interaction. Asymmetry along the mirror plane will lead to a node in that plane and is described in the antibonding orbital, œÄ*. The MO diagram for butadiene An example of a MO of a simple conjugated œÄ system is butadiene. To create the MO for butadiene, the resulting œÄ and œÄ* orbitals of the previously described system will interact with each other. This mixing will result in the creation of 4 group orbitals (which can also be used to describe the œÄ MO of any diene): œÄ1 contains no vertical nodes, œÄ2 contains one and both are considered bonding orbitals; œÄ3 contains 2 vertical nodes, œÄ4 contains 3 and are both considered antibonding orbitals. === Localized molecular orbitals === The MO diagram for methane The spherical 3D shape of s orbitals have no directionality in space and px, py, and pz orbitals are all 90o with respect to each other. Therefore, in order to obtain orbitals corresponding to chemical bonds to describe chemical reactions, Edmiston and Ruedenberg pioneered the development of localization procedures. For example, in CH4, the four electrons from the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms and the valence electrons from the carbon atom (2 in s and 2 in p) occupy the bonding molecular orbitals, œÉ and œÄ. The delocalized MOs of the carbon atom in the molecule of methane can then be localized to give four sp3 hybrid orbitals. == Applications == Molecular orbitals and, more specifically, the bonding orbital is a theory that is taught in all different areas of chemistry, from organic to physical and even analytical, because it is widely applicable. Organic chemists use molecular orbital theory in their thought rationale for reactions; analytical chemists use it in different spectroscopy methods; physical chemists use it in calculations; it is even seen in materials chemistry through band theory‚Äîan extension of molecular orbital theory. == References == Category:Chemical bonding ","title":"Bonding molecular orbital"},{"id":"56853157","text":"Asabe Shehu Musa Yar'Adua (born 6 June 1956) is the widow of Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, a retired Nigerian Army major general who served as the Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters under General Olusegun Obasanjo's 1977 - 1979 military government.

The collar is made of silver-plated metal and enamel. It is worn on the same length at the front and back. For male recipients, the collar is 100.6 cm long while it is 78.74 cm for female recipients. The differences is because the female's collar is designed to be worn at the neck so it is made without the two chain link in the middle of the male's collar. This necklace has 14 connecting chain link for male, and 12 for female. The two middle chains contain two frames of the Selangor flag that are combined with crescent moon and star. To his left and right are two rubber leaves compositions. All these compositions are made of enamel. The rest of the chain links are round in shape and adorned with coconut leaves around them. These compositions are arranged into four pairs, each of which contains three different types of chromatic compositions, the first containing the word Selangor in jawi, the second contains two crossed fragments of coconut leaves, and the third contains crescent and stars. Each of these compositions is made of shadowed thin, red enamel metal. The breast star is made of silver-plated metal, its surface length is 6.985 cm long and has five arise fractions, complete with circles at the end of each of these fractions, and made of red enamel metal. In the center of this star is a circle of 3.175 cm long bearing the symbol of Selangor state with yellow enamel as the base. The badge is made of silver-plated metal. It is five pointed and decorated just like the breast star. It is also decorated with the engraving of the Selangor State Emblem on red enamel. This badge is made to be suspended on the collar or sash. The sash is made of red silk cloth 10.16 cm in width for male, 5.715 cm for female, with a 2.54 cm wide yellow band in the center. === Knight Commander === It is awarded in a set of breast star, a badge and a red coloured sash with a yellow stripe, worn from right shoulder to the left waist. The shape and size of the badge is the same as the Knight Grand Commander's except the symbols are shown on a flat background, replacing the engraved emblem in the red enamel background in the former. The breast star is also of the same size and shape as Knight Grand Commander's but without the five-pointed silver star. The male sash is made of 10 cm wide red silk cloth with a 2 cm wide yellow band in the middle. To the left and right of the band are two 0.35 cm wide red strips and two 0.35 cm wide yellow strips.

His primary interest is facial reconstruction and he has developed several new procedures. His most high-profile surgery was in 2009 when he worked with a large team of experts to separate the Bangladeshi conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna. In 1990 he created the Children's Craniofacial Foundation of Australia which has subsequently been renamed The Jigsaw Foundation. == Early years == In 1969, Holmes graduated from Melbourne University MBBS with honours in Biology, Physiology, Medical Psychology, and Surgery. He followed this with General Surgery training from 1970 to 1974, then Plastic Surgery training from 1975 to 1978 at Royal Melbourne Hospital. He held positions as Plastic Surgery Resident from 1971 and Senior Plastic Surgery Registrar from 1975 at the same hospital. He became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1978. Holmes undertook a Plastic Surgery Residency at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA from 1976 to 1978. He was certified as a Fellow in Plastic Surgery, Harvard Medical School in 1978 and as a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery in 1982. ==Craniofacial speciality== Since 1978 Holmes has been Consultant Plastic Surgeon at Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne where he set up The Melbourne Craniofacial Unit in 1979. He was head of Cleft and Craniofacial Surgery until 2009 and the Director of the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery from 1990 to 2003 when he became Senior Plastic Surgeon. During his career Holmes has been Consultant Plastic Surgeon for a number of hospitals, often concurrently: 1979 to Present Victorian Plastic Surgery Unit, 1979 to 1989 Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, 1979 to 1980 Peter MacCallum Hospital, Melbourne, 1980 to Present, Epworth Hospital and Consultant Paediatric Plastic Surgeon at Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne 1993 to Present. Holmes has trained over thirty Craniofacial Fellows, the majority of whom have become Heads of Departments in Australia and overseas. He was a young surgeon working in New Guinea when he developed his passion. Holmes has performed life- changing operations on many children during his career. He has developed and improved new procedures to solve many major and difficult craniofacial reconstructive problems. Holmes and colleagues at The Royal Children's Hospital have developed the \\"Melbourne Procedure\\" to normalise the skulls of children with severely deformed heads and has successfully treated more than thirty children. The surgery is not just cosmetic, as restriction on the brain can cause developmental delays. He describes the procedure as ‚Äúnothing more than advanced carpentry‚Äù. This the procedure was used to correct a condition known as scaphocephaly for one-year-old Isaac Jones. In 2018, at 72, Holmes was still working 60 hours a week; raising funds for the Jigsaw Foundation and operating at the Royal Children's Hospital. === Academic positions === Since 1981 Holmes has been Associate, Department of Paediatrics at the University of Melbourne. He was awarded the McIndoe Lectureship of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, London in 2010. He was the inaugural Harvard Plastic Surgery Resident's Visiting Professor in 2012. He has 57 articles listed in PubMed. === Professional societies === Holmes is a member of numerous professional associations and societies: * 1970 Australian Medical Association * 1982 Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons * 1984 Australian Association of Surgeons * 1984 American Society of Plastic Surgeons * 1990 Australian Cleft Lip & Palate Association * 1995 Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons * 1995 Associate Member, The Neurosurgical Society of Australasia Inc. * 1998 Asia Pacific Craniofacial Association * == Jigsaw Foundation == Holmes is the Founder and Board Member of Children's Craniofacial Foundation of Australia which was renamed The Jigsaw Foundation. The foundation, established in 1990, consists of nine voluntary directors and is a donor funded, not-for-profit organisation which promotes research and education in paediatric craniofacial surgery. While service and community organisations are able to provide travel and accommodation, the foundation supports the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Melbourne by providing advanced equipment. The foundation also supports surgeons from both Australia and overseas while they train in paediatric craniofacial surgery in the belief that this is the best way to spread knowledge and skills. Additionally the foundation funds the Jigsaw Foundation Chair of Paediatric Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery at Melbourne University which supports a Professor and several PhD students to carry out further research in paediatric craniofacial surgery. ==Significant cases== Holmes was part of a large team involved in the 27 hour surgery to separate the Bangladeshi conjoin twins, Trishna and Krishna who were joined at the skull. Although they were given only a 25 per cent chance of both surviving the separation surgery without brain damage, in 2010 at 7 years old, they were \\"not only surviving but thriving.\\" Six year old, Kim Thoa Nguyen was brought from Vietnam by Rotary Overseas Medical Aid for Children (ROMAC). In 2001, Holmes and Mr Andrew Heggie, a maxilo-facial surgeon, a dental surgeon who worked on her upper jawbone, spent 8 months correcting severe cranio- facial deformities. Eman Tabaza first came to Australia from Gaza in 2004 when she was eight. Holmes led an eight-hour operation at the Royal Children's Hospital which removed the tumour and rebuilt Eman's face. She returned to Melbourne at 16 for further facial surgery and Professor Tony Penington also performed spinal surgery related to the same birth defect. ROMAC also brought Asi from Papua New Guinea so that Holmes and Neurosurgeon Mr Patrick Lo were able to correct a rare cranio-facial abnormality called an encephalocele. Operation Rainbow and the Australian Filipino Guidance Association raised funds for eight year old Ronald Aguliar to travel to Australia so that surgeons including Holmes could rebuild his severely deformed face. He was able to return home feeling and acting like a normal child. ==Awards== In 2004 Holmes received the Elizabeth Turner Medal which acknowledges ‚Äúexcellence in clinical care provided by a member of the Senior Medical/Dental Staff of the RCH over an extended period of time. This medal is awarded primarily on the basis of the individual‚Äôs contribution to the clinical care of their patients.\\" Holmes was awarded the Royal Children's Hospital Chairman's Medal in 2008 for \\"a member of staff and recognises exemplary achievement by an individual in her or his chosen field. It commemorates an outstanding contribution to the work and reputation of the RCH, and a significant impact by the individual on the hospital‚Äôs vision to be a great children's hospital, leading the way.\\" In January 2018 Holmes became an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for \\"distinguished service to medicine, particularly to reconstructive and craniofacial surgery, as a leader, clinician and educator, and to professional medical associations\\". == References  External links == * The Jigsaw Foundation * Category:Living people Category:20th-century Australian medical doctors Category:21st-century Australian medical doctors Category:Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Category:Officers of the Order of Australia Category:University of Melbourne alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Anthony D.

The Liberal Democratic Party also lost its majority in the House of Councillors, but the LDP maintained control of the House of Councillors with its junior coalition partner Komeito. == Background == The term of members elected in the 2013 regular election (including those elected in subsequent by-elections or as runners-up) was to end on 28 July 2019. Under the \\"Public Offices Election Act\\" (k≈çshoku-senkyo- h≈ç), the regular election must be held within 30 days before that date, or under certain conditions if the Diet is in session or scheduled to open at that time, between 24 and 30 days after the closure of the session and thus potentially somewhat after the actual end of term.e-gov legal database: ÂÖ¨ËÅ∑ÈÅ∏ÊåôÊ≥ï , chapter 5 (election dates), article 32 (regular elections) Going into the election, the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner Komeito controlled a two-thirds super-majority of seats in the House of Representatives but did not control a similar super-majority of seats in the House of Councillors, necessary to initiate amendments of the Constitution of Japan. === Pre-election composition === (as of 15 March 2018)House of Councillors: Members Strength of the Political Groups in the House (only caucus totals and female members; full Japanese version partitioned by class/end of term and election segment ‰ºöÊ¥æÂà•ÊâÄÂ±ûË≠∞Âì°Êï∞‰∏ÄË¶ß) { style=\\"width:67em; font- size:88%; text-align:center;\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"‚Üì - style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"  style=\\"background:blue; width:17.77%; color:white;\\"  44  B0CEFF; width:13.64%; color:white;\\"  32  style=\\"background:gold; width:2.48%; color:white;\\"  6  style=\\"background:goldenrod; width:3.31%; color:white;\\"  8  FFB6B6; width:4.55%; color:white;\\"  11  FFB6B6; width:28.93%; color:white;\\"  70  style=\\"background:red; width:5.79%; color:white;\\"  14  style=\\"background:red; width:23.14%; color:white;\\"  57 - style=\\"font- weight:bold\\"  style=\\"color:blue;\\"   style=\\"color:blue;\\"   style=\\"color:gold;\\"   style=\\"color:gold;\\"   style=\\"color:red;\\"   style=\\"color:red;\\"   style=\\"color:red;\\"   style=\\"color:red;\\"  } In the class of members facing re-election, the ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), K≈çmeit≈ç and Party for Japanese Kokoro (PJK) had a combined 81 of 121 seats (as of March 2018). The governing coalition would have to lose 30 seats or more to forfeit its overall majority in the House of Councillors and face a technically divided Diet. However, as independents and minor opposition groups might be willing to support the government on a regular basis without inclusion in the cabinet, the losses required to face an actual divided Diet may have been much higher. If the Diet is divided after the election, the coalition's two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives can still override the House of Councillors and pass legislation, but certain Diet decisions, notably the approval of certain nominations by the cabinet such as public safety commission members or Bank of Japan governor, would require the cooperation of at least part of the opposition or an expansion of the ruling coalition. Among the members facing re-election were House of Councillors President Chuichi Date (LDP, Hokkaido), K≈çmeit≈ç leader Natsuo Yamaguchi (K, Tokyo) and Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko (LDP, ). == District reapportionment == The following districts saw a change in their representation within the House at this election. One set of reforms were introduced in 2012 and first took effect at the 2013 election. The districts below are affected by the 2015 reforms, which started to take effect in the 2016 election. In May 2018, the government announced that they are planning to introduce a revision into the Public Offices Election Law before the 2019 election. The proposed changes increased the number seats in the House by 6, 2 seats in the Saitama at-large district and 4 in the national PR block. As Saitama currently has the highest voters- to-councillor ratio, the increase would reduce its ratio gap with the least populous district (below the constitutional 3 to 1 limit). Meanwhile the seat increase in the PR block is aimed to address the absence of representation of prefectures in the merged-prefecture districts (namely Tottori-Shimane and Tokushima-K≈çchi) and popular discontent in those prefectures. The plan also introduced a ranking system for the PR lists. This essentially changed it from a most open list system into a less open list system, mirroring the one used in the House of Representatives elections. To reduce the chance of the non- representation of a prefecture, candidates from prefectures not running in the merged districts were to be prioritised on the list. Under the plan, the new Saitama seat and two new PR seats were contested in 2019, while the other three would be contested in 2022. {  - ! District !! Magnitude !!

In 2017, she was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months and 22 days in prison for ‚Äúterrorist propaganda‚Äù because of her news coverage, social media posts, and sharing a painting of hers on social media. Her painting depicts the destruction of the Nusaybin, town in southeastern Turkey, after the clashes between state security forces and Kurdish insurgents. After she finished her sentence, she was released from imprisonment from Tarsus Prison on 24 February 2019. ==Career== She was a founder and the editor of Jinha, a feminist Kurdish news agency with an all-female staff. Jinha was closed on 29 October 2016 by Turkish authorities, as one of over 100 media outlets shut down since the failed coup d'√©tat in July 2016. In February 2016, Doƒüan moved to and began reporting from Nusaybin. === Arrest and imprisonment === On 21 July 2016, she was detained at a caf√© in Nusaybin and then incarcerated on 23 July in Diyarbakir prison. Her release pending trial was ordered on the 9 December of the same year. On 2 March 2017, she was acquitted of the charge of \\"belonging to an illegal organisation\\", but was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months and 22 days in jail for her news reporting and posting a painting to social media. She appealed the sentence but it was confirmed and she was arrested on 12 July 2017. ‚ÄúI was given two years and 10 months [jail time] only because I painted Turkish flags on destroyed buildings. However, they (Turkish government) caused this. I only painted it,‚Äù Doƒüan wrote on Twitter following the sentencing. In prison, she and other women created the newspaper √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem Zindan (Free Agenda Dungeon), whose name is a wordplay on √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem (Free Agenda), an Istanbul-based publication that catered to Kurdish audiences. Zehra Doƒüan was released from prison in February 2019. === International reaction to the imprisonment === In November 2017, Chinese dissident artist Ai WeiWei published a letter he wrote in solidarity with Doƒüan's case, drawing parallels between Chinese and Turkish repression of artistic expression.

The central tower of the south facade, which contains the staircase is pierced on the ground floor of a radiating Gothic door. The typically feudal and defensive character of the castle is somewhat mitigated by the existence of later windows on the three floors. The defensive system which surrounded it (enclosure, ditch, fortifications) disappeared, replaced by two wings in the 17th century. Inside, the ground floor has kept its kitchen intact, with the mesh stage where the musicians were based.

In 1930, she joined the newly established Haandarbejdets Fremme (Danish Handcraft Guild), where over the next 65 years she created hundreds of mainly cross- stitch patterns. They have been widely used not only in Denmark, but also in Germany, the United States and Japan. She also contributed to a number of embroidery guides, some in English, published from the 1950s to the 1970s. ==Early life and education== Born on 20 May 1907 in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg, Ida Anna Winckler was the daughter of Peter Johan Winckler (1862‚Äì1953), a sea captain, and Anna Elise Bornholm (1869‚Äì1907). Her artistic talents were developed at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Arts and Crafts School for Women) under Margrete Drejer and Gunnar Biilmann Petersen. Drejer introduced her to both Danish and foreign styles of sewing and embroidery, including complex techniques such as goldwork. On receiving her diploma in 1928, Winckler remained at the school as a teacher, developing embroidery patterns, especially for whitework, for use as educational aids in high schools. ==Career== In 1930, Winckler gained employment at the newly established Danish Handcraft Guild where for the next 65 years she created hundreds of embroidery patterns which were widely used both in Denmark and in countries such as Germany, the United States and Japan. They were intended principally for decorating the home, consisting of wall panels, table cloths and Christmas items, but they also covered handbags finely embroidered in silks. Her early work represented patterns for reproducing traditional work such as 17th-century silk-embroidered canvas and 19th-century rural whitework. Later, much of her work was more freely designed, as she began to create simpler patterns, especially for cross stitch which became popular after the Second World War. Here Winckler became a major contributor, creating artistically presented patterns, often with intricate detail. Her cross-stitch patterns for houses are of particular note, as are her representations of the coats of arms of Danish and Swedish cities. Her patterns were based on watercolour paintings or colour photographs of the scenes or objects she intended to reproduce. She had a gift for selecting appropriately coloured threads and for emphasizing the most important features. She also managed to give her work a modern look. Her many published works testify to her diligent approach, overcoming the limitations of the availability of only about 80 available colours for cross stitch. Together with Gerda Bengtsson, she developed a colour-identification system, indicating on a black-and-white pattern which colours should be used for the different sections. From the 1970s, Winckler collaborated with Anna Sofie Boesen Dreijer in developing sewing patterns for embroidering traditional folk costumes for Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme, a folk dance association. Ida Winckler died on 4 April 1995 in Copenhagen. ==Publications== Ida Winckler has contributed to a number of sewing guides in Danish and other languages.

The Cambridge English Qualifications are based on the candidate's scoring on the Cambridge English Scale which is a single range of scores used to report results for Cambridge English Language Assessment exams. It was introduced in January 2015, with Cambridge English Scale scores replacing the standardised score and candidate profile used for exams taken pre-2015. The scale aims to provide exam users with more detailed information about their exam performance than was previously available. Each of the qualifications is also aligned with a level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Cambridge English Qualifications are set and administered by Cambridge Assessment English (previously known as Cambridge English Language Assessment and University of Cambridge ESOL examination). ==History== Cambridge Assessment English exams, starting with C2 Proficiency in 1913, B2 First in 1939, and B1 Preliminary in 1980, gave learners and teachers different curriculum and examination levels. By the early 1990s, with the addition of A2 Key and C1 Advanced, Cambridge English exams provided a range of different curriculum and examination levels.Hawkey, R, Milanovic, M (2013) Cambridge English Exams. The first hundred years The concept of a framework of reference levels for English language learning, teaching and assessment, laid the foundations for the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/23119-research- notes-07.pdf During the mid-1990s, Cambridge Assessment English and other founding members of the newly formed Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) then worked to relate different language qualifications within a shared framework of reference. The ALTE Framework was developed simultaneously alongside the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) published in draft form in 1997. Both frameworks share a common conceptual origin, similar aims and comparable scales of empirically developed descriptors. ==The qualifications== Each of the Cambridge English Qualifications focuses on a level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). There are Cambridge English Qualifications for schools,https://www.britishcouncil.cz/sites/default/files/british-council- english-exams-guide.pdf general and higher education, and business. {  - !

The study of how learners are motivated was pioneered in the post-war years by John William Atkinson at the University of Michigan. In his book Motivation and Achievement, Atkinson argued that motivation is increased when there is an attainable goal in an activity that is highly valued.Atkinson, J. and J.O. Raynor, Motivation and Achievement. 1974, New York: Wiley. John Hattie and Helen Timperley of the University of Auckland argue that assessment feedback is most effective when it relates to specific tasks, and focuses on how to improve. They propose that there are three important questions for learners: * What are my goals? * What progress am I making towards them? * What activities are needed to make better progress?Hattie, J. and H. Timperley, The power of feedback. Review of educational research, 2007. 77(1): p. 81-112. Cambridge English Qualifications aim to provide information about the learners‚Äô level in each individual language skill (reading, writing, speaking and listening), to enable learners to take action on problem areas and monitor their own progress.Black, P. and D. Wiliam, Developing a theory of formative assessment, in Assessment and learning. 2012. p. 206-230.

It is thought to have been written on 20 November 1963 and was first published in 1970 in Jandl's volume Der k√ºnstliche Baum [Eng: the artificial tree]. The poem is made up of simple sentences of two to four words that contain exclusively the vowel \\"o\\". It tells the story of a short episode in the life of a dog and its owner: after Otto sends his badly behaved pug away, he begins to miss it and calls it back. The reaction of the returning pug is, however, not quite what is expected: it vomits. Ottos mops is one of Jandl's most famous humorous poems. The author himself labelled it a 'Sprechgedicht': a poem that creates its particular effect best when read aloud. It is frequently used in German schools as an example of concrete poetry, and has inspired several imitations by other poets, and by children. == Content and style == Ernst Jandl's ottos mops and Elizabeth MacKiernan's Lulu's Pooch link to full text (please observe copyright laws) ottos mops is made up of 14 lines divided into 3 stanzas. At the beginning, a badly behaved pug is sent away by his owner, who is called Otto. ‚Äûottos mops trotzt otto: fort mops fort ottos mops hopst fort\\" [otto's pug defies him otto: away pug away otto's pug hops away] Otto comments on the fact that the pug follows his command with the word \\"soso\\". Then he completes every-day activities, such as fetching coke and fruit. After a while, he listens for the pug, calls it, and hopes that it returns. The pug knocks, and is greeted joyfully by Otto, but its reaction is unexpected: ‚Äûottos mops kommt ottos mops kotzt otto: ogottogott\\" Ernst Jandl: ottos mops. In: Jandl: Poetische Werke. Band 4. Luchterhand, M√ºnchen 1997, , p. 60. [otto's pug comes otto's pug pukes otto: ohgodohgod] Because the sound of the poem is so important, a literal translation such as that above does not do it justice. Translations of ottos mops therefore tend to carry the basic structure of the poem into other languages, conveying Jandl's word play freely. As such, Elizabeth MacKiernan translated ottos mops for the US-American Jandl poetry collection Reft and Light as Lulu‚Äôs Pooch.Ernst Jandl: Lulu‚Äôs Pooch. Translated by: Elizabeth MacKiernan. In: Ernst Jandl: Reft and Light. Poems, translated from the German by various American poets. Burning Deck Press, Providence 2000, , p. 33. In 2005, the online service sightandsight.com held a competition to translate ottos mops in honor of Jandl's 80th birthday. Scottish scholar of German Brian O.Murdoch won with his poem fritz‚Äôs bitch.And the winner is... on signandsight.com from 28 September 2005. == Text analysis == The most striking feature of the poem ottos mops is that it is univocalic: all the words contain only the vowel \\"o\\", while consonant selection remains free. This radically restricts word choice. It does not make word choice strictly serial in the sense of generative poetics, but rather allows the composition of a text under a variety of possibilities, which tells a particular story.Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 80. The poem is composed of 41 words with o-assonance, but is only built out of 15 different root words that are continually repeated. There are only two acting characters: Otto and the pug. They are assigned verbs that appear in the first person singular indicative present tense, the only exception to this being the imperative \\"komm\\" [Eng: come] with which Otto calls his pug back, and which stands out because it is repeated.The only punctuation mark used is the colon, to introduce direct speech.Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 75. By not using punctuation in his works, Jandl refers to Gertrude Stein's idea that commas get in the way of the reader's activity and autonomy when their only function is to make reading easier. Equally characteristic for Jandl is that the poem is written entirely in lowercase, which has a visual function in his poetry, where capital letters are reserved for special emphasis.Uhrmacher: Spielarten des Komischen. Ernst Jandl und die Sprache, p. 174‚Äì175. In German, every noun is capitalized - in contrast to English, which only uses capitals for proper nouns - so this is even more striking. Every line of the poem begins with the anaphor \\"otto\\", or the possessive (genitive) \\"ottos\\". Even in the title, the pug follows directly, in a combination that is repeated 5 times in the poem, and which underlines the close relationship between the two characters. The sentences are short, sometimes elliptical, and consist of 2 to a maximum of 4 words. In their simplicity they are reminiscent of the words of a young child. The individual words are monosyllabic, with the exception of \\"otto\\" and his comments \\"soso\\" and \\"ogottogott\\", which stand out because they are polysyllabic and because they are reduplicated. The pug is the grammatical subject of five sentences. The first and last stanzas of the poem show the pug's actions, which are commented on by Otto, who himself first becomes the agent in the middle of the stanza.Uhrmacher: Spielarten des Komischen. Ernst Jandl und die Sprache, p. 139‚Äì140. Because of this, the first and last stanzas are syntactically analogous, but they contrast semantically: the growing distance between Otto and his pug in the first four lines is juxtaposed with the parallel return of the dog at the end. The line \\"ottos mops kotzt\\" rhymes with the first line \\"ottos mops trotzt\\", linking the beginning and the end of the poem and making the end the consequence of the beginning.Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 76. == Interpretation == Although ottos mops is frequently mentioned in poetry studies, there have been relatively few studies which focus exclusively on ottos mops.Uhrmacher: Spielarten des Komischen. Ernst Jandl und die Sprache, p. 138‚Äì139. === Order and revolt === For the German scholar Andreas Brandtner, the title already shows the relationship between Otto and the pug: the possessive genitive assigns and subordinates the pug to Otto. In addition, the pug is only ever referred to by its breed, which, being a traditional domestic dog, further suggests that Otto is the pug's master. This situation is disrupted by the rebelliousness of the defiant pug, without any explanation of what exactly the pug is rebelling against. After Otto has sent the pug away, the conflict subsides for a while, while Otto is distracted by other activities. However, it is not long before he regrets sending the pug away. He calls to the pug, and his hope that it will return reveals their inner bond. Otto's listening tension is answered by the pug knocking in the third stanza. For a moment, it seems as though the conflict will be resolved, due to the pug's obedience. But the pug vomits, which breaks this accord and refers back to the pug's original defiance: in an instinctive act, the dog continues its attitude of defiance. Otto's rather indifferent or even threatening \\"soso\\" gives way to an appalled \\"ogottogott\\", an exclamation which contains the palindrome \\"otto\\".Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 76‚Äì78. Brandtner sees two levels at the core of the poem: the communication between human and animal, between master and hound, whose effectiveness is questioned; and the power relationship of the character constellation and its reference to real social-historic processes. According to Brandtner, this places ottos mops within the tradition of Jandl's other poetry, which, in the broadest sense, can always be understood as critical of society and language. At the same time, a democratic perspective is also inherent in ottos mops: the simple style encourages the reader to develop their own language games, and opens up participation in the production of poetry to the reader, in accordance with the avant-garde belief that art should play a role in everyday life.Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 80‚Äì81, 84. === Humor and poetry === Friederike Mayr√∂cker with Jandl at a reading, Vienna 1974 The German scholar Anne Uhrmacher, who wrote a dissertation on Jandl's poetry, feels that what differentiates ottos mops from the many adaptions that came as a consequence of its growing popularity is the form of humor that is different from the wit and irony of many attempts in the same style. She quotes Ludwig Reiners: \\"Wit laughs, humor smiles. Wit is ingenious, humor is affectionate. Wit sparkles, humor is radiant.\\"Ludwig Reiners: Stilkunst. Ein Lehrbuch deutscher Prosa. C. H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2004, , p. 422. In this sense, according to Uhrmacher, Jandl's humor, which is expressed in Otto's longing for the pug as well as in the comfort of the little world described, is far more than just witty word play.Uhrmacher: Spielarten des Komischen. Ernst Jandl und die Sprache, p. 144‚Äì145. Jandl himself differentiated the cheerful tone of poems such as ottos mops from the \\"grim\\" and \\"grotesque\\" humor of other texts. These, he argued, are poems \\"where people are right to laugh and where you don‚Äôt notice any controversial intentions.\\"Ernst Jandl: ich sehr lieben den deutschen sprach. Im Gespr√§ch mit Peter Huemer. In Wespennest 125/2001, , p. 27. Dieter Burdorf, another German scholar, sees a different form of humor in ottos mops. The poem reminds him of the slapstick humor of early silent films or of comic strips. Thus the comedy arises here not from the trivial content, but rather from the sound structure. The \\"o\\" sound is an exclamation of astonishment. The facial expression that the performer adopts, with rounded mouth for the \\"o\\", invites cabaret-like exaggeration in the opening and closing of the lips, and this itself was adopted by Jandl himself in the performance of the poem.Dieter Burdorf: Einf√ºhrung in die Gedichtanalyse. Zweite Auflage. Metzler, Stuttgart 1997, , p. 39 Hans Mayer also discusses Jandl's elocution: \\"For children, Ernst Jandl‚Äôs concrete poetry was always immediately evident. [...] When Jandl himself recites it, children imitate him.\\"Hans Mayer: Nachwort. In: Ernst Jandl: dingfest. Luchterhand, Neuwied 1973, , p. 103. Volker Hage feels that nobody could \\"shout out, whisper, celebrate, stutter, twist, chop up, spit out or caress their own lines\\" like Jandl. For him, ottos mops sounds as though it is structured like a nursery rhyme.Volker Hage: Alles erfunden. Portr√§ts deutscher und amerikanischer Autoren. Rowohlt, Hamburg 1988, , p. 154, 157. In her commentary on ottos mops, Jandl's life companion Friederike Mayr√∂cker referred to \\"the author‚Äôs linguistic analysis of a vowel: he sings the high praises of O, of O-animal, of O-God, ohgodohgod, of the dog owner Otto, of the pug, who found his way back home, and we all laugh and cry\\". She sees the reader as being affected by a naive sympathy for both the owner of the pug and the pug itself: they are brought back to their early childhood experiences with animals. In the lines of the poem, a transition is accomplished \\"that succeeds afresh every time, namely from love of the vowel, to the reality of the image; from belief in the O for the revelation of poetry\\".Friederike Mayr√∂cker: On: ottos mops. In: Requiem f√ºr Ernst Jandl. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main 2001, , p. 43‚Äì44. == Position in Jandl's works == Ottos mops was not Jandl's first attempt at writing poems which used only one vowel. In August 1963 he wrote das gro√üe e [Eng: the great e], a cycle of nine poems that are consistently based around the vowel \\"e\\",Ernst Jandl: das gro√üe e. In: Ernst Jandl: Poetische Werke. Band 3.

In the collection der k√ºnstliche baum, Jandl sorted his poems according to type, and in doing so differentiated between visual poems and sound poems. Ottos mops was placed in the section of \\"lese- und sprechgedichte\\" [Eng: read and spoken poetry]. In 1957, Jandl said the following of this form of poetry: \\"The sprechgedicht only becomes effective when it is read aloud. The length and intensity of the sounds are fixed in the way they are written. Tension arises through the sequences of short and long sounds [...], the hardening of the words through the lack of vowels [...], the dismantling of the word and the adding together of its elements to create new expressive groups of sound [...], varied repetition of words with the thematically justified addition of new words, up to the explosive ending.\\"Ernst Jandl: Das Sprechgedicht. In: Ernst Jandl: Poetische Werke. Band 11, p. 8. In terms of subject matter, dogs play a big role in Jandl's poetry. J√∂rg Drews counted 42 poems that mention dogs, which makes up 3% of Jandl's total production.J√∂rg Drews: Der Mensch ist dem Menschen ein Hund. Tiermetaphern und tierische Metaphern bei Ernst Jandl.

Forum, Udine 1997, , p. 153‚Äì164, here p. 153. == Reception == The poetry collection der k√ºnstliche baum [Eng: the artificial tree], in which ottos mops was first published, proved to be an immediate sales success. Initially 4,000 books were printed, which rose to 10,000 copies in a further two printings within the first year alone. In the mid-1970s, Jandl himself counted the volume as one of his three standard works. The poem ottos mops has also been published in collections of Jandl's poems and in anthologies. It has been incorporated into poetry books for children and young people, adapted into a picture book, published multiple times as an audio and music recording, and it is also the title of a German-language computer game, subtitled \\"In search of Jandl\\", which leads the player through Ernst Jandl's poetry.Brandtner: Von Spiel und Regel. Spuren der Machart in Ernst Jandls ottos mops, p. 73‚Äì74. Ottos mops has often been performed by others as well as Jandl himself, such as Harry Rowohlt. In short, ottos mops became one of Jandl's most famous humorous poems. Robert Gernhardt called it \\"the second most popular poem of the German tongue [...] after Goethe‚Äôs Wanderer's Nightsong.Robert Gernhardt: In Zungen reden. Stimmenimitationen von Gott bis Jandl.

The film marks the feature film directorial debut of actress Jennifer Morrison, who also plays a supporting role in the film. The film premiered at the LA Film Festival in June 2017 and was released on Netflix on April 6, 2018. ==Plot== Ned Chipley (Angarano) is a mentally handicapped individual who lives with his mother Rose (Janney) and his stepfather Bob Garrity (O'Neill). Chipley, whose birthday is on September 11, is tempted by the 9/11 attacks to enlist. However, he is politely rejected, with the marines listed at the station always feeling sorry for him. Ned, as a result of this, cancels his birthday dinner and goes to work at the casino. Bob is in the middle of a lawsuit against his truck-driving company for his back injuries, much to the consternation of Rose, who is frustrated with constantly having to stay in the same place, but stays strong for Ned, nevertheless. In Ned's latest attempt to enlist, Staff Sergeant Jenkins (Xzibit) politely lies to Ned about a fictitious unit known as \\"Sun Dogs\\" which keep watch over sleeper cells of Al- Qaeda in the United States after hearing about Ned's desire to \\"save lives\\". Ned takes this seriously and proceeds to print out note cards which he passes, spreading the message of the sleeper cells to everyone he meets, informing them to \\"stay vigilant\\". Ned also encourages Rose to follow her dreams of being an EMT and move to New York City. Rose, who realizes that she has what it takes and has been using Ned as an excuse to stay behind, agrees to do so. Bob discovers that there is a potential gold mine in the area near his home but fears doing physical activity out of fear of losing the lawsuit. At the casino, Ned approaches Tally Petersen (Benoist), a woman constantly thrown out for flirting with the people inside and alerts her to the sleeper cells in the United States. Tally, mistakenly believing Ned to be a marine, becomes tempted to help with the investigation as she is struggling financially and faces the worst-case scenario of being evicted from the trailer park she lives in. However, she and Ned become close when they go on stakeouts after Ned mistakenly believes his boss, Sameer Udday, to be an agent working for Al- Qaeda. Ned and Tally go on multiple stakeouts and trail Udday everywhere he goes, filming him and his activities. Tally, who has a gift in filmmaking, makes and edits videos which they submit as \\"evidence\\" to Jenkins. The investigation continues until it ultimately leads to the two of them sneaking back into the casino. When caught, Tally is almost arrested for trespassing until Ned uses his strength acquired from training for the Marines to choke the security guard unconscious. This leads to Ned being fired and Bob having to bail Ned out of jail. Tally is grateful to Ned and becomes even more convinced that he is a Marine. As Thanksgiving approaches, Ned invites Tally over to his house but Tally is initially hesitant as she has unsuccessfully tried flirting with Bob before to get a ride back to her trailer. When it starts storming, Ned and Tally take shelter indoors where Tally reveals that her mother had always wanted to take her to San Francisco but they couldn't afford to move there due to them living paycheck to paycheck. As a result, she had low self esteem and wrote that she would walk to the train station and if no one said hello to her, she would kill herself (which she ended up doing). Tally claims that Ned is a caring person and tearfully states that Ned would've said hello to her, before realizing that she is in love with him, ultimately deciding to have dinner with him on Thanksgiving. At Thanksgiving, Tally has dinner with the Chipleys, much to the consternation of Bob. Rose, upon learning of Tally's filmmaking talents, suggests that she apply to film school. However, seeing that she still believes that Ned is a Marine and that Tally genuinely cares for Ned, she decides not to let spill his secret right away. Later, Bob is shocked that Rose has accepted a job as an EMT in New York City. Rose admits that it was time for her to find her calling, promising to visit. However, Bob is still depressed as he is waiting on the lawsuit to succeed. Rose insists that she can't wait forever and kisses Bob goodbye before leaving for New York to follow her dreams. When Tally receives a transcript of the video recording of Udday's conversation after the two mistakenly believe that there was going to be a second attack by Al-Qaeda, Tally goes to visit Ned's house to find Bob there. Bob, tired of the charade that Rose let go on, lets Tally know the truth about Ned. Tally, in denial, refuses to believe it but when she finally goes into Ned's room, the truth becomes apparent that he is not a Marine, breaking her heart. Tally lashes out at Ned for deceiving her and leaves him heartbroken, hinting that Ned had feelings for Tally as well. Ned informs Jenkins that he resigns, alarming him. Bob, seeing that Ned's depression is gradually getting worse as he is refusing to even shave and is continually wearing the Cougar mascot head from high school, calls Jenkins to talk some sense into Ned. When Jenkins arrives, he apologizes to Ned for lying to him and lets him know the truth about why he never allowed him to enlist. He then bids Ned farewell and leaves, telling him that he should find his purpose in life. Ned receives postcards from his mother and Tally, who wrote to apologize for lashing out at him. She reveals that she submitted the videos from the stakeout to a film school in San Francisco and got accepted there, inspired by Ned's optimism and brave spirit, reaffirming her love for him. Bob buys a metal detector using eBay and he and Ned search for the gold mine in the property near their house. They go at night so as to avoid being seen doing physical activity. Bob ultimately decides to make a decision regarding dropping the lawsuit as he knew he would lose anyway. He then gives fatherly advice to Ned, telling him that he admires Ned for taking risks, but he should know his limits and avoid setting unrealistic goals for himself, telling him that he often tends to go astray when thinking about what he wants in life. Ned, remembering what Tally had said to him about people committing suicide from low self-esteem and that if they could be saved then in 50 years it would even out 9/11, takes into account her conservative math. Inspired by the story of her mother's suicide, Ned makes a collection of notecards with the phrase \\"HELLO, HOW ARE YOU DOING?\\" and, moving to San Francisco to be with Tally, heads to the Golden Gate Bridge and passes one of the note cards to a woman who is evidently contemplating suicide. ==Cast== * Michael Angarano as Ned Chipley * Melissa Benoist as Tally Petersen * Alvin \\"Xzibit\\" Joiner as Master Sgt.

Sheri Linden from The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Morrison balances her affection for all the characters with droll naturalism and an assured visual style.\\" Renee Schonfeld from Common Sense Media gave a positive review, writing : \\"Jennifer Morrison's initial feature direction is a delicate movie, honest within the constraints of its fantastical premise. It focuses on relationships, compassion, and every individual's right to live a life of purpose. Sun Dogs is gentle, heartfelt, and skilled. Working with notable actors, she brings nuance and grace to what, in lesser hands, might have been stereotypes of America's struggling working class.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2017 independent films Category:American films Category:2017 films Category:English-language films Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:American independent films Category:2017 comedy-drama films Category:American comedy-drama films ","title":"Sun Dogs (2017 film)"},{"id":"56853833","text":"Sir Roger Sewell Bacon, MBE (23 January 1895 ‚Äì 17 February 1962) was a British judge who was Chief Justice of Gibraltar (1946‚Äì55) and a Justice of Appeal on the East African Court of Appeal (1955‚Äì57). == Early life and education == Roger Sewell Bacon was born on 23 January 1895, the elder son of Sewell Bacon.\\"Bacon, Sir Roger (Sewell)\\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007).

It belongs to the prymnesin family and has potent hemolytic and ichthyotoxic properties. In a purified form it appears as a pale yellow solid. P. parvum is responsible for red harmful algal blooms worldwide, causing massive fish killings. When these algal blooms occur, this compound poses a threat to the local fishing industry. This is especially true for brackish water, as the compound can reach critical concentrations more easily. == Structure and reactivity == The structural formula of prymnesin-2 is: C96H136Cl3NO35. The compound has two chiral centers, at the carbon atoms C14 and C85. The molecule is amphoteric, which means that it can act both as base and an acid. This is because all 16 hydroxyls, except for one at C32, are concentrated on carbons C48-84, and there is a xylose moiety at C77. This might lead to interaction with biomembranes, which is thought to be the basis of its toxicity. The difference between prymnesin-1 and prymnesin-2 is the glycosidic residues: L-arabinose, D-galactose and D-ribose, yet prymnesin-2 and prymnesin-1 show comparable activities. Prymnesins also have unique features: The possession of only one methyl, but three chlorine atoms, acetylene bonds, sugars and an amino group. === Synthesis === There is not much known about the synthesis of prymnesin-1 and prymnesin-2 in vivo. However, it is likely that both are derived from acetate-related metabolism, based on knowledge about the structure of the prymnesins. In general primary and secondary metabolites such as fatty acids, polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides are synthesised by the acetate pathway == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of prymnesin-2 remains to be determined. Prymnesin-2 and prymnesin-1 show comparable activities. Prymnesin-2 has shown multiple functionalities, such as potent hemolytic activity and diverse biological activities, such as mouse lethality, ichthyotoxicity and activity inducing Ca2+ influx into cultured cells. The hemolytic potency of prymnesin-2 exceeds that of plant saponin by 50.000 times. Prymnesin-2 causes hemolysis by direct interaction between toxin and cell surface. Partly due to interaction with cellular lipids, mainly to interaction with a specific binding site on the blood cell surface. This is supported by the observation of competitive inhibition by the prymnesin-2 analogues, which assume the presence of a specific binding site on the blood cell surface. Also the process of toxin molecule aggregation may be involved in the main mechanism of the haemolytic activity. == Toxicity == Prymnesin-2 is an ichthyotoxic compound with the ability to hemolyze blood. 2.5 nM is needed for a 50% hemolysis rate of a 1% rat blood cell suspension, and 9 nM is enough for killing freshwater fish. The hemolytic and ichthyotoxic properties increase when the pH of the solution rises from 7 to 8. Prymnesin-2 causes calcium ion influx into C6 rat glioma cells at a concentration of 70 nM. Besides the lytic effect on blood cells, hepatocytes, Hela cells and artificial liposomes are affected by prymnesin-2. As seen in the table below, prymnesin-2 is highly hemolytic for blood cells of different animal species, even when compared to the already highly hemolytic toxin saponin. {  +Table1. Sensitivities of blood cells from different animal species ! !Prymnesin-2 (nM) !Saponin (nM) !Relative to saponin - Mouse 2.5 17000 6800 - Rabbit 1.7 15000 8800 - Dog 0.5 25000 50000 - Sheep 0.6 23000 38000 - Chicken 1.9 17000 8900 - Carp 1.6 11500 7200 } == Effects on animals == In the US, the first recorded P. parvum bloom occurred in 1985 in a semi-arid region of the country (Pecos River, Texas).James T. L., De La Cruz A.. Prymnesium parvum Carter (Chrysophyceae) as a suspect of mass mortalities of fish and shellfish communities in western Texas, Texas Journal of Science, 1989, vol. 41 (pp. 429-430). Since then, the incidence of P. parvum blooms dramatically increased in the US, where the organism has invaded lakes and rivers throughout southern regions and most recently into northern regions. The magnitude of P. parvum blooms are also increasing over the past decade compared to 30 years ago, with massive fish killings as result. ==See also== * Prymnesin-1 * Prymnesin-B1 == References == Category:Phycotoxins Category:Polyether toxins Category:Polyynes Category:Primary alcohols Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Conjugated enynes Category:Amines Category:Organochlorides Category:Halohydrins Category:Halogen-containing natural products Category:Glycosides ","title":"Prymnesin-2"},{"id":"56853872","text":"NH 11.

He appeared in opera houses in London in the 1830s; from 1838 he lived in America, appearing in New York and touring the USA and Canada. ==Early life and career== Seguin was born in London on 7 April 1809. His father, Ralph Arthur Seguin (1781/2‚Äì1865), was for many years secretary at Her Majesty's Theatre; his mother was Sarah n√©e Smythe. He was of Irish descent. He was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, from which he narrowly escaped dismissal for some youthful breaches of discipline in 1827. In that year he came into prominence by his singing at a students' public concert in the Hanover Square Rooms. His performance of the part of Basilio in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, at the first dramatic performance of the Royal Academy of Music on 8 December 1828, was warmly praised by the press. On 6 November 1830 he was in the academy's production of Lord Burghersh's opera Catherine, Ann Childe (who subsequently became his wife) filling the title-role. A reviewer wrote: \\"... in the concerted pieces... his fine sonorous bass came in with a charming effect.\\" Pages 515‚Äì516 The New Monthly Magazine. 1830. Early in 1831 he sang Polyphemus in a stage representation of Handel's Acis and Galatea at the Queen's Theatre, Tottenham Street, under the management of George Macfarren. In 1832 Seguin was engaged at Drury Lane, where he appeared with Maria Malibran in Bellini's La Sonnambula, and during the two following years, and from 1835 to 1837, he sang at Covent Garden. His performance of Masetto in the revival of Mozart's Don Giovanni in February 1833 was successful, and in 1835 he was in Beethoven's Fidelio, as Rocco.Performance history in vocal score of Fidelio.

In America he founded an operatic company, The Seguin Troupe, which toured successfully in the United States and Canada, including in the summer of 1840 a season of opera at the Theatre Royal in Montreal, Canada.Music at Theatre Royal Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved 16 March 2018. A concert given by Anna Bishop at the Tripler Hall, New York in 1850 was reviewed: \\"Mr Seguin sang the two great bass songs from the Creation, in pure and classical style. He has a grand voice, a true basso profondo, rich, deep, flowing.... We have but one fault to find in him ‚Äî he lacks somewhat in fire....\\" Seguin is said to have been elected a chief by an Indian tribe, an honour he shared with Edmund Kean. He died in New York in 1852. His was described as \\"one of the finest bass voices ever heard\\" (The Athen√¶um, 1853, page 115), and he was also noted as a comic actor. ==Notes and references== Attribution * Category:1809 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Operatic basses Category:English basses Category:American basses Category:19th-century opera singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Arthur Seguin"},{"id":"56853929","text":"Tsing Yi Concern Group (; TYCG) is a pressure group formed in 1983 by a group of social workers to promote grassroots participation in local affairs in Tsing Yi.

The company was based at Church Gresley, Derbyshire. ==Activities as historian and archivist== Starting as a collector of Cornishware in 1991, his collection grew and was largely featured in Paul Atterbury's first Cornish Ware & Domestic Pottery book. First discussing Cornishware on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow (series 19, 1996‚Äì7), he went on to make another two appearances with other T G Green designs and later a half- hour programme on Channel 4, Collectors' Lot. There was an active Collectors' Club between 1996 and 2001, for which Hambling wrote and advised in 'Iain's Corner'. The club folded upon the acquisition of T G Green by neighbouring company Mason Cash. Increasingly aware of the many other unrecorded patterns dating from 1864, Hambling started to build collections of the patterns and created a virtual online museum. A second Atterbury book, concentrating on the many other domestic wares produced, followed in 2001. Hambling continued to piece together collections of designs and patterns, concentrating initially on the Art Deco sets of the 1930s, and later the Victorian sets from the company's inception, as well as sourcing a lot of the original paperwork, tools and moulds which had been gradually removed from the now-derelict factory site at Church Gresley by treasure hunters and opportunists.

He is best known for developing the arts organisation Poet in the City. In 2014 he launched a second arts organisation, the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, committed to cross-arts commissioning and to championing a new funding model for the arts. Henderson has also been involved in many other arts-related initiatives including the development of a public art consultancy, the creation of an international arts network and a campaign to create a new investment fund for the arts. ==Early life and education== Henderson was born in Somerset in 1964, was educated at Taunton School in Taunton and Millfield School in Street, Somerset, and spent a year in Ontario, Canada before doing a history degree at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge between 1983 and 1986. ==Early career== Graham Henderson‚Äôs career has spanned both the City of London and the arts. A qualified solicitor, he previously worked as a commercial litigation lawyer at one of the largest law firms based in the City of London, Clifford Chance. He took a sabbatical break from legal practice in 2000‚Äì01 to become a consultant in the specialist travel business in which he created and marketed specialist dance and music activity holidays for both Dance Holidays Ltd and WOMAD. In 2003 he produced Coach of Black Water, an exhibition of Cuban art photographs, which took place at the Menier Gallery in Southwark, the first sponsored exhibition to take place at this venue. In 2004 he launched The Company of Adventurers Ltd in an attempt to raise funding for independent arts and cultural documentary films. And in 2005 he was responsible for arranging the translation and publication of Kindred Spirits, a collected edition of poems by the Cuban poet Regino E Boti, known as \\"the poet of Guantanamo\\", which was published by Mango Publications. ==The Lorca case== Federico Garc√≠a Lorca in 1932 In 2002, Graham Henderson was the solicitor in charge of the high-profile case concerning ownership of the manuscript of the famous poetry collection Poet in New York by the Spanish poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, assassinated by Franco's militia at the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. This case resulted in a 10-day trial at the High Court in London, presided over by Judge Peter Smith. The case was a success for Henderson and his law firm, Morgan Cole, who were acting under a conditional fee agreement. Henderson was keen to celebrate the life and work of the poet and organised a special event in the Great Room at Christie‚Äôs on the eve of the auction of the manuscript. The event was attended by, amongst others, the ambassadors of all the main countries associated with the manuscript, Spain, Cuba and Mexico. In order that the event should be bipartisan in nature, he invited Poet in the City, a project founded in 1998 by City of London lawyers, to present the event on his behalf. The success of the event led Rosamund McCarthy, its founder and first chair, to invite Henderson to run Poet in the City. ==Poet in the City== 8 Royal College Street in 2007, before restoration 8 Royal College Street in 2015, after restoration Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation investment pitch document Initially Henderson continued to run Poet in the City as a project of the Poetry Society, to which it was affiliated. However, he became increasingly interested in the opportunities it presented to reach out to new audiences for poetry and to access new sources of funding to support poetry education. Establishing Poet in the City as a separate charity in 2006, he obtained substantial sponsorships for it, including sponsorships from leading brands such as Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Pfizer, Linklaters and Lloyds of London. He also achieved its selection as a National Portfolio Organisation by Arts Council England in 2010. Between 2006 and 2014, Henderson led on programming over 50 high-profile poetry events every year in London and South East England, together with a wide range of other poetry-related projects and activities, including short films, national poetry tours and public art commissions. After organising Poet in the City's successful transition to a new chief executive in April 2014, he remained as a trustee of the charity, and as its public art consultant, until April 2016. ==The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation== In 2007, Henderson became involved in the campaign to save the Regency property at 8 Royal College Street that had been occupied by the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine in 1873. Henderson persuaded the owner, Michael Corby, to leave the property as a legacy gift in his will. The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation was created to take advantage of this gift, and with the long-term goal of establishing a European-style \\"poetry house\\" at the property, providing a cultural and educational resource for the residents of the London Borough of Camden. Incubated inside of Poet in the City, the Foundation was launched as a separate organisation and as a registered charity in 2014. However, rather than just be a small house museum the Foundation decided to use the poets as an inspiration for a wider mission to champion the arts, create new sources of earned income, and provide platforms for talented up-and-coming artists across many different art forms. Becoming Chief Executive of the new Foundation in April 2014, Henderson delivered a programme of over 30 cross-arts events and original arts commissions during 2014‚Äì17 that featured opera, classical and rock music, theatre, film, sculpture and other art forms, as well as poetry and literature. Henderson has also been responsible for developing a new business model for the arts centred on the development of new sources of earned income, and for devising a new form of investment bond suitable as a means of attracting investment to arts organisation. ==Kindred Spirits ‚Äì The European Poetry House Network== Delegates attending Kindred Spirits conference in Bucharest in 2015 As part of his role in championing the idea of the \\"poetry house\\" as a new and streamlined business model for the arts, Henderson created an international collaboration, bringing together seven \\"poetry houses\\" in six different European countries. Kindred Spirits seeks to promote international cultural exchange and to develop new business and funding models for the arts, as well as being an arts network and a vehicle for celebrating a shared European culture. ==Social capital building== Henderson has long championed the arts as an important source of social capital, and as a fundamental building block of a healthy civil society. This has directly informed his work, both in promoting a new approach to public art and in seeking an innovative new funding model for arts organisations. ==Public art== Pope's Urn on Twickenham riverside As public art consultant for Poet in the City, between 2014 and 2016, Graham Henderson created important new sources of income for the arts. In 2015, working in partnership with Richmond upon Thames Council and the architectural design practice Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, he conceived, designed, built and installed Pope's Urn, a contemporary piece of public art, inspired by the poetry of Alexander Pope. Enjoying a central position on the Twickenham riverside, the sculpture was commissioned to celebrate the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was opened in a ceremony in September 2015. This work provided an important source of earned income for Poet in the City in 2015. Associated with this work, Henderson has also been involved in high-level advocacy for innovative approaches to public art, including an active role in the 2014 Farrell Review of Architecture and the Built Environment, writing the official essay in support of its findings, and continues to work with BEAM in promoting new approaches to the commissioning of public art. ==Limited profit investment fund for the arts== As an elected member of the Culture Forum in 2010, Henderson played an important part in developing innovative ideas for the funding of the arts, including an influential paper which led directly to the establishment in 2014 of an Arts Impact Fund. However, Graham Henderson parted company with the Fund over the insistence on the part of some its funders that investment in arts organisations should also achieve so-called \\"social outcomes\\". He continues to campaign for the original funds that he proposed in 2010, a limited profit fund designed to help arts organisations to make money from their existing assets and intellectual property rights. Henderson argues that investment which allows arts organisations to develop their sources of earned income will release a great deal of entrepreneurial activity in the arts, particularly amongst small-medium enterprise arts organisations, and will lead to a much more resilient funding basis for the arts sector as a whole. ==Modern Poetry in Translation== Graham Henderson has been an active board member of the journal Modern Poetry in Translation since 2008 and is now working with its editor, Clare Pollard, to deliver a programme of poetry and translation placements in Camden schools. ==Oxford Cultural Leaders programme== Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford In 2015 Henderson was selected, along with 17 other leaders from the arts, cultural and museums sectors, to be part of a new residential programme, Oxford Cultural Leaders, delivered by Oxford University Museums in partnership with the Sa√Ød Business School. The programme, held for the first time in 2015, brings together leaders to experiment and take risks, to explore new business models and ways of working and to develop innovative organisational cultures. Henderson now runs the alumni network for all those who have passed through the programme, encouraging them to continue to meet and to collaborate. ==Jan Patoƒçka== Henderson has been interested for many years in the ideas of the Czech philosopher Jan Patoƒçka (1907‚Äì1977). In particular, Patoƒçka's ideas for \\"putting soul in the city\\", and of recapturing the relationship between the arts and social capital building (and between culture and political engagement) characteristic of the ancient Athenians, have been much used by Henderson in his own championship of the arts. As of 2018 he is involved in a project, working in partnership with the Jan Patoƒçka Archive in Prague and with the phenomenologist Erin Plunkett, to publish, for the first time, an English-language edition of the philosopher‚Äôs selected works. ==Personal life== Graham Henderson lives in Twickenham, south-west London. ==See also== * Poet in the City *Pope's Urn * Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation ==References *: Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation *Kindred Spirits ‚Äì European Poetry House Network *BEAM *Oxford Cultural Leaders Alumni *The Jan Patoƒçka Archive Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:20th- century English lawyers Category:21st-century English businesspeople Category:21st-century English lawyers Category:Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:British arts administrators Category:English curators Category:English nonprofit executives Category:English solicitors Category:Founders of charities Category:People educated at Millfield Category:People educated at Taunton School Category:People from Somerset Category:Poetry houses ","title":"Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)"},{"id":"56854131","text":"Shangdu Subdistrict () is a subdistrict of Xinhua County in Hunan, China.

It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station and is located in the district of Einbeck of Salzderhelden. == History== The section from Alfeld via Kreiensen and Northeim to G√∂ttingen on the old North‚ÄìSouth railway was connected to the railway network on 31 July 1854. The station of the then independent municipality of Salzderhelden was opened only one day later, on 1 August 1854. The station building was built according to the plans of Conrad Wilhelm Hase. The line from Salzderhelden to Einbeck (now Einbeck Mitte) was opened on 10 September 1879, turning it into a junction station. All transport operations on the Salzderhelden‚ÄìEinbeck line were taken over by the Ilmebahn (Ilme Railway) from Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1954. Passenger services on the line were discontinued by 1975 and replaced by bus route 230. Salzderhelden was incorporated into the municipality of Einbeck on 1 March 1974. The station was renamed Einbeck in 1978 and the former Einbeck station was renamed Einbeck Mitte. Until 2002, the track of the Ilme Railway still existed as far as Dassel and it was then gradually dismantled back to Juliusm√ºhle. In the same year, the Einbeck-Salzderhelden ‚Äì Einbeck Mitte line was transferred from DB to Ilmebahn GmbH. The station has been called Einbeck-Salzderhelden since 1994. == Transport servicesRail services=== Salzderhelden is located on the Hanoverian Southern Railway and it has been served approximately hourly since December 2005 by a Regional-Express service, RE 2, operated by metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft and connecting with G√∂ttingen, Kreiensen and Hanover. The line to Einbeck has not been regularly used by passenger services since 1984, but it is occasionally used by special passenger trains and by freight traffic. {  !Line !Route !Interval !Operator -  align=\\"center\\" RE 2 Uelzen ‚Äì Celle ‚Äì Hannover Hbf ‚Äì Kreiensen ‚Äì Einbeck-Salzderhelden ‚Äì Northeim(Han) ‚Äì G√∂ttingen 60 Metronom -  align=\\"center\\" RB 82 Bad Harzburg ‚Äì Goslar ‚Äì Langelsheim ‚Äì Seesen ‚Äì Kreiensen ‚Äì Einbeck-Salzderhelden ‚Äì Northeim (Han) ‚Äì G√∂ttingen 120 DB Regio Nord -  align=\\"center\\"  RB  Einbeck-Salzderhelden ‚Äì Einbeck Mitte  Individual services  Ilmebahn GmbH } === Bus services=== Einbeck is now connected to Einbeck-Salzderhelden station by bus route 230, which operates on the Einbeck‚ÄìSalzderhelden‚ÄìNortheim route. All bus and rail services in the Einbeck area are managed by the Verkehrsverbund S√ºd-Niedersachsen (Southern Lower Saxony transport association, VSN). == Prospects== There are efforts to restore regular passenger services on the Einbeck-Salzderhelden ‚Äì Einbeck Mitte section of the Ilmebahn. The reactivation of this section was found to generate significant economic benefits. The operation was due to be resumed at the timetable change in December 2017, but it has been delayed until December 2018. ==ReferencesFootnotes=== Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1854 Category:Railway stations in Lower Saxony Category:Buildings and structures in Northeim (district) Category:Einbeck ","title":"Einbeck-Salzderhelden station"},{"id":"56854231","text":"Statistics of Empress's Cup in the 1981 season. ==Overview== It was contested by 8 teams, and Shimizudaihachi SC won the championship.RSSSF ==ResultsQuarterfinals=== *FC Jinnan 2-0 Nagoya LFC *FC PAF 2-1 Nishiyama High School *Takatsuki FC 3-0 Yowa Ladies *Kobe FC 0-5 Shimizudaihachi SC ===Semifinals=== *FC Jinnan 0-0 (pen 1-2) FC PAF *Takatsuki FC 0-3 Shimizudaihachi SC ===Final=== *FC PAF 0-6 Shimizudaihachi SC Shimizudaihachi SC won the championship. ==References== Category:Empress's Cup Category:1981 in Japanese women's football ","title":"1981 Empress's Cup"},{"id":"56854239","text":"Project Child or Project ‚Äú CHILD‚Äù is an initiative of Society for Promotion of School Health (SPSH), is the oldest and most comprehensive School Health Programme of Assam.

He was one of the main artists in the development of the Flemish Expressionism style. ==Biography== Jozef Cantr√© was born in Ghent in 1890, four years after his brother Jan Frans. His father was a house painter. He studied art at the Royal Academy, together with Frans Masereel; his teachers included Jean Delvin and Felix Metdepenningen. He was politically active in a socialist youth movement and later created the \\"Rode Jeugd\\" (\\"Red Youth\\"). He studied Literature at the Von Bissing University from 1916 on, together with the poet Richard Minne. Already in March 1918 he was appointed lector in drawing. His role in this university, created by the German occupier, led to his conviction in 1920, when he was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. This sentence was removed in 1929. On 27 October 1918, when it became clear that Germany would lose the war, Cantr√© fled the country. He then lived in Blaricum until 1921 and then in Oosterwijk, both in the Netherlands, where he was joined by Frits Van den Berghe and Gustave de Smet. In 1930 he returned to Belgium where he moved to Sint-Martens-Latem, which would become the center of the Flemish art during the interbellum. By 1931 he lived in the nearby Astene, where Hubert Malfait became his neighbour. Afterwards he moved to Ghent. Between 1941 and 1946 he was a teacher at the La Cambre Art Institute. He was married to Martha Vandaele; they had one son, Walter Cantr√©. ==Art== His early art is influenced by Georges Minne and Constantin Meunier. Later influences include fauvism, cubism and German Expressionism, before he became one of the founders of the so-called Flemish expressionism. He was one of the main avant-garde illustrators in Belgium between World War I and World War II as a member of De Vijf (\\"The Five\\") together with his brother Jan Frans Cantr√©, Joris Minne, Frans Masereel and Henri Van Straeten. Most of his graphic work consisted of engravings and woodcuts, as stand-alone works, ex-libris, or book illustrations. As a sculptor, he worked in wood, clay and bronze. Together with Frits Van den Berghe and Gustave de Smet he is also considered one of the pioneers of the Flemish Expressionism, and together with Oscar Jespers the main sculptor in the movement. ==Bibliography== Excerpt from the Flemish magazine \\"Regenboog\\".

Gilpin began his career in 1883 when he was appointed a public school teacher, serving in various country schools. As a teacher he married Mary Ann Southam at Tilba Tilba on 21 October 1884 and they had five sons and two daughters. Later becoming a Sydney produce merchant and accountant, Gilpin settled with his family in the inner Sydney suburb of Camperdown. ==Political career== Gilpin first took elected office as an Auditor for the Council of the small Municipality of Camperdown in February 1904, but, as secretary of Camperdown Ratepayers Association, soon stood for election as an Alderman for Belmore Ward, to which he was elected in February 1906. Gilpin however joined the council during a period of severe crisis; the council had been running insolvent for the last few years and the Town Hall where council met was fully mortgaged. In the years before his election, Camperdown aldermen had been seeking to amalgamate with one or several of their neighbouring councils, with little success. Gilpin was elected mayor after the February 1908 municipal elections, and tasked himself with concluding the negotiations for Camperdown amalgamating with the City of Sydney. Gilpin presided over the final meeting of Camperdown council held on 7 December 1908, with Gilpin noting that \\"I am very pleased to say that the result of the negotiations, in the form of the present Bill, was unanimously agreed to by this council, and has met with the approval of all the ratepayers of Camperdown. The primary object for which we were elected was the extinction of Camperdown as a municipality, and in a few days this will be an accomplished fact.\\" The council officially ceased to exist and was absorbed into the City of Sydney when the Sydney Corporation (Amendment) Act 1908 was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, with the council area becoming the Camperdown Ward returning two aldermen. In January 1909, Gilpin was elected alongside his fellow former Camperdown alderman and mayor, Charles Mallett, to the Camperdown Ward of the City of Sydney. Gilpin became one of the council's representatives on the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in March 1922. Joining the Civic Reform Association when it was created, Gilpin became honorary secretary and was elected Lord Mayor of Sydney for 1923 and 1924. Gilpin lost his bid for re-election to his Camperdown Ward seat on the council in the 1924 municipal elections and forfeited his seat on the Water Board as a result. However, when the Water Board was reconstituted in March 1925 shortly after as an elected, rather than appointed body, Gilpin, who now lived in Burwood, stood for election and was successful for the Fifth Constituency (Annandale, Ashfield, Burwood, Concord, Enfield, Glebe, Homebush, Leichhardt, Lidcombe, and Strathfield). After gaining re-election for a further four-year term in 1927, Gilpin was defeated in his 1931 bid for re-election by the Mayor of Leichhardt, Andrew Noble Campbell. ==Later life and legacy== Gilpin's wife, Mary Ann, died at their residence, \\"Kayla\\", on Parkes Street, Wentworth Falls on 5 November 1938. Gilpin died on 21 May 1952, aged 89 and was buried at Wentworth Falls Church of England Cemetery. Gilpin Street in Camperdown is named after him. ==References== Category:Australian accountants Category:Australian schoolteachers Category:New South Wales local government politicians Category:Civic Reform Association politicians Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney Category:Mayors of places in New South Wales Category:1863 births Category:1952 deaths ","title":"David Gilpin"},{"id":"56854303","text":"e-engineering is a concept that results from the concatenation of two previous ideas: distance learning and remote laboratories. Distance learning education has been around since the XIX century when the development of the mail services in England enabled the delivering of correspondence courses by mail. In the second half of the XX century, audio and television players where the first technological means used to deliver new, more engaging distance learning courses. And despite keeping the same way to communicate with students, the now more fast and reliable postal services, the materials were then much more diversified, ranging from carefully constructed texts and audio and video records to conventional broadcast radio and television, in this case, open to all, students and non-students. These were complemented by live individual or group sessions over the phone, between instructor and students, or among students, enabling real interactive teamwork.Gericota M. et al. \\"Combining E-Technologies & E-Pedagogies to Create Online Undergraduate Courses in Engineering ‚Äì an Example of a Successful Experience\\". Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies, Barcelona, July 2016, pp 4209-4218. However, the breakthrough that represents a true turning point in distance learning was the introduction of the concept of e-learning during the 90s, boosted by the two most significant advances in the telecommunications area ‚Äì the Internet network and the invention of the World Wide Web. With the Internet a fast, reliable and interactive channel of communication between instructor and students or among students was now available, enabling a degree of interaction never achieved before in distance learning and comparable to face-to-face classes. On the other hand, the World Wide Web with its hypertext links enabled the construction of much more diversified and engaging materials, supported by audio, image, and video, readily available and highly interactive. This revolution was accompanied by the massification of personal computers, which made them accessible and affordable. In a decade, from 1990 to 2000, these very expensive machines, complicated to operate and whose access was almost restricted to scientist and engineers and to technical university students, became an indispensable household equipment. In spite of all these advances, the undergraduate courses on offer were nevertheless restricted. Engineering courses which require the access to specific chemistry, physics, mechanics, electrical machines, electronics or optics laboratories and real-time interaction with equipment and instrumentation, were not available at distance. This reality is changing due to the creation of remotely accessible laboratories that enable students to perform hands-on lab work remotely, with a level of interactivity and realism never achieved before. A lot of work is being done in the past decade in the area of remote laboratories. In the specialized literature, it is possible to find many examples of different labs for different areas of physics and electrical engineering,Farah, S., A. Benachenhou, G. Neveux and D.

The integration of these remote laboratories as part of fully online undergraduate programs in engineering areas enabled the creation of e-engineering courses. These are e-learning courses in engineering areas where students perform their hands-on laboratory work remotely interacting in real-time with equipment and instrumentation available online 24/7. The first example of one such course is the L3-EOLES (Electronics and Optics e-Learning for Embedded Systems) course, an entirely online English-taught 3rd year bachelor's degree in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems.Gericota M. et al. \\"EOLES course - The first accredited online degree course in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems\\".

Designed as a specialization year, this course is oriented towards a currently expanding field in the electrical and computer engineering area, the field of electronics and optics for embedded systems. This area of knowledge requires students to be able to perform experimental work to acquire the expected technical experimental skills. The execution of laboratory assignments over the Internet required the development of remotely accessible experimental laboratories enabling students to interact in real-time with real experimental setups.

Joff√© co-wrote the script with Michael Ashton on the basis of the play The Archbishop and the Antichrist by Michael Ashton, which tells a story involving Archbishop Desmond Tutu's search for answers during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and his meetings with the fictional character Piet Blomfeld. ==Plot== After the end of apartheid, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is running the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and visits Cape Town's Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison to meet with Piet Blomfeld, an ex-security police officer and Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging member, to assess his candidacy for amnesty. Blomfeld is a potential witness to murders committed during the time of Apartheid, particularly the murder of the teenage daughter of Mrs. Morobe, who begs the Archbishop to find answers about her missing daughter. Blomfeld initially shows no regret and no willingness to speak, instead using his time during the meetings to berate the Archbishop with insults. However, when the Archbishop shows him a photograph of a young black girl in his file and tells him that he is in two prisons, (the other being the prison within himself) he begins to reconsider. Francois Schmidt, one of Blomfeld's fellow officers and a participant in the murders, initially tries to pay off a black gang to assassinate Blomfeld, but Blomfeld (having been affected by the Archbishop's words) spares the life of the prisoner sent to kill him and manages to earn the respect of the gang to the point where they tell Schmidt to fight his own battles. He also forms somewhat of a bond with the prisoner, Benjamin. As this is going on, Howard Varney (one of the members of the Commission) speaks with Mrs. Van der Berghe, who had known Blomfeld when he was a child. He learns that Piet Blomfeld had been friends with a young black girl (the girl in the photograph); his father Rian did not approve and murdered the girl and her entire family before beating Piet so badly he broke his arm. Afterwards the Blomfelds moved to Zimbabwe; while Piet was at boarding school the rest of his family was killed (presumably as retaliation for Rian's crimes.) Blomfeld ultimately decides to confess, and calls the archbishop. Schmidt arranges for the prison to be locked down and then attacks Blomfeld accompanied by riot troopers; Blomfeld is ultimately beaten to death by the troopers. However, he has sent an audio recording, confessing to the murder of Mrs. Morobe's daughter and her boyfriend, which is played to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (he also leaves Benjamin what little money is in his bank account). Mrs. Morobe confronts Hansi Coetzee, one of the participants in her daughter's murder and ultimately forgives him. Afterwards the Archbishop is met by Linda Coetzee, who thanks him for his work and admits that she hadn't wanted to face what her husband had done. The movie ends with the Archbishop and his wife visiting the beach he had gone to as a child, now successfully integrated. ==Cast== * Forest Whitaker as Archbishop Desmond Tutu * Eric Bana as Piet Blomfeld * Jeff Gum as Francois Schmidt * Morn√© Visser as Hansi Coetzee * Thandi Makhubele as Mrs. Morobe * Terry Norton as Lavinia * Osbert Solomons as Mogomat * Rob Gough as Howard Varney * Debbie Sherman as Linda Coetzee * Warrick Grier as Kruger * Nandiphile Mbeshu as Benjamin * David Butler as Governor * Dominika Jablonska as Forensic Clerk * Shane John Kruger as DTF Officer * Michael MacKenzie as Young Warder * Vuyolwethu Adams as Idukew * Joe Nabe as Judge Draad * Alexander Wallace as Young Piet Blomfeld * Robert Hobbs as Burly ==Production== On 2 November 2015, it was announced that Forest Whitaker and Vince Vaughn would star as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the fictional character Piet Blomfield, respectively, in the film adaptation of Michael Ashton's play The Archbishop and the Antichrist, to be directed by Roland Joff√©. Joff√© also co-wrote the script with Ashton, which would be produced by Craig Baumgarten. On 27 October 2016, Eric Bana joined the film to play the brutal murderer Blomfeld, replacing Vaughn. The film was retitled The Forgiven and would be produced by Joff√© with Baumgarten through Link Entertainment and Zaheer Goodman-Bhyat through Light and Dark Films. ==Release== The film premiered at the London Film Festival on 13 October 2017. It was also shown as the closing film at the Pan African Film Festival on 19 February 2018 and was shown at the Belgrade Film Festival on 28 February 2018 before being released in the United States on 9 March 2018. ==ReceptionBox office=== The Forgiven grossed $39,177 in territories outside North America, sales of its DVD/Blu-ray releases have cashed $54,156. ===Critical response=== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 22 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the 'sluggishly paced film's disparate parts never come together as a compelling whole.' Glenn Kenny of The New York Times wrote that the film by Roland Joff√©, who is 'not known for a light touch', 'is heavy-handed from its early texts explaining apartheid through its end credits' but praised the performances of Forest Whitaker and Eric Bana. ==ReferencesCategory:2017 films Category:British films Category:English- language films Category:Films set in South Africa Category:Films shot in South Africa Category:Apartheid films Category:British drama films Category:2017 drama films Category:Films directed by Roland Joff√© Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about racism Category:Films about criminals Category:Films about murderers Category:Films set in 1996 Category:Desmond Tutu Category:Truth and reconciliation commissions (South Africa) ","title":"The Forgiven (2017 film)"},{"id":"56854359","text":"Pipkin (also known as Malpais Crater) is a volcano in California, with activity during the Quaternary.

Describing her beliefs as center-right, she is a critic of third- wave feminism, activists she views as social justice warriors, and activist movements like Black Lives Matter. White supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign but has since expressed reservations about him and his policies. ==Early life== White has described feeling gender dysphoria from a young age. At the age of 18, she was a victim of date rape by a man, which she later related in a video collaboration with Shane Dawson. White's father died the following year. When she was 20 years old, she came out as transgender to her family and friends and began feminizing hormone therapy in 2015. White attended California State University, Chico, where she studied computer science. While attending college, she appeared on a friend's live stream, and commenters encouraged her to start a YouTube channel of her own. ==YouTube career== After she was dissatisfied with studying computer science at college, White began posting anti-feminist political videos on the platform in December 2015. She continued making videos about her views on social issues like gender politics. A doxxing fight broke out between White's supporters and supporters of Black Lives Matter when she criticized the social movement. She told Penthouse that she had to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation. White has uploaded her political debates with other YouTubers, commentators and comedians. She has also appeared on political talk show The Rubin Report several times, discussing issues including the North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires individuals to only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. She has also appeared on Shane and Friends, a video podcast hosted by Shane Dawson. In February 2017, White was banned from social networking platform Facebook for 30 days, drawing complaints from her supporters. Her account was reinstated shortly afterwards, and Facebook said the ban was an error. That same year, White started uploading videos about her personal life, including about her transitioning plastic surgeries. On November 11, 2017, White and her boyfriend filmed a video in which they wore hats bearing the Trump slogan \\"Make America Great Again\\" and attended an anti- Trump protest on Hollywood Boulevard. In the video, she claims to have been assaulted twice, and had a drink thrown in her face. Police say that White and her boyfriend began the altercation when they crossed a divider between pro- and anti-Trump protesters. White has said that she would not wear a red hat in an American liberal area again because of the confrontation. == Personal life == White lives in Los Angeles. She describes her political beliefs as center- right and is non-religious, stating that religion has had little significance in her life. White supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election but has stated she remains critical of some of his policies and actions in office. In June 2018, White announced her engagement to fellow YouTuber Joey Sarson. ==References* * Category:1993 births Category:American critics of Islam Category:American media personalities Category:American political commentators Category:American social commentators Category:American YouTubers Category:California State University, Chico alumni Category:Commentary YouTubers Category:Criticism of political correctness Category:Female critics of feminism Category:Female YouTubers Category:Fullscreen (company) channels Category:LGBT conservatism in the United States Category:LGBT YouTubers Category:Living people Category:Men's rights activists Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States Category:People from Chico, California Category:Transgender and transsexual media personalities Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:YouTube channels launched in 2015 Category:YouTubers who make LGBT- related content Category:YouTube vloggers Category:People from Tehama County, California Category:21st-century American women ","title":"Blaire White"},{"id":"56854460","text":"The Hands All Over Tour was the fifth concert tour by the American pop rock band Maroon 5, in support of their third studio album Hands All Over (2010).

It is adapted from the stage musical of the same name, which was first produced on the stage at the Saville Theatre, London, on 23 April 1958. In the film, Cliff Richard and the Shadows made their second screen appearance in a film released during 1959, the first being the much darker Serious Charge. The later film was made at Shepperton Studios, near London, with certain scenes shot on location in London's Soho district. ==Plot== Laurence Harvey plays sleazy hustler Johnny Jackson, who is always on the lookout for fresh talent to exploit, while managing his hectic life with his stripper girlfriend, Maisie King. Maisie is looking to find a better life in singing. Jackson discovers a teenage singer named Bert Rudge, played by Cliff Richard, in an espresso coffee shop and sets about sending him along the rocky road to fame. He changes his name to Bongo Herbert and soon gets him a record deal and a relationship with an ageing American singing sensation Dixie (Yolande Donlan). Johnny gets a meeting with Mr Mayer of Garrick Records on Tin Pan Alley and gets Maisie to phone him there pretending to be HMV records, this prompts Mr Mayer into giving Bongo a contract. However, Bongo soon realises that his 50/50 contract, which he naively agreed with Johnny, is not as great as he thought it was, and breaks from Johnny's contract with help from international star Dixie Collins (because Bongo is still legally a minor). ==Production== Director Val Guest engaged Kenneth MacMillan to choreograph the strip-club dancers who appear in the film. Struggling at Shepperton Studios to get them to dance and sing to playback at the same time, MacMillan complained, \\"It's the simplest routine. They may have looks, legs and tits, but they have no co-ordination.\\" At first, Laurence Harvey was undecided on the kind of accent he would give his character, so Guest told him he was 'part Soho, part Jewish, and part middle-class' and that it might be an idea to model him on the writer Wolf Mankowitz. Harvey arranged a couple of lunches with the unsuspecting Mankowitz to study the writer at close hand, so the character Johnny Jackson in the film sounds something like the writer of the film.Val Guest, So You Want to Be in Pictures, p. 135 Harvey's character sports a melange of accents including his own South African. Wolf Mankowitz appears in the film's opening credit sequence, wearing a sandwich-board bearing his writer credit. Laurence Harvey appeared in the film version ==Cast== * Laurence Harvey as Johnny Jackson * Sylvia Syms as Maisie King * Yolande Donlan as Dixie Collins * Cliff Richard as Bert Rudge/Bongo Herbert * Meier Tzelniker as Mayer * Ambrosine Phillpotts as Lady Rosemary * Eric Pohlmann as Leon (as Eric Pohlman) * Gilbert Harding as Himself * Hermione Baddeley as Penelope * Reginald Beckwith as Reverend Tobias Craven ==Soundtrack album== The music for the 1959 film was produced by Norrie Paramor. With the exception of one song, it was entirely different from the music that was used in the 1958 musical. The music and the plot were rewritten to downplay the satire and showcase Richard and his band. In the best ironic traditions of Tin Pan Alley, a satire became a tribute. Only The Shrine on the Second Floor ‚Äî a song that was intended to drive a sharpened stake into the heart of all sentimental ballads about mother ‚Äì made it into the movie, but Richard sang it straight. {  !

One of the findings of the Institute of Islamic Studies she heads (as of 2007) is that no Islamic country today grants Christians real religious freedom. Rather, they would be socially discriminated against and harassed in numerous states. Those who convert from Islam to Christianity are sometimes even threatened with death (see Apostasy in Islam). Europe is also facing new challenges in the age of globalisation and migration.

Park Ji-sung Road is a six-lane road that runs from the front of Bethlehem Church in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province to Yeongtong-dong Road in Yeongtong-dong, Suwon. The road is named after Park Ji- sung, and it was created after the 2002 World Cup match against Portugal when he scored the decisive goal for Park's advance to the round of 16 and was promised by Gyeonggi Province Governor Sohn Hak-kyu, who visited Park's house in Suwon. It was opened in 2005, attended by Park. In 2009 the road was renamed Dongtanjiseong-ro, with the name of Dongtan New Town added to the name of the road. On the 86 meter-long soundproof walls that are installed in front of the Jamsa Insector Research Center in the middle of the road, 10 large photos of Park's World Cup matches and goals are displayed. Park Ji-sung Forest, a 297.5 m2 forest, was also created near the National Seed Management Center next to the road. == Park ji-sung Football Center == Ji-sung Football center Park ji-sung Football center is located right next to Park Ji-sung Road.

The Park Ji-sung Soccer Center (Ji-Sung Football Center, JSFC) is a football center that enables Korean soccer player Park Ji-sung to foster growth and development of youth soccer training facilities in the Republic of Korea, and to utilize his training facilities for training in various sports. The construction began on October 6, 2009 with a groundbreaking ceremony for the seed management office site of the Korea Agricultural Technology Institute in Gyeonggi Province, 10,5658 square meters 2, and held a completion ceremony on July 24, 2010. == Maintenance issue == Ten years after the opening of Park Ji-Sung Road, the road became neglected due to the lack of management and indifference of the local governments. In 2009, a section of road (3.4„éû) in Hwaseong City was included in a reorganisation and the name of the road was changed to Dongtanjiseong-ro, and the management responsibility for the road between different local governments became unclear. As a result, maintenance work was not done on time, and the management of roads and facilities is left in a state of disarray.

The track was constructed by the Southern Greyhound and Sports Company Limited, in part of the 27 acres known as Lower Park, which was owned by the Cork Agricultural Buildings Co Ltd. Lower Park was used by the County Cork Agricultural Society and ran from the present-day Centre Park Road to Blackrock. The Society became the Munster Agricultural Society and buildings were constructed in c.1895. == Opening == In early 1928 the new stadium took shape, the construction was simple because there was already much in place such as the jumping enclosure where spectators viewed the show jumping from previous shows. There was excellent accommodation for 20,000 people, car parking was for 1,000 cars and the kennels were listed as exhibition kennels allowing the public to view them. There was a tram service to Ballintemple and there were three price bands for the three areas of the grandstand, the special enclosure and the popular enclosure. Mr T C Morris, secretary of Irish Coursing Club (ICC) and Mr Hoare from the Greyhound Racing Control Board visited the facilities and gave the green light by issuing a licence under ICC rules. The racing started on Wednesday 27 June 1928 and events were held over 525 and 550 yards. ==Closure== The choice of venue had been constantly criticised by the press due to the fact that it was too far east and outside of the city, which ultimately led to closure on 20 September 1935 because a new venue was being constructed. The new venue was called the Cork Greyhound Stadium and was on Western Road which allowed the Cork public easier access. ==References== Category:1928 establishments in Ireland Category:Defunct greyhound racing venues in Ireland Category:Sport in County Cork Category:Sports venues in County Cork ","title":"The Show Grounds Greyhound Track"},{"id":"56854880","text":"The 2009 NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament was a single- elimination tournament to determine the men's collegiate basketball national champion of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III.

Powerful swimmers, including salmon and sea trout, find it easy to pass through many structures. However, it is widely accepted that some structures make fish migration more difficult upstream. River Welland Elver Pass at Duddington == Construction == The UK Environment Agency has guidelines for the design of eel and elver passes for employment in weirs, tidal flaps & gates and sluice structures. A variety of materials for example HDPE and stainless steel are used to construct brush and bristle surfaces, pipes, ducts, mouse holes, cat flaps and pet door types of eel and elver passes. Eel and elver passes are distinctive from fish ladders which in turn are distinct from eel ladders. The eel ladder is constructed by introducing steps or uprights. Each step or upright of the eel ladder interrupts the flow of water at each point in the ladder. In contrast, eel and elver passes are distinct by either employing a tube which bypasses the main flow or current and/or employing a bristle surface that presents a greater length of continuous disruption to the flow of water.The Eel by Frederich W. Tesch, Ray J. White 3rd edition, Wiley-Blackwell Elver pass during manufacture exposing bristles == Migration and measurement == Eel and elver passes have a dual purpose. By separating the eel traffic in the flow of water more accurate measurement of eel and elver migration is made possible. The results also prove the benefits. Wisbech Standard 12 July 2014 report large numbers of eels return to the Fens also being able to migrate into the Middle Level along a bristle and duct type eel and elver pass. ==Regulations== The Eels (England and Wales) Regulations 2009 implement Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 of the Council of the European Union, establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel. Some requirements of the regulations are, where appropriate, to: * Notify the Environment Agency of the construction, alteration or maintenance of any structure likely to affect the passage of eels. * Construct and operate an eel pass to allow the free passage of eels * Use eel screens to exclude eels from water abstraction and discharge points * Use of a by-wash to return excluded eels to the waters they came from. ==See also== *Eel ladder *Fish ladder == References == Category:Eels Category:Dams Category:Fish migrations ","title":"Elver pass"},{"id":"56854998","text":"Corderman is a surname.

It was built near the villages of Cark and Flookburgh on the Cartmel Peninsula which today forms part of Cumbria. ==HistoryConstruction=== RAF Cark was constructed on a site which had been considered for a possible airship factory in 1916. Preparation work had been undertaken however the project was cancelled the following year.http://www.forgottenairfields.com/united- kingdom/england/cumbria/cark-s1347.html ===Operational life=== Opening in 1941, the station was designed primarily to operate as a fighter station under the control of RAF Fighter Command in order to afford protection to the industrialised areas of northwest England. The airfield featured a dispersal site on the east side which consisted of six pens each able to accommodate two aircraft. On the northwest side of the airfield a Bellman Hangar was built on the technical site and in time this was supplemented by the addition of fourteen blister type hangars. Once the threat of invasion had receded, the airfield was used by RAF Flying Training Command as a Staff Pilot Training Unit and for Anti Aircraft gunnery training with aircraft such as Hawker Hurricanes, Miles Martinets and latterly Supermarine Spitfires. Initially parented by RAF Millom, RAF Cark became a self reliant station during 1942. The Staff Pilot Training Unit left in November 1942, but returned the following March. In 1944 gliders of the requisitioned Lakes Gliding Club were moved from RAF Walney and formed No. 188 Gliding School, Air Training Corps. During its operational life RAF Cark played host to detachments from several squadrons on anti aircraft co-operational duties. Miles M.25 Martinet TT MkI in flight ==Units== During the course of the operation of the station, the following units were at sometime based at RAF Cark: 03/41 to 11/42, Staff Pilot Training Unit RAF. 01/42 to 10/42, No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF ('R'.Flt). 01/42 to 11/42, No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF ('F'.Flt). 03/42 to 03/43, No. 6 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF 11/42 to 12/43, No. 1614 (Anti-Aircraft Co-operation) Flight RAF. 11/42 to --/--, No. 289 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Hawker Hurricanes. 03/43 to 12/45, Staff Pilot Training Unit. 03/43 to 11/44, No. 650 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Miles Martinets. 04/44 to 05/44, No. 290 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Supermarine Spitfires 11/44 to --/--, 650 Sqn (detachment) with Hawker Hurricanes. 10/45 to 12/45, Pilot-Navigation Instructors Course RAF \\\\--/44 to 05/47, No. 188 Gliding School, Air Training Corps. ==Closure== Following the cessation of hostilities in 1945 operations at RAF Cark were run down with the Station being placed on care and maintenance. The last residents to leave were No. 188 Gliding School who transferred to RAF Walney in May 1947 following which the Station closed. ==Subsequent use== RAF Cark was sold off by the Air Ministry and was subsequently used as a venue for gliding.

Her aunt, Miss Germaine Bailac of the Paris Opera, was in her day a celebrated singer in Paris: she had begun at the Opera in 1907 in the role of Delilah, and was later a much sought-after Carmen. Jourfier approached music by entering the conservatory of her hometown in the viola class. It was at the age of 19, when she was working as an accompanist in the singing class, that she made a name for herself and joined the same singing class at the Toulouse Conservatory. She obtained her first prizes unanimously from the jury in June 1943, already being noticed by the directors of the lyrical theatres present, including that of the Capitol, who offered to hire her in his troupe. She nevertheless insisted on obtaining her prizes in Paris, and entered the Conservatoire de la Ville de Paris a few months later in March 1945, in the class of Paul Guillamat, the father of singer Ginette Guillamat.Ginette Guillamat on data.bnf.fr She won her first prizes, again unanimously, in June 1945, just six months after she had entered the singing class at the Conservatoire de Paris. She sang the same aria as during the entrance contest, the \\"Scene of Madness\\" of Lucia di Lammermoor, with variations of Lily Pons. It is on the occasion of the contest for the students of this singing class that the composer and conductor Reynaldo Hahn noticed this 21-year-old girl, and hired her to begin on the prestigious stage of the Palais Garnier the following August during the revival of Mozart's The Magic Flute, in which she had Mado Robin, Paul Cabanel and Henri M√©dus as partners. Thus Jourfier made her debut at the Paris Opera on 10 August 1945 in the role of Pamina, aged 21. She remains to this day the youngest singer of the Paris opera. Also in 1945, Jourfier made her debut at the Salle Favart in the role of Sophie in Werther. Subsequently, she sang Leila of Les P√™cheurs de perles, Philine of Mignon, Violetta of La Traviata, Micaela of Carmen, Suzanne of The Marriage of Figaro, La Guimard of Gabriel Piern√©'s FragonardFragonard on data.bnf.fr (with Fan√©ly Revoil and Jacques Jansen), Mimi of La Boh√®me, Messager's Monsieur Beaucaire which she sang with Jacques Jansen, Rosina of The Barber of Seville... She was chosen to play this Rosina on screen when it was decided to produce a film production of Rossini's opera in 1948 under the musical direction of conductor Andr√© Cluytens. Jourfier responded there to Raymond Amade, Roger Bourdin and Roger Bussonnet. At the palais Garnier, besides Pamina, she was Gounod's Juliette (1947), and it was to her that Maurice Lehmann entrusted the task of resurrecting \\"Amour\\" of Rameau's Les Indes galantes in the 1952 revival with G√©ori Bou√©, Denise Duval, Janine Micheau and Jacqueline Brumaire. She also played in Massenet's Manon, which was the role in which she left a great memory. The young woman announced that she was leaving the Paris Opera in 1953. Maurice Lehmann continued to consider her a full member of his troupe. But nothing did: Lucienne Jourfier continued to perform live, less and less often, and gave up her career definitively in 1956, at the age of 32. Being bound by an exclusive contract with the Paris Opera, Jourfier could only exceptionally participate in recording sessions. She nevertheless leaves a handful of discs, among which are the main arias of Massenet's Manon. For the same reasons, her career in the provinces and abroad was rather limited, the artists under contract with the Opera at the time having the possibility to perform on other stages only during their holidays (i.e. in July in early August). Jourfier was nevertheless able to meet audiences in North Africa and Geneva; but it was in Monte-Carlo that she represented the Paris Opera and the French singing school, particularly during the 1952 season. Raoul Gunsbourg, then director of the Monte-Carlo Opera asked her to come and sing in 'his' \\"house of the Bohemians\\", a performance which moved both the public, and the princely family, and her partner, the great tenor Giacomo Lauri-Volpi. There are a very large number of radio recordings of this singer in the Institut national de l'audiovisuel archives. Lucienne Jourfier died in Paris at age 92. == References  External links == * * Lucienne Jourfier, Carmen air de micaela, concert given on 23 May 1948 on YouTube Category:French operatic sopranos Category:1923 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Toulouse Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni ","title":"Lucienne Jourfier"},{"id":"56855331","text":"Microphysogobio brevirostris is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to Taiwan. ==References== Category:Microphysogobio Category:Fish described in 1868 ","title":"Microphysogobio brevirostris"},{"id":"56855350","text":"Free Sicilians (; ; SL) is a Sicilian nationalist and pro-independence political party in Sicily, Italy.

She began working for the National Health Service (NHS) on the day it was established, 5 July 1948, and subsequently played a key role in establishing the NHS Retirement Fellowship. ==Early life and education== Ethel Armstrong was born in Durham in 1930. She attended school until the age of 17, then her headmaster recommended that she get a job rather than continue in the sixth form. She was unable to attend university as there were no grants for women to study dentistry or medicine. ==Career== On leaving school, Armstrong worked at a large mental health hospital in Newcastle as a \\"cadet\\" where she experienced several different departments. Once she was 18 she was able to join the school of radio diagnosis, on the same day as the birth of the NHS: 5 July 1948. She primarily worked in radiography and radiotherapy from this point forward. Armstrong worked with John Charnley during his early work on hip operations, before he received his knighthood. Armstrong worked as a tutor and advisor to the Liverpool Breast Screening Service until 1989, when she retired. At the time that she worked for the service, it was an experimental unit and only adopted across the NHS in the 1980s. During the course of her work, Armstrong earned a master's degree in clinical practice (oncology). ==Voluntary work== After retirement, Armstrong returned to Durham and continued her work for the NHS by volunteering for the Durham branch of the NHS Retirement Fellowship. She served as chairman from 1994 to the present. From 2005, she became part of the National Council, and was elected vice chairman in 2009, then chairman in 2011 and president in 2013. Having been involved with the service for so long, Armstrong was invited to become the Retirement Fellowship's first Life Patron in 2015. She is also an active member of the Cavell Nurses' Trust. Because of her long career and continued charity work, Armstrong made a guest appearance alongside Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, at the Health and Care Innovation Expo 2017. In March 2018, Armstrong received an MBE for her seven decades of service to the NHS. On receiving the award, Armstrong stated: > The NHS is part of who I am, and I have been proud and lucky enough to have > been there at the start of this wonderful institution. It's a particular > honour to receive this in the year that the NHS turns 70 and I see this as a > nod to all the special people I've had the privilege of working for over the > decades. However, she noted that when the NHS turns 70 it would also be her 70th anniversary, and perhaps time to retire fully. ==Personal life== Ethel Armstrong was married to husband Harry until his death in 1998. He worked for Hawker Siddeley as a director, which required regular moves around the United Kingdom and led Ethel to work for many different NHS trusts. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:Radiographers Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Durham, England Category:Living people Category:English nurses ","title":"Ethel Armstrong"},{"id":"56855380","text":"Gino Mulder (born 9 October 1987) is an Aruban international footballer who plays for Dutch club HBS Craeyenhout, as a midfielder. ==Career== He has played club football for Haaglandia, Katwijk, De Jodan Boys, Quick Den Haag and HBS Craeyenhout.

Stark (born November 21, 1951) is an American author and educator, specializing in the areas of cultural commentary and U.S. law. He has worked as the cultural commentator for CNN, National Public Radio (NPR), and Voice of America, and written regularly for publications such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and The Atlantic. He has also contributed to The World, a radio program co-produced by the BBC World Service and WGBH. Stark is the author of four books, including Glued to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We Are Today (1997), Writing to Win: The Legal Writer (1999), and Meet the Beatles: A Cultural History of the Band That Shook Youth, Gender, and the World (2005). ==Early life and career== Stark grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended Sidwell Friends School. His father, William, was a psychiatrist, and his mother, Vivianne, was a professor of English at Montgomery College. He graduated from Harvard College and Yale Law School. By 1979, he was employed as a law clerk to Judge Elbert P. Tuttle of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Atlanta. In 1976, he served as an \\"issues director\\" on Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and came to appreciate the political significance of the rise in contemporary Southern culture. According to Ralph Whitehead, a professor of journalism at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, this experience encouraged Stark to develop \\"the American-studies view of politics: that what happens in politics is often an expression of deeper cultural and psychological forces that are at work in the country.\\" In addition to writing for The Boston Phoenix, Stark contributed as an op-ed columnist to The Boston Globe and wrote a column on international sport for the Montreal Gazette. On his website, Stark's former role as an NPR broadcaster is described as his attempt to \\"interpret American culture to the rest of the world\\". Stark's first book, Glued to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We Are Today, was published in 1997. In 1999, Doubleday published Stark's book Writing to Win: The Legal Writer, in which he espoused an approach in legal correspondence and in the courtroom of brevity and simplicity. Among the endorsements for the book, Laurence Tribe described it as an \\"invaluable\\" work that would benefit students and most practicing lawyers alike. Stark's book Meet the Beatles: A Cultural History of the Band That Shook Youth, Gender, and the World was published in 2005 by HarperCollins. Three years before its publication, he moved to Chester, near Liverpool, in the north of England, to carry out research into the Beatles phenomenon. Kirkus Reviews said that Meet the Beatles offered little insight on the band that had not been unearthed by previous studies into their international impact. By contrast, James Rosen of The Washington Post appreciated the author's focus on how the Beatles' feminine qualities were a key factor in the group's appeal, and said the book was a \\"thoughtful, provocative and ultimately valuable contribution to the literature of the Beatles\\". Don Aucoin wrote in The Boston Globe that in analysing the band's impact, \\"[Stark] captures also the sheer waves of joy the Beatles sent through the world, how they transformed youth culture, legitimized rock 'n' roll as an art form, and hastened the globalization of business and communications.\\" Publishers Weekly said: \\"A thorough biography of the band ... Stark is sharp and insightful.\\" Stark has lectured in law at Harvard Law School. He has also published fiction, poetry in the chapbook format, and exhibited as an artist. He currently lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works as a consultant to the legal and other professions, teaching courses on speaking and writing. He married Sarah Wald, also a lawyer and academic, in October 1979, and the couple have two sons. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American cultural critics Category:1951 births Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Sidwell Friends School alumni ","title":"Steven D.

Set in England in 1939 after the beginning of World War Two, the drama presents the Hobbs family reunion in the family's ancestral home, Burley Hall. The play features many of the themes or motifs that run through Barnes's work, including betrayal, familial relations, regression and transgression. The dialogue is highly stylized and poetic. The play premiered in 1961 in Stockholm in a Swedish translation by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary- General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Despite the fact that Barnes continued to write until her death in 1983, it was the last of her major works to be published. Although it was not as successful as Nightwood, Barnes considered it her most important work.Giroux ==Synopsis== The play tells the story of the reunion of Augusta Hobbs, her brother, Jonathan Burley, and her four estranged adult children: Dudley, Elisha, Miranda and Jeremy. The play begins with the arrival at Burley Hall of Miranda, a 'tall woman in her late fifties', and a coachman, Jack Blow, that she has met in Dover during her journey to England from France. She reveals that, along with her sibling, uncle and mother, she has been summoned by her youngest brother Jeremy to the family's ancestral home. However, Jeremy is nowhere to be found upon their arrival. The building has not been occupied for some time and is in a state of dilapidation thanks to German bombing campaigns; the house's former contents are sprawled all over the set. Miranda is shortly joined by her uncle, Jonathan Burley, as well as her two brothers, Dudley, a manufacturer of watches and Elisha, a publicist, and later by her mother, Augusta. As they wait for Jeremy, they discuss family history and air old grievances, many of them about the family's deceased patriarch, Titus Hobbs. Dudley and Elisha exhibit a strong dislike for Miranda and their mother, playing a number of increasingly cruel and violent tricks upon them. Miranda starts to suspect that the invitation might have been a trap set by Dudley and Elisha to lure them to the home and murder them. Augusta, however, remains oblivious to her sons' behavior. Miranda and Augusta argue, with Miranda suggesting that just as Augusta was blind to the sexual and physical abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, she is also blind to the murderous intent that her sons present towards her. The final act begins with all the characters asleep on stage. Jeremy has still not arrived. Augusta, unable to sleep, begins to playact as if she was a young woman once again and that the traumatic events she has lived through have not happened. Miranda silently watches with horror and empathy. She tries to warn Augusta again of the violent dangers posed by Dudley and Elisha. However, Augusta, believing Miranda to be betraying her own family, smashes her skull with a curfew bell and kills her. Jack then reveals that he is, in fact, Jeremy and that he invited them to the house with the intent that the family would implode as they have. When he is asked why he did it by his uncle, he responds that 'This is the hour of the uncreate;  The season of the sorrowless lamenting'. The play ends with Jonathan Burley watching his nephew, Jeremy, silently and 'with what appears to be indifference' leave the stage. ==Publication History== Barnes started writing the play in the early 1950s, and unlike her other major works, many of the early manuscript drafts still exist. They can be consulted in her archives at The University of Maryland. In 1954, once Barnes had completed writing the play, she sent it to T.S. Eliot at Faber & Faber, who previously published Nightwood and with whom she had developed a strong friendship. Eliot was initially uncertain of the play's merits, indeed in a letter responding to it he explained that he had struggled to fully comprehend it. Nonetheless, he enlisted the poet and critic Edwin Muir to read the manuscript, who claimed the play \\"a work of genius and utterly absurd.\\"Quoted in Herring, 272 Muir did, however, suggest some editorial changes, especially to the first act, and Barnes produced a new draft of the play. In November 1956, with Muir and Eliot's recommendation, Faber & Faber agreed to publish the play, and Eliot agreed to write the preface for it as he had done for Nightwood. However, the draft preface he sent to Barnes ahead of the publication described the play as quixotic and Barnes as a writer with too much genius and not enough talent. Barnes was hurt, and Eliot withdrew the preface, but their friendship had been soured.Herring 272-5 The editing process was extensive and intensive, with Eliot's working closely with Barnes on numerous drafts. Robert Giroux, her American publisher, recalled being sent 1,500 manuscript sheets from Faber & Faber when they published the play in the U.S.Giroux ==Performances== In 1956, Edwin Muir organised for the New York Poets Theatre to give a reading performance of an early draft of the play at Harvard Yard. Muir, Eliot and Barnes were present as well as a number of other literary figures, including Robert Lowell. In his biography of Barnes, Phillip Herring suggests that the performance was so bad that \\"Eliot's head sank into his hand; Muir became rigid [and] Barnes was furious\\".Herring 274 The play received its first public performance in 1962 in Stockholm. It was translated into Swedish by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, the latter of whom Barnes became close friends. The play was directed by Gierow. The Swedish performance remains the only major production of The Antiphon, and indeed, perhaps the only public performance of the play. Barnes's correspondence in her archive at the University of Maryland reveals that she often was contacted with requests to stage the play, but she invariably turned them down. ==Critical Reception== In The New York Times Book Review, Dudley Fitts described the Antiphon as \\"dramatic poetry of a curious and high order' and highlighted that the pleasure of the play was to be found in 'the pleasure of language. Not spoken language; Miss Barnes has no ear for the stage, but the intricate, rich, almost viciously brilliant discourse, modeled more or less on the murkier post-Elizabethans.\\" In the Times Literary Supplement, the anonymous reviewer suggested that \\"[t]here will always be one or two eccentrics who think 'The Antiphon' gives its author first place among women who have written verse in the English language.\\"Quoted in Giroux In recent years, the play has been re-examined by literary critics. Daniela Casselli has argued that the play is an important work of modernist drama and 'stages the moment when drama collapses'.Casselli, 235 ==NotesReferences== * * Giroux, Robert. \\"The Most Famous Unknown in the World - Remembering Djuna Barne s\\".

Their use is most prevalent in chemical and biological research relating to pharmaceuticals and food science, where alcohols are frequently used as cosolvents in water (often less than 5% by volumeShi, John. Functional Food Ingredients and Nutraceuticals: Processing Technologies, 1st ed. CRC Press: Boca Raton, 2007.) to dissolve hydrophobic molecules during extraction, screening, and formulation. Cosolvents find applications also in environmental chemistry and are known as effective countermeasures against pollutant non- aqueous phase liquids,Ward, C.H., Oubre, C.L., Lowe, D.F. Surfactants and Cosolvents for NAPL Remediation A Technology Practices Manual, 1st ed. CRC Press: Boca Raton, 1999. as well as in the production of functional energy materials and synthesis of biodiesel.Littell, M.J. Effect of a co-solvent feedstock on the synthesis of biodiesel via heterogeneous catalysis. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Tennessee. 2015. The topic of cosolvency has attracted attention from many theorists and practicing researchers who seek to predict the solubility of compounds using cosolvent systems, and it is the subject of considerable research in scientific literature. Studies exist to propose and review methods of modeling cosolvency using calculation, to describe empirical correlations of cosolvents and observed solvation phenomena, and to report the utility of cosolvent systems in various fields. == In Pharmaceuticals == Long- standing challenges in pharmaceutical chemistry include overcoming the inherent hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of certain molecules for treatment and finding effective synthesis procedures for complex molecules. Cosolvents are able to aid researchers in both the trials of formulation and synthesis. === Formulation === In pharmaceutical chemistry, numerous methods exist to help solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs for use in treatment. These methods include cosolvency, hydrotropism, complexation, ionization, and using surface active agents. The most pervasive is the application of non-toxic cosolvents with water to produce formulations that can dissolve hydrophobic molecules while maintaining cohesion with biological systems. Common cosolvents for this purpose are ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerine, glycofural, and polyethylene glycols. The effect of cosolvency on drug solubilization can be great, as evidenced by a 2009 study in which researchers from Panjab University showed the solubility of various anti-diabetic drugs increase by more than 500 times by use of a cosolvent.Seedher, N., Kanojia, M. Co-solvent solubilization of some poorly-soluble antidiabetic drugs. Pharm. Dev. Technol. 2009, 14(2), 185-192. DOI: 10.1080/10837450802498894. === Synthesis === Cosolvents prove useful in synthetic applications as well as in formulation. Cosolvent systems are commonly specific to the synthetic target being studied, so reviewed here are the generalized findings of several publications that exemplify important points on the subject: In a 2017 project, researchers at Cornell University studied the effect of cosolvency in oxazolidinone enolizations mediated by lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS). This reaction pathway was exemplified by the group in the synthesis of filibuvir, a drug used for the treatment of hepatitis C that is produced on plant-scale by Pfizer. The researchers focus primarily on polymer formation in systems of tetrahydrofuran with hydrocarbon cosolvents, and find that the rate is strongly sensitive to the cosolvent utilized. Among other results, the study concludes that cosolvent choice is of acute importance in the pharmaceutical industry where percent yield, trace impurities, and processing techniques are chemically, financially, and toxicologically relevant. However, the researchers take care to mention that the mechanisms that bring about these empirical differences in cosolvent systems are not yet well-understood. A 2016 paper from researchers at Hokkaido University describes a cosolvent-promoted mechanism for benzylating hydroxyl groups in the synthesis of sucrose derivatives.Wang, L., Hashidoko, Y., Hashimoto, M. Cosolvent-promoted o-benzylation with silver(I) oxide: synthesis of 1‚Äô-benzylated sucrose derivatives, mechanistic studies, and scope investigation. J. Org. Chem. 2016, 81(11), 4464-4474. DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.6b00144. The group reports a method by which the benzylation reaction, empirically low yielding and with significant formation of byproducts due to the generally low reactivity of the target 1‚Äô-hydroxyl group in sucrose, was carried out to up to 95% yields with excellent selectivity for the synthetic molecule. They accomplished this yield by utilizing a cosolvent system of hexanes and methylene chloride, and extrapolated the method to include a number of benzyl halide substrates, as well as alcohols, glucose, and ribose derivatives. This study is one of many where reaction yields in organic synthesis can be optimized by application of polar/non-polar cosolvent systems. Cosolvents also play a role in the biochemical subdiscipline: a 2012 study from researchers at the South China University of Technology reports how cosolvent parameters can be optimized to obtain higher yields in enzyme- catalyzed reactions.Yang, R.L., Li, N., Zong, M.H. Using ionic liquid cosolvents to improve enzymatic synthesis of arylalkyl √ü-D-glucopyranosides. J. Mol. Cat. B. 2012, 74, 24-28. DOI: 10.1016/j.molcatb.2011.08.009. Specifically, the group looked at the prune seed meal-catalyzed synthesis of bioactive anti-depressant salidroside, and found that using ethylene glycol diacetate in conjunction with an ionic liquid cosolvent afforded up to a 50% increase in product yield. The use of ionic liquids as cosolvents in this study and many similar demonstrates the variability of this methodology, where cosolvent systems can extend beyond standard conventions of polar and non- polar solvents to affect change on a mechanistic level. == In Environmental Chemistry == Cosolvents have long been reported to be effective tools in environmental chemistry, both as powerful means of pollution remediation and as important additives in syntheses of green technologies, such as solar cells, biofuels, and sorbents. In some cases, the utilization of cosolvents also allows for satisfaction of a broad goal in the field of green chemistry: reduction in unsustainable solvent use by enhancing substrate solubility or providing greener alternatives. === Remediation === 400x400pxIn the context of aqueous pollutant remediation, cosolvents can be used in a variety of functions, including to enhance the performance of surfactants, to increase solubility of a non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL), and to physically mobilize NAPLs by decreasing interfacial tension between aqueous and organic phases.Kueper, B., Wyatt, K., Pitts, M., Sale, T., Simpkin, T. Technology Practices Manual for Surfactants and Cosolvents, 2nd ed. CH2M HILL: Houston, 1997. Due to toxicological concerns, the main agents used for remediation are aqueous solutions of 1-5% alcohols by volume, which can be flushed through a polluted site and later extracted from the bulk water. This ‚Äúcosolvent flooding‚Äù (called alcohol flooding when using >5% by volume) is often combined with salinity modification, in situ chemical oxidation, and temperature alteration to provide the most effective methods of removing NAPLs from a water source. In situ flushing is a process by which soil is decontaminated in a similar manner as aqueous environments.CLU-IN. In situ flushing. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017.276x276px Complications that arise from using alcohol cosolvents in aqueous remediation include the formation of macroemulsions, desorption of organic contaminants from aquifer solids, and introduction of toxicity, flammability, and explosivity at higher concentrations. === Green Technologies === The versatile and variable nature of cosolvents has allowed them to be used in many applications regarding green technology. One such application is in the processing of polymer solar cells, where cosolvents have been recognized as being important additives to reduce phase separation of main solvent into droplets, which disrupts continuity in the sample and leads to less favorable morphologies. In most cases, a cosolvent is used in 1-10% by volume and acts by encouraging polymer aggregation in either the casting or solution evaporation stages. While the use of cosolvents in this context is nearly ubiquitous in organic solar cell research, there remains a lack of understanding on the dynamical processes by which cosolvency achieves this effect. Cosolvents also play an important role in the production of biofuels from assorted biomass. For example, in efforts to convert used sunflower oil into biodiesel via transesterifcation, the utilization of a cosolvent in methanol was found responsible for improving product conversion from 78% to near completion in a short time frame. In another example, a tetrahydrofuran-water mixture was found to be incredibly effective in extracting lignin from biomass to yield fermentable sugars, despite that both THF and water are poor solvents for this purpose. By simplifying the synthesis and processing procedures for these and other developing green technologies, cosolvents are reducing waste from lost yields, poor solubility of substrates, and excess processing. As time moves forward, even better systems are being developed, and directed research into greener cosolvents is being explored. == Approximating Cosolvent Effects == A variety of models exist to describe and predict the effects of cosolvents. Relying heavily on the application of mathematical models and chemical theory, these models range from simple to relatively complex. The first model and also the simplest is still in use today: the model of Yalkowsky. Yalkowsky‚Äôs model utilizes the algebraic mixing rule or log-linear model: logXm = ∆í1logX1 \\\\+ ∆í2logX2 Where Xm is the mole fraction solubility of the solute, X1 and X2 denote the mole fraction solubility in neat cosolvent and water. While this model is only correlative in nature, further analysis allows for the creation of a predictive element. Simplifying the above equation to: logXm = logX2 \\\\+ œÉ ‚Ä¢ ∆í1 Where œÉ is the solubilization power of the cosolvent and theoretically is equal to log(X1/X2). One can incorporate the work of Valvani et al., which shows: œÉ = M ‚Ä¢ logKow \\\\+ N Where M and N are cosolvent constants that are not dependent on the nature of the solute, and have been tabulated for many commonly-used cosolvents. These transformations effectively turn the Yalkowsky log-linear model into a predictive model, where a researcher can predict with fair accuracy the cosolvent concentration for solubilization of a compound using only aqueous solubility data. For a more in-depth discussion of cosolvent modeling systems, the reader is directed to reviews by Jouyban (2008), Smith and Mazo (2008), and for biochemical context, Canchi and Garcia (2013). A simpler view at choosing cosolvents involves looking at measureable properties of varying cosolvent systems and making a determination from empirical evidence. Researchers from the University of Arizona and the University of Wisconsin-Madison review a selection of parameters in an Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry paper,Li, A., Andren, A.W., Yalkowsky, S.H. Choosing a cosolvent: solubilization of naphthalene and cosolvent property. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1996, 15, 2233-2239. among them the partition coefficient, surface tension, dielectric constant, interfacial tension, and others. Using naphthalene as a representative case of solubilizing hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), the authors report that a majority of the most commonly-used parameters fall short of accurately describing solubility, including dielectric constant, partition coefficient, and surface tension. Instead, they find that Hildebrand‚Äôs solubility parameter, Et(30), and interfacial tension correlate more favorably with empirical trends. The practicing chemist should take these results into account when developing a cosolvent system for a given target. == References == Category:Solvents ","title":"Cosolvent"},{"id":"56856358","text":"Okoli≈°te is a village in the municipality of Svrljig, Serbia.

It premiered in Japan on October 5, 2019. ==Plot== Rikka Isuragi is a young girl living at her family home at the edge of Brad City. She is the descendant of ninjas and is expected to follow in the steps of her grandfather, Hyoei Isurugi, and become the next family head. However she wants to be like her father, Allen Isurugi, a renowned robot scientist. One day, Rikka returns home from school for her birthday to find it being attacked by a hit squad led by her father's former colleague, Lauren, intent on obtaining his research, including three AI robotic animal drones: Kasumi the eagle, Oboro the dog and Madara the flying squirrel. Hyoei tries to fight back, only to be restrained and mortally wounded by Lauren's daughter, an esper who is under his control through an electronic collar. Allen is shot and dies, but the drones take Rikka to safety, where she vows to avenge her family. Six months later, Rikka is now going under the alias \\"Lily\\" and is living in a small apartment with her roommate, Melissa. She works as a detective-in-training for Harold Berkeley and uses the animal drones to find information about her family's murderers which are linked to the Gradsheim company. Lily observes one of their facilities, but is caught by security. She is fortunately helped out by a girl named Mia, who vouches for her, and the two become fast friends. That night, Lily infiltrates the facility to retrieve her father's research. However, she is caught by Lauren and the esper, who's revealed to be Mia. Upon discovering Lily's identity, Lauren orders Mia to kill her, but she resists his control and goes berserk; destroying the facility and allowing Lily to flee with her. The animal drones prevent Lily from killing Mia, and she takes Mia to her apartment where Melissa helps her recuperate. Lauren sends a military drone created using Allen's AI research to kill Lily, but together Lily and Mia lure the drone to Lily's home, where they disable it using the house's ninja traps. Lauren then attacks them and destroys the house using esper powers gained from his research on Mia. Mia fights him but is defeated, while Lily finds a recording of her father and grandfather, wishing her a happy birthday and giving her a present: a \\"Black Fox\\" ninja suit with cybernetic enhancements. Once again embracing her true identity as \\"Rikka,\\" she dons the suit and defeats Lauren. However, he then puts the electronic control collar on Mia and transfers his powers to her, killing himself in the process, causing her to attack Rikka. In the end, with the help of the animal drones, Rikka manages to destroy the collar and free Mia. Later, the president of Gradsheim, Brad Ingram, holds a press conference where he denies any involvement in the incident with the military drone, but Rikka recognizes him as the mastermind behind the attack on her family. Rikka, now going by the codename \\"Black Fox\\", with the aid of Mia, Melissa, and the animal drones, plans to go after Brad next. ==Characters== ; : :The main protagonist, a ninja and detective in training.

Lindahl is credited as one of the inventors of the first women's general exercise bra, known as the jocksbra, along with theater costume designer Polly Smith, and Smith's assistant, Hinda Schreiber. Lindahl has been acknowledged for her many contributions to the Epilepsy Foundation, including teaching others about the cause, and raising money and awareness. She was born in Montclair, NJ in 1948, and grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. She attended the University of Vermont to complete her undergraduate and received her bachelor's degree in education in 1977. Previously she graduated from Vernon Court Jr. College in Newport, R.I. and the Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School in Montclair NJ. Later in life Lindahl finished her master's degree in culture and spirituality from Holy Names University in California in 2007. She currently resides in South Carolina. == Jockbra == Lindahl was in the middle of graduate school, which she put on hold, when she came up with the idea for the jockbra. Lindahl's sister Victoria Woodrow called her up one day to complain about her painful experiences having to just wear a normal bra while working out. During the course of Lindahl and theater costume designer Polly Smith's exploration for a better alternative, Lindahl's husband suggested that what they needed was a jockstrap for women's breasts. In the costume shop of Royall Tyler Theatre at the University of Vermont, Lindahl and Smith actually sewed two jockstraps together and nicknamed it a \\"jockbra\\". Smith's assistant, Hinda Schreiber, also helped with creating the bra. It was later renamed a \\"jogbra\\". One of their original Jogbras is bronzed and on display near the costume shop of the theatre. Two others are housed by the Smithsonian and another by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. For years Lindahl held the role of president, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for selling the invention. Then in 1990 Playtex purchased the invention. After Playtex's purchasing of the company, Lindahl still served as Co-President of the Jogbra. == Epilepsy == Lisa Lindahl suffers from epilepsy herself, and has made it one of her main goals to educate others on the topic. Lindahl took upon the role of Senior Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Epilepsy Foundation for several years. While holding this position Lindahl created The Women and Epilepsy Health Initiative, which has given opportunities for researchers to study the gender differences in epilepsy. For all her work to help the cause, the Epilepsy Foundation gave Lindahl a National Personal Achievement Award. Lindahl was also awarded a Congressional Commendation for her work on epilepsy by Vermont Senator, Jeffords in 1999. == Bellisse Compressure Comfort Bra == In later years, Lindahl joined with Dr. Lesli Bell to create a form of her previous bra invention that would serve as a compression bra to help breast cancer patients overcome the pain and discomfort associated with procedures. With Lindahl's prior knowledge of designing and entrepreneurship, in 2001 the two ladies invented the Compression Comfort Bra. Along with the creation of the Compression Comfort Bra, Lindahl also worked to educate people about truncal lymphedema, which many women with breast cancer suffer from, and Dr. Bell has continued teaching the public about this issue, and is now a world renowned public speaker on the topic. == Other contributions == Lindahl has also put her education and practice to good use by teaching a Women's Small Business Program at Trinity College in Burlington, Vermont. She also co-authored the book used in her course, Minding Your Business. Lindahl also taught business at Champlain College and Trinity College. She later served as a Trustee of the Vermont Land Trust, which is an organization devoted to conserving Vermont's landscape. Lindahl as well participated in a support and backing network for entrepreneurs. She was nominated for the Boss of the Year Award, and Entrepreneur of the Year award, by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers‚Äô Association, and by Inc. Magazine. Lindahl was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2020 alongside co-inventors Hinda Miller and Polly Smith. == Present day == Lisa Lindahl's most recent publication is Unleash The Girls, The Untold Story of the Invention of the Sports Bra and How It Changed the World and Me, a business memoir about women in business dealing with success, power issues and personal growth. Her previous book, titled Beauty as Action, the Way of True Beauty and How its Practice can Change our World. is a self-help book for individuals who want to contribute to changing the current societal paradigm.

The match was a culmination of the 2018 Indian Super Cup, a knockout football tournament in India run by the All India Football Federation. This was the first edition of the Super Cup, the successor to the Federation Cup. Bengaluru won the tournament after defeating East Bengal 4‚Äì1. A brace from captain Sunil Chhetri and goals each from Rahul Bheke and Miku were enough for Bengaluru to get past East Bengal who scored once through Ansumana Kromah. Both teams qualified for the tournament after finishing within the top six in both their respective leagues, the I-League and Indian Super League. Prior to this match, both East Bengal and Bengaluru only played each other in league matches when Bengaluru was part of the I-League. The final was televised on Star Sports and online on Hotstar. The match took place at the Kalinga Stadium which had hosted every match of the tournament up till this match. ==Road to the final== The Super Cup is a new annual Indian knock-out football competition that is open to all ten teams in the I-League and Indian Super League and is run by the All India Football Federation. The tournament is a replacement for the Federation Cup, the previous domestic competition for Indian football. The top six teams in both leagues during their 2017‚Äì18 seasons automatically qualified for the competition. The bottom four from each league had to go through a qualification stage. East Bengal finished in fourth in the I-League and thus qualified directly for the Super Cup. Bengaluru meanwhile finished in first during the Indian Super League but ended as runners-up after losing in the final. ===East Bengal=== Prior to the 2018 Indian Super Cup, East Bengal had reached the final of the Federation Cup, India's previous top domestic cup competition, 16 times and won the tournament eight times. Most recently, East Bengal won the competition in 2012. They began their Super Cup campaign on 5 April 2018 against Indian Super League side Mumbai City. Mumbai City took an early lead in the 22nd minute through Achille Eman√° before Katsumi Yusa scored an equalizer for East Bengal four minutes later. East Bengal then took the lead in the 73rd minute through Mahmoud Amnah and went on to win the match 2‚Äì1. In the quarter-final, the club took on fellow I-League side Aizawl. The match was a highly contested and was only won six minutes into second half stoppage time from a Laldanmawia Ralte penalty. East Bengal won 1‚Äì0. In the semi-finals, East Bengal again took on an Indian Super League when they faced off against Goa. Goa entered the match heavily depleted after losing three players through suspension in their last match while also not having some players due to injury. With that the case, East Bengal managed to secure a 1‚Äì0 victory and confirm their place in the Super Cup Final with Dudu Omagbemi scoring in the 78th minute. ===Bengaluru=== Bengaluru had competed in the Federation Cup only four times as the club was only founded in 2013. In those four appearances, the club managed to win the competition twice, in 2014‚Äì15 and the last edition of the tournament in 2016‚Äì17. Bengaluru began their Super Cup campaign on 1 April 2018 against the Gokulam Kerala. Henry Kisekka began the scoring in the match for Gokulam Kerala in the 33rd minute. Bengaluru soon found an equalizer through Miku before Udanta Singh found the winner for the club two minutes into stoppage time. The club then went to take on NEROCA in the quarter-finals on 13 April. Bengaluru captain Sunil Chhetri scored a hattrick as he helped his side secure a 3‚Äì1 victory over their I-League opponents. In the semi-finals, Bengaluru took on Mohun Bagan, the club they defeated in the Federation Cup final in 2017. During the match, Bengaluru found themselves down at halftime after Aser Pierrick Dipanda scored in the 42nd minute. However, second half saw Bengaluru respond with four goals, three from Miku and one from Chhetri, as they took a 4‚Äì1 lead. Dipanda then scored a second for Mohun Bagan in stoppage time but it was too late as Bengaluru won and clinched their spot in the final with a 4‚Äì2 victory. ==Pre-matchVenue=== alt=Aerial view of a stadium. On 7 March 2018, it was announced by the All India Football Federation that the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, Odisha would host the entire Super Cup. The venue had not previously hosted any edition of the Federation Cup. In addition, none of the 20 teams that participated in the Super Cup were based in Bhubaneswar or the entire state of Odisha. However, Jamshedpur, one of the Indian Super League clubs did play one match at the stadium towards the end of the 2017‚Äì18 ISL season. Originally, the entire tournament was set to take place in Kochi, Kerala. On 4 March 2018, a couple weeks before the Super Cup qualifiers, Jamshedpur head coach Steve Coppell had told the media that all he knew about the tournament was that it would take place in Kochi. However, when AIFF officials inspected the Kalinga Stadium during the Jamshedpur match in February, they were impressed with the facilities around the stadium. ===Analysis=== Coming into this match, both sides looked at it as a chance to win some silverware after they both lucked out in their respective league campaigns. Since Bengaluru had finished as runners-up during the Indian Super League, they were considered favorites. Albert Roca, the Bengaluru head coach, stressed before the match that their hunger and confidence would help them in this match: \\"The Super Cup final is another chance and we will be going into the game with the right amount of confidence. We've been consistent and have had a fantastic season so far. It would be nice to have a trophy for our efforts.\\" According to Goal.com, the club were expected to enter the match using a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation, with key players Sunil Chhetri and Miku leading the attack. Left back Nishu Kumar would be suspended for this match after gaining a red card in the previous match while defenders Rahul Bheke and Juanan were doubts to play. Khalid Jamil, the East Bengal head coach, said that his team must remain positive before the match and apprehensive of Bengaluru. \\"It is the last match of the season. Bengaluru FC is a great team, no doubt. We cannot afford to make mistakes,\\" he said. East Bengal centerback, Eduardo Ferreira, meanwhile made some comments to the media as he was part of the Mohun Bagan side which took on Bengaluru in the final of the Federation Cup in 2017: \\"I know they have good players and a good coach. One of the best teams in the country. But we have to keep focus and play well. Last year's Fed Cup final is past. I am thinking about tomorrow's game. I want to give my best tomorrow.\\" According to Goal.com, East Bengal were expected to enter the match using a 4‚Äì1‚Äì4‚Äì1 formation. Midfielder Mohammed Rafique would be unavailable due to injury and striker Dudu Omagbemi was a doubt. ==MatchSummary=== Prior to the match, it was announced that both Juanan and Rahul Bheke had passed fitness tests and were starting for Bengaluru. For East Bengal, Dudu Omagbemi wasn't fit enough for the starting eleven but was on the bench. Within the first minute of the match, Bengaluru had earned a corner kick before East Bengal were able to get their first attack at Bengaluru. East Bengal's Ansumana Kromah was able to draw a foul outside the box and Bengaluru's Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and John Johnson were both given yellow cards. Kromah would eventually find the opening goal of the match in the 27th minute. Sandhu made a mistake on a corner as Kromah scored off a bicycle kick. The lead would only last for 12 minutes though as Bengaluru soon equalized through Rahul Bheke's header off a V√≠ctor P√©rez cross. Finally, before halftime, East Bengal's Samad Ali Mallick was sent off after attempting to punch Subhasish Bose, reducing the club to 10 men. During the second half, East Bengal began putting the pressure on Bengaluru and scored a goal. Unfortunately, the goal scored by Kromah was judged to be offside after the Liberian striker attempted to put in a rebound after Sandhu saved a shot from Cavin Lobo. A few minutes later, Sandhu comes up big for Bengaluru after saving a free kick shot from Mahmoud Amnah. Later, in the 69th minute, a foul in East Bengal's box resulted in the referee awarding Bengaluru a penalty which was scored by Sunil Chhetri. Two minutes later, Bengaluru extended their lead when Miku scored his 20th goal in all competitions for the season. Finally, in the first minute of stoppage time, Chhetri wrapped the game up for Bengaluru by heading home the club's fourth goal and sealing a 4‚Äì1 victory. ===Details=== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK  1  Ubaid CK - DF  4  Lalramchullova - DF  14  Eduardo Ferreira - DF  16  Gurwinder Singh - DF  25  Samad Ali Mallick  - MF  5  Khalid Aucho - MF  6  Mahmoud Amnah - MF  7  Cavin Lobo   - MF  10  Katsumi Yusa - MF  17  Laldanmawia Ralte   - FW  40  Ansumana Kromah   - colspan=3Substitutes: - DF  3  Arnab Mondal - MF  11  Gabriel Fernandes - GK  12  Luis Barreto - FW  22  Jobby Justin   - MF  29  Deepak Kumar   - MF  30  Brandon Vanlalremdika - FW  44  Dudu Omagbemi   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Khalid Jamil } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK  1  Gurpreet Singh Sandhu - DF  2  Rahul Bheke - DF  5  Juanan - DF  6  John Johnson - DF  15  Subhasish Bose - MF  16  Erik Paartalu   - MF  8  Lenny Rodrigues - MF  21  Udanta Singh   - MF  44  V√≠ctor P√©rez - FW  11  Sunil Chhetri - FW  7  Miku - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK  28  Lalthuammawia Ralte - DF  10  Harmanjot Khabra - DF  4  Zohmingliana Ralte - MF  19  Toni Dovale   - MF  17  Boithang Haokip   - FW  25  Daniel Lalhlimpuia - FW  18  Thongkhosiem Haokip - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Albert Roca } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Hero of the Match: Sunil Chhetri (Bengaluru) Assistant referees: Antony Abraham Sumanta Dutta Fourth official: Santosh Kumar style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. } ==Post-match== During the post-match press conference, Bengaluru head coach Albert Roca praised his team and said that they were the most consistent side during the entire season. Roca also expressed his happiness in winning the tournament for the fans while praising how his team reacted to being a goal down, \\"I am very happy for the supporters. This is the success we were looking forward to. Today we showed that my team has been the most consistent team this season.\\" The club would soon resume their season five days later when they took on New Radiant of the Maldives in the AFC Cup. Khalid Jamil after the match meanwhile praised his side, \\"Talking about this game, everybody worked very hard. I give all the credit to boys. They started well. The score wasn‚Äôt in our favour. No complaint from my side.\\" Jamil was also very critical of the refereeing performance during the match, especially during Samad Ali Mallick's red card and Ansumana Kromah's disallowed goal. \\"Kromah‚Äôs goal, I don‚Äôt think it was offside. The result could have been different if Kromah's goal was not disallowed. Samad Ali‚Äôs red card was harsh, it could have been a yellow card. But I was far away and I couldn‚Äôt see properly.\\" Six days later, on 26 April, it was announced by East Bengal that Jamil had been sacked by the club. ==References * Super Cup website.

These engagements were a part of the Black Sea campaigns between Axis and Soviet naval forces. ==Background== As during the first 1941 campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea. A number of neutral Turkish vessels were also attacked near the Bosporus area, resulting in the Struma disaster. Once again, Axis defenses primarily consisted of Romanian-laid fields of mines: 5000 mines were laid (both anti-submarine and floating), the Soviet Navy possessed 34 submarines including 14 of new construction but only 20 were operational ready.John F. O'Connell, Submarine Operational Effectiveness in the 20th Century: Part Two (1939‚Äì1945), 2011, p. 200 German U-boats began operating in the Black Sea during late 1942, without scoring any hits while the Romanian submarine Delfinul departed for her final patrols. ==Sevastopol operations== A separate action was accomplished (alongside other Soviet Navy units) to supply and later evacuate troops from the Siege of Sevastopol. While carrying away men from the besieged city, Soviet submarine ShCh-214 was torpedoed and sunk in surface action by Italian MAS boats on 19 June. A second loss occurred on 26 June when Soviet submarine \\"S-32\\" was sunk, most likely by German bombers (while Italian midget-submarines CB-3 and CB-4 also take credit of this victory but their attacks did not matched with S-32's last mission). With the Axis finally victorious in Sevastopol, the Soviet Navy scuttled submarines \\"D-6\\" and \\"A-1\\" to avoid their capture. ==Engagements== * On 1 January, the Soviet submarine ShCh-214 shelled and sunk the Turkish sailing vessel \\"Koraltepe \\" (209GRT) off Cape Igneada. * On 23 February, the Soviet submarine ShCh-213 shelled and sunk the Turkish sailing vessel \\"Kankaya\\" (464 GRT) off the Bosporus. * On 24 February, the Soviet submarine ShCh-213 torpedoed and sunk the Panama-flagged Bulgarian merchant \\"Struma\\" carrying Jewish refugees onboard. * After 12 March, the Soviet submarine \\"ShCh-210\\" was lost, most likely on Romanian mines from field \\"S-15\\". * On 18 May, the Soviet submarine \\"ShCh-205\\" shelled and sunk the Turkish merchant Duatepe (128 GRT) south-east of Burgas. * On 23 May, the Soviet submarine \\"ShCh-205\\" torpedoed and sunk the Turkish merchant Safak (682 GRT) off the southern Bulgarian coast. * On 29 May, the Soviet submarine \\"A-3\\" torpedoed and sunk Romanian merchant \\"Sulina\\" (3495 GRT) off Odessa. * On the same day, the Soviet submarine ShCh-214 rammed and sunk the Turkish sailing vessel \\"Hudavendigar\\" (90 GRT) off Cape Igneada. * On 31 May, the Soviet submarine ShCh-214 shelled and sunk the Turkish sailing vessel \\"Mahbubdihan\\" (85 GRT) off Cape Igneada. * On 2 June, the Soviet submarine ShCh-214 rammed and sunk the turkish sailing vessel \\"Kaynarea\\" off the Bulgarian coast. * On 11 June, the Soviet submarine \\"A-5\\" torpedoed and damaged the Romanian merchant \\"Ardeal\\" (5695 GRT) off Odessa, the ship having to be beached to prevent sinking.

Printed music in the Musicalis Library in the Capitolary Archive ==History== The first testimonies were related to the sacred performances of the Passion of Christ which were located in the Loggia del Giuramento, and were a central moment in the life of the citizens because the entire population was involved in the spectacular staging.Cesare Orselli, Toscana: una scena incantata. Guida ai luoghi dell'opera, Firenze, Giunti, 2007-2008. Beginning in the 1500s, the Chappell of the Cathedral became the main musical organization, next to the single parishes and churches of the Dominican order and of San Filippo, the latter attended by nobility. Starting in the 1600s, the Rospigliosi family was central to the music scene in PistoiaGiulio Rospigliosi becomes Pope Clement IX in 1667, and was one of the greatest authors of sacred lyric works or operas of the Roman Baroque., together with Melani and Pasquini. With their donations they succeeded in ensuring that the Chappell always continued to excel. In this period, the dynasties of composers Gherardeschi and Brunetti, who dominated the music in Pistoia even in the 1700s, were affirmed. The entire activity of the Chappell and the works of its masters, made up of compositions from scratch such as the performance and collection of the works of other composers, has been merged, and is today available for consult, in the preserved documents of the Biliotheca Musicalis of the Archive of the Chapter and at the Forteguerriana Library (Biblioteca Forteguerriana), while the materials produced by the single parishes are today found in the State Archive (Archivio di Stato), in the Leoniana Library at the Vescovile Seminary, the Old Library of Canonici (today at the Archive of the Chapter), and at the Dominican Library. Music and square notation in the State Archive in Pistoia Beginning in the 1600s, the large nobile families also began to patron the production of lyric opera, especially in the academic scene (The Accademia dei Risvegliati constructed its theater in 1677). Melani made their descendants acquire musical skills: Jacopo, Alessandro and Atto became esteemed composers and musicians in Italy and in France. However, the Rospigliosi family is still the family that left the greatest trace and documentation of operatic activities in Pistoia in the 1600s and on: the Rospigliosi Collection (today divided between the Archive of the Chapter and the Forteguerriana Library) attests to the great musical vitality of the citizens with a collection of music of the most influential composers in the world, performed in Pistoia until the end of the 1800s, which was the century in which the Rospigliosi salon, where many celebrities gathered, was one of the major cultural centers at the local level..Teresa Dolfi, Luciano Vannucci (ed.), Catalogo del Fondo Musicale Rospigliosi, Lucca, LIM, 2011. Parallel to the secular production, we cannot forget the production of sacred music (as is attested by the Music Collection of the Seminary, the Collection of the Parish of the Madonna dell'Umilt√† (Mary of Umility), and the musical documents of the Fabroniana Library, rich in theoretical and historical texts that were especially pertinent to the 1700s). A composer of the 1800s, Teodulo Mabellini, for example, wrote both lyric operas and sacred music, and some of his compositions are today preserved as autographs in the Forteguerriana Library and in the Archive of the Chapter (see the Sources of Mabellini). In the 1800s, the Borgognoni Philharmonic and the School of Music and Dance were founded (later named Mabellini). The Philharmonic conducted an intense production of music and diffusion of sophisticated music, thanks to the many band arrangements, today preserved in their archive. The School is still functioning today. Beginning in the 1900s, the Philharmonic also accompanied the caff√© concerto (the music produced for this performances are now at the Globo Cinema) and are still active today (the archive of the director Giuseppe Da Prato have documented the production of the band since 1973). In the 1900s, the musical possessions of Pistoia were enriched by the donations of many private citizens, who entrusted their books regarding music to the Forteguerriana Library (Chiappelli Collectioni, Martini Collection, Bellini Collection), to the Leoniana Library at the Seminary (Mazzei Collection and the Collection of Aldo Pacini, a collector, who possessed some autographs and antique printed editions). An exceptional testimony of music of the 1900s is at the Mabellini School of Music and Dance: the autographed arrangements by Carlo Savina for two concerts in Pistoia of the music of Nino Rota performed with the Orchestra of Rome of RAI in 1981. ==List of music collections== *Archive of the Chapter, address: vicolo Sozomeno 3Sito Ufficiale dell'Archivio Capitolare., preserves: **Musical documents of the Old Canonical Library: possesses the oldest testimonies of sacred music in Pistoia; **Bibliotheca Musicalis: preserves the greatest number of operas produced and collected by the Chappell of the Cathedral; **A branch of the Rospigliosi Collection referred to most for sacred music of the 1700-1800s. *State Archive of Pistoia, address: piazza delle Scuole Normali.

After moving to Japan in 1973 she became an expert on sumo and was hired by NHK in 1992 to provide commentary for their English language sumo broadcasts. She was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in 2017. ==Early life== She was born in Nottingham, England, the daughter of a civil servant and a store manager. She attended Mundella Grammar School and sang in its choir. She was a keen follower of cricket as a teenager and would visit Trent Bridge cricket ground every Saturday. She studied theology and classics at Girton College, Cambridge and Hughes Hall, Cambridge from 1950 to 1954. == Career == After graduation from college, she became a Latin and Greek teacher. She spent much of the 1960s teaching at a British Army school in Singapore, where she married. She made a three-month visit to rural Japan where she stayed on a farm and saw her first sumo match on television during the March tournament of 1968. After returning to England she taught classics and was a contestant in the first series of Mastermind, before deciding to return to Japan five years after her previous visit, securing a teaching post there in September 1973. She worked at the International Language Centre in Jinb≈çch≈ç, Tokyo, and then joined the Foreign Press Center, editing translations of Foreign Ministry press releases. She also checked English language material for both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors in the National Diet, and the National Diet Library. ===Sumo commentary=== It was while working for the Foreign Press Center that Simmons first developed an interest in sumo. She saw her first live sumo match in January 1974 and began to regularly attend tournaments in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. She wrote a bi- monthly sumo column for Kansai Time Out from 1983 and was a contributor to Sumo World magazine from 1987. In 1985 she revised the book Sumo: From Rite to Sport, originally published in 1979 by Patricia Cuyler. In 1992 she became a commentator for national broadcaster NHK, on their newly established English language sumo broadcasts. She was hired for her specialist knowledge to complement NHK's play-by-play commentators who were more familiar with baseball broadcasts. In 2017 she celebrated her 25th year commentating for NHK, and she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun for her contribution to sumo. She lived in Sumida, Tokyo near sumo's heartland of Ry≈çgoku. She was a financial sponsor of Dewanoumi stable, one of the many training stables or heya for over 20 years, and had friendships with many sumo wrestlers and officials. ==Other interests== Simmons sang in Tokyo's British Embassy Choir. She also performed with the Tokyo International Players. She was a percussionist, playing the bodhr√°n and the djembe. She became a member of the Asiatic Society of Japan in 1980 and later served for some years on the ASJ Council. She went bungee jumping in Australia at age 68 and as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity helped dig foundations for homes in Mongolia on her 71st birthday. ==Personal life== Her marriage to Bob Simmons had ended in divorce, and she had no children.

He was Archbishop of Lagos from 1939 to 1965. Taylor was the first principal of St Gregory's College, Lagos and as Bishop, he was considered a pillar of support for the school. ==Life== Taylor was born in Minnesota to parents of English and Irish background. Educated at St Joseph's College, Wilton, Cork city, he was ordained a priest on June 23, 1914. Taylor was among the first group of trainee missionaries to attended SMA's seminary in Cork, Ireland. He was lifelong friends with Father Michael O'Flanagan, a nationalist sympathizer, a relationship that must have provoked nationalistic sentiments in Taylor. As founder of African Missionary, an SMA monthly newsletter, his writings were sympathetic to the nationalist cause. His first missionary appointment was as a staff of the Vicariate of the Bight of Benin's Holy Cross Primary School in Lagos. He served at the school from 1920 to 1924, he then moved to Ibadan to serve as a teacher at St Theresa's Minor Seminary. When St Gregory's College Lagos became a full fledged college, Taylor was appointed its first principal. In February 1934, upon the death of the Irish Bishop of Western Nigeria, Taylor was nominated to succeed him. After the death of Bishop O'Rourke in Lagos, Taylor was brought back to Lagos as the new Bishop. ===Archbishop=== At the beginning of his tenure, the Abeokuta, Oyo and Ibadan Diocese was within the Archdiocese of Lagos. Taylor had the zeal of the early missionaries in West Africa, he spoke Yoruba and was known to sometimes correct the Yoruba interpreter. He was also an avid cyclist and frequently traveled to out stations by road or forest path to practice the sacrament of confirmation or administer to a dying baptized catholic. To progress the mission of the church in Lagos and to close a gap in the need for elementary school teachers, Taylor established a teachers training school, Blessed Murumba's College at Ile-Ife in 1944. In 1943, he founded the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus Sisters at Ibonwon, an institution that practiced chastity and vows to poverty. In 1951, Taylor accepted a request from Dominican fathers to manager a new parish in Yaba. The fathers came from St Alberts Province in Chicago. The Parish is now called St Dominic's Parish, Yaba. He died in 1965. ==References== Category:19th-century births Category:1965 deaths Category:Nigerian Roman Catholics Category:People of colonial Nigeria Category:American emigrants to Nigeria Category:People from Minnesota Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American Roman Catholic priests Category:Educators from Ibadan Category:Educators from Lagos Category:20th-century Nigerian educators Category:Founders of Nigerian schools and colleges Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Nigeria Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Nigerian people of British descent Category:Nigerian people of Irish descent ","title":"Leo Hale Taylor"},{"id":"56856768","text":"The Office of the Vice-President is a ministry in Zambia.

There are two distinct forms that have not been formally recognized as separate taxa. There is an upright form with orange flower heads of up to high, and a sprawling form of in diameter with yellow flower heads. Its common name is needle-leaf pincushion, or narrow-leaf pincushion, in English and smalblaarspeldekussing in Afrikaans. The orange-flowered form is called tangerine pincushion or assegaaibos pincushion. Flowering occurs in the first half of the southern hemisphere season, but peaks in September and October. It is an endemic species that can only be found in the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa. == Description == Leucospermum lineare is an upright evergreen shrub of up to high, or a sprawling shrub of in diameter. The branches that bear flower heads are hairless in diameter, and may either be upright or spreading horizontally. The leaves are linear in shape and flat or with the margins rolled inwards, long and wide, pointing at an angle upwards, with two or three teeth near the leaf tip or without teeth. The flower heads are usually solitary or grouped with two or three, have a flattened egg-shape, are in diameter, atop a stalk of long. The common base of the flowers within the same head has a very slim cone-shape with a pointy tip, long and wide. The bracts that subtend the flower head are oval with an pointy tip, about 1¬Ω cm (0.6 in) long, overlapping, rubbery in consistency, softly hairy on the outside, with a dense row of hairs around the fringes. The bracts that subtend the individual flower are oval with a pointy tip, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and wide, rubbery in consistency, and densely woolly at the base. The perianth is about long, S-shaped when opening, and pale yellow to orange in colour. Its base is fused into a tube of long, with a slight bulge at one side, smooth near the top. Perianth tube 7.0- 8.0 mm long. The anthers are atop a very short filament of about 1 mm. The style is 5‚Äì5¬Ω cm (2.0‚Äì2.2 in) long, and near the upper end quadrangular and strongly bending towards the center of the flower head. It is topped by a slight thickening that is called the pollen presenter, which is obliquely oval in shape with a pointy tip, about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) long, with the groove that functions as the stigma obliquely at the very tip. The oblong ovary look grey due to a dense cover of minute soft hairs, and surrounded by white hairs of about long, is subtended by four linear to awl-shaped scales that secrete the nectar (the so-called hypogynous scales) of about long. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24). == Taxonomy == In 1768, Nicolaas Laurens Burman was the first to describe the needle-leaf pincushion, and he named it Leucadendron lineare. Carl Peter Thunberg assigned the species to the genus Protea, making the new combination P. linearis in 1781, but he had not noticed the name was already occupied in 1775, when Maarten Houttuyn used it for another species now known as Leucadendron ericifolium. Joseph Knight published a book in 1809 titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Richard Anthony Salisbury. Salisbury named the needle-leaf pincushion Leucadendrum fallax, a superfluous name since he referenced Burman, and should have adopted his species name. In 1810, Robert Brown called the species Leucospermum lineare, but referenced Thunberg's homonym, where he should have taken up Burman's name. Michel Gandoger in 1901 distinguished the upright and orange- flowered form as Leucospermum lineare var. calocephalum, which he raised together with Hans Schinz to a species in 1913, making the new combination Leucospermum calocephalum. In 1970, John Patrick Rourke considered these forms not sufficiently different to merit the distinction and so regarded them as synonymous. L. lineare has been assigned to the showy pincushions, section Brevifilamentum. The species name lineare is Latin, meaning \\"linear\\" or \\"line- shaped\\" and refers to the needle-like leaves. == Distribution, habitat and ecology == The range of L. lineare extends from Bainskloof to the Klein Drakensteinberge. The form with horizontally sprawling branches and golden yellow flowers occurs is most widespread. An upright form with deep orange flowers grows at the Assegaaibos Kloof near French Hoek. The species mostly occurs in mountainous sites on heavy gravelly clay soils at elevations of , with an average annual precipitation of , most of which fall during the winter. In a few locations L. lineare occurs on Table Mountain Sandstone, but even there it is mostly underlain by weathered granite. Flowers can be found between July and January with a peak in September and October. Birds pollinate the flowers. The seeds fall from the flower heads after about 2 months. The seed is covered by a soft, sweet and fatty layer that emits pheromones (called elaiosome) that is coveted by ants. Indigenous ant species collect them and take them to their underground nests, where they eat the ant bread. The ants cannot move the large hard and slick seed when the ant bread is removed and so remains underground, safe from being eaten and fire. This seed dispersal strategy is called myrmecochory. Although the plants do not survive a fire, the seeds promptly germinate after a fire. == Cultivation == Leucospermum lineare has been crossed with L. cordifolium, L. tottum and L. vestitum. Selections of the species and its hybrids are cultivated for cut-flowers and as garden plants. == Conservation == Leucospermum lineare is considered a vulnerable species. The reasons for the decrease in population size include invasive plants, cut flower harvesting, and land transformation. == References  External links == * several photos Category:Endemic flora of South Africa Category:Plants described in 1810 lineare ","title":"Leucospermum lineare"},{"id":"56856869","text":"Ministry vehicle taking social services in rural areas The Ministry of Community Development and Social Services is a ministry in Zambia.

All the above-ground parts of the plant are hairless. Its stem is upright and strong. The five to seven-veined leaves are decussate. The lower leaves are petiolate and elliptic in shape; the upper ones are sessile and lanceolate. The Hungarian gentian flowers from July to September. Its flowers are located in the upper leaf axils or grouped at the end of the stem. The hermaphroditic flowers are radially symmetrical with double perianths. The green sepals are fused. The calyx is bell-shaped and has five to eight outward curving teeth. The bell-shaped corolla is 25 to 50 millimetres long. It is wider at the top and, towards the middle, has five to nine petals. The corolla tip is ovate. On their outer side, the petals are red and violet with black and red spots, the inside is usually yellowish. Its chromosome count is 2n = 40. == Taxonomy == The first publication of Gentiana pannonica was by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. The species epithet pannonica derives from the Roman province of Pannonia. Synonyms for Gentiana pannonica SCOP. are: Gentiana semifida HOFFMANSS. EX RCHB. and Coilantha pannonica G.DON. == Similar species == The Hungarian gentian is very similar to the purple gentian (Gentiana purpurea). == Distribution and habitat  Range === The Hungarian gentian is found in the Eastern Alps, Bergamasque Alps, Carpathians and Transylvania. The western boundary of the gentian (Allg√§u, eastern Switzerland) is coincident with the eastern boundary of the purple gentian. In Austria the Hungarian gentian is scattered to moderately common (e.g. on the Krippenstein/Dachstein). It does not occur in Vienna or the Burgenland. In Germany it occurs in the alms of the Bavarian Forest, including within the Bavarian Forest National Park. === Habitat === The Hungarian gentian thrives best on calcareous soil, but also on soils poor in calcium. It occurs in Central Europe in perennial meadows and cirques, bogs and mountain pine bush. The Hungarian gentian is a character species of the Nardion community, but also occurs in plant communities of the sub-group rhododendro-vaccinienion. == Uses and conservation == The Hungarian gentian is an old medicinal herb and is used like the yellow gentian. Because it was intensively used in former times, its stocks shrank to just small residual populations. As a result the IUCN placed it in the \\"near threatened\\" category. For the conservation of this species habitat management plans were created or adjusted. == References  Literature == * * == External links == * * * Thomas Meyer: Gentian data sheet with identification key and photographs at Flora-de: Flora von Deutschland (old name of the website: Blumen in Schwaben). pannonica Category:Alpine flora ","title":"Gentiana pannonica"},{"id":"56856961","text":"Mariccus (d. 69) was a Gallic Boian leader who lived in the mid 1st century AD and led a failed revolt against Roman rule.

It is the central post office of the city of Patna and the headquarters of India Post's Bihar Circle. It is located on the intersection of Buddh Marg and New Market Station Road. The post office handles most of the city's inbound and outbound mails and parcels. As of 2017, GPO Patna delivers 1 lakh letters and parcels daily through 96 postmen. It also has more than 12 lakh savings accounts. The building was designed by New Zealand-born architect Joseph Fearis Munnings. The GPO campus also houses the office of the Chief Postmaster General for Bihar Circle. The construction of building started in 1912 and was completed in 1917. The building was opened to public in 1917 and was then known as Post and Telegraph Office. The building was part of the New Patna that British established in 1912 after the division of Bihar and Orissa from Bengal Presidency. The post office celebrated its centenary year in 2017. View of Post and Telegraph Office, Patna (1916) ==History== At the Delhi Durbar of 1911 King George V announced the creation of a new province of Bihar and Orissa under a lieutenant-governor. British decided Patna to be the capital of the new province. With this came the need to establish government offices and buildings such as the Patna Secretariat, Raj Bhavan (Bihar), Patna University campus, Patna High Court, Post and Telegraph Office. Munnings was appointed as Consulting Architect to the Government of Bihar and Orissa in the year 1912 and was tasked with the planning and development of New Patna. Lord Hardinge laid the stone of new buildings in Patna on 1 December 1912. The construction of the building started in 1912 and was completed in 1917. It was opened for the public on 1 July 1917 with 17 employees in total and was built over an area of 22 acres. Patna GPO when built was known as Post and Telegraph Office. It was however, not the first post office in Patna. The first post office in official records of Patna was near Anisabad area. This post office was later shifted to Bankipore, 150 metres away from the current GPO building. When the GPO building was constructed, the Bankipore post office moved to Muradabad area on Ashok Rajpath. The first post office of the province of Bihar and Orissa was opened near Hazaribagh - now part of the state of Jharkhand. ==Building and architecture== The post and telegraph office, Patna was built in Gothic Revival architectural style. J.F. Munnings was the main architect on the project and was influenced by choice of local materials and plain designs. These constraints were also practical in nature as it was the time when World War I was waging and British Empire was one of the main belligerents of the allied powers. This led to the plain designs of the building as the empire was spending more on war efforts. The building is a flat roofed, plastered brick building featuring Chhajja. The building also has Mughal features as when built, it was located on the edge of the old city of Patna and was on the road leading from old city to the new capital city of Patna. It also features an arcade. The original structure had three porticoes - north, south and east. East portico functioned as the main entrance. The western flank was added later. The ground floor has seven rooms and four halls with counter areas. The first floor houses 14 halls which are quite huge in size. The chief postmaster's office is now located in the central portion, while the deputy postmaster's office is located underneath it. The building was renovated in the year 2000 at a cost of INR 1.25 crore. The renovation also added five gardens, including one having medicinal herbs to the campus. == Location == Patna GPO is located in Beer Chand Patel Path locality of Patna. The main building is located on the intersection of Buddh Marg and New Market Station Road. The main portico of the building faces in the south east direction. GPO is less than 1 km from Patna Junction and around 6 km from Patna Airport. Hardinge Park is located on west side of the GPO campus. ==Current use== Patna GPO currently serves as the main post office of the city of Patna and is also the head office of Bihar circle of India Post. The area of the building is around 2.5 lakh sq ft and houses almost 296 employees. One multipurpose hall on ground floor houses the counters of all the mail and booking services. The other three halls on ground floor deal with financial services, staff and philately. A separate area for 96 postmen is housed in seven other rooms on the same floor in the southern flank. Mail, delivery and parcel sections are also present in the same section. There are separate counters for senior citizens and students in the northern side of the building. ==See also== * Patna Secretariat * Raj Bhavan (Bihar) ==References * India Post Website Category:Government buildings in Bihar Category:Buildings and structures in Patna Category:Government of Bihar Category:Post office buildings in India ","title":"General Post Office, Patna"},{"id":"56857110","text":"Mark Segbers (born April 18, 1996) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer on loan from USL Championship side Memphis 901. ==Early life== Mark Segbers was born in St. Louis and is the son of Jim and Mimi Segbers and brother to Nick, David, Shirley, and Shelby Segbers.

The auteur for the event was Jean-Richard Bloch. The spectacle was based around the story of an oil-rich colony led by an engineer which was threatened by an imperialist power. However, following the intervention of the League of Nations, there was a decision to pool the world's resource and an era of endless peace was ushered in. The drama unrolled to the sound of horns and sirens, radio news flashes and during the finale not only were there wrestling matches and athletic events, but the cycle track of the V√©lodrome d'hiver was used for a cycle race. There was a chorus ‚Äî achieved by amplifying the voice of radio announcer, but original plans to project a film onto a big screen were dropped, in favour of an enormous backdrop designed by Fernand L√©ger. A copy of this backdrop, entitled La Naissance d'une cit√©, was dedicated by L√©ger to Jean-Richard Bloch. It fetched ‚Ç¨93,600 when auctioned at Christie's in 2005. The score included contributions from Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and Jean Wiener. The plot was adjusted to fit the publicised optimism of the sponsors, the French Popular Front government. The story concerned a group of workers trapped in a monotonous job who plan to set up a utopian community on an Island in the Atlantic ocean. In 2006 the Groupe √âtudes Jean-Richard Bloch republished the book, Naissance d'une cit√©, related to the original show. ==References== Category:1937 in France Category:Culture of Paris Category:October 1937 events ","title":"Naissance d'une cit√©"},{"id":"56857212","text":"The 2016 Offaly Senior Football Championship was the 119th edition of Offaly GAA's premier gaelic football competition for senior graded clubs in County Offaly, Ireland.

In 2015/16, Fuchs-Sch√ºndeln held a visiting appointment at Stanford University. In parallel to her academic position, Fuchs-Sch√ºndeln is also affiliated with the Center for Financial Studies, IZA Institute of Labor Economics, CESifo Research Network, Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), and the Global Working Group on Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO).

Among else, findings of her research include the following: * Their experience with socialism has made East Germans more in favour of state intervention than West Germans, though complete convergence of preferences is expected to occur within one to two generations (with Alberto Alesina). * Risk-averse individuals self-select into occupations with low income risks (e.g. civil service), which in turn decreases their need for precautionary savings (with Matthias Sch√ºndeln). * Income inequality was relatively stable until the German reunification but has increased substantially since then, especially after 1998 (with Matthias Sommer and Dirk Krueger). * With regard to the post-reunification migration of East Germans to West Germany, mostly the old and less educated stayed, the young and educated moved, and older and single migrants returned to East Germany (with Matthias Sch√ºndeln). == References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:German women economists Category:German economists Category:Goethe University Frankfurt faculty Category:Macroeconomists Category:Writers from Cologne Category:University of Cologne alumni Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Nicola Fuchs-Sch√ºndeln"},{"id":"56857254","text":"Windhill, South Yorkshire may refer to two places in England: *Windhill, Staincross, in Barnsley *Windhill, Mexborough, in Doncaster ","title":"Windhill, South Yorkshire"},{"id":"56857256","text":"The 2017 Longford Senior Football Championship was the 101st running of the Longford GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Longford, Ireland since the first County Championship was held in 1890 (100 completed since 1890, 1 started but not completed in 1891).

It was built as a monument for Margrave Christian Ernest of Brandenburg-Bayreuth after he had participated in the liberation of Vienna, which had been besieged by the Turks in 1683. The Margrave's equestrian statue is placed in the centre of the fountain, surrounded by other sculpture groups representing the four known continents as well as four rivers rising in the Fichtel Mountains. The fountain was designed by German sculptor Elias R√§ntz in 1699-1705 by order of Margrave Christian Ernest. It was placed in the outer courtyard of the Old Castle, today it stands in front of the New Castle (Neues Schloss). == The equestrian statue == Sitting on his horse, Margrave Christian Ernest is depicted wearing an armour. Beneath his horse, an anguished Turk is lying on the ground. On the other side, the Margrave's court dwarf is holding a shield with the inscription \\"PIETAS AD OMNIA UTILIS\\" (piety is useful for everything). Originally, both the Margrave's and the dwarf's statue were gilded. == The banner == The statue is surrounded by a banner. The inscription \\"IPSO SERENISS NATAL D. 27. IV L. AN.

The text is written as a chronogram: the bold letters are written larger on the banner than the others. If you read them as Roman numerals and sum them up, the result is 1705, the year the fountain has been completed. == The other sculpture groups == The lower part of the fountain is made up of four sculpture groups, each consisting of a person sitting on a spouting animal. The water flows represent the four rivers rising in the Fichtel Mountains, whose directions of flow match the four cardinal directions.

Her debut film Hooligan Sparrow premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2016 and was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2017. Her second film, I Am Another You, premiered at SXSW Film Festival in 2017 and won two special jury awards, and her third film, One Child Nation, won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary Feature at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Wang is the recipient of a 2021 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Filmmaking, from the Vilcek Foundation. == Early life == Wang was born on a small, rural farming village in 1985 in Jiangxi Province, China. Her parents named her \\"Wang Nanfu\\" (), as Nan (Áî∑) means man, and Fu (Ê†ø) means pillar, hoping that the girl would grow up strong like a man. When Wang was 12 years old, she lost her father (he was 33 when he died) and was forced to drop out of school to work so she could support her family. Wang's family could not afford to send her to secondary education. Instead, she enrolled herself in a vocational school and eventually started working as a teacher for primary school-age children. == Education == With several years of work experience under her belt, Wang studied English literature at a local university's Continuing Education Program. After that, she was granted a full fellowship from Shanghai University while enrolled in a graduate program for English language and literature. Later, she became interested in film and went back to school to study it. She studied communication at Ohio University and holds a master's degree in documentary from New York University's journalism school. == Career and work Hooligan Sparrow=== Hooligan Sparrow was Wang's first feature documentary. It tells the story of Chinese human rights activists fighting to bring accountability to government officials who sexually assaulted several young girls. As Wang films the activists, she becomes the subject of harassment from state actors responding to Wang's efforts to document the work of the activists. Wang has stated that she created the film because, ‚ÄúI was interested in many, many topics like the healthcare system and the educational system in China because I didn‚Äôt go to high school or college in China. Another topic that interested me was sex workers because, like I said, I grew up in a village and I had seen a lot of women from the village who didn‚Äôt have access to education and they end up becoming sex workers because they did not have skills, they did not have education and they were really discriminated against. So, I wanted to make a film about the poorest sex workers in the country, but I also knew that it would be hard to get access to them. I‚Äôve known Hooligan Sparrow‚Äìher name is Ye Haiyan‚Äìfor a long time through social media, but I had never seen her in person at the time.‚Äù When creating the film Wang was not aware that this would make her a target for government surveillance, later stating that she \\"knew very little about the activist world\\". Wang has noted that her family and friends were followed and interrogated by officers who questioned whether or not they knew her, her whereabouts, and her current actions. == Major contributions and awards == Wang's film ‚ÄúHooligan Sparrow‚Äù screened at festivals in over 25 countries including Sundance, Hot Docs, Sheffield, Full Frame, and Human Rights Watch Film Fest. Her film I Am Another You premiered at SXSW in 2017 and won the LUNA Chicken & Egg Award for Best Documentary Feature directed by a woman and the SXSW Special Jury Award for Excellence in Documentary Storytelling. Wang is a recipient of the Sundance Documentary Fund and Bertha Britdoc Journalism Fund, Sundance and IFP supported filmmaker. She was also placed on the shortlist for the 2016 Oscar for Feature Length Documentary for Hooligan Sparrow. Wang was honored by the International Documentary Association with the 2016 Emerging Filmmaker Award. Her third feature, One Child Nation, won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary Feature at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Wang was awarded a 2021 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Filmmaking by the Vilcek Foundation, \\"for the impact and courage of her riveting documentaries\\". In October 2020, it was announced that Wang was one of 21 recipients awarded the Macarthur Genius Grant. ==Personal life== Wang is married and has one child (born c. 2017), and they reside in New Jersey. == References  * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese documentary filmmakers Category:New York University alumni Category:Shanghai University alumni Category:Women documentary filmmakers Category:Ohio University alumni ","title":"Nanfu Wang"},{"id":"56857620","text":"The Battle of Barawa was an armed military encounter between the Portuguese Empire and the Ajuran Sultanate, in the city of Barawa. The Portuguese staged a landing and sacked the city but couldn't permanently hold it. Eighty years later the Portuguese returned to capture the city, but Barawa's fierce resistance made the campaign a failure.

The King of Malindi had been a faithful vassal of the Portuguese since the maiden voyage of Vasco da Gama to India in 1497, and at that instance, the King requested assistance from the Portuguese against the hostile cities of Oja, Lamu and Barawa. Oja was sacked and Lamu was subjugated without a fight.\\"The History of the Portuguese, During the Reign of Emmanuel\\" page 285 Upon reaching Barawa, the Portuguese first asked the city to submit without a fight, which was refused.\\"The History of the Portuguese, During the Reign of Emmanuel\\" page 286 The Portuguese made ready to assault the city, and reported that its defences included a wall and 4,000 men ready to fight.\\"The History of the Portuguese, During the Reign of Emmanuel\\" page 286 The following morning, Trist√£o da Cunha and Afonso de Albuquerque led two assault groups ashore. 2,000 men sallied forth to fight the Portuguese on the beach, but were driven back to the city. Coming under attack from fire arrows, the Portuguese scaled the wall at a weak point and the defences were breached. Many inhabitants fled, but those who remained perished in the fight.

The group consists of founding members Saint P (born Theophilus Kwesi Layne Aban- Mensah) and PK (born Alexander Denzil Bamidale Johnson-Cole), both of whom are from Camden, and later addition Lyrical Strally (born Mluleki David Mvubu), who was born in Ealing and raised in Sunbury-on-Thames. The group have released music through Logan Sama's Keepin' It Grimy label, and are currently signed to Flowdan's label SpentShell. They have received extensive airplay on Rinse FM, BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra and NTS, and have supported AJ Tracey on tour. In 2017, they appeared at several festivals including Glastonbury, Cambridge's Strawberries and Creem and Bristol's Love Saves the Day. In 2018, they played at Detonate Festival in Nottingham, Helios Festival in Corfu, Pop-Kultur in Germany, and Outlook Festival in Croatia. ==Career2006‚Äì2010: Formation as YRS and transformation into YGG=== In an interview with Big Zuu on Radar Radio's Joints Show on 27 July 2016, PK explained how the group originated as a five-member crew in 2006, until several members dropped out. He and Saint met Lyrical Strally years later through Novelist at a cypher. PK and Lyrical Strally met again by a chance encounter in a nightclub queue, and discovered that they were both attending Kingston University (studying Music Performance and Criminology & Sociology respectively).

PK and Saint have recorded music together since 2010, originally operating in a studio in Kilburn. Songs dating back to 2011 are available on PK's SoundCloud account, including \\"Shut Your Mouth\\", \\"Live\\", \\"Radio\\", \\"We Spit Greeze\\" and \\"Worth the Wait\\". In 2015, they appeared on West London MC AJ Tracey's breakthrough project The Front, on the track \\"Red Bull\\". ===2015‚Äìpresent: Breakthrough and World Domination=== The group's debut single, \\"Okay\\", was self-released on 19 September 2015, and premiered via FACT. Joseph 'JP' Patterson, senior editor of Complex UK, wrote of the song: \\"It's a bouncy number... somewhat jovial... there's now plenty of room for a group like this in the market.\\" Reviewing the song for The Quietus, Tomas Fraser observed \\"how different their individual styles are; Lyrical Strally, quick-witted with clear, solid diction; Saint, skippy and fast-paced (if a little erratic at times) and PK, a loud, confident, reload-friendly MC with a reputation for turning raves upside down already under his belt.\\" YGG's second single, \\"Don't Talk Like That\\" was self-released on 5 January 2016. The song was premiered by i-D, and a remix featuring guest vocals from Spitz, Mic Ty, Big Zuu, Jay Amo and AJ Tracey was released in June of the same year. In 2017, the group signed to BBC and Rinse FM DJ Logan Sama's record label, Keepin' It Grimy. They released a standalone single entitled \\"Bad\\" on 31 March, which was hailed by Pigeons and Planes as an \\"instant underground anthem\\". The trio released their debut extended play, World Domination, on 28 November 2017 through Keepin' It Grimy. The project features six group tracks as well as a solo track from each artist, and was preceded by the single \\"Three IC3s\\" and the promotional single \\"Lyca\\". In 2018, the group signed to Flowdan's record label and management company, SpentShell. PK released his four-track debut solo EP, The Bad Ombr√©, with the label on 2 February 2018. In an interview with Notion, the other two group members revealed that they too have been working on solo content: Lyrical Strally has a forthcoming song entitled \\"I Finesse\\", while Saint mentioned a song entitled \\"On To\\".

According to Tacitus, Africanus had denounced the brothers Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Proculus and Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Rufus to the emperor Nero; they were suffect consuls in 56.Tacitus, Histories, IV.41 As Dio Cassius tells the tale, at the time both were administering Germania Inferior and Germania Superior when Nero summoned them to Achaea for some misleading reason, only to be charged under the lex maiestas, and, unable to defend themselves, both committed suicide.Dio Cassius, Romaike Historia LXIII.17.3 After the death of Nero, when the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors had settled, Africanus was prosecuted for his role in the deaths of the brothers Sulpicii Scribonii; unable to either confess or deny the fact, he instead implicated Quintus Vibius Crispus as also involved in the matter. In the aftermath, he was physically ejected from the Curia Julia. Despite his disreputable history, Africanus was able to remain on good enough terms with the emperor Vespasian that he was allowed to participate in the sortition and be proconsular governor of Africa for the term 77/78.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), p. 299 He went on to be patronus municipii, most likely of Hippo Regius. == References  Further reading == * H.W.

It is the oldest church in the United States dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe and is listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties. It is also a contributing property in the Santa Fe Historic District. with The church is a simple cruciform building with thick adobe walls and has been remodeled several times, most recently in the 1970s. ==History== The church was built sometime between the late 1700s and early 1800s, though its exact date of construction is unknown. The records of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe suggest it was built around 1795, as a license authorizing its construction was issued that year. However, the church's existence was not definitively documented until 1821. Conversely, at least one source claimed the church is much older, dating to before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, though this is probably apocryphal. The famous altar screen depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe, transported in pieces from Mexico City over the Camino Real, is signed by Jos√© de Alc√≠bar and dated 1783. The church remained active until the 1830s, but by the time the U.S. Army occupied the city in 1846, it was little-used and in disrepair. A visitor in 1881, John Gregory Bourke, wrote At the time of Bourke's description, the church was only being used once a year for the festival of Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. However, after the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad arrived in Santa Fe in 1880, Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy arranged to have it repaired to serve the new English-speaking population brought by the railroad. A native of France, Lamy preferred European architectural styles over the local adobe vernacular and had the church remodeled with a pitched roof and steeple starting in 1881. On June 27, 1922, the steeple and roof were destroyed by a fire that also damaged the interior, though the altar screen survived. The church was then rebuilt in the Mission Revival style with curved parapets and a tiled roof. It was remodeled again in 1976‚Äì78 to bring it closer to the original appearance, though some of the Mission details remain in place. Since the opening of a new church next door in 1961, it is no longer an active parish church but is still used for monthly masses. ==References Category:Roman Catholic churches in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties Category:Our Lady of Guadalupe ","title":"Santuario de Guadalupe"},{"id":"56857692","text":"Bhagwant may refer to * Bhagwant Das, ruler of Amber * Bhagwant Mann, Indian politician and actor * Bhagwant Nagar, a town in the Unnao district in the state of Uttar Pradesh * Bhagwant Singh, Jat ruler of Dholpur state * Bhagwant Singh of Mewar, the titular ruler of the Indian princely state of Udaipur or Mewar * Bhagwant University, located in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India Category:Hindu given names Category:Indian masculine given names ","title":"Bhagwant"},{"id":"56857693","text":"Macdonald Nkabika is a Zambian businessman and former politician.

In June 1950, it became the Band of the Ministry of People's Security, & later that year, the band became attached as a unit of the Supreme Guard Command's Honor Guard Battalion. By September 1954, full control of the band was given to the Ministry of Public Security, serving for the remainder of the Cold War and the 1990s before being reorganized into a separate entity in June 1998 as a directly reporting unit of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, tasked as the primary unit for the military music activities throughout the whole KPA.

The satellite is intended to replace the failed IRNSS-1A, and complete the constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites after IRNSS-1H failed to do so. The satellite's assembly, integration and testing is partly done by a consortium of six small firms led by Alpha Design Technologies, a Bengaluru-based aerospace firm under URSC's supervision. ==Payload== Like its predecessor, IRNSS-1I has two types of payloads, navigation payload and the ranging payload. The navigation payload transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L5 band and S band. A highly accurate Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. Failure of these Rubidium atomic clocks was the reason for IRNSS-1A to be deemed unfit. The ranging payload consists of transponder which is operated in CDMA mode for two-way range measurements. The IRNSS satellites continuously emites time stamped navigation signals, which are received by the ground-based user receivers. The information is then processed by the receivers to derive their own position, velocity and time. The system provides the seamless 24 by 7 services under all weather condition. ==Satellite== The satellite will help in completing the satellite based navigation system of India which is currently under development. The IRNSS space segment consists of seven satellites. After the failure of all three Rubidium Atomic clocks on-board IRNSS-1A and the failure of IRNSS-1H to separate from the heat shield of the launch vehicle, IRNSS constellation remains incomplete without this satellite. This independent regional navigation satellite system is developed by India and is similar to Global Positioning System (GPS) of the US, which has 31 satellites currently in orbit. ==Launch== IRNSS-1I was successfully launched by 43rd flight of PSLV (PSLV-C41) in XL configuration on 11 April 2018. ==See also== * Communication-Centric Intelligence Satellite (CCI-Sat) * GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation (GAGAN) * Satellite navigation == References  External links == * ISRO Future Programmes Category:IRNSS satellites Category:Spacecraft launched by India in 2018 Category:Spacecraft launched by PSLV rockets Category:April 2018 events in India ","title":"IRNSS-1I"},{"id":"56857766","text":"Resmi Resmiev (, born 19 June 1947) is a Bulgarian alpine skier.

It is a port of the original Japanese NEC PC-9801, which had 16 colors, which was released in 1995-08-25. Players assume the role of Hajime, a man who is about to get a full-time job and is looking for a date. This is done by entering a VR-machine in a popular attraction called \\"May Club\\" (pun on \\"make love\\"), where players interact with people from across great distances as if they were right there with them. The number of tickets to access May Club are limited however, so players must plan when to enter May Club to meet the woman of their choice. There are ten women in all and each one is very different. This game focuses on many different themes, from S&M;, to lesbianism, to a lolita complex. The game is known to be quite difficult, due to the planning needed on when to enter May Club to meet the right people, as players can enter in the morning, afternoon, or evening on any given day. The game has a time limit, and by a certain date, the game is over, regardless of whether players managed to get a girlfriend or not. However, each of the women players meet while in the VR machine has a secret they are hiding, ranging from the fairly normal to the absurd. Because the VR space isn't as secure as the company thinks, anything could be possible. One woman is a hacker set out on having fun exploring the virtual space. Just how much she's affected is up to you to find out. Two hentai scenes were deleted from the English version of the game because in those scenes, the characters, Misato and Kirara, appeared to be underage by US standards. However, the programmers removed the images only from the game, not the programming, and with a hex editor or patch, the scenes can be viewed. There is a patch that restores one of the scenes into the game fully translated, and another that adds the graphics from the second scene back into the CG gallery, but the second scene still has yet to be translated. ==References== * Visual novel database entry ==External links== * Jast USA company webpage, NSFW content Category:1995 video games Category:Eroge Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels Category:Windows games ","title":"May Club"},{"id":"56857928","text":"The Australia Day Honours 1981 were announced on 26 January 1981 by the Governor General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowen.

Adams, in which she develops her Vegetarian-Feminist, Pacifist, intersectional critical theory. The book was first written as an essay for a college course taught by Mary Daly and includes material such as interviews from vegetarian feminists in the Boston-Cambridge area. The Sexual Politics of Meat has been translated into nine languages and re-published for its 25th anniversary edition as a part of the Bloomsbury Revelations series. == Summary == The book is composed of three parts, \\"The Patriarchal Texts of Meat\\", \\"From the Belly of Zeus\\", and \\"Eat Rice, Have Faith in Women\\", as well as an epilogue entitled \\"Destabilizing Patriarchal Consumption\\". In these sections Adams looks at the connections between as well as the comparisons of ingrained cultural misogyny and what Adams sees as an obsession with the consumption of meat and masculinity. == Reception == The Sexual Politics of Meat has been reviewed by multiple outlets, which includes the NWSA Journal, Etnofoor, and The Women's Review of Books.

Brown was one of the first graduates of El Paso High School. She was the first person to teach music in the public schools in Texas and El Paso and was the first woman to own a bicycle in El Paso. Brown is also one of the original creators of the El Paso International Museum which later became the El Paso Museum of Art. == Biography == Brown was born in Missouri on December 17, 1871. She was raised in Sherman, Texas where she took music lessons at the North Texas Female College. Brown's sister, Francis Moore, would later become a well-known pianist in New York. Brown came to El Paso in 1886 with her family. She served as a bridesmaid for Anne Buford, who married into the Magoffin family in 1887. Brown was in the first graduating class of El Paso High School, and was one of the two graduates in 1887. When she graduated, she went with her father to San Diego, California where she received a second high school diploma from a high school there in 1889. She returned to El Paso again in 1890, a year after her father died. She then began to teach music in the public schools and was the first person to do so in both El Paso and Texas. Brown was the first woman to own and ride a bicycle in El Paso, Texas. She used the bike to get to the schools she taught at, pedaling through sand in some places. She taught music in the public schools until 1899. She also wrote about the history of music in El Paso. Brown married William R. Brown, a railroad agent for the Santa Fe railroad, on June 29, 1898. Her husband was a cornet player and also enjoyed music. Brown continued to play piano and organ and also organized various musical groups in El Paso. Brown joined the El Paso Woman's Club in 1899. She was the head of the El Paso Woman's Club's music department. Brown was also a member of the first board of directors for the El Paso School for Girls (Radford School) in 1910. Also in 1910, Brown became the president of the Woman's Club and held meetings at her home. Later, she was on the executive board of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1917, she formed an auxiliary of the Woman's Club devoted to music, called the MacDowell Club, named after Edward MacDowell. Brown became the second woman elected to the El Paso School Board in 1921. She recalled later that the Ku Klux Klan attempted to infiltrate politics within the board, and she said, \\"I worked hard as a board member and stood for justice.\\" She later became the state chair of Child Welfare in 1923. Brown helped originate the idea for the El Paso International Museum (later known as the El Paso Museum of Art) in 1925. She served as an organizer for the museum and worked as a chair on the board. In 1933, she was the president of the Pioneer Women's Association. Brown's husband died in 1934. Kate Moore Brown inherited his estate. Brown was president of the El Paso Symphony Association and helped get the organization incorporated in 1937. Brown also served on the board for the El Paso Public Library. She was president of the library board in 1936. Brown collected the fans and shawls belonging to notable women from around the world. Brown donated her collection of over 300 fans to the El Paso International Museum.

Reed is best remembered as a leading voice of the social gospel movement in the American West and as the president of the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth, a utopian socialist organization seeking to establish cooperative colonies. ==Early life== Reed was born July 24, 1836, in Brookfield, Vermont. His father was a minister. He attended the St. Lawrence Academy of Potsdam, New York. Reed taught school for two academic years, from 1858 to 1860, at Watertown, Wisconsin, studying law during the evenings. He was admitted to the Wisconsin state bar in 1860. Reed did not feel himself drawn to the legal profession, however, and at the urging of friends he left for Chicago to enroll at the Congregational theological seminary there. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Reed put aside his theological studies and enlisted as an officer in the 18th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving as a lieutenant. He would serve four years in the Union Army, gaining promotion to the rank of captain in 1863 and commanding 100 scouts, mustering out only at the end of the war. Reed was wounded in action in Tennessee when he rode into an ambush, shot in the leg at close range with a shotgun loaded with buckshot. Damage done to his knee in the encounter would afflict Reed for the rest of his life. In November 1865 Reed resumed his religious studies, preaching in El Paso, Illinois, on weekends. ==Congregationalist minister== Reed's first Congregationalist pastorate was at Hudson, Michigan. This was followed with a stint at Columbus, Wisconsin, before being moved to the Southern metropolis of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1868. It was there that he met the abolitionist school teacher Louise Lyon, who was a soprano in the church choir. The pair married in 1883. From New Orleans, Reed was called to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was made pastor of the Olivet Congregational Church. He would remain in the position for four years, preaching for a time from the stage of a local theater when his church was destroyed in a fire. Reed's reputation as a spellbinding and thoughtful divine grew and he was called by the First Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis, Indiana, a prosperous congregation which included among its members US President Benjamin Harrison and his wife. He would remain there for seven years before moving to his last city, becoming pastor of the First Congregational Church of Denver, Colorado, in 1884. He felt \\"that the West, more malleable than the East, offered a fresh opportunity to fulfill the United States' divine mission by creating a just, truly democratic society\\", \\"an ideal community worthy of the kingdom of God.\\" He would have a six-month sabbatical over that summer, coming back to head Denver's Broadway Temple congregation, which met each week in the Broadway Theater instead of in a conventional church setting. Reed became a member of the Knights of Labor circa 1884. In 1886 Reed served as a Democratic congressional candidate. He was nominated again in 1892. ==Death and legacy== Reed was stricken with fatal illness late in January 1899, lapsing into unconsciousness during his final hours. He died at 4:55 am on January 30 in Denver, with physicians listing the cause of death as chronic entero colitis inflammation. Reed was 62 years old at the time of his death. The memorial service which followed was pointedly addressed by a representative of the three main religious tendencies of Colorado, led by the rabbi W. S. Friedman, the Roman Catholic priest William O'Ryan, and the Protestant minister Barton Aylesworth and addressed by several secular speakers. The Grand Army of the Republic and Masons, two organizations with which Reed was actively involved, were also made part of the proceedings. A committee of six state senators were appointed by Governor Charles S. Thomas, who also paved the way for Reed's body to lie in state in a closed casket at the Colorado State Capitol prior to interment. Reed was survived by his wife and three children. ==See also== * Mila Tupper Maynard ==ReferencesFootnotes=Works cited=== : : : : : : ==Further reading== : : Category:1836 births Category:1899 deaths Category:19th-century Congregationalist ministers Category:American Christian socialists Category:American Congregationalist ministers Category:Congregationalist socialists Category:People from Denver Category:Religious leaders from Vermont Category:Utopian socialists Category:Knights of Labor people ","title":"Myron W.

She has been acclaimed for her intimate musical soundscape and unique voice, and has been described by The Guardian as \\"an understated, wise guide through uncertain territory\\" and by Revue as \\"allegorical and often brutally honest\\". Her three albums, Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs, Preservation, and latest, Out of My Province, have received acclaim in New Zealand and internationally. Reid performs live with a regular band of musicians consisting of Sam Taylor (guitar), Richie Pickard (bass), and Joe McCallum (drums). ==Early life== Born in Devonport, New Zealand, Reid is the daughter of Karin Reid and Craig O‚ÄôReilly. She was educated at Logan Park High School and Queen's High School. Reid began playing the guitar at 14, and went on to win best female musician in the Smokefreerockquest. She was a member of the Queen's madrigal choir, winners of the New Zealand Choral Federation (Otago) Millennium Trophy for secondary school choirs in 2009. ==Career== At the age of 18, Reid moved to Christchurch and began performing her original songs. Several short EPs followed, and as opportunities to perform nationally arose she moved to Auckland, and then Wellington. ===2014‚Äì2016: Crowdfunding and release of debut album=== Reid was encouraged to work toward her first full-length album, and was already connected to Lyttleton-based producer Ben Edwards. Without startup capital, Reid set up a PledgeMe campaign, which was given a significant boost after she opened for Tiny Ruins. This gave her a footing to record and self-release Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs at Edwards' Sitting Rooms Studios. In early 2015, Reid was signed to Australian indie label Spunk Records and the album was released officially in Australia and New Zealand. Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs was warmly received by critics, and in 2016 was nominated for a Tui award for best folk album and for the Taite Music Prize. After a period living and playing shows in Australia, Reid returned home to Port Chalmers and began an English Degree at the University of Otago. Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs was quickly licensed for UK, US and European release, which opened the door to Reid‚Äôs first tour of the UK and Europe in 2016. ===2017‚Äìpresent: World tours and second album=== Before leaving the country for the tour, Reid returned to the Lyttleton studio with Ben Edwards and her backing band where they recorded her sophomore album Preservation. The tour was a success, and while in London, Reid was approached with a co- management offer with Melodic Records. This was followed by a publishing deal with Basin Rock Records and an endorsement from Crafter Guitars. Since its release on 3 March 2017, Preservation has been met with a positive reception. Reid opened for Ryan Adams at his sold-out Auckland show on 20 May 2017. ==Awards== Reid‚Äôs first single from ‚Äò‚ÄôPreservation‚Äô‚Äô, Richard, saw her nominated for the APRA Silver Scroll award in 2017, regarded as New Zealand‚Äôs most important songwriting award. Judges described the song as \\"a stand-out folk-rock gem with its wonderfully direct delivery, charting heartbreak and dissolution, through striking imagery\\". Also in 2017, producer Ben Edwards won a New Zealand Music Award for his work on Preservation, and Reid herself was nominated for Best Solo Artist, Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Best Alternative Artist. ==Film and television appearances== On 26 September 2017, Reid made her UK television debut with her band, appearing on Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" + List of studio albums with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" NZ - ! scope=\\"row\\" Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs  *Released: 27 March 2015 *Label: Spunk Records *Format: CD, LP, download align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Preservation  *Released: 3 March 2017 *Label: Basin Rock/Spunk! *Format: CD, LP, download align=\\"center\\" 13 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Out of My Province  *Released: 6 March 2020 *Label: Spacebomb/Slow Time *Format: CD, LP, download align=\\"center\\" 2 - align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"13\\" style=\\"font-size: 8pt\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes releases that did not chart. } ===Extended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Letters I Wrote and Never Sent  * Released: 27 October 2011 * Label: Self-published * Formats: digital download } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of singles, showing year released and album name ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.75em;font-size:85%;\\"  NZ Artist Hot Peak positions for Benee's singles on the NZ Artist hot singles chart: * For \\"Get the Devil Out\\": * For \\"Heart to Ride\\", \\"All of My Love\\", \\"High & Lonely\\", \\"Oh Canada\\": - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Call the Days\\"  2015  ‚Äî  Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Arrow and the Aim\\"  2016  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"2\\" Preservation - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Richard\\"  2017  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Best Thing\\"  2019  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"3\\" Out of My Province - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Get the Devil Out\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2020  13 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Oh Canada\\"  16 -  colspan=\\"14\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"--\\" denotes releases that did not chart. } ===Other charted songs=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of songs, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\"  Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.75em;font-size:85%;\\"  NZ Arist Heat.

The colloid gas is immediately used for commercial purposes by Sam Boulder, who creates a Salvatory system; sheltered deep underground, well-equipped storage facilities of those people who want to go to the future - fleeing from incurable disease, boredom, the threat of nuclear war, or simply because of the desire to \\"remain an eternal champion\\". McKinley is a small man, a clerk in one of the advertising bureaus - very fond of children but his dreams of having his own are hampered by an inferiority complex, which manifests itself as a fear of a nuclear war and a world catastrophe. McKinley seeks to escape from the outside world, and from himself. Once at the press conference of SBS, which creates and maintains a network of salvatories, McKinley draws the attention of one of the top managers of this firm and receives an invitation to visit one of the salvatories to get acquainted with his work. After that, Mr. McKinley, fascinated by the fantastic technology of the salvatories, has only one dream in life - to get into the salvatory and escape to the future. For this he is even ready to commit crime. He attempts a number of times to get rich in order to buy a treasured ticket to a salvatory, but always ends up failing. At the last moment, McKinley finds a winning lottery ticket, which has the amount required for the purchase of the ticket. The fantasy comes true - McKinley sleeps for 250 years to wake up later clean, shaved and washed ready to go out into the new world. He does not pay attention to the strange behavior of the hateful and contemptful employees of SBS, who are performing their duties strictly according to the instructions. The elevator takes McKinley to the surface of the Earth but instead of a flowering garden, a world scorched by endless wars waits for him. But all this turns out to be only a dream. McKinley did not leave his time period, and he acts as he never did before to cure his complexes. ==Cast== *Donatas Banionis ‚Äî Mr. McKinley (voiced by Zinovy Gerdt) *Zhanna Bolotova ‚Äî Miss Bettle *Angelina Stepanova ‚Äî Mrs. Ann Shamway *Boris Babochkin ‚Äî billionaire Sam Boulder *Alla Demidova ‚Äî loose woman *Vladimir Vysotsky ‚Äî street singer Bill Seeger *Alexander Vokach ‚Äî Barens *Sofya Garrel Madame ‚Äî Coquillon *Leonid Kuravlyov ‚Äî Mr. Droot *Tatyana Lavrova‚Äî Mrs. Perkins *Victor Sergachev ‚Äî Jacques-Paul Coquillon *Vladimir Kenigson ‚Äî episode *Olga Barnet ‚Äî Miss Kathy Benson *Yuri Volyntsev ‚Äî McKinley's colleague *Igor Kvasha ‚Äî director of SB-Salvatory *Igor Kashintsev ‚Äî Parkins ==ProductionFilm score=== Schweitzer, in the process of reworking the Leonov's script so that it would be more suited for the present time, decided to express the author's idea through songs. Since the film was made in the American style, the idea arose to use the method of end-to-end ballads widely used in American films. The option of inviting Dean Reed was considered, however, Schweitzer's wife came up with the idea of hiring Vladimir Vysotsky. Vysotsky wrote the ballads, but they were mostly unsuitable for the picture because of their excessive length. Composer of the film's score Schwartz refused to write his own ballads which was why some songs were written by Anatoly Kalvarsky. ===Location=== Outdoor scenes of the film were mostly shot in Budapest. ==References Category:Soviet films Category:Soviet science fiction drama films Category:1970s science fiction drama films Category:Films directed by Mikhail Shveytser Category:Mosfilm films Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in Europe Category:Films set in the 23rd century ","title":"The Flight of Mr. McKinley"},{"id":"56858520","text":"Natasha Baig (), also spelled Nata-sha Baig is a Pakistani singer-songwriter from Hunza Valley.

The remaining feature is a Doric column with capital, about in height. Remains of marble roof-tiles have been seen on the spot (Livy xlii.3) and architectural fragments were excavated in 1886‚Äì1887 by the Archaeological Institute of America. The sculptures found were mostly buried again, but a few fragments, some decorative terracottas and a dedicatory inscription to Hera of the 6th century BC, in private possession at Crotone, are described by F. von Duhn in Notizie degli scavi. The date of the erection of the temple is postulated as 480‚Äì440 BC; it is not recorded by any ancient writer. It was reputed to have been founded by Hercules (Herakles) after he killed the bandit Lacinius, who attempted to steal some of the cattle of Geryon. The temple has been described a \\"perhaps the most splendid [structure] in southern Italy.\\" The federal treasury of the Italiote League was moved there in the 5th century BC, and remained there until relocated to Herakleia near Tarentum. Before evacuating Italy in 206 BC, toward the close of the Second Punic War, Hannibal dedicated bronze plaque inscribed in Punic and Greek there detailing his accomplishments. In 173 BC, the Censor Quintus Fulvius Flaccus dedicated the Temple of Fortuna Equestris in Rome, for which he had stripped the marble tiles from the roof of the Temple of Juno. In 172, out of grief over tragic news about his sons, Flaccus hanged himself. \\"[T]here was a general belief that he had been driven mad by Juno Lacinia, in her anger at his spoliation of her temple.\\" The Senate ordered the tiles returned, but, \\"as there was no one who understood how to replace the tiles they had been left in the precinct of the temple.\\" Cicero cites Coelius Antipater saying that the temple featured a golden column. Hannibal wanted to know whether or not it was solid gold, and drilled a hole and, determining that it was solid, decided to take it back to Carthage. The next night Juno appeared to him in a dream and threatened him with the loss of his remaining good eye if he took it. Hannibal obeyed the warning; he had a small statue of a heifer‚Äîsacred to Juno‚Äîcast from the drill shavings and mounted it on top of the column. The temple was said to have still been fairly complete in the 16th century, but was destroyed to build the episcopal palace at Crotone. ==See also== * List of Ancient Greek temples ==References== * See R.

Kim's father worked for American missionary Henry Appenzeller. In 1886 he sent his daughter to study at the Ewha Girls' School founded by Mary F. Scranton. Kim's parents allowed her to study under two conditions: she was forbidden to go to the United States, and to leave school prior to marriage. Kim was a good student, particularly good at English. When American missionary doctor Rosetta Sherwood Hall visited the school, Kim was asked to work as her interpreter. Impressed by Rosetta Sherwood Hall's surgery to correct a cleft lip and cleft palate, Kim began to dream of a medical career. Rosetta Sherwood Hall convinced Kim that Koreans were afflicted by Confucian prohibitions that did not allow them to be properly treated.Hall, Rosetta Sherwood. (about 1910) Mrs. Esther Kim Pak, M. D. : Korea's first woman doctor (Boston: Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, Methodist Episcopal Church). via Internet Archive. == Study and career == Rosetta Sherwood Hall introduced Kim to Pak Yusan (Î∞ïÏó¨ÏÑ†, Êú¥Ê±ùÂÖà), who worked with her husband, and on May 24, 1893, Kim Jeom-dong married him at the first Western-style wedding ceremony in Korea. After the wedding, she took the name of Esther Pak, adding her husband's name to the name under which she was baptized. In 1894, Sherwood Hall returned to New York, taking Esther and Yusan with her. Esther Pak graduated from a one-year school in New York where she studied Latin, physics and mathematics. In 1900, Park graduated from the Women's Medical College of Baltimore, as the first Korean woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. Her husband supported Park's medical education, but he died from tuberculosis, half a year before her graduation.. After obtaining the degree, Pak returned to Korea and settled in the first female hospital in the country, Bogu-yogwan (), in Jeongdon, Seoul. For ten months of work there, Dr. Pak helped more than 3,000 patients, and then in 1901 moved to Pyongyang, where Rosetta Sherwood Hall established a new hospital. Pak traveled all around Korea, including during the cholera epidemic, helping patients free of charge. In addition to the main work, she also conducted educational and teaching activities, teaching the first generation of Korean female doctors. Park lead public lectures in which she emphasized the importance of health education and education for women, and promoted Christianity . Esther Pak died of tuberculosis in April 1910, at the age of 34 years. == Honors == On April 28, 1909, Esther Pak and two other Korean women pioneers were celebrated with a ceremony: Ha Ran-sa, the first woman bachelor in Literature from an American university, and Yun Jeong-won, the first Korean graduate of the Japanese Meiji University (Music); it was attended by 7800 people. Emperor Gojong presented Pak with a silver medal. Pak was one of the historical figures featured in a missionary pageant titled \\"A Cloud of Witnesses\\" by Dora Patterson, performed in Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1933. In 2006, the Korean Academy of Sciences inducted Esther Park to the Korean Science and Technology Hall of Fame. In 2008, the Ewha University Alumni Committee established the Esther Park Medal, which recognizes the merit of women who graduated from the university and became doctors. == References == Category:1870s births Category:1910 deaths Category:People from Seoul Category:Women physicians Category:19th-century Korean physicians Category:20th-century Korean physicians Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians Category:Medical missionaries Category:Ewha Womans University alumni Category:19th-century Korean women Category:Tuberculosis deaths in South Korea ","title":"Esther Park (physician)"},{"id":"56858533","text":"A timeline of notable events relating to Classic FM, a British national radio station which began broadcasting in September 1992. ==1990s== *1990 **The Broadcasting Act 1990 paves the way for the launch of Independent National Radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom.

Combining the Internet, finance and a low-carbon lifestyle, it is a personal carbon account as well as public benefit activity: if users walk, travel by public transport, pay utility fees online, pay traffic tickets online, make online hospital registration, book tickets online and generate other low-carbon activities, they would reduce corresponding carbon emissions. These would be counted and converted into virtual \\"green energy\\" and users could use these energy to raise a virtual tree in their Ant Forest account. When enough energy has been earned to grow a virtual tree, it would be converted into a real tree and planted in some real areas in China by people supported by Ant Financial Services Group and its partners. After that, the virtual tree in users' Ant Forest account have to be re-raise. Until May 2017, there was about two hundred million users in Ant Forest, equivalent to 3% of the world's population. Until August 2017, 1.22 million tons carbon emissions have been reduced totally and 10.25 million entity trees have been planted. Users could see the trees they planted through satellite map. According to Gong Zhang, a former NASA scientist and the founder of GAGO Inc., it should be hard to see the saplings because of the low resolution of satellite, but millions of saplings have been planted so we could see the changes they brought to the world.Alipay hopes to cultivate and encourage users to stick to a low-carbon lifestyle through this way. By August 27, 2019,122 million trees were planted in China by Alipay ant forest. ==Background== The world faces serious environmental challenges. As environmental pressures grow, global ecosystems are severely damaged. The Paris Agreement recognizes the collective nature of the historic challenge of reducing carbon emissions. As an important economic force in the world, China also faces great challenges. In the process of transitioning to a more low-carbon lifestyle, the use of digital technology in the financial sector plays a key role and some progress has been made, but green finance still has great potential for development. The development of new digital technologies and the innovation of forms attract more citizens to participate directly in green financing. In this case, in August 2016, Ant Financial launched the Ant Forest Program. ==Application== The purpose of ant forest activity is to convert simulated energy into real trees. Ant Financial evaluates the personal behavior data of participating users, including transportation, entertainment, and utility payments. For example, users can save carbon emissions from going out to buy train tickets by buying train tickets online. Convert \\"avoid carbon emissions\\" below the scheduled carbon emission standard into a user's virtual energy stored in a personal Ant Forest account, where virtual energy accumulates in a certain amount and can be exchanged online for different types of trees or protected areas, and then Ant Financial works with its ecological partners to plant a real tree in the desert. ==Development== On 5 September 2017, Ant Forest released a plan called \\"Planet Blue\\" at its \\"Bluer Sky\\" forum of the public benefit activities week. This plan would open product capabilities and technology platform to the whole society and urge everyone to participate in a green future. This project tries to transform itself into an incubator of social charity innovation. The CEO of Ant Financial Services Group Xiandong Jin said:\\" Public benefit activities are right around us. The power of mobile Internet technology is available to everyone and makes everyone's actions into possible. Technology is the greatest public welfare of this era\\". He also pointed out that mobile Internet allows individuals to translate their daily low-carbon behaviors into green energy, whilst the use of technologies such as remote sensing satellite and artificial intelligent technology could help commonweal organizations to manage forest ecology better and make public benefits more real and transparent. The new plan of Ant Forest would encourage more access to low- carbon scenarios and await the NPO, government agencies, international organizations and other partners to join into this public benefit innovation. According to Wang Zu, the product manager of the Ant Financial Services Group, the plan was more than finding trees and preserves and union of brands, it was a vision of achieving the open of the whole industry chain, which could connect all the green scenes and resources with everyone's actions on the platform. As of August 2019, more than 500 million people have joined the Alipay Ant Forest Green Program, planting more than 100 million trees and reducing carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons, covering a total area of 112,000 hectares in northwest China. ==Cooperation== On January 19, 2017, Ant Financial and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched the world's first green digital financial alliance during the Davos World Economic Forum, with the aim of harnessing digital technology to promoting financing that addresses global environmental challenges. The collaboration marked the UNEP's first joint venture with a Chinese company since it was established 45 years ago. The Sustainable Digital Finance Alliance (The Green Digital Finance Alliance) is registered as not-for-profit in Geneva and focuses on knowledge and policy recommendations and harnessing a global network of actors to undertake rapid and higher risk experimentation and challenges to address the potential for digital finance and fintech-powered business innovations to reshape the financial system in ways that better align it with the needs of sustainable development. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) released a report on China's carbon market on February 17 and specifically analyzed Ant Forest, the world's largest platform for gathering data on individuals' efforts to reduce their carbon footprints. The UNDP‚Äôs report said the Chinese platform has ‚Äúa special significance in enhancing personal contribution to the global response to climate change‚Äù. ==Reward== Ali Annual Outstanding Public Benefit Activity Project. 19 September 2019 , Ant Forest wins UN Chanmpions of the Earth award, the United Nations‚Äô top environmental honour in inspiration and action category. ==Social implications== Maosheng Duan (the director of the China Carbon Market Research Center Tsinghua University and the former chairman of the executive board of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)) said that Ant Forest have taken a pioneering step towards promoting ordinary people to reduce carbon emissions at consumer- sides. Ant Forest would make more contributions to the environment and public benefits in China and even the world. Also, it would become a typical duplicable project. Zhenping Huang (the assistant to the president of the Institute For Philanthropy Tsinghua University) believed that in the era of technology, the public benefit activities could reshape personal habits as well as affect cooperations and interactions among social groups profoundly. Such crossover collision provides the most fertile soil to innovation of public benefits. ==Carbon Trading== Man-induced global climate change has become a prominent political issue. Dangerous climate change caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations has a serious impact on global ecosystems, and governments are seeking mitigation measures and solutions. Market-based carbon trading is emerging as the most popular government strategy. Carbon trading refers to the economic action of trading carbon dioxide emissions rights as a commodity and in accordance with market mechanisms in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and in the 1990s European governments began to limit corporate emissions by directly regulating and imposing carbon taxes. In 2005, the EU formed its own carbon trading system. Between 1997 and 2001, The Kyoto Protocol encourages governments to develop carbon trading plans. Carbon permits have rapidly grown into an important financial instrument on the market with billions of dollars a year. China is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is regarded by many countries as the most promising market for emission reduction. The Kyoto Protocol limits countries' greenhouse gas emissions in the form of regulations. Ant Forest is the world's largest platform for personal carbon accounts, which record each person's low- carbon behavior in quantitative terms. According to Chenlong, Chief Strategy Officer of Ant Forests, if individual carbon reduction activities can form a nationally recognized methodology and incorporate China's voluntary emission reduction project (CCER), it will become a \\"carbon account\\" for individuals to participate in carbon trading in the future, participating in the future trading and investment in the carbon market. In addition, as of August 2019, Ant Forest users have reached 500 million, Ant Financial and the largest entrepreneurial environmental organization, SEE public welfare organization, the actual planting of more than 100 million trees in China's northwest region, a cumulative reduction of carbon emissions of 7.92 million tons, these reduced CO2 emissions will also be a huge asset in the carbon market. In the future, sustainable investment will be a means of generating long-term returns. ==References * Aerial Ant Forest Category:Alibaba Group Category:Ecology of China Category:2016 establishments in China ","title":"Ant Forest"},{"id":"56858613","text":"Transitron Electronic Corporation was a semiconductor device fabrication company of the United States.

Crank slider mechanisms with 0 and 1.25 eccentricity. Coupler curves of a slider crank. A slider-crank linkage is a four-link mechanism with three revolute joints and one prismatic, or sliding, joint.Hartenberg, R.S. & J. Denavit (1964) Kinematic synthesis of linkages, New York: McGraw-Hill, online link from Cornell University. The rotation of the crank drives the linear movement the slider, or the expansion of gases against a sliding piston in a cylinder can drive the rotation of the crank. There are two types of slider-cranks: in-line and offset. # In-line: An in-line slider-crank has its slider positioned so the line of travel of the hinged joint of the slider passes through the base joint of the crank. This creates a symmetric slider movement back and forth as the crank rotates. # Offset: If the line of travel of the hinged joint of the slider does not pass through the base pivot of the crank, the slider movement is not symmetric. It moves faster in one direction than the other. This is called a quick-return mechanism. There are also two methods to design each type: graphical and analytical. == Kinematics of the in-line slider-crank == 100px The displacement of the end of the connecting rod is approximately proportional to the cosine of the angle of rotation of the crank, when it is measured from top dead center (TDC). So the reciprocating motion created by a steadily rotating crank and connecting rod is approximately simple harmonic motion: :x = r \\\\cos \\\\alpha + l where x is the distance of the end of the connecting rod from the crank axle, l is the length of the connecting rod, r is the length of the crank, and Œ± is the angle of the crank measured from top dead center (TDC). Technically, the reciprocating motion of the connecting rod departs from sinusoidal motion due to the changing angle of the connecting rod during the cycle, the correct motion, given by the Piston motion equations is: :x = r \\\\cos \\\\alpha + \\\\sqrt{l^2 - r^2\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha} As long as the connecting rod is much longer than the crank l >> r the difference is negligible. This difference becomes significant in high-speed engines, which may need balance shafts to reduce the vibration due to this \\"secondary imbalance\\". The mechanical advantage of a crank, the ratio between the force on the connecting rod and the torque on the shaft, varies throughout the crank's cycle. The relationship between the two is approximately: :\\\\tau = Fr \\\\sin (\\\\alpha+\\\\beta) \\\\, where \\\\tau\\\\, is the torque and F is the force on the connecting rod. But in reality, the torque is maximum at crank angle of less than Œ± = 90¬∞ from TDC for a given force on the piston. One way to calculate this angle is to find out when the Connecting rod smallend (piston) speed becomes the fastest in downward direction given a steady crank rotational velocity. Piston speed x' is expressed as: :x' = (-r\\\\sin \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{r^2\\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\cos \\\\alpha}{\\\\sqrt{l^2-r^2\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha}})\\\\frac{d \\\\alpha}{dt} For example, for rod length 6\\" and crank radius 2\\", numerically solving the above equation finds the velocity minima (maximum downward speed) to be at crank angle of 73.17615¬∞ after TDC. Then, using the triangle sine law, it is found that the crank to connecting rod angle is 88.21738¬∞ and the connecting rod angle is 18.60647¬∞ from vertical (see Piston motion equations#Example). When the crank is driven by the connecting rod, a problem arises when the crank is at top dead centre (0¬∞) or bottom dead centre (180¬∞). At these points in the crank's cycle, a force on the connecting rod causes no torque on the crank. Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train. ===Design=== An in-line crank slider is oriented in a way in which the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke() of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, the time it takes to perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a reverse stroke. ===Graphical approach=== The graphical method of designing an in-line slider-crank mechanism involves the usage of hand-drawn or computerized diagrams. These diagrams are drawn to scale in order for easy evaluation and successful design. Basic trigonometry, the practice of analyzing the relationship between triangle features in order to determine any unknown values, can be used with a graphical compass and protractor alongside these diagrams to determine the required stroke or link lengths. When the stroke of a mechanism needs to be calculated, first identify the ground level for the specified slider-crank mechanism. This ground level is the axis on which both the crank arm pivot-point and the slider pin are positioned. Draw the crank arm pivot point anywhere on this ground level. Once the pin positions are correctly placed, set a graphical compass to the given link length of the crank arm. Positioning the compass point on the pivot point of the crank arm, rotate the compass to produce a circle with radius equal to the length of the crank arm. This newly drawn circle represents the potential motion of the crank arm. Next, draw two models of the mechanism. These models will be oriented in a way that displays both the extreme positions of the slider. Once both diagrams are drawn, the linear distance between the retracted slider and the extended slider can be easily measured to determine the slider-crank stroke. The retracted position of the slider is determined by further graphical evaluation. Now that the crank path is found, draw the crank slider arm in the position that places it as far away as possible from the slider. Once drawn, the crank arm should be coincident with the ground level axis that was initially drawn. Next, from the free point on the crank arm, draw the follower link using its measured or given length. Draw this length coincident with the ground level axis but in the direction toward the slider. The unhinged end of the follower will now be at the fully retracted position of the slider. Next, the extended position of the slider needs to be determined. From the pivot point of the crank arm, draw a new crank arm coincident with the ground level axis but in a position closest to the slider. This position should put the new crank arm at an angle of 180 degrees away from the retracted crank arm. Then draw the follower link with its given length in the same manner as previously mentioned. The unhinged point of the new follower will now be at the fully extended position of the slider. Both the retracted and extended positions of the slider should now be known. Using a measuring ruler, measure the distance between these two points. This distance will be the mechanism stroke, . ===Analytical approach=== To analytically design an in-line slider crank and achieve the desired stroke, the appropriate lengths of the two links, the crank and follower, need to be determined. For this case, the crank arm will be referred to as L2, and the follower link will be referred to as L3. With all in-line slider-crank mechanisms, the stroke is twice the length of the crank arm. Therefore, given the stroke, the length of the crank arm can be determined. This relationship is represented as: : Once L2 is found, the follower length (L3) can be determined. However, because the stroke of the mechanism only depends on the crank arm length, the follower length is somewhat insignificant. As a general rule, the length of the follower link should be at least 3 times the length of the crank arm. This is to account for an often undesired increased acceleration yield, or output, of the connecting arm. ==Offset slider-crank designAnalytical approach=== The analytical method for designing an offset crank slider mechanism is the process by which triangular geometry is evaluated in order to determine generalized relationships among certain lengths, distances, and angles. These generalized relationships are displayed in the form of 3 equations and can be used to determine unknown values for almost any offset slider-crank. These equations express the link lengths, L1, L2, and L3, as a function of the stroke,(ŒîR4)max, the imbalance angle, Œ≤, and the angle of an arbitrary line M, Œ∏M. Arbitrary line M is a designer-unique line that runs through the crank pivot point and the extreme retracted slider position. The 3 equations are as follows: : √ó : √ó : √ó With these relationships, the 3 link lengths can be calculated and any related unknown values can be determined. ==Slider-crank inversions== Close-up of the linear actuator of a back hoe that forms an inverted slider-crank. Slider-crank chain inversion arises when the connecting rod, or coupler, of a slider-crank linkage becomes the ground link, so the slider is connected directly to the crank. This inverted slider-crank is the form of a slider-crank linkage that is often used to actuate a hinged joint in construction equipment like a crane or backhoe, as well as to open and close a swinging gate or door.Design of Machinery 3/e, Robert L. Norton, 2 May 2003, McGraw Hill. J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, Geometric Design of Linkages, 2nd Edition, Springer 2010 A slider- crank is a four-bar linkage that has a crank that rotates coupled to a slider that the moves along a straight line. This mechanism is composed of three important parts: The crank which is the rotating disc, the slider which slides inside the tube and the connecting rod which joins the parts together. As the slider moves to the right the connecting rod pushes the wheel round for the first 180 degrees of wheel rotation. When the slider begins to move back into the tube, the connecting rod pulls the wheel round to complete the rotation. Different mechanism by fixing different link of slider crank chain are as follows : ;First inversion This inversion is obtained when link 1 (ground body) is fixed. Application- Reciprocating engine, Reciprocating compressor etc... ;Second inversion This inversion is obtained when link 2 (crank) is fixed. Application- Whitworth quick return mechanism, Rotary engine, etc... ;Third inversion This inversion is obtained when link 3 (connecting rod) is fixed. Application- Slotted crank mechanism, Oscillatory engine etc.., ;Fourth inversion This inversion is obtained when link 4 (slider) is fixed.

So several of its genera - including Jovellana - have been split off and assigned to new or existing families. ==Description== Jovellana currently contains six to eight species of mainly herbaceous perennials native to Chile and New Zealand. They have simple leaves and, in summer, nodding sprays of single, two-lipped, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, lilac and purple, heavily spotted with a contrasting colour inside. The following species are currently included:- *Jovellana albula (Chile) *Jovellana guentheri (Chile) *Jovellana petiolaris (Chile) *Jovellana punctata (Chile) *Jovellana repens (New Zealand) *Jovellana sinclairii (New Zealand) *Jovellana sturmii (Chile) *Jovellana violacea (Chile) ==Distribution== Authorities have commented on the disjunct nature of the two populations in Chile and New Zealand. However, this is not unique. Fuchsia is another genus with species apparently randomly segregated between Central and South America, New Zealand and Tahiti. ==Cultivation== At least three species are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. They are frost-hardy down to , but in cultivation they require a sheltered position in full sun. Jovellana violacea, growing to tall by broad, is a semi-evergreen subshrub with lilac coloured flowers, internally spotted with purple on a yellow background. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. ==Gallery== File:Jovellana punctata 001.jpgJovellana punctata File:Jovellana sinclairii kz4.jpgJ. sinclairii - leaf File:Jovellana violacea (17966578828).jpgJovellana violacea File:Jovellana violacea (8425622546).jpgJovellana violacea ==References== Category:Flora of Chile Category:Flora of New Zealand Category:Lamiales Category:Lamiales genera ","title":"Jovellana"},{"id":"56858823","text":"Maria Bogner (n√©e Lux, 1914 ‚Äì November 17, 2002) was a German fashion designer credited with developing practical stretch pants, thereby profoundly affecting the direction of the ski fashion industry. She created colorful, sexy, and functional stretchy skiwear. Her husband's established ski apparel company, the development of stretch material in the 1950s, and her sewing skills all contributed to her success. Her stretch pants, as modeled by leading ski athletes of the period, provided both sex appeal and practicality as ski garments. ==Personal life== Skiwear in the 1950s, prior to the adoption of stretch pants. Bogner was born Maria Lux in 1914 in Cologne, Germany and died on November 17, 2002 in Tegernsee, Germany. In 1937 she married Wilhelm Bogner (Willy Sr.), a German Nordic combined ski champion who competed in the 1930s. Together, they had three children, Rosemarie, Michael, and Wilhelm (Willy Jr.). Willy Bogner's success as a skier allowed him and his future wife, then Maria Lux, to establish a clothing line in 1932, that included outfitting the German national ski team at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Her husband died in 1977 and she died in 2002. ==Career== Skiing Magazine called Bogner, ‚Äúthe mother of modern ski fashion‚Äù, citing her outsized influence as a woman on ski culture. Her career began with the development of novel ski garments in the early 1930s and was interrupted by World War II. After the war her ski fashion innovations in style and color, especially with stretch pants, allowed the Bogner business to flourish in the upscale ski apparel market. ===1936-45=== In 1936 Bogner created an anorak (parka) for the German Olympic ski team of which her fianc√© was a member. After their marriage, Bogner became involved in the fashion side of her husband's business, which included importing ski equipment. In addition to ski apparel, they designed and manufactured blouses, traditional Bavarian dresses, as well as hiking apparel. The growth of their business was interrupted by WWII and her husband's internment by the US. ===1946-77=== Stein Eriksen and other skiers wearing stretch pants in 1967. While her husband was away and in order to support her three children, Bogner continued to design colorful anoraks that were sold by the thousands. In addition to creating and selling parkas, Bogner also began rebuilding the business by creating other products, such as aprons. In 1950, the Bogners began exporting their colorful products to the US, including Bogner's parkas. In 1955 Bogner began branding the company with a logo, styled as a ‚ÄúB‚Äù, on all zippers found on their clothing.  Development of stretch pants  In the early 1950s, the Bogners were manufacturing ski pants in gabardine fabric. They were distinctive both for their durability and the wide choice of bright, appealing colors‚Äîa break from the previous standards of black, blue and forest green. A Bianchini textile representative introduced Bogner to a new material, developed by the Swiss company, Heberlein, and marketed under the name, Helanca, which was incorporated into a prototype pair of ski pants. Helanca was a blend of wool and a springy, coiled nylon fiber, which allowed the material to stretch and be durable through multiple wash cycles. The problem was how to sew it successfully, which Bogner solved. Early examples of her stretch pants lost their resiliency after a few seasons. This problem was solved such that by 1955, she was exporting them to the US in 42 different colors. The pants were highly successful, despite costing double what conventional ski pants cost at the time, thanks to the sex appeal of their form-fitting cut and wide variety of colors. The product was marketed effectively in catalogs and advertisements, using attractive young women and celebrity athletes, such as Stein Eriksen, as models. Business expansion and retirement The publicity and advertising of the Bogner line of up- scale fashion made it the choice of such celebrity consumers of ski apparel as, Marilyn Monroe, Ingrid Bergman, the Shah of Iran, and Toni Sailer. Bogner apparel was also in demand by ski teams for its aerodynamic efficiency and warmth. By the mid-1960s many other companies were producing stretch pants. Bogner remained active in the company until the early 1970s, when her sons, Michael and Willy Jr., took over the business. ==Legacy== Bogner's creation was so widely recognized that she was featured on the cover of the November, 1955 issue of Ski Magazine, wearing her ski apparel. In its 1995 \\"Skiing for Women\\" issue, Skiing magazine cited Bogner as a skiing \\"legend\\", along with Andrea Mead Lawrence and Martha Rockwell ==References * *Bogner company history at official website *Image of Bogner modeling her anorak at Bogner site Category:1914 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Clothing brands of Germany Category:German fashion designers Category:Businesspeople from Cologne ","title":"Maria Bogner"},{"id":"56858825","text":"Sam Daley-Harris is an American activist and author. He is the founder of Results, and has been a hunger eradication advocate and democracy activist since the mid-1970s. Daley-Harris is also the author of Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government. ==Early career== Early in his life, Sam Daley-Harris was a music teacher, and was a percussionist for the Miami Philharmonic. ==Activism== During the 1970s Daley- Harris became involved in the movement to eradicate global hunger. During this process he spoke with about seven thousand high-school students, at which time he discovered that only 3% of the youth knew the name of their congressperson. In response, he founded an organization called Results (stylized: RESULTS), which is an acronym for \\"Responsibility for Ending Starvation Using Legislation, Trimtabbing, and Support\\". After working with other anti-hunger organizations like Bread for the World, he founded the organization in 1980, which recruited and trained volunteers to lobby the government on food security and hunger issues. Tactics have included sit-down meetings with politicians, generating supportive media, and letter writing campaigns. The organization has also helped advocate for global vaccination campaigns with UNICEF, and worked in promoting micro-lending. Muhammad Yunus said of Results' work in micro-lending that, ‚ÄúNo other organization has been as critical a partner in seeing to it that micro-credit is used as a tool to eradicate poverty and empower women.‚Äù Daley-Harris has also served as the director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign, where he advocated for the role of microcredit in combating poverty. The Microcredit Summit Campaign tracked the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of microfinance organizations. He later founded the organization Center for Citizen Empowerment and Transformation, which provides consultations to organizations on the subject of ‚Äúdeep advocacy‚Äù, a method of working with politicians and the media to fuel advocacy efforts for social issues. The organization later changed its name to Civic Courage. He has also worked with Citizens' Climate Lobby. ==Writing== Sam Daley-Harris is the author of the book Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government, which at the end of the book outlines thirteen ‚Äúprinciples of action‚Äù, and uses case-studies of successful advocacy to show evidence of their efficacy. Many of the case-studies come from Daley-Harris‚Äô work as the head of Results. The original version was published in 1993, and a twentieth anniversary edition was published in 2013 with a foreword by Muhammad Yunus.

She is a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from the 99th District, serving since 2017. State Rep. Lopez Romero currently serves on the State House Education, Retirement, and State Planning and Community Affairs committees. Lopez Romero has sponsored 72 bills. She is a member of the Democratic party. After weeks of lobbying by the Latino Victory Fund, Georgia Assembly House Minority Leader Bob Trammell and other public figures in the state, Lopez Romero launched her campaign for Georgia's 7th Congressional District on May 1, 2019. == Early life, Education, and Career == Lopez Romero was born in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca and came to the United States at the age of five. In 2008, after years of waiting on a backlog, Lopez Romero became a U.S. Citizen. She graduated from Cross Keys High School in DeKalb County. After becoming the first in her family to graduate high school, Lopez Romero earned a bachelor's degree in political science and sociology from Georgia State University in 2005. She then went on to receive her Juris Doctor, with a concentration in National Security and Counterterrorism, from Syracuse University College of Law. Before graduating law school in 2011, Lopez Romero served as a law clerk for the Farmworker's Division of the Georgia Legal Services Program; she then clerked for the ACLU of Georgia's National Security and Immigrant Rights Project. In 2011, after being admitted to the State Bar of Georgia, Lopez Romero managed the immigration department for the Velasquez Law Firm, LLC. In 2012, through her role as a staff attorney for Catholic Charities' Immigration Legal Services, Lopez Romero represented numerous low-income immigrants and families in times of crisis. In 2013, she opened her own law firm in Norcross, Georgia primarily dealing with immigration matters. == Georgia House of Representatives  2016 and 2018 Campaigns === In 2016, Lopez Romero ran to represent Georgia's 99th State House District in the General Assembly. After beating Jay Trevari in the Democratic Primary, Lopez Romero won 100% of the vote in the general election and became the first Latina elected to the state's legislature. In 2018, Lopez Romero ran for re-election to the State House; she handily beat her primary opponent, Shawn Allen, winning 77% of the vote. She again ran unopposed in the general election and was subsequently re- elected with 100% of the vote. === Legislative Tenure === Since first being sworn in 2017, Lopez Romero has served on the Education, Retirement, and State Planning and community Affairs committees. She has sponsored, or co-authored, 72 bills since taking office.  HB 481  Lopez Romero was opposed to and voted against 2019's HB 481, which sought to ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat was detected. She, along with several other lawmakers, brought coathangers onto the House floor to show her opposition to the controversial bill.  HB 896  In 2020, Lopez Romero, along with several other legislators, introduced HB 896; the bill seeks to allow high school graduates in Georgia to receive in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status. If passed, Georgia would be the 20th state to enact such a law. == 2020 Congressional Campaign == On May 1, 2019, Lopez Romero announced that she would not seek re-election to the State House and would instead be vying to finally flip Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Upon announcing she said, \\"We have a unique opportunity to elect someone who reflects the values and the rich diversity of our district...I know that I am the right person for the job.‚Äù Soon after announcing, she was endorsed by Georgia Assembly Minority Leader Bob Trammell, Chair of the Gwinnett House Delegation Rep. Pedro Marin, Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education Board Chair Jason Esteves, Georgia Assembly House Democratic Chair James Beverly, and several other major figures in the state. After the June 9, 2020 election, numerous media outlets had initially declared that the primary would be going to a runoff between Lopez Romero and Carolyn Bourdeaux; however, after tens of thousands of absentee ballots were counted, Bourdeaux was declared to have won the primary outright. In her concession statement, Brenda Lopez Romero stated, \\"I am about to walk into legislative session and just walked out of our streets as I protested and stated that #BlackLivesMatter, this impresses upon me how vital our work is and that there is still a great deal to do for our state and country. As I finish up my last term in the state legislature (for now), I will continue to fight for the hate crimes bill and justice-for-all legislation, push back against cuts to our education budget, and reform our state‚Äôs election laws so every citizen can exercise their sacred right to vote with ease and security. Furthermore, I will concentrate on supporting efforts to flip the 16 state house seats we need in order to prevent disastrous gerrymandering in 2021....No one is voiceless. Rather, there are those whose voices are always heard and those whose voices continue to be ignored. It is my goal to magnify the voices and perspectives of those who are ignored.\\" == Honors and Awards == The Georgia Association of Educators' gave Lopez Romero the 2017 Friend of Education Award. In 2019, she was recognized as one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. She was also one of 21 women to have been selected as one of the Atlanta Business Chronicle's 2019 Women Who Mean Business honorees.

The film is propelled by the sonorous, magnetic acting of then-30-year old Ed Hood interacting with the dumb blonde Hustler, Paul America. Joe Campbell (\\"Sugar Plum Fairy\\"), Genevieve Charbin and Dorothy Dean also compete for the attentions of the Hustler and provide foils for the interaction of the main characters. The erudite and very funny Hood, a perpetual graduate student in English at Harvard and \\"live parody of southern gentility\\" Watson, p. 62 , was recruited by Chuck Wein. Hood's magnetic performance was driven by his deep, mellifluous voice, trained by elocution lessons as a privileged child in Alabama, and lubricated copiously by alcohol. Among his many peculiarities was his habit of drinking beer from the bottle, not by placing the bottle to his lips, but into his mouth, sucking on it, as seen in the film. ==Production== The film is a collaboration between Warhol, Chuck Wein and Paul Morrissey, with Morrissey as camera and audio operator and Wein credited as director, Escoffier, p. 24 and was filmed over Labor Day Weekend, 1965, on Fire Island, NY.\\"My Hustler\\", \\"Warholstars.org\\" _My Hustler_ is the first Warhol film worked on by Paul Morrissey, who introduced, in this fim, camera movement and audible sound to Warhol's cinematography.

After 1984, with Warhol's approval, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum \\"agreed to collaborate on the largest archival research project in the history of American avant-garde cinema: to catalogue Warhol‚Äôs massive film collection, investigate its history, and preserve and re-release all of the films in conjunction with a program of scholarly research and publication.\\" Since 1988, _My Hustler_ has been screened several times at both museums, but, like other Warhol films, has never been commercially released on DVD or other medium. \\"The Andy Warhol Film Project\\" ==ReceptionBox office=== _My Hustler_ was the first Warhol film to make any money, grossing $4,000 from its initial run at the Filmmaker's Cinematheque.Bockris, P. 250 At the Hudson theater in New York, it grossed $52,400 in its first 3 weeks. ===Critical reception=== A common expression at the time of the films initial release was one of revulsion; viz. Bosley Crowther: \\"It is sordid, vicious and contemptuous. The only thing engaging about it is a certain quality and tone of degradation that is almost too candid and ruthless to be believed.\\"BOSLEY CROWTHER. New York Times. [New York, N.Y]11 July 1967: 29. A few years later the revolutionary nature of _My Hustler_ was being recognized; Vincent Canby, in somewhat backwards and grudging praise, complained that distributors were taking his critical remarks out of context and using them as advertising come- ons: \\"Warhol, of course, is responsible for one of the toughest dilemmas facing critics today. Largely as a result of his pioneering in the making of movies like _Chelsea Girls_ and _My Hustler_ it's impossible to accurately describe many new movies without automatically writing phrases that can't be picked up and used as instant come-ons,\\"VINCENT CANBY. New York Times New York, N.Y, 03 Aug 1969: D1 By 1995 the critical perspective of Warhol's most influential films, including _My Hustler_ had shifted to an appreciation of their unique, semi-documentary perspective; Stephen Holden: \\"The esthetic running through Warhol's films is an icy voyeurism. As witty or sexy or photogenic as Warhol's superstars may have been, their largely unstructured, crudely edited play-acting in front of his camera could also be cruelly revealing. Again and again one has the feeling of confronting people with limited internal resources, desperate to be noticed at any cost.\\"\\"For Warhol, to Be Was to Be on Screen\\" Holden, Stephen, New York Times; Jan 27, 1995 ==Censorship== _My Hustler_ was the subject of plainclothes police surveillance in the audience during its initial theatrical release in 1966, and on April 12 the owners of the Filmmakers' Cinematheque were served a summons to a hearing to show-cause why the theater's license should not be revoked for showing films of \\"sexual immorality, lewdness, perversion and homosexuality.\\" On November 16, after a defense by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the charges were thrown out.The New York Times, April 13, 1966 p. 36; Nov. 17, 1966 p. 54. ==See also== *List of American films of 1965 *Andy Warhol filmography ==References== Bibliography * Escoffier, Jeffrey.

He was educated in Putney at the school of Reverend William Carmalt. In 1836, he married Frances, daughter of Thomas Drake, and they had eight children: two sons and six daughters. ==Legal career== The Hon. Mr. Baron Pigott - The Illustrated London News (1863) Pigott launched his legal career in 1836 when he entered the Middle Temple, and three years later he was called to the bar and entered the Oxford circuit. There, he worked with H Rodwell to serialise reports of appeals from revising barristers between 1844 and 1846. In 1854, he was made counsel to the Inland Revenue and in 1856, he became serjeant, receiving a patent of precedence the following year. From December 1857 to December 1862, he was recorder of Hereford. Pigott was made a Baron of the Court of the Exchequer on 3 October 1863, and was knighted on 1 November. The appointment was initially received with disfavour by the bar, but he became well-liked and recognised for strict impartiality and conscientiousness in his arbitration. ==Political career== Pigott first launched his bid for a seat in the House of Commons in 1859, when he stood for Banbury; he retired before polling day.

The museum is located on the northern periphery of Deer Lake Park, situated off of Deer Lake Avenue. The museum occupies Fairacres Mansion, a historic residence designated as a historic site by the provincial government. The institution was established through a private association in 1967, who used the publicly owned Fairacres Mansion to exhibit its collection. The association continued to manage the museum until 1998, when the municipal government of Burnaby assumed control of the museum's collections, and governance. The museum's permanent collection includes over 5,000, largely made up of works on paper. ==Scope of operation== The gallery is the only public gallery in Canada devoted to works on paper. Established in 1967, the Burnaby Art Gallery has been dedicated to collecting, preserving and presenting a contemporary and historical visual art program by local, national and internationally recognized artists. The Burnaby Art Gallery cares for and manages over 5,500 works of art in the City of Burnaby's Permanent Art Collection. Located at 6344 Deer Lake Avenue, the Burnaby Art Gallery is operated by the City of Burnaby. == Building history == The Burnaby Art Gallery is located in Fairacres Mansion, which was designed by Robert Percival Sterling Twizellhttp://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1373 (1875-1964). Fairacres Mansion, also called Ceperley House, for its original owners, was built in 1910 at an estimated cost of C$150,000.00, making it the largest and most expensive house in Burnaby, BC of its time. It was constructed in the Edwardian Arts and Crafts style with handmade fixtures, carpentry and tiled fireplaces. The grounds included horse stables, an aviary, gazebo and pergola, lagoons, strawberry fields, greenhouses, a steam plant and a gardener's cottage. The tiles throughout the house were imported from England, fabricated by Conrad Dressler and his Medmenham Pottery. In the former billiards room and parlour, a grand oak mantelpiece, hand-carved by George Selkirk Gibson, bears a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: \\"The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it.\\" On the death of the original owner, Grace Ceperley, the house was sold to a series of private owners. In 1939, it was acquired by Benedictine monks, and became an Abbey in 1953. The Order vacated the house in 1954 when it moved to Westminster Abbey (British Columbia) in Mission. After the Benedictines sold the property, it was used by the Canadian Temple of More Abundant Life and as a fraternity house for Simon Fraser University's Delta Upsilon Fraternity. In 1966, the Burnaby Art Society, led by Jack Hardman, Sheila Kincaid and Winifred Denny, among others, worked with the City of Burnaby to purchase the site for C$166,000.00. The Burnaby Art Gallery opened its doors in June 1967. == Permanent collection == The Burnaby Art Gallery manages a collection of over 5,500 objects, largely made up of works on paper (particularly original hand pulled prints) by Canadian artists. Highlights include substantial holdings by Ernest Lumsden, Jack Shadbolt, Takao Tanabe, Laurence Hyde, Gathie Falk, Sylvia Tait, Ann Kipling, Alistair Bell, Kate Craig, Al Neil and Molly Lamb Bobak. ==See also== *Burnaby Village Museum in the same park == References  External links == * Category:Art galleries established in 1967 Category:Tourist attractions in Burnaby Category:Buildings and structures in Burnaby Category:1967 establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Burnaby Art Gallery"},{"id":"56859006","text":"\\"High Flying Bird\\" (sometimes \\"High Flyin' Bird\\") is a song written by American folk and country singer-songwriter Billy Edd Wheeler, and first recorded by Judy Henske in 1963.

They were seen by songwriter Ed E. Miller, the credited co-writer of the Serendipity Singers' hit \\"Don't Let the Rain Come Down\\". In early 1964, Miller was preparing a revue, America Sings, which chronicled the history of folk music in America, and suggested that the four, together with an existing group, the Bay Singers - Roy Michaels, Mike Scott, Fred Geiger and Jean Gurney - and Michaels' girlfriend Kathy King, provide the music in the show. Although the show only ran for two weeks, Miller secured a contract with Roulette Records for the nine-strong group to record an album, which they did with producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore. After seeing the show, club owner Howard Solomon signed the group for a residency at his Cafe au Go Go nightclub on Bleecker Street. Bruce Eder, \\"The Au Go Go Singers\\", Allmusic.com.

A second album never appeared; some members received draft notices; and Kathy King, who suffered from stage fright, decided to leave. In 1965, the group disbanded.

In March 2018 the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, claimed to have been informed by British authorities that A-234 had been identified as the agent used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Vladimir Uglev, one of the inventors of the Novichok series of compounds, said he was \\"99 per cent sure that it was A-234\\" in relation to the 2018 Amesbury poisonings, noting its unusually high persistence in the environment.Harvey SP, McMahon LR, Berg FJ. Hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation of Novichok nerve agents. Heliyon. 2020 Jan 7;6(1):e03153. According to a classified report by the United States Army National Ground Intelligence Center, the agent designated as A-232 and its ethyl analog A-234, developed under the FOLIANT program, \\"are as toxic as VX, as resistant to treatment as soman, and more difficult to detect and easier to manufacture than VX\\". Of the agent's binary versions, one is reportedly formed by acetonitrile and an organic phosphate \\"that can be disguised as a pesticide precursor,\\" while for another, Bill Gertz wrote, \\"soldiers need only add alcohol\\". No certain data on toxicity exist but it is estimated that the median lethal concentration of A-234 is 7 mg/m3. This means that half of 70 kg men under slight physical activitybreathing 15 litres of air per minutewould die within two minutes of exposure. This equates to median lethal dose of 0.2 mg via respiration. == Regulated chemical under the Chemical Weapons Convention == A-234 has recently (entry into force 7 June 2020) been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14.

She left the University of Michigan to pursue a master's degree in nursing education. After graduating, she became a faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles. She was the head of the Western Council on Higher Education for Nursing from 1957 to 1980. This council was a collection of over 150 schools of nursing across 13 states. She advocated for continuing education, graduate education, and basic education for nurses; and helped to cultivate loans and scholarships for nurses. Her work with the Western Council on Higher Education for Nursing was perhaps the first work done in evaluation of continuing education in the United States. The council launched a 12-year initiative for continuing education for nurses. Over 3,000 nurses completed continuing education programs through the council. Elliott also participated in numerous research projects and conferences about higher education for nurses. She developed many of her plans in collaboration with Lulu Wolf Hassenplug, who worked then at the University of California, Los Angeles and Pearl Coulter, who worked at the University of Arizona. Elliott considered Hassenplug to be her mentor in her endeavors for advocating for continuing education. Elliott served as the president of the American Nursing Association from 1964 until 1968. She helped to advocate support for Medicare in the United States. In 1964, she helped to pass the Nurse Training Act to Aid Professional Nursing Education. In 1965, Elliott along with the American Nursing Association controversially advocated for nurses to have at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing, and an associate degree for technical nursing. Elliott argued that this was essential for the field of nursing to evolve with the needs of patients, and scientific knowledge, in mind. Also in 1965, she was present when the Medicare bill was signed into law. She also helped to set minimum salaries for nurses, devised a revised Code for Nurses, helped to overhaul the structure of the American Nursing Association, established practice divisions in the American Nursing Association, and created the Congress on Nursing Practice. She was re-elected head of the American Nursing Association on June 17, 1966. Elliott was the United States' Department of Health And Human Services's director of the Division of Nursing from 1980 - 1989. Elliott headed the International Council of Nurses from 1965 until 1969. Elliott was a member of Sigma Theta Tau. She taught at several universities, including the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Texas, San Antonio, Loyola University Chicago, and The University of Michigan. ==Honors== In 1966, Elliott was named a Woman of Achievement in the first annual Colorado Woman of Achievement ceremony. She was one of three selected out of a pool of 102 women throughout Colorado that were nominated. In 1974, Elliott received an honor for Distinguished Leadership in Continuing Education in Nursing at the Sixth National Conference on Continuing Education in Nursing. She was nominated for this award by her peers in the field. In 1987, she received a Distinguished Alumni Athena Award from the University of Michigan. In 1997, the American Academy of Nursing named Elliott a Living Legend, which is the organization's highest award. The University of Michigan established the Jo Eleanor Elliott Scholarship Fund in their school of nursing. In 1988, the Western Institute of Nursing established the Jo Eleanor Elliott Leadership Award, which has been awarded continuously every year since. In 2010, then-President Barack Obama praised her for her lifelong contributions to, and advocacy for, healthcare. In 2010, the National League for Nursing gave her the \\"President's Award: Champion in the Shaping of Nursing Education.\\" Elliott was the recipient of six honorary doctorates. She also received the American Nursing Association's Distinguished Membership Award. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Pettis County, Missouri Category:University of Michigan alumni ","title":"Jo Eleanor Elliott"},{"id":"56859136","text":"A234 or A-234 may refer to: * A234 road, England * A234 highway (Nigeria) * A-234 (nerve agent), a Novichok agent * ASTM A234, an ASTM International standard for steel ==See also== * Article 234 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community * 234, a year ","title":"A234"},{"id":"56859138","text":"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections (also abbreviated as Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent Elections or simply Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions) was a report issued by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence that made an assessment of the extent and basis of Russia's interference in United States' elections in 2016. Published on January 6, 2017, the report includes an appraisal by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the type and breadth of actions undertaken by Russia and affiliated elements during the elections. The report examines Russia's utilization of cyberspace such as hacking and the use of internet trolls and bots, and an intensive media campaign to influence public opinion in the United States. Additionally, it analyzes Russia's intentions and motivations in regards to their influence campaign. Issued in two forms, a classified version and a declassified version, the report drew its conclusions based on highly classified intelligence, an understanding of past Russian actions, and sensitive sources and methods. ==Background== Between 2015 and 2016, computer hackers affiliated with Russian intelligence breached the Democratic National Committee and began scoping its servers and lifting large amounts of data in the form of e-mails, donor lists, opposition research, etc. This information was published during the summer of 2016 by DCLeaks and WikiLeaks. In March 2016, John Podesta, the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, was the target of a spear-phishing attack which stole more than 20,000 pages of e-mails that were subsequently dumped by WikiLeaks later in the fall of 2016. On October 7, 2016, roughly one month before Election Day, the Department of Homeland Security in conjunction with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the independent agency charged with overseeing and integrating the U.S. Intelligence Community, released a statement expressing confidence that the Russian government was attempting to influence the upcoming election. The statement accused Russia of hacking and disseminating e-mails, and probing election databases, reading \\"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\\" Two months after the election, on December 9, outgoing President Barack Obama directed intelligence agencies to conduct a \\"full review\\" of Russian influence operations on the U.S. electoral process back to 2008. A preliminary Joint Analysis Report (JAR) was released by the DHS and FBI on December 29, which provided specific details on the type of cyber-tools and infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence services in compromising and exploiting American systems. ==Contents== The version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections released for public consumption contained the same conclusions as the classified version, however, complete supporting information for the claims made in the public report was omitted due to its classified nature. The intelligence used was compiled by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA), and throughout the report confidence-levels by the agencies relating to specific claims were measured. In the report, it is explicitly made known that the U.S. Intelligence Community only analyzed and monitored the intentions, capabilities, and actions of the Russian government, and not what, if any, impact their influence campaign had on U.S. public opinion or the U.S. political process. Much of the content was focused on RT, the Kremlin-funded television network, and its purported role in attempting to manipulate U.S. public opinion and discourse. The report was the most detailed public collection of Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections released as of January 2017. According to CNN, the CIA and FBI took Steele's dossier \\"seriously enough that they kept it out of\\" the January 6, 2017, assessment \\"in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how.\\" ===Russian actions in the 2016 election=== * The Russian influence campaign was directly ordered by Vladimir Putin with the intention of promoting and increasing the electoral-chances of then-candidate Donald Trump while discrediting Hillary Clinton. The CIA and FBI made this claim with \\"high confidence\\" while the NSA displayed \\"moderate confidence.\\" * The Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Russia's military intelligence service, used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to disseminate information gained from the compromise of Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers. This claim was made in \\"high confidence\\" by the agencies. * Multiple state election databases were accessed and probed by Russian intelligence, however the Department of Homeland Security has confirmed the systems involved in vote tallying were not compromised. * Putin had a personal preference for candidate-Trump due to his advocacy of Russia-friendly policies in Ukraine and Syria on the campaign trail, and his stated desire for a closer relationship with Moscow. * Immediately after the election, Russian government officials halted their characterizations of the U.S. election processes as unfair due to their belief that doing so would have hampered the possibility of warm relations with the incoming administration. * The tactics used to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election are the result of \\"years of investment\\" by Russia which has employed similar tactics in former Soviet republics, allowing them to sharpen their skills. * Russian intelligence services gained entry into the servers of the Democratic National Committee as early as July 2015, and the GRU began cyber operations oriented at the U.S. election as early as March 2016. In May, hackers \\"exfiltrated large volumes\\" of data from the DNC. * Guccifer 2.0, DCLeaks, and WikiLeaks were used by Russia as intermediaries to publicly release \\"victim data\\" obtained from U.S. targets. WikiLeaks was purportedly chosen by Moscow for this task due to its \\"self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity\\", though no data leaked to the organization contained \\"evident forgeries.\\" * RT (formerly Russia Today) actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. In 2013, the news agency's editor-in-chief visited the Ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange resides to negotiate a possible contract renewal and RT routinely gave Assange \\"sympathetic coverage\\" and a \\"platform to denounce the United States.\\" * Russia gathered information on Republican political targets during the course of the election cycle but withheld that information from the public. * Russian state media arms such as RT, Sputnik, and a web of Internet trolls consistently praised candidate-Trump while providing negative coverage of his opponent, Clinton. The media outlets targeted U.S. domestic audiences using English language mediums to portray candidate-Trump in a positive light and disparage U.S. media coverage of him as prejudiced and motivated by their commitment to the American political establishment. * RT published a variety of anti-Clinton material throughout the election cycle intended to disparage Hillary Clinton. Among them were videos titled \\"How 100% of the Clintons' 'Charity' Went to‚Ä¶Themselves,\\" and \\"Clinton and ISIS Funded by the Same Money.\\" * Before Election Day, Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky proclaimed that Russia would \\"drink champagne\\" in the event of a Trump victory, due to the anticipation of Russia being able to move on its positions in Ukraine and Syria. * One of the main propagators of Russian interference was the Saint Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), a troll farm financed by a Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence services. Some of the trolls at the IRA had previously been used to advocate online for pro-Russia causes in Ukraine. ===RT-specific assessments=== * RT America escalated its anti-U.S. rhetoric in the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election, labeling the U.S.'s electoral system as \\"undemocratic\\" and encouraged Americans to revolt and \\"take this government back.\\" During the 2012 election, RT ran a multitude of segments alleging voter machine vulnerabilities, widespread voter fraud, and aired two new shows which overtly criticized the United States and the Western institutions while promoting \\"radical content.\\" * In November 2012, RT ran a documentary about the Occupy Wall Street movement which characterized the movement as a struggle against the \\"ruling class\\" and reiterated calls for Americans to \\"take back\\" the government, claiming that the only method of changing the U.S. government was through revolution. * Anti-fracking has been a popular talking point for RT, likely an indicator of the Russian government's fear that an increase in fracking could lead to an expanded U.S. natural gas market, threatening Russia's stake in the industry. * During the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, RT claimed the Georgian government was killing civilians and orchestrating a genocide in South Ossetia ===Russian government intentions in the 2016 election=== The report affirmed that numerous past incidents had motivated the Russian government to wage an influence operation in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Vladimir Putin believed that Russia was being demeaned on the international stage by a series of scandals he publicly attributed to the United States, such as the Olympic doping scandal and the Panama Papers. Putin sought to use the leaks of politically damaging material in the U.S. as a method of tarnishing the image of the United States. In addition, Putin also held a personal vendetta against former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for what he saw as her personal hand in a series of protests in Russia from 2011 to 2012 as well as remarks by Clinton that Putin held were maligning. According to the report, when a Clinton victory appeared likely, Russia shifted its strategy from aiding Trump's candidacy to sabotaging Clinton's legitimacy, and questioning the trustworthiness of the election. Notably, the Putin government also surmised that their actions would contribute to Russia's aim of threatening and eroding the \\"US-led liberal democratic order\\" which Russia views as a threat to its country and the regime. ==Release and reception== Director of National Intelligence James Clapper On the afternoon of January 6, 2017, the ODNI published the declassified edition of the report titled Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, less than one month after the Obama administration had requested a thorough review. Earlier in the day, FBI director James Comey, CIA director John Brennan, NSA director Mike Rogers, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed President-elect Donald Trump on the classified findings of the intelligence community during a meeting at Trump Tower, and then Comey privately briefed Trump about the most salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. On Tuesday, January 4, Trump tweeted that \\"the briefing was delayed until Friday\\", even though no briefing had been scheduled for Tuesday, and he insinuated that information was being withheld from him. After being briefed, Trump called the meeting \\"constructive\\" but Comey would later claim that Trump's reaction had disturbed him, compelling him to document the conversation in a memo. The next day, Trump issued a statement claiming \\"Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results,\\" which some have called a contradiction of the report's insistence that it had not undertaken an analysis of the effect of Russia's influence campaign on voters and public opinion. However, the report also indicates that Russian actions were limited to influence and propaganda, not the voting process itself. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan acknowledged meddling but insisted that \\"We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect's victory.\\" House Minority Leader and Gang of Eight member Nancy Pelosi called the report \\"really quite a stunning disclosure\\" and advocated for further declassification and congressional investigation. The Wall Street Journal accentuated the report's \\"surprisingly detailed findings\\" while The Washington Post' called it a \\"remarkably blunt assessment.\\" An editorial in The Moscow Times accused the report of containing blatant falsities and highlighted the fact that it had intentionally omitted supporting evidence and dedicated a large fraction of its content to scrutinizing RT. Reporter Glenn Greenwald labeled the report \\"flimsy\\" and questioned why it contained \\"old, public- source information\\" in reference to RT. Unclassified Summary of Initial Findings on 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment released by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence The Senate Intelligence Committee performed an in-depth review of the report and released their initial findings in July 2018. The committee found the report to be \\"a sound intelligence product.\\" ==See also== * 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak * Cyberwarfare by Russia * Links between Trump associates and Russian officials * Podesta emails * RT (TV network) * Special Counsel investigation (2017‚Äìpresent) ==References * Category:Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Category:Trump administration controversies Category:Foreign electoral intervention Category:Reports of the United States government Category:2017 documents ","title":"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections"},{"id":"56859140","text":"The Oluf Larsen House, at 75 S. 100 West in Ephraim, Utah, is a historic pair- house which was built in 1870.

Founded by attorney Ferdinand Barnett in 1878, it was the first African-American newspaper in Chicago. ==History== Barnett founded the newspaper in 1878 and served as co- editor with R. P. Bird. A.T. Hall served as the paper's city editor during its early years and was in charge of the office. During his tenure as editor, Barnett used the newspaper to campaign for the capitalization of the word \\"Negro\\". The Conservator focused mainly on editorials and commentary, although it did feature factual news pieces. It also published stories chronicling activities at local churches, social clubs and black fraternal organizations. Alexander Clark and his son Alexander Clark, Jr. purchased the Conservator in 1882 and owned it until 1887. In 1884, Alexander Clark Sr. began editing the paper himself. In 1893, Ida B. Wells began writing for the newspaper. She later purchased a partial ownership in the publication. She married Barnett in 1895 and then took over full ownership of the Conservator. She was the editor from 1895 to 1897. After Wells retired to raise her children, D. Robert Wilkins became the editor of the Conservator. He was a proponent of the Niagara Movement, and the paper became very critical of Booker T. Washington under Wilkins' tenure. Washington was so upset that he gave money to W. Allison Sweeney, the editor of the Chicago Leader, one of the Conservator's rival publications, hoping to put Wilkins out of business. When that did not work, he tried unsuccessfully to buy the paper. In January 1908, Wilkins was replaced by Jesse Max Barber, the former editor of The Voice of the Negro, who had moved to Chicago from Atlanta following the Atlanta race riot. After Barber penned a negative editorial concerning Washington, he used his influence with the Conservator's stockholders to have Barber fired. Monroe Alpheus Majors, a supporter of Washington, became the editor of the Conservator in 1908 and served in that position until 1911.

The film centers on Capone after his 11-year sentence at Atlanta Penitentiary, as he suffers from neurosyphilis and dementia while living in Florida. Linda Cardellini, Jack Lowden, Noel Fisher, Kyle MacLachlan, and Matt Dillon also star in supporting roles. First announced in October 2016, production on the film did not begin until March 2018, lasting through May in Louisiana. Originally intended to have a theatrical release, it was released through Premium VOD by Redbox Entertainment and Vertical Entertainment on May 12, 2020. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with Hardy's performance being praised but Trank's script being criticized. == Plot == Once the most feared bootlegger in Chicago, mobster Al Capone is finally brought down when he is successfully prosecuted for tax evasion. At the age of 40, following nearly a decade of imprisonment, he is released after the government deems him to no longer be a threat as his mind is slowly rotting from untreated neurosyphilis. Now retired and living with his family in Palm Island, Florida, Capone remains under surveillance by FBI agents, as they think he may be faking his insanity. Forced to sell many of his remaining belongings to pay old debts and support himself, Capone begins to have hallucinations and loses control of his motor functions as his disease progresses. He acknowledges that he hid $10 million before he was convicted, although he cannot remember where it is. After Capone, whose memory is nearly gone, has a physical confrontation with his wife Mae, she instructs her husband's bodyguards to keep everyone away from him. Meanwhile, Capone has increasingly debilitating visions of the men he killed and many of the violent acts he committed throughout his life. His mental capacity continues to deteriorate, until a psychiatrist hired to evaluate him declares that his IQ is no more than that of a child. Wracked with guilt, and having alienated all around him, Capone eventually dies of complications from his syphilis in January 1947 at the age of 48. His surviving family changes their name from Capone, and the money he allegedly hid away has never been recovered. == Cast == *Christopher Bianculli as Young Tony == Production == It was announced in October 2016 that Tom Hardy would star as Al Capone in the film, then known as Fonzo, which would be directed, written and edited by Josh Trank. Filming was initially eyed to begin in the summer of 2017, with Hardy stating it would be released sometime in 2018. Hardy instead ended up filming Venom in 2017, and in March 2018 announced Fonzo as his next project. Later that month, Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, Kathrine Narducci, Jack Lowden, Noel Fisher and Tilda Del Toro joined the cast. Filming began on March 19, 2018 in New Orleans, and lasted through May 15.https://www.sagaftra.org/files/new_orleans_production_update_2-20-18.pdf On April 15, 2020, the trailer was released with its new title, Capone. EL-P composed the film score. Milan Records has released the soundtrack. == Release == On May 12, 2020 Vertical Entertainment released the film digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium video on demand. The film was originally set to have a theatrical release, but these plans changed due to movie theater closures that started in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The film received a theatrical release in several regions such as Iceland, Lithuania and Portugal, where it has grossed a combined $112,116. == Reception VOD sales=== In its first few days of release, Capone was the number-two rented film on iTunes. Over its first weekend, it ranked third on iTunes and fourth on both FandangoNow and Google Play. Over its first ten days the film made $2.5 million from digital sales, a record for Vertical Entertainment. IndieWire called the results \\"quite good\\" but \\"far from being a money-[maker]\\", saying that Vertical would see about 75% of the initial gross ($1.5 million), and that the film could leg out to $4‚Äì5 million in sales. In its second weekend of release the film fell to 11th on iTunes and seventh on Fandango. The weekend of August 7, upon lowering the price to $0.99, the film was the second-most rented on the iTunes Store and Apple TV. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 4.88/10. The website's consensus reads: \\"Tom Hardy makes the most of his opportunity to tackle a challenging role, but Capone is too haphazardly constructed to support his fascinating performance.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Writing for TheWrap, Steve Pond said: \\"It's nuts, it's a mess and it's pretty damn entertaining if you don't mind characters pooping the bed and getting stabbed in the neck\\", saying that \\"Tom Hardy laughs in the face of conventional notions of good v. bad acting.\\" Scout Tafoya writing for Consequence of Sound gave the film an A- grade and noted that \\"Somehow, Trank had energy left over, despite wrangling one of the most eccentric performers working, to make a satisfying haunted house film as well\\" and called it \\"one of the most bravely singular and uncommon films you'll see this year.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \\"the last half hour of The Irishman crossed with the doddering-legend parts of Citizen Kane\\" and said that Hardy gives \\"a mumbly Method showboat performance that's authentic on the surface, but there isn't enough beneath the mob mannerisms.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C-\\" grade and wrote: \\"Nevertheless, the director and his subject are ultimately buried together in the same boat: We're made to understand their suffering, but given no reason to root for their salvation.\\" == References  External links == * Category:2020s biographical films Category:2020s crime films Category:2020 films Category:American biographical films Category:American crime films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American films Category:Biographical films about Al Capone Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Josh Trank Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films with screenplays by Josh Trank Category:Vertical Entertainment films Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Films about syphilis Category:Films about organized crime in the United States ","title":"Capone (2020 film)"},{"id":"56859338","text":"Kato Acharnes () is a station on the Piraeus‚ÄìPlaty railway line in Agioi Anargyroi, West Athens.

Her drawings depict alternative realms while her collaborations with Simon Ward and Andrew Clarke adapt the world of her drawings into video animations and virtual reality. == Biography == Jess Johnson was born in Tauranga, New Zealand in 1979. She grew up in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand and attended University of Canterbury in Christchurch from 1997‚Äì2001, where she earned a BFA. In 2004 she moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she co-founded and ran Hell Gallery from 2008‚Äì2011. She began exhibiting her work in group and solo shows throughout Australia in New Zealand, including shows at institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. In 2016 she relocated permanently to New York City after participating in the Australia Council's Greene Street residency in SoHo. == Works  Drawings === Johnson's drawings typically include bold colors, repetitive and fractal geometric shapes, humanoid figures, alien creatures, and structures that draw from both classical and ancient architecture. They have been likened to the work of Japanese pop-psychedelia artist Keiichi Tanaami. Although the detail and precision of her drawings suggest digital composition, the drawings are all done by hand. Mistakes made during the creation of her drawings \\"act as mutational directions\\" that she incorporates into them. She has said: \\"If I were able to digitally erase my mistakes, I wouldn't necessarily get that organic growth in the world. I like that it's a little out of my control and driven by something else.\\" About Johnson's drawings, Chloe Mandryk of Art Almanac wrote: > Jess Johnson's complex and sensuous images use bold colour and a geometric > bravura that conjure the glow and kinaesthesia of arcade video games and the > 'wormholes' of speculative thought so key to good science fiction. Her > humanoids occupy a virtual reality patterns and ancient architectural forms > that delineate the boundaries of these imagined spaces. Johnson has discussed the role of text in the creation of her drawings: > Whenever I start a new drawing I first choose a piece of text from one of my > notebooks. The text is almost always the starting point. Whatever amorphous > vibe the words give off determines the imagery that comes. The phrases are > often rhythmic and I choose them because they get stuck in my head like > thought-worms. The text plays a really practical role in the construction of > the drawings. The letters and words are like scaffolding and I often arrange > the composition around them. The number of letters gives me mathematical > starting points for mapping out other areas. === Animation and virtual reality === In 2014, Johnson began collaborating with video artist Simon Ward to adapt her drawings into animated video. Their first collaborative work, the single-channel high-definition digital video Mnemonic Pulse, premiered at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne in March 2014. Composer Andrew Clarke created original audio for the piece and continues to collaborate with Johnson and Ward. The first virtual reality work created by Johnson, Ward, and Clarke, Ixian Gate, premiered in 2015 as the centerpiece of Johnson's solo exhibition, WURM HAUS, at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. Johnson participated in the Oculus Rift Launchpad Program at Facebook HQ in May 2016. Johnson and Ward then began creating a series of five HD video animations, each of which translated a single drawing by Johnson into \\"richly rendered 3-dimensional animations, digitally extrapolating Johnson's planar surfaces into tonally modelled architectures and bodies.\\" Drawings translated in this series (which also serve as the respective names of the collaborative videos) are Worldweb Allthing (2017), Transkin Simulator (2017), Whilst In Genuflect (2017), Milxyz Wae (2017), and Worldken (2017). In 2017, the installation piece WHOL WHY WURLD collected these five videos and displayed them on five HD televisions mounted on poles around the perimeter of a painted decagon platform. The videos played on a continuous loop. WHOL WHY WURLD premiered at The National 2017 at Carriageworks in Sydney. An edition of WWW was acquired in 2018 by Buxton Contemporary in Melbourne and presented as part of the museum's inaugural The shape of things to come exhibition. WHOL WHY WURLD was a finalist for the 2018 Walters Prize. Both Ixian Gate and Whol Why Wurld were featured in Johnson's first solo exhibition in the United States, Everything not saved will be lost, in September 2017 at Jack Hanley Gallery. The show was reviewed in the November 2017 edition of ArtForum magazine. In May 2017, Johnson and Ward received a commission from the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) for a major new virtual reality work as part of their Balnaves Contemporary Intervention Series. Five new VR pieces premiered as part of Terminus, Johnson and Ward's exhibition at the NGA opening 4 May 2018. In an interview in Ocula Magazine, Johnson discussed how her drawing practice translated to her work in VR, as a means to catapult the viewer 'to a different planet entirely.' == Influences == Johnson has identified a wide range of influences including the ideas of Terence McKenna; Frank Herbert's Dune and the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky; the dystopian novel Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban; early video games; and comics. == Exhibitions  Selected solo exhibitions === * _Neon Meat Dream_ , Nanzuka Gallery, Tokyo, Japan, 2019https://www.juxtapoz.com/news/installation/neon- meat-dream-the-otherworldly-work-of-jess-johnson-nanzuka-underground-tokyo/ * _Panspermia, Sing Omega_ , Jack Hanley Gallery, New York, NY, 2019https://www.artforum.com/artguide/jack-hanley-gallery-2091/panspermia- sing-omega-174712 * Terminus (w/ Simon Ward), National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 2018 * Auckland Art Fair, Ivan Anthony Gallery, Auckland, New Zealand, 2018 * Everything not saved will be lost, Jack Hanley Gallery, New York, NY, 2017 * Jess Johnson at CLIFT, presented by FOUR A.M, San Francisco, CA, 2017 * Hex Nemesis, Fremantle Arts Centre, Fremantle, Australia, 2017 * Chondrule Terminus (w/ Andrew Clarke), Dark Mofo: Welcome Stranger, Tasmania, Australia, 2017 * Darren Knight Gallery, Discoveries Section, Art Basel, Hong Kong, 2016 * Eclectrc Panoptic, Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland, 2017 * Wurm Haus, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, 2015 * Sensorium Chamber, Ivan Anthony Gallery, Auckland, New Zealand, 2015 * Endless Future Terror Forever, Darren Knight Gallery, Sydney, Australia, 2015 * Gertrude Edition 2015, Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces, Melbourne, Australia, 2015 * Electric Affinity: Jess Johnson/Tina Havelock Stevens, Alaska Projects, Sydney, Australia, 2015 * Ratholes in the Babylon of Information, Ivan Anthony Gallery, Auckland, New Zealand, 2014 * Gamma World, Vivid Festival, MCA Facade, Sydney, Australia, 2014 * Mnemonic Pulse, Gertrude Contemporary Studio 12, Melbourne, Australia, 2014 == Awards and residencies == * International Studio Residency at ISCP, New York, 2017‚Äì2018 * Sci-Fi & the Human Condition Residency, Bemis Center, Omaha, NE, 2016 * Selection for Oculus Rift Launch Pad Program, Facebook HQ, San Francisco, 2016 * Residency at University of Edinburgh, Talbot Rice Gallery, Scotland, 2016 * Studio Residency at ARTSPACE, Sydney, Australia, 2015 * Winner, 2014 National Works on Paper, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, Australia, 2014 * Studio Residency at Gertrude Contemporary, Melbourne, Australia, 2012‚Äì2014 * John McCaughey Memorial Prize, acquisitive commission for NGV, Australia, 2013 * Asialink Residency at Tokyo Wonder Site, Japan, 2013 == Collections == Jess Johnson's works are held in the following permanent collections: * Christchurch Art Gallery, New Zealand (3 works) * James Wallace Arts Trust, Auckland, New Zealand (2 works) * National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, Australia * Museum of Contemporary Art, NSW Australia (1 work) * Monash University Museum of Art, VIC Australia (3 works) * Michael Buxton Collection] Melbourne, Australia (3 works) * National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia (14 works) * Artbank, NSW Australia (2 works) == References  Further reading == * \\"Caught In Eternal Digital Glitches: A Conversation With Jess Johnson\\", Filthy Dreams, October 2017 * \\"Artist Profile: Jess Johnson and the New Language of Virtual Reality,\\" Huffington Post, July 2016 * \\"The gorgeous, unsettling worlds of Jess Johnson,\\" Versions, April 2016 Category:21st-century women artists Category:21st-century New Zealand women Category:New Zealand animators Category:New Zealand animated film directors Category:Women animators Category:New Zealand emigrants to the United States Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tauranga Category:People from Mount Maunganui Category:University of Canterbury alumni Category:Artists from New York City ","title":"Jess Johnson"},{"id":"56859351","text":"The regional council of Centre-Val de Loire (French: conseil r√©gional du Centre-Val de Loire) is a deliberative assembly composed of 77 councillors, elected to six-year terms.

In her work studying prisons she found that both inmates and prisoners face similar experiences. == Select bibliography  Journal Articles (organized by year) === * ‚ÄúSex & Surveillance: Gender, Privacy and the Sexualization of Power in Prison‚Äù, 10 George Mason University Civil Rights Law Journal 291-356 (2000) * Keeping the Government‚Äôs Hands Off Our Bodies: Mapping a Feminist Legal Theory Approach to Privacy in Cross-Gender Prison Searches, 4 Buffalo Criminal Law Review 861-889 (2001) * ‚ÄúCitizenship and Severity: Recent Immigration Reforms and the New Penology‚Äù, 17 Georgetown Immigration Law Journal 611-666 (2003) * ‚ÄúBlurring the Boundaries Between Immigration and Crime Control after Sept. 11th‚Äù, 25 Boston College Third World Law Journal 1-45 (2005) * ‚ÄúA New Look At Neo-liberal Economic Policies and the Criminalization of Undocumented Migration,‚Äù 61 SMU Law Review 171-186 (2008) * ‚ÄúLessons Learned, Lessons Lost: Immigration Enforcement‚Äôs Failed Experiment with Penal Severity,‚Äù (38 Fordham Urban Law Journal 217-246 (2010) * ‚ÄúEncountering Attica: Documentary Filmmaking As Pedagogical Tool,‚Äù 62 J.

This includes the end of the Hands- Off Doctrine and the ability to be protected by the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Furthermore, prisoner laws regulate the ways in which individuals experience privacy in a prison setting. Important case laws have arisen through time that have either hindered or protected prisoners from certain rights. Some include the Hudson v. Palmer case which held that prisoners were not protected against searches and seizures of their prison cells and Wolff v. McDonnell that stated that prisoners shall remain entitled to some of their constitutional rights even after being incarcerated. == Background == Incarceration rates in the United States have and continue to increase significantly. In comparison to the rest of the world, the United States holds a record for the highest number of incarcerated individuals. In 2015, the prison population estimated approximately 2.2 million people. There has been a rapid increase in the prison population since the 1980s. However, violent crime has significantly decreased from the years 1973 to 2003. In the United States, the majority of inmates are people of color and from low socioeconomic backgrounds. === Historical === A theoretical form of prison surveillance is called the Panopticon. The Panopticon is a building composed of a middle tower for the surveillance of the surrounding cells. Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon makes it possible that ‚Äúeach individual in his place is securely confined to a cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his companions‚Äù. In America the first prison was established during the 1970s in Philadelphia which was named after the name Walnut street. === Hands-off Doctrine === The Hands-off doctrine was the decision of the federal courts to stay out of the regulating the administration of how prisons and rules for prisoners are decided. In essence this meant that if an inmates‚Äô rights were said to be violated the court would not get in between. This stems from the idea that these corrections institutions knew more about how to make decisions over prisons and prisoners than the courts did. Also, judges believed that if a prisoner became incarcerated then they shall expect to lose their rights. Due to the complexity of the issues that have arisen among prisoners and their rights, the hands-off doctrine in the courts has diminished. This led to a greater awareness of the rights of prisoners as well as increased court involvement within the violation of rights. In fact, the detachment from using the \\"hands off\\" approach began during the 1960s and courts started to look into specific violations regarding prisoners. Some of the related cases begin with Procunier v. Martinez, which was the first case where the Supreme court began to interfere between the prisoner and prison administration relationship. This case revolved around controlling and censoring the correspondence of prisoners. A final decision over this issue was not made until the occurrence of the Turner v. Safley case. It concluded that the ability to send mail to and from other prisoners was not allowed in order to keep prisons safe and controlled. Moreover, it was decided that marriage between prisoners was to be allowed. In Coffin v. Reichard, the idea that prisoners have and should maintain their constitutional rights as human beings was acknowledged. However, becoming incarcerated does in fact take away from many of those constitutional rights. This led to a complexity of cases that decided what protections would be available to prisoners through incarceration. == Prisoner Case Law- General  The First Amendment === Both the freedom of Speech and the freedom of religion are protected by the First Amendment. For Prisoners there have been an abundance of case laws that have emerged which protect these rights and the various violations they have faced within prison.  Freedom of Speech  Prisoners have the freedom to send and receive correspondence and visitations from their loved ones. In some instances this right may be limited for the safety and security of the prison. Correspondence is largely monitored by the prison staff. The case Carothers v. Follette, portrays an instance where a prisoner wrote about the prison administration in his letters and was then penalized for it. As a result, the courts concluded that prisons may penalize prisoners for the way they express themselves only if it interferes with the functioning of the prison. In addition, prisons get to decide who is allowed to send prisoners mail and who they can send mail to by implementing a set mailing list. Prisoners are entitled to receive legal aid when needed. When it comes to communicating with their attorneys, prisoners are allowed to talk with them in person and without major surveillance. They also have the right to reach out to \\"petition for redress of grievances\\" which was decided in the case Nolan v. Fitzpatrick. This gave prisoners the right to be able to express their complaints and expose prison conditions to the outside world.  Freedom of Religion  The courts respect the right to freedom of religion in prison, however, they focus largely on protecting this freedom of all prisoners equally. There is a large population of the Black Muslim religion within prisons, therefore, many litigation cases have arisen. Prisoners may not be discriminated based on their religious beliefs but certain religious practices may be restricted in prison. The Brown v. Peyton, case revolved around the rights of Black Muslim prisoners in which they believed that their rights of freedom to practice religion were violated. Similarly, in Fulwood v. Clemmer, Black Muslin prisoners fought for their right to practice their religion in prison. It was ruled that because their practices disrupted the prison environment that they could be penalized for such practices. Walker v. Blackwell, is a case which fought for the needs of Muslim prisoners to eat at specific times due to their religious practice of Ramadan but were eventually denied. The courts decided that it was not cost efficient and also raised safety issues. == Prisoner Privacy law  The Fourth Amendment === As part of the constitution, the Fourth Amendment protects prisoners' privacy by forbidding ‚Äúunreasonable searches and seizures‚Äù of individuals' property. There are a variety of cases that fought to protect this privacy right, yet there are many cases that attempted to take it away. For example, the case Lanza v. New York ruled that prisons and inmates would not be protected under the fourth amendment. Further, in Bell v Wolfish which had to do with searches and seizures it was decided that prisoners shall not expect to have any privacy in prison. Both of these cases ruled against the protection of prisoners themselves being search or their property from being confiscated. However, in Wolff v McDonnell the courts established that prisoners should still be entitled to some rights even if they have committed a crime. In addition, the 1975 Bonner v. Coughlin case also protects that these privacy rights remain available to individuals in prison, to an extent. Searches and seizures of inmates and their property in prison occur without any prior announcement. The function of this is to search for any unauthorized property that inmates may be hiding and are needed in order to prevent or get rid of unauthorized property. In the case Parrat v Taylor an inmate's property was destroyed by a member of the prison staff which was not ruled as a violation by the courts. Essentially, this decision supported the conclusion that prisons must prioritize their own security and well-being over the privacy rights of inmates. Moreover, in the 1984 Hudson v. Palmer case, the Supreme Court decided that the privacy rights of inmates against searches were not protected.The case stated that this was important in order to maintain control and security within the prisons. Additionally, the case Timm v. Gunter decided that searches and seizures were not in violation of an inmates rights if it was for the sake of the prison and its security. Similarly, the case Levoy v. Mills ruled that no matter how big the invasion of privacy, it must be rightfully justified for the prison's welfare in order to be held in the prisons favor. === The Eighth Amendment === The Eighth amendment of the constitution is a protection of individuals against \\" cruel and unusual punishment\\". When Prisoners are subjected to monitoring, observation and searches this amendment may be violated. Two cases that explore this further are Jackson v. Werner and Jordan v. Gardner. In Jackson v. Werner, the courts decided that there was no violation with searching and observing because it is all supposed to be for the good of a prison institution. It stated that inmates should get used to this due to the fact that they are within the boundaries of an institution that is meant to punish them. In Jordan v. Gardner, the courts made a decision based on the idea that inmates may have had previously experienced sexual abuse or harassment. The decision was oriented towards preventing more trauma for inmates and ruled that searches and observations may cause an \\"infliction of pain\\". Additionally, in the case, Estelle v. Gamble, a situation occurred in which the right to health care was not given to a prisoner and had his heath conditions worsen. This led to a conclusion that decisions like these could lead to worsening conditions of prisoners, and violates the eighth amendment because this denial could further cause a cruel and unusual punishment. === The Fourteenth Amendment === The Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution protects individuals' privacy and one instance is being \\"observed by strangers naked or stripped of [their] clothes\\" Due to the way that prisons function these privacy rights may not be protected by the fourteenth amendment. Female guards employed within male prisons have the right to walk around areas in which men may be naked or using the restrooms. Along with being able to monitor these areas they are also allowed to search the men if needed. This also occurs with female prisons within where men are employed. According to a report from the Human Rights Watch, male corrections officers have abused their right to search prisoners. This includes the harassment and sexual abuse of female prisoners. Consequently, officers have threatened female inmates to engage in sexual activity with them. In court, prisoners may be subjected to prove that they have been wrongly harassed and that their privacy has been breached in order to be protected. == Privacy in the prison setting == Prisoner Privacy within a prison setting includes the ways that prisoners experience privacy through communicating with others, their physical prison environments and the protection of their health. === Communication methods === Most inmates have methods available to them to communicate with individuals outside of prison. These methods include access to sending and receiving mail, telephone calls, and visitation rights. Writing letters is a popular way in which inmates maintain contact with the outside world. Letters are a way for both inmates and their family members to communicate with each other via mail. All of the mail that enters or leaves the facility is read and gone through by the prison staff and guards. Similarly, telephone calls are accessible to most inmates except those who are placed in solitary confinement. The allowed duration of the calls tend to be approximately fifteen minutes long. Phone calls are monitored and recorded; there are also key words that may cause the disconnection of calls by guards, for example: profanity. Inmates have the option to receive visits from family members and friends. These visitations vary from three to six hours in length and are consistently monitored by prison guards. Aside from being monitored by guards there are an abundance of cameras in the visitation rooms for surveillance of these interactions. All physical interactions are strictly limited. Aside from their encounter being monitored family members undergo searches upon entering the facility for visitations. These visits \\"can be humiliating and degrading\\" for the visitor. === Physical Environments === In prison the physical environments that prisoners are exposed to are becoming more overcrowded through time. However, aside from dealing with overcrowded spaces they face a privacy concern regarding corrections officers. Corrections officers risk losing their jobs or not attaining a job at all within prisons of the opposite sex in order to maintain the privacy of inmates. When privacy of inmates is protected by disallowing guards to wander private areas those areas become more dangerous to the inmates. On the other hand, if those areas are monitored than inmates may lose their sense of privacy. In order to secure the privacy of inmates, oftentimes individuals of the opposite sex are denied employment in prisons. This occurred in the case Dothard v. Rawlison where a female was discriminated against when applying to a male prison in the state of Alabama. The supreme court focused on arguing that females are sexually susceptible in a male environment. This was justified by the idea that if a female was to work in a male prison that prisoners would become more violent. In Bowling v. Enimoto male inmate rights were challenged by deciding that these inmates have the right not to be monitored while either showering, changing or using the restroom. Similarly, in Forts v. Ward females' inmate rights were challenged.The case ruled that there was a need to block surveillance of areas such as showers and toilets. === Health === The case Estelle v. Gamble ruled that inmates have the right to receive health care in prison. It also established that if prisoners want to get an abortion that they are entitled to do so. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule applies to health care in prison. HIPAA's privacy rule protects everything pertaining to a prisoners health. However, under HIPAA's Permissible Use and Disclosure Exception it is okay for prisons to share inmate's information with other institutions when needed and without their approval. There are various ways that privacy is breached in terms of the health of inmates and these breaches form barriers for access to healthcare. First, a variety of blood tests can be conducted on prisoners at any moment for any reason and is not protected by the fourth amendment. A lack of trust drives prisoners to feel uncomfortable when voicing health issues to the guards. Also, overcrowding in prisons has led to the spread of health related issues and diseases. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) has disclosed that the transmission of diseases and other health related issues is high in prisons and can spread further after an inmate is released Diseases that can be transmitted are constantly monitored. Also, this is immediately communicated to public health officials. Some examples of these health issues and disease are: * HIV/AIDS * Hepatitis * Tuberculosis == Controversies  Observations, Searches of Inmates, and Gender === Controversy exists with gender in prison as a double standard. In one instance if same gender observations or searches are conducted then it is stated to be required in order to keep prisons safe and secure. On the other hand, if this occurs with opposite genders then a violation of prisoner rights arises. It is more likely to become a violation or an intrusion if these observation and searches take place on behalf of the opposite sex. Oftentimes, the decisions of federal judges are shaped by different stereotypes that characterize men and women. Because of this, according to the courts, females have a higher expectation of privacy than males do. === Conflict between prisoners and correctional officers === In the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII protects the employment rights of workers against any discrimination pertaining to who they are or where they come from. However, there is a debate between inmates' privacy rights versus corrections officers' and equal employment rights. Complaints come from prisoners because they believe that their privacy is breached by guards of the opposite sex. Contrarily, guards complain that they are being discriminated against when it comes to obtaining a job within an institution of the opposite sex. An example of a violation of the equal employment rights is shown in Brooks v. Industries. This is seen mainly with cross-gender searches. In the case, Brooks v. Industries, a female janitor working in a male prison lost her position due to gender in prison issues. The decision concluded that having to clean a male bathroom should not be done by a female because it would invade the male privacy. Conflicts like these lead to a call to balance the two situations in the best way possible. == References == Category:Imprisonment and detention ","title":"Prisoner Law"},{"id":"56859413","text":"Leo J.

He attended The English High School and Saint Anselm College. ==Political career== Sullivan began his political career in 1934 as an unsuccessful candidate for the Massachusetts House of Representatives. It would be the only defeat he suffered in his career. He was elected to the House in 1936 and served there from 1937 to 1941. From 1941 to 1947 he represented the 4th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts Senate. In 1946 he defeated 40-year incumbent W. T. A. Fitzgerald to become Suffolk County Register of Deeds. As register, Sullivan worked to modernize the office. This included photostating every document which came through the registry and making microfilms of all the records in the land division. Sullivan managed Foster Furcolo's campaign in Suffolk County during the 1956 gubernatorial election. ==Police Commissioner== In 1957, Furcolo appointed Sullivan to the position of Boston police commissioner. During his tenure as commissioner, Sullivan broke up the special service squad, established a juvenile squad, and eliminated 101 positions from the department (which saved the city $550,000 a year). He supported consolidation of stations and opposed legislation to return the department under city control. In 1961, CBS aired a program called \\"Biography of a Bookie Joint\\", which showed police officers entering and exiting Swartz's Key Shop, an illegal gambling parlor. Governor John A. Volpe hired James D. St. Clair to prepare removal proceedings against Sullivan. After Sullivan refused to resign, Volpe brought him before the Massachusetts Governor's Council's on charges of splitting renovation and repair contracts, failing to advertise contract bids, engaging in the insurance business while serving as commissioner, and neglecting his duty by not ordering an investigation into the officers who were filmed visiting Swartz's Key Shop. Sullivan resigned on March 15, 1962, during the hearings on his removal. ==Death== Sullivan died on February 1, 1963, at his home in South Boston. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1963 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Commissioners of the Boston Police Department Category:Massachusetts Democrats Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:Register of deeds in Suffolk County, Massachusetts Category:Saint Anselm College alumni Category:Politicians from Boston Category:Catholics from Massachusetts ","title":"Leo J.

A born entrepreneur, he launched and sold his first business at the age of 19 while on active duty in the US Air Force. ==Early life== Frederick Hutson grew up in Brooklyn, NY with a single mother and three siblings. He moved to St. Petersburg, Florida where he attended Brandon High School. He then served in the US Air Force where he worked on jet engines at the Nellis Air Force Base as an electrician. During his time in the Air Force he launched and ran several businesses, including a window-tinting business that made about $50,000 when he was 19. He was honorably discharged in 2005 after the base began downsizing, and eventually turned his business efforts to sending marijuana through the parcel companies. The business netted approximately $500,000 annually. Hutson was arrested by the DEA, and Hutson served a sentence of 51 months beginning in 2007 at the age of 23, The indictment was for shipping approximately 2 tons of marijuana, accepting marijuana from Mexico and shipping it to Florida. He was released in 2012 to a half-way house. ==Pigeonly== While in prison Hutson encountered the difficulty that American inmates have with communicating with their family and friends outside of the institution, and developed an idea for delivering communications for individuals residing in prison. After leaving prison he founded a company, Pigeonly, which prints out electronic communications for prisoners and mails them through the postal system to them in order to be better accepted by the prison system. His business venture was accepted in the incubators Y Combinator and NewMe. The enterprise was cofounded in 2013 with Alfonzo Brooks, whom had employed Hutson during his final year in prison when Hutson was admitted to a work release program. Hutson currently serves as the company‚Äôs CEO. By 2015 the company had forwarded around a million pieces of mail and facilitated about eight million minutes of telephone calls. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American chief executives Category:American technology company founders Category:People from Brooklyn ","title":"Frederick Hutson"},{"id":"56859599","text":"The 1959 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Women's Doubles was the 24th edition of the women's doubles championship.

It has up to five linear leaves at its base and up to five pale yellow flowers with brown markings. It is found along the south coast, often growing in areas that are flooded in winter and flowering more prolifically after fire the previous summer. ==Description== Diuris concinna is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of , although often up to when surrounded by sedges. Between three and five linear leaves emerge at the base, each leaf long and wide. Up to five pale yellow flowers with brown markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to sword-shaped, green and purplish, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are curved backwards, spread apart from each other, sometimes almost horizontal, with an elliptic blade long and wide on a reddish-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are egg-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge- like calli long near the mid-line of the base of the labellum.

Over a career spanning four decades he has refereed four NCAA championships, 10 final fours, and 28 NCAA tournaments. In 2005, he won the Naismith College Official of the Year. ==Early life and career== Valentine grew up in a poor, single parent home in Moundsville, West Virginia. He was raised by his mother, who was a worker at a Louis Marx and Company factory, making big wheel tricycles. His mother would put cardboard into her shoes over worn soles to save money. He did not know his father until junior high. In the same year he met his father, he witnessed a friend die from an accidental gunshot wound to the head. Following this, he developed a stutter, for which he saw two speech therapists. He attended John Marshall High School, where he played baseball for three years. He attended Glenville State College, where he majored in physical education. He played first base for his college team. He graduated in 1980. Though he did not play basketball, he was a manager on his college's basketball team. He was inducted into his college's sports hall of fame in 2006, after lettering in baseball. Following college, he returned to John Marshall High School, becoming a physical education and driver's education teacher, as well as a coach. In 1985, he was an assistant coach for the John Marshall High School baseball team that won the West Virginia Class AAA State Championship. While Valentine has never played organized basketball, he has coached, if briefly. While in college, he was a student teacher at Weston Junior High in Weston, West Virginia. He was an assistant coach for the school's junior high girls team. The head coach had taken maternity leave, leading to Valentine being the substitute head coach for a game. He received three technicals before half time, and was ejected. On his way off the court, he passed the principal of the school who said \\"You just coached your last game.\\" Following knee surgery, Valentine moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 2003. In addition to refereeing, Valentine also works part-time for the North Charleston Recreation Department. ==Basketball referee career== While doing janitorial work in a gym on work-study program in college, Valentine had observed basketball referees and decided he wanted to be a college basketball referee. He talked with some referees about how to get started in the profession, and took a class. He began refereeing at kids games, later moving up to junior high and high school games. In 1981, he attended a refereeing camp in Bristol, Connecticut run by NBA Hall of Fame member Dallas Shirley. While there, he poured out a cooler of ice water from a window onto sunbathers below the window. Shirley threw Valentine out of the camp for the stunt. A few months later, Shirley offered him a job as a referee. Valentine worked his first NCAA Division I basketball game in 1981 at the former Baptist College, now Charleston Southern University. He was paid $150 for the game, and received speeding tickets both on the way and returning from the game. In 1986, he was hired by Bob Wortman, who was then the Big Ten Conference's director of officials. Wortman was looking to diversify his staff, and after an interview offered Valentine a job refereeing 30 games. Wortman personally trained Valentine. He quit teaching and became a full-time college referee in 1988. Before his first NCAA Championship game, Valentine lost his official pass and nearly did not get into the game. Valentine refereed his first final four in 1991. He worked 26 consecutive NCAA tournaments until 2015, when he stepped aside from his work to spend time with his brother, who was dying from cancer. Valentine is sometimes referred by the nickname of \\"TV Teddy\\" for his sometimes theatrical officiating. ===Controversies=== On February 24, 1998, Valentine officiated a game between Indiana and Illinois. Valentine called three technical fouls during the game on Bob Knight; one in the first half, and two in the second half. Ed Hightower, also an official for the game, attempted to get Valentine to rescind the second technical, which Valentine had issued against Knight for Knight walking onto the floor to attend to an injured player, which is allowable under NCAA rules. Valentine refused to rescind the call. Knight vociferously protested, resulting in the third technical. Knight later referred to Valentine's officiating as \\"the greatest travesty\\" he had witnessed over his career. Knight was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten Conference. Valentine was censured for making the \\"clearly erroneous\\" second technical, and was placed under restrictions for non-conference Big Ten Conference basketball games for the following season. On March 1, 2014 during a game involving the Cincinnati Bearcats, the team's coach Mick Cronin contested an out of bounds call. Valentine got into Cronin's face and the two men needed to be separated. Valentine later apologized. On January 3, 2018 Valentine was involved in an incident during an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) game where Joel Berry II was coming to talk to him about a call. Valentine turned his back on Berry rather than discuss the call with him. Following this, he was removed from officiating two Big Ten Conference games. He contemplated retirement for a time following this incident. Valentine apologized to Berry at the next game of Berry's that Valentine was officiating. Berry's head coach Roy Williams was not critical of Valentine's officiating in the game. The ACC indicated they were handling the incident internally, and a week after the game, a spokesman for the ACC said the incident was a non-issue. In March, 2018, Valentine was informed he would not be working the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Valentine believes the banishment from the tournament stems from the January incident. ==Personal life== He has one daughter, Joneesha, and a granddaughter. ==References== Category:African- American sports officials Category:College men's basketball referees in the United States Category:Living people Category:People from Moundsville, West Virginia Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ted Valentine"},{"id":"56859922","text":"DCM (also known as DCM Ventures) is a venture capital firm located in Silicon Valley, Tokyo and Beijing.

During spring, Natsuki works up the courage to talk to Anna Kobayakawa, who lends him her hand towel after he falls into a puddle. His attempt to return it to her fails when he is intercepted by her protective best friend, Mari Tsutsui. The boys make a bet for Natsuki to ask Anna out by the end of the semester, and he succeeds in getting her Line ID, to Mari's anger. In the summer, Natsuki, Tomoya, and Keiichi fail their exams and seek help from Tsuyoshi and his girlfriend Yukiko Asai, to which they also invite Anna. Later, Yukiko discovers that Tsuyoshi plans on applying to a university in Tokyo. After the boys pass their remedial exams, they go to a summer festival with the girls. While Natsuki grows closer to Anna, Tomoya learns that Mari fears that he will steal Anna away. In the fall, during guidance counseling, Tsuyoshi becomes conflicted over choosing between his college choices and his relationship with Yukiko. Anna becomes confused when she sees that Natsuki's classmate, Chiba, is close to him, and she is later saved from unwanted advances from another boy when Keiichi pretends to be her boyfriend. In the winter, Tomoya distracts Mari from interrupting Natsuki and Anna's day out and later invites her to a Christmas party. Mari attends, but discovers it is a surprise birthday party for her planned by Natsuki and Anna. Upset, she runs off, causing everyone to look for her. When Tomoya finds her, she confesses that she feels she is no longer Anna's closest friend, and he kisses her. Meanwhile, Natsuki develops a fever during the search and accidentally kisses Anna. After winter break, Natsuki and Anna's relationship becomes awkward, while Tomoya admits to Mari that he has fallen in love with her. Mari is knocked unconscious when she walks away from him, and after carrying her to the nurse's office, Tomoya tells Mari's older brother, Masaomi, that he is confident in winning her over. Masaomi conveys this to Mari, and she realizes how genuine his feelings are after Tomoya confirms he has deleted phone numbers from other girls. As the boys become third year students with the arrival of spring, Anna overhears Natsuki helping Chiba rehearse for their play at the cultural festival, misinterpreting their conversation as a love confession. She begins to ignore him, putting distance between the two. Keiichi tells the boys that he will pursue Anna if Natsuki doesn't, causing Tomoya and him to get into a fight. Once Tsuyoshi warns Natsuki that Keiichi is going to confess to Anna, he chases after them. Revealing his threat to be a ruse, Keiichi gives Natsuki and Anna time together in the planetarium exhibit, where they confess their love to each other and kiss. Outside, everyone has discovered the rain has stopped and a rainbow has formed in the sky. In a mid-credits scene, the boys jump into the school's swimming pool and later graduate from high school. ==Cast== * Reo Sano as Natsuki Hashiba * Taishi Nakagawa as Tomoya Matsunaga * Mahiro Takasugi as Tsuyoshi Naoe * Ryusei Yokohama as Keiichi Katakura * Riko Yoshida as Anna Kobayakawa * Yuri Tsunematsu as Mari Tsutsui * Mayu Hotta as Yukiko Asai * Nozomi Bando as Reiko Chiba * Yuki Yamada as Masaomi Tsutsui * Kenichi Takit≈ç as Professor Tabuchi ==Production== A live-action film adaptation for Rainbow Days was announced in October 2017 and slated for a summer 2018 release, which was later confirmed to be July 6, 2018.

Marco d'Aviano prophesied his success as a priest and recommended him, after Rummel's ordination in Regensburg, to be an educator and religious tutor to the future Emperor Joseph I. In addition, the wife of Emperor Leopold I, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg, favored him because his grandfather, Johann Rummel, had already served the Palatinate as a chamber councilor. From 1684 he carried out this activity, but was soon hostile and slandered. Through the mediation of Emperor Leopold he became Bishop of Tinin and Provost of Ardagger and Wroclaw. On 11 July 1706, he was appointed Prince-Bishop of Vienna by Joseph I, the Papal confirmation taking place on 4 October. He was concerned with pastoral care and was able to increase priesthood. In 1708 there were 111 priestly ordinations in the small Viennese diocese. He introduced the celebration of the Rosary and in 1711 had the Pummerin Bell poured from cannonballs captured during the Second Turkish Siege. He also mediated between the Emperor and Pope Clement XI when in 1708 Austrian troops occupied territories of the Papal States during the War of Spanish Succession.

He was her third husband, and she was his second wife, and their marriage was her second morganatic marriage. Later in his life (after the death of his older brother, Louis Philippe de Bombelles), he became the Count of Bombelles. ==Early life== Charles-Ren√© de Bombelles was born in Versailles on November 6, 1784, and was the third child and third son of Marc Marie, Marquis de Bombelles and Marie- Ang√©lique de Mackau, as well as the grandson of Henri Fran√ßois de Bombelles. He was either one of seven children- six of whom who survived to adulthood, or one of four children, all of whom survived to adulthood. Among his siblings were Louis Phillipe (the Count of Bombelles, chamberlain to the Emperor of Austria and Austrian ambassador to Denmark), Henri Fran√ßois de Bombelles (tutor of Francis-Joseph, Emperor of Austria), Caroline Antoinette de Bombelles (lady of honor to the Duchess of Berry and wife of Fran√ßois de Biaudos de Casteja).Billard 1910, p. 212-15 As he was born to a noble family in Versailles, he was forced to flee to Austria during the French Revolution (presumably around the beginning of the Revolution, approximately 1789) and joined \\"the Austrian Mittrowsky regiment as ensign.\\" In 1804, after some time in the military, he assumed the title of captain. Presumably, he went onto fight in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1814, after the defeat of Napoleon, he returned to Paris, France to serve as aide-de-camp to Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, who was \\"the commander-in-chief of the coalition armies.\\" Charles remained in Paris, serving as the Prince's aide-de-camp until he became a lieutenant of infantry.Billard 1910, p. 216 In 1814, soon after returning to France, Charles married Caroline Sabine Victoire de Poulhariez de Saint Andr√© de Foucaud. Together they had two children- a son named Louis (Louis de Bombelles, born 1817) and a daughter named Marie (Marie de Bombelles, born 1819). Soon after, Charles was widowed. It is unclear when exactly Caroline died (some sources place her death in 1834), but primary sources suggest that she died in Vienna in 1819, leaving her husband a widower with two children. Billard 1910, p. 218-19 ==Marriage to Marie Louise== After Marie Louise, the Duchess of Parma and widow of Napoleon, lost her second husband (and grand chamberlain), Adam Albert von Neipperg, in 1829, Prince Metternich (a German prince and diplomat who initially introduced and encouraged the marriage Napoleon and Marie several years before hand), suggested that Charles become the new grand chamberlain of Marie Louise. Charles initially declined this offer, but after some consideration, relented, and, \\"at 48 years of age,\\" Charles left for Parma and became the grand chamberlain of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. He was reportedly an extremely scrupulous chamberlain. \\"He came,\\" wrote a Mr. Challiot, the steward of Marie- Louise, \\"into a country distracted by feuds and indignant at the strong measures which it had been necessary to take in order to sweep away the former abuses... By degrees he [Charles] filled up the court appointments, which had become vacant--appointing persons who had earned the respect of the public. The accounts were kept with severe regularity. A budget drawn up every year assigned to each department and amount which was never exceeded; on the contrary there was very often a surplus. As far as was possible, everything supplied to the court, and all works required for the Ducal residence, were issued for tender and open to competition. Each department was minutely organized, all expenses were settled and paid once a month. A balance sheet showing receipts and expenditure was drawn up yearly, and submitted for audit to the Treasury of the Duchies, before being presented to her Majesty.\\" After working as her grand chamberlain for some time, Marie Louise, who had grown quite close to him over his stay in her household, proposed marriage to Charles, and on February 17, 1834, Charles and Marie-Louise were secretly married. The marriage was a morganatic one. Marie Louise was a duchess, and he a lesser noble and military officer with no clear title aside from Captain (and, later, Count). Upon their marriage, he assumed the title of Minister of Defense.Billard 1910, p. 226-33 Not much is known about their marriage, though they seemed to be happy and affectionate towards each other. Marie Louise and Charles remained married until her death on December 17, 1847. They had no children, and he stayed by her side over the course of the few days that she was on her deathbed. In her will, she left her stepdaughter and his daughter, Marie, \\"the ivory crucifix which hung from the curtains of her bed, and which would receive her last breath\\" and publicly declared their marriage to one another. Along with this, she also left him \\"the sum of 300,000 Italian livres, in Milanese bonds,\\" as well as her portrait by Fran√ßois G√©rard, all of her books, and her manuscripts.Billard 1910, p. 267-77 ==Later life== Soon after Marie Louise's death, Charles returned to Vienna, Austria where he served in the court of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. After serving in Emperor Ferdinand's court, he returned to France where he died in Versailles on May 30, 1856, aged 70. == References Sources=== * ===Citations=== Category:1784 births Category:1856 deaths Category:French soldiers Category:People from Versailles Category:De Bombelles family ","title":"Charles-Ren√© de Bombelles"},{"id":"56860502","text":"Ye Peiqiong (; born 1937), also known as Yei Pei-chun, is a female former international table tennis player from China. ==Table tennis career== She won two bronze medals at the 1957 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1959 World Table Tennis Championships in the Corbillon Cup (women's team event) for China.

The conservation park began in 1948 as a gift of ‚Äú20 acres of scrub land at Myponga for use as a natural history reserve‚Äù by Mrs. Lucy Page to the Field Naturalists Section of the Royal Society of South Australia and was named as the Nixon Skinner sanctuary in memory of her two grandfathers.

The series deals with solved or cold criminal cases, often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. Port Arthur or the Snowtown murders), although notable crimes from the UK and the USA are increasingly featured, and well-known cases from other countries have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings. Larger and more-complex cases have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut. == Production == The podcast first aired on 9 January 2016 and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room. The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. The Joe Rogan Experience, Hardcore History, Serial, and Making A Murderer) at the time, and felt encouraged by Joe Rogan to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style. According to one source, the host remains anonymous because \\"he wants the stories, facts, and questions to speak for themselves\\" and \\"It makes the show about the stories and that's it.\\" According to another review, the podcast's: > deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging > listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor > contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading > listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news > reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories > are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough > editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the > tale. In its current format, the 2019 Casefile team now consists of four researcher/writers, two composers, a designer, a social media liaison, and the host/narrator. It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, ‚Äúsince about episode 7‚Äù, which led to episodes 1‚Äì6 being reworked. Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the UK National Archives in Kew in 2017 to examine police files on Myra Hindley. A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author Eileen Ormsby. Each case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as in this example.

However, as the podcast evolved, these began to be placed behind a voluntary subscription paywall. In July 2019, it was announced that these updates would now be spun out into an \\"informal companion\\" series, From the Files, to be aired monthly in the show's off week. To replace it, a new patron only show called Behind the Files debuted the same month. It was announced in December 2019, however, that From the Files would be put on hiatus for 2020. ===Silent Waves=== Another companion podcast, titled Silent Waves and released by Casefile Presents, began weekly releases in October 2019.

Bissel, R. Ward. Artemisia Gentileschi and the Authority of Art: Critical Reading and Catalogue Raisonn√©. University Park, Penn., 1999. 79. Although a date has not been agreed upon by scholars, Artemesia most likely painted The Birth of Saint John the Baptist between 1633 and 1635. It is one of the most renowned works from Artemisia's Naples period, especially due to its detailed rendering of fabrics and floor tiles. Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi. Ech. cat. Metropolitan Museum of Art, ed. Keith Christiansen and Judith W. Mann. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001. 405. The painting depicts a Bible story from Luke 1:5-80, in which Zacharias and his wife, Elizabeth, are too old to have children. One day the angel Gabriel appears to tell Zacharias that he and Elizabeth will have a son named John. Zacharias is literally dumbfounded and loses his ability to speak. Later, the baby is born and all the couple's neighbors and midwives insist that the baby should be named Zacharias, after his father. Elizabeth disagrees, so they ask for Zacharias's opinion. He writes on a tablet ‚ÄúHis name is John‚Äù and regains his ability to speak. Thus Saint John the Baptist begins his miraculous life. Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi. Ech. cat. Metropolitan Museum of Art, ed. Keith Christiansen and Judith W. Mann. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001. 405. Before moving to Naples, Artemisia was known for arguably pre-feminist, secular works; but in Naples she began painting a great number of commissions for Spanish rulers and churches, so her subject matter became more religious. The composition of this painting, which emphasizes female neighbors and maidservants rather than the miracle of the story, is distinctly secular. The style of this painting, though specific to Artemisia, is heavily influenced by Caravaggio, Simon Vouet, and Massimo Stanzione. The painting is now on display at the Prado Museum in Madrid. https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-birth-of-saint- john-the-baptist/65572d18-d9a1-42b8-bddd-f931c4b88da6 == References == *See Brown, Jonathan, and John H.

The British Royal Navy captured her in 1805 but laid her up. The Navy finally commissioned her in 1809. She was at the British invasion of √éle de France and later served in the Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic, and the Chesapeake. She was broken up in 1816. ==French service and capture== She was built to plans by Pierre-Jacques-Nicolas Rolland and commissioned on 14 June 1804. She was stationed in √éle-d'Aix Roads. On 11 January 1805, she departed Rochefort under Lieutenant Depoge to join up with Admiral Missiessy's squadron, bound for the Caribbean. She returned to Rochefort on 20 May. French records state that she was captured off the Gironde, on 27 September, or on 11 Vend√©miaire An 14 (3 October 1805),Fonds Marine BB4:227. by . British records state that on 2 October 1805 captured the French brig-sloop Act√©on, under Capitaine de fr√©gate Depoge, off Rochefort. She was armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 126 men. Act√©on had on board a colonel and some recruits, as well as arms and clothing for a regiment in the West Indies. The navy took Act√©on into service as HMS Acteon. ==British service== After Act√©on arrived at Portsmouth the navy laid her up in ordinary. In February 1809 Commander Ralph Viscount Neville commissioned her at Portsmouth. Between June and September Acteon underwent a Very Small Repair. , under the command of Commander Phillip Browne, was off the Scilly Isles on 6 November, when she sighted a brig (Acteon) chasing a lugger. Plover joined in, with joining later. After a chase of almost four hours, Plover came alongside the lugger, which surrendered. The lugger proved to be the French privateer L√©zard, of Saint Malo. She was pierced for 14 guns, but had none aboard when captured. She and her crew of 57 men had sailed from √éle de Batz the night before but had not made any capture. Browne credited Acteon and Orestes with having blocked L√©zards escape. Lastly, Browne further reported that the three British men-of-war had recaptured the English ship Weymouth, from Gibraltar, shortly before she could reach Aber Wrac'h. Weymouth, Llewellyn, master, had been captured on 4 November at . After her recapture she arrived at Scilly where she described her captor as having had six guns and a crew of 63 men. In February 1810 there occurred an unfortunate incident of friendly fire. As the packet Princess Elizabeth, Kidd, master, was sailing to Lisbon she encountered a naval brig and an engagement developed that lasted about two-and-a-half hours. Eventually Kidd decided that further resistance was useless and ceased firing. When the boarding party from the brig arrived at Princess Elizabeth both sides realized the mistake. The brig was Acteon. Kidd had prepared the mails for jettisoning but had not yet given the order that it be thrown overboard when it became clear that the brig was English. Fortunately, there were no casualties aboard the packet and no loss of mail. Kidd believed that it was possible that there were wounded aboard Acteon. Princess Elizabeth arrived at Lisbon on 28 February and was due to sail back to London on 4 March.\\"Portuguese Papers.\\" Times London, England 30 Mar. 1810: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 16 Mar. 2018. On 23 May the French ship Susan and Sarah arrived at Plymouth from √éle de France. She and her \\"very valuable Cargo\\" were a prize to Acteon. On 15 July Nivelle sailed Acteon for the Cape of Good Hope. By 21 November she was off the island of Rodrigues preparing for a joint naval and military expedition to take √éle de France. The invasion fleet, under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, arrived at √éle de France on the 28th; the capitulation was signed on the 3 December. After the capture of the island Neville received promotion to post captain and transferred to take command of . Admiral Bertie appointed his nephew, Bertie Cornelius Cator, to command of Acteon. Earlier Lieutenant Bertie Cator had been appointed to command the transport \\"Bombay \\". He moved from temporary command of and by some accounts commanded Anna during the invasion. (The navy had temporarily engaged four transports as hired armed ships and put naval officers in charge of each. Bertie sent Cator and Acteon to England with duplicate dispatches announcing the successful end to the campaign.The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, for the Year 1864, Vol. 217 (September), p.394.Marshall (1829), Supplement‚ÄìPart 3, pp.359-362. In February 1811 the French privateer captured the American vessel Sally, Webber, master, as Sally was sailing from Charleston to Liverpool. Acteon recaptured Sally, which arrived at Plymouth on 13 February. That same day Cator arrived at the Admiralty; it turned out that he was the first with the good news. The Admiralty awarded him a gratuity of ¬£500 pounds for his good news. Acteons next mission was to carry a single letter to Calcutta and return with an answer. The sickly state of her crew meant that she often spent weeks sitting with the result that the voyage took 10 months. Acteon then cruised off Cherbourg and the Norwegian coast. On 24 January 1813 Minerva, Patterson, master, and Christiansand, Sinus, master, arrived at Hull. They were prizes to Acteon, which detained Minerva as Minerva was sailing from Gothenburg to Boston. At some point Acteon escorted the Russian fleet from the Baltic to Gothenburg. She was then caught up in severe winter gales on the Norwegian coast and sustained some damage that required her to put into Sheerness for repairs. Later in 1813 Acteon sailed to North America. On 22 September she landed marines at Lynhaven Bay by Hampton Roads. There, after a short action with American dragoons and infantry, the marines destroyed a barracks and its military stores, captured nine American soldiers, and killed and wounded several others. British casualties were one marine severely wounded. During the very severe winter of 1813 Acteon provided watering parties for the British squadron blockading the Chesapeake. She also assisted in the capture and destruction of numerous coasting vessels. Between 22 and 28 November she joined forces with to destroy two schooners and a sloop and capture three schooners and two sloops. All these vessels were coasters. The first was the New York, of 28 tons and four men. Then came the Phoebe, of 48 tons and five men. Next came the sloop Caroline, of 45 tons and five men. The fourth was the schooner Fredricksburgh, of 38 tons and two men. The fifth and sixth were the sloop Polly and the schooner Peggy, both of which the British burnt. The seventh was the schooner Lucy and Sally, of 48 tons and four men, sailing from Fredericksburgh to Onnacohe. The last was the schooner Poor Jack, of 26 tons and three men, also sailing from Fredericksburgh to Onnacohe. In December, Acteon, again working with Sophie, destroyed or captured seven small prizes. On 11 December the burnt a schooner of 37 tons. The next day they captured the 76-ton schooner Erie and its crew of nine men. (Erie, under the command of John Hearn, had been sailing from Havana to Baltimore with a cargo of sugar and coffee. The British unloaded the cargo and afterwards sent it to Bermuda, thereafter employing Erie as a tender to the British squadron in the Chesapeake.Vice-Admiralty Court (1911), Halifax, p.116. There Erie too captured several prizes.) On 12 December, Sophie and Acteon burnt two small schooners, one of 25 and one of 60 tons. Then on the 16th they burnt Little Elenea, of 59 tons and two men, sailing from Charleston to Baltimore. On the same day they also burnt a 69-ton sloop. Lastly, on 23 December Acteon and Sophie captured two vessels of 240 tons (bm). George and Betsey were both sailing from Baltimore to Lisbon. Acteon returned to Norwegian waters in 1814. On 7 June Cator received promotion to post captain. Commander John Ross (later an Arctic explorer), replaced Cator in command of Acteon. Acteon was part of a squadron of five vessels that detained Panther, Gegollae (or Gezoline), master, which was sailing from Martinique to Dunkirk. Panther arrived at Plymouth on 26 June 1815. ==Fate== The principal officers and commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the brig Acteon, of 353 tons, for sale at Portsmouth on 11 January 1816.Naval Chronicle Vol. 36, p.80. Acteon failed to sell on several sale dates. She was surveyed with the result that on 16 October the surveyors found that she was so decayed that she was no longer seaworthy. She was then broken up. ==NotesCitationsReferences== * * Fonds Marine. Campagnes (op√©rations; divisions et stations navales; missions diverses). Inventaire de la sous-s√©rie Marine BB4.

The episode premiered on February 15, 2001 on The WB. It features Rory going to a The Bangles concert with Paris, Madeline and Louise, and beginning to make friends with Paris, while Lorelai finds out about an ex-girlfriend of Luke's after buying one of the items he donates to the town's charity sale. ==Plot== Lorelai (Lauren Graham) has volunteered to store items for the town's charity clothing sale, and as a result her house is filled with donated items. Rory (Alexis Bledel) convinces her to give up much clothing from her wardrobe, but Lorelai cannot resist buying a sweatshirt with rhinestones that someone has donated. Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) arrives with four tickets to a The Bangles concert, for herself, Lorelai, Rory and Lane (Keiko Agena). Luke is instantly furious when he sees Lorelai wearing the sweatshirt from the charity sale, and yells at her though Lorelai does not understand what she has done wrong. She talks about it later to Sookie and Miss Patty (Liz Torres), who think that it formerly belonged to Rachel, Luke's ex-girlfriend. Rory has been put in a team with Paris (Liza Weil), Madeline (Shelly Cole) and Louise (Teal Redmann) for a history debate, much to Paris and Rory's annoyance. Tristan (Chad Michael Murray) flirts with Paris after class, saying that he wanted to be in a team with her. As no-one else's house is free, Rory suggests that they work at her house, despite its clutter. Lane initially asks her mother (Emily Kuroda) if she can go to a play with Lorelai, Rory and Sookie, but later admits that it is a rock concert, and Mrs. Kim will not allow her to go. Seeing the girls getting along, Lorelai suggests that Rory could go to the concert with Paris, Madeline and Louise. Rory agrees, and Lorelai buys cheap tickets with Sookie. At the concert, Lorelai keeps asking Sookie questions about Rachel, leading Sookie to question whether she is interested in Luke. Meanwhile, Madeline and Louise leave the concert to go to a party with two boys who were sitting behind them. Paris enjoys the band's music and talks with Rory about why she likes Tristan. After the concert, Lorelai is enraged to discover the girls have run off, and they find the party and drag Madeline and Louise away from it, with Lorelai shouting at them. Later, Rory tells Lorelai that Paris gave her half the debating time, a sign of friendship, and Lorelai apologises to Luke about wearing Rachel's clothing. ==Analysis== \\"Concert Interruptus\\" develops the characters of Luke and Paris, both of whom were previously \\"grumps with rare moments of humanity\\". Along with the following episode, \\"That Damn Donna Reed\\", it advances the relationship between Lorelai and Luke in a way that previous episodes did not. However, the main focus of the episode is Paris' growth; Paris was previously only seen as a bully, with the exception of her storyline in \\"Paris is Burning\\". This episode is part of the development that leads Rory and Paris to become friends. We also see the relationship between Paris, Madeline and Louise in more detail: Paris is indifferent to their \\"borderline nuts\\" actions, and acts as a \\"worker bee\\" and \\"wet blanket\\" in the group's dynamic. In Screwball Television, the author opines that Lorelai's clothing is an \\"extension of self\\". After Lorelai reluctantly gives away some of her clothing, she asks \\"Who wants cheese?\\", which can be seen as her experiencing separation anxiety and trying to cope with it by eating. J.M. Suarez comments that the episode is one of many to point out that \\"Lorelai's always a mother first\\", despite seeming \\"hip and young\\". Ritch Calvin notes that in the scene where Lorelai talks to Sookie and Miss Patty about Rachel, the focus of attention is on the clothing, and its ties to emotional memory, not the conversation. ==Reception== First airing on February 15, 2001 on The WB, the episode garnered 3.6 million viewers. David Sims of The A.V. Club criticizes that \\"it's a bit of a stretch\\" for Rory and Lane to be interested in The Bangles, but praises Paris' apathetic reaction to her friends as \\"great to watch\\". Listed by J.M. Suarez on PopMatters as one of 20 Gilmore Girls episodes to \\"Make You Excited for the Revival\\", \\"Concert Interruptus\\" is praised for The Bangles' performance and scenes of Rory and Paris' growing friendship. Out of the 153 episodes of Gilmore Girls, \\"Concert Interruptus\\" is ranked 115th by Paste and 140th by Vox. ==References * Concert Interruptus at The Internet Movie Database * Concert Interruptus at TV.com Category:Gilmore Girls episodes Category:2001 American television episodes ","title":"Concert Interruptus"},{"id":"56860613","text":"Clube da Crian√ßa () was a Brazilian children's television series in the Rede Manchete between June 6, 1983 and August 14, 1998. The attraction was exhibited from Monday to Sunday at 5:00 p.m. and Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. by mixing jokes with the audience, drawings and toy raffles. ==Background== In 1983, the director Maur√≠cio Shermann, then hired from TV Band decided to create a new children's show for programming. Remembering all the attractions for this age group he has already created, Shermann noted that in all of them they always had a pretty girl in charge. So he decided to invite Xuxa to present the show called TV Crian√ßa, and had a member of his team go to Rio de Janeiro to look for Model. There was no success with the attempt. Xuxa refused and even Alda, the mother of TV hots, even went to the room of Mauricio on the station asking for explanations about the invitation, which she suspected of the director's ulterior motives. Two months after leaving Bandeirantes, Shermann headed for the Manchete, a station where he also controlled a publishing house where Xuxa was often the cover of some publications. And again, the director tried to convince the then model to present a children's show. Surprised by the invitation, the model refused the invitation, claiming that she was following an international career as a model and the project did not interest her. Then, Mauricio talked to the player Pel√©, boyfriend of Xuxa at the time, that guaranteed that she would accept the project. So the director marked the first recording of the show for two weeks later. ==Development== The TV show, It premiered on June 6, 1983 at 5 pm led by Xuxa who played games, raffles, announced cartoons and received guests. After leaving Xuxa (1983-1986) for Globo TV in 1986, the program was canceled, and was replaced by the childish TV show Lupu Limpim Clapl√° Top√¥. He returned in October 1987, hosted by Ang√©lica (1987-1993) (as well as Xuxa, debuting in children's programs), then only 13 years old. After the transfer of Angelica to the SBT (1993), the program was hosted by the actress Mylla Christie (1993-1994). In the same year by former Miss Patr√≠cia Nogueira (1994-1995), but due to lack of financial resources, she left the air in 1995. After two years out of the air, the program returned being hosted by Debby Lagranha (1997-1998). With the serious crisis of the transmitter, the program left the air again and Debby transferred to the Globo TV. The program was created and directed by Maur√≠cio Sherman. The most enduring picture of the Club (in command of Xuxa) were the toy raffles sponsored by Estrela. In it, the children sent letters to the program asking to open one of the 3 boxes numbered that Xuxa showed in the attraction. The little boy got the surprise toy that was inside the box he asked to open it. In July 1985, Xuxa created two paintings in the Children's Club that would only become famous in the Xou da Xuxa.

The family moved to England in 1903 but returned to Canada in 1907, settling in Banff. She studied art with Jessie Topham Brown, a student of the Slade School of Fine Art. After she received an inheritance from her grandmother, she travelled to London and then Paris where she pursued further studies in art. She exhibited at the Salon des Surind√©pendants there in 1929. While in Paris, she studied engraving with J√≥zef Hecht. Her work was also shown at galleries in Paris, London and in Canada. Husband and her friend Alice Carr du Croft convinced Stanley William Hayter to teach them how to make prints. This was the start of Atelier 17. Around 1930, Husband and Hayter also began an affair which lasted until 1938. She worked with Hayter on two projects Solidarit√©, published in 1936, and Fraternit√©, published in 1939. Other artists participating in these projects included Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir√≥, Wassily Kandinsky, Andr√© Masson and Yves Tanguy. Funds raised by these projects supported the Spanish resistance and Spanish children. Husband returned to Canada at the start of World War II. In May 1940, she left for Mexico where a group of Canadian artists were working. She died in Mexico City of blood poisoning at the age of 44 after undergoing ear surgery. In 1989, the Winnipeg Art Gallery acquired a substantial collection of Husband's work. == References == Category:1899 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Canadian women painters Category:Canadian printmakers ","title":"Dalla Husband"},{"id":"56860839","text":"The Brisbane Lions' 1999 season was its third in the Australian Football League (AFL). ==Season summaryPremiership Season=== Home and away season {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px; font- weight:bold\\"  rowspan=2 Rd  rowspan=2Date and local time  rowspan=2 Opponent  colspan=2 Scores  rowspan=2 Venue  rowspan=2 Attendance - ! 78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px\\" Brisbane ! 78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px\\" Opponent - d9f9e9;\\"  1  align=left  27 March (7:40 pm)  align=left   152  63  The Gabba (H)  20,172 - fcc;\\"  2  align=left  3 April (9:00 pm)  align=left   73  83  Subiaco Oval (A)  29,932 - fcc;\\"  3  align=left  10 April (7:40 pm)  align=left   80  103  The Gabba (H)  21,092 - d9f9e9;\\"  4  align=left  17 April (7:40 pm)  align=left   115  54  The Gabba (H)  21,360 - d9f9e9;\\"  5  align=left  25 April (9:00 pm)  align=left   108  53  Subiaco Oval (A)  24,044 - d9f9e9;\\"  6  align=left  1 May (7:10 pm)  align=left   93  70  The Gabba (H)  21,753 - d9f9e9;\\"  7  align=left  8 May (7:40 pm)  align=left   96  62  The Gabba (H)  22,023 - fcc;\\"  8  align=left  16 May (2:10 pm)  align=left   119  135  Melbourne Cricket Ground (A)  28,217 - d9f9e9;\\"  9  align=left  23 May (2:40 pm)  align=left   144  87  The Gabba (H)  22,948 - fcc;\\"  10  align=left  5 June (7:40 pm)  align=left   44  66  The Gabba (H)  17,665 - d9f9e9;\\"  11  align=left  12 June (2:10 pm)  align=left   94  78  Princes Park (A)  24,235 - fcc;\\"  12  align=left  19 June (7:40 pm)  align=left   71  89  The Gabba (H)  24,989 - d9f9e9;\\"  13  align=left  27 June (2:40 pm)  align=left   133  98  Sydney Cricket Ground (A)  25,528 - fcc;\\"  14  align=left  3 July (2:10 pm)  align=left   100  102  Melbourne Cricket Ground (A)  24,189 - d9f9e9;\\"  15  align=left  10 July (7:40 pm)  align=left   92  61  The Gabba (H)  22,758 - d9f9e9;\\"  16  align=left  17 July (2:10 pm)  align=left   107  68  Waverley Park (A)  22,268 - d9f9e9;\\"  17  align=left  25 July (2:10 pm)  align=left   166  66  The Gabba (H)  22,186 - d9f9e9;\\"  18  align=left  1 August (2:10 pm)  align=left   118  66  Football Park (A)  33,345 - d9f9e9;\\"  19  align=left  8 August (2:10 pm)  align=left   83  44  Football Park (A)  33,398 - d9f9e9;\\"  20  align=left  15 August (2:10 pm)  align=left   181  67  The Gabba (H)  23,845 - d9f9e9;\\"  21  align=left  21 August (2:10 pm)  align=left   159  104  Melbourne Cricket Ground (A)  18,679 - d9f9e9;\\"  22  align=left  28 August (2:10 pm)  align=left   94  52  Victoria Park (A)  24,493 } Finals series {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px; font-weight:bold\\"  rowspan=2 Rd  rowspan=2Date and local time  rowspan=2 Opponent  colspan=2 Scores  rowspan=2 Venue  rowspan=2 Attendance - ! 78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px\\" Brisbane ! 78184A; color:gold; border: solid blue 2px\\" Opponent - d9f9e9;\\"  Second qualifying final  align=left  4 September (7:45 pm)  align=left   138  65  The Gabba  26,112 - d9f9e9;\\"  Second semi-final  align=left  11 September (7:45 pm)  align=left   126  73  The Gabba  24,045 - fcc;\\"  First preliminary final  align=left  17 September (7:45 pm)  align=left   78  123  Melbourne Cricket Ground (A)  61,031 } ==LadderReferences== Brisbane Lions Season, 1999 Category:Brisbane Lions seasons ","title":"1999 Brisbane Lions season"},{"id":"56860857","text":"Ethiopian Railway, commonly known as ER, full name Ethiopian Railway Corporation is the national railway operator of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, under the regulation of the Ministry of Transport.

She was active in women's groups and in Republican politics, being an alternate delegate to the 1920 Republican National Convention in Chicago. She covered the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, where \\"she had the advantage of speaking French, and she interviewed the envoys of foreign countries which sent exhibits and had buildings in Forest Park.\\" In 1905, Marion was called a \\"famous feature writer\\" after she returned from attending a convention of the Federated Women's Clubs in Paris, Missouri, where she wrote a guest column for the local newspaper, the Paris Mercury.

She continued work for the Post-Dispatch on a part-time basis until 1913, when she went to the Globe-Democrat.

His grandfather was colonial politician Walter Duffield. He was educated at St Peter's College in Adelaide. Moving to England, Duffield graduated in Arts from Cambridge in 1906 and a diploma in agriculture the following year. At Cambridge he was part of the Footlights Club. == Career == As a young man in England, Duffield composed words for songs with lyrics including by A.A. Milne and P.G. Wodehouse, and had a number of songs published. He returned to work at the family station Koonoona in South Australia for eight years. Soon before the outbreak of World War I, Duffield returned to England. He enlisted and rose to be a captain in the Royal Warwick Regiment. He was said to have \\"entertained troops on a battered 80 franc French piano, which was carried in a 30 franc cart\\". Between 1920 and 1922, Duffield contributed music for West End revues including Puss! Puss! (Vaudeville Theatre, 1921), Pot Luck (Vaudeville Theatre, 1921), A to Z (Prince of Wales Theatre, 1921) and Snap (Vaudeville Theatre, 1922). He again returned to South Australia in 1922 to manage Koonoona following the death of his father. His musical comedy Hullo Healo was first presented in Adelaide in 1924 (as Healo) and at the Palace Theatre in Sydney in 1927. In the late 1920s he returned to London where he contributed to further musical revues. Duffield published an autobiography Savages and Kings in 1946, and retired to Adelaide in 1948. == References == Category:1885 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Australian musical theatre composers Category:People from Adelaide ","title":"Kenneth Duffield"},{"id":"56860949","text":"The First Presbyterian Church in Bridgewater, South Dakota was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

He then went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he received a commission as a second lieutenant into the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 11 November 1914, and was given the service number of 8864. He saw service in the First World War on the Western Front, mainly with the 1st Battalion, KRRC,Smart, p. 340 which then formed part of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division. During his service he was promoted to lieutenant on 14 October 1915, and captain on 22 April 1918 (with seniority backdated to 11 February 1917), was wounded in action, awarded the Military Cross in February 1917, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and mentioned in dispatches, both in 1919. ===Between the wars=== Remaining in the army during the interwar period, Wilson served in Ireland with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC during the Anglo Irish War. He married in 1922 and attended the Staff College, Camberley, from 1928 to 1929. Among his fellow students there included several who would become general officers during the Second World War, such as Gerald Templer, John Harding, Richard McCreery, Gerard Bucknall, Charles Miller, Alexander Galloway, Alexander Cameron, Philip Gregson-Ellis, Charles Murison, Claude Nicholson, William Holmes, I. S. O. Playfair and Gordon MacMillan. After graduating from Camberley Wilson served briefly again with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC before being sent to the War Office, where he served as a General staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) from January 1931 until March 1932. Promoted on 1 January 1932 to the brevet rank of major, and major on 27 July 1932, Wilson served for just under three years, from March 1932 to January 1935, as Commander of the Company of Gentleman Cadets at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1936, he then returned to the War Office, this time serving as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, from February 1936. Relinquishing this post on 18 January 1938, he was made Military Assistant to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), then General Lord Gort. On 1 August 1938 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and succeeded Lieutenant Colonel Evelyn Barker, a fellow KRRC officer and student at the Staff College, as Commanding officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, KRRC. The battalion was then serving in England as part of the Mobile Division (later the 1st Armoured Division), then under Major General Roger Evans. Wilson commanded the battalion until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. He commanded the infantry school at Barnard Castle School in July 1942, assisted by Colonel James Mardall. ==Bibliography== * ==References *Generals of World War II Category:1896 births Category:1961 deaths Category:British Army generals of World War II Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British military personnel of the Irish War of Independence Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:King's Royal Rifle Corps officers Category:Machine Gun Corps officers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:People educated at West Downs School Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:People from Lymington Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:War Office personnel in World War II ","title":"Thomas Needham Furnival Wilson"},{"id":"56860960","text":"The 1985 Giro d'Italia was the 68th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours.

The women's division held their championships a little over a week later, separately, eighty miles southwest at La Playa Stadium on the campus of Santa Barbara City College, California. Both tracks were dirt tracks, technically a finely crushed brick surface. This is the meet where Jim Ryun set the world record in the mile, uncharacteristically leading from the gun in 3:51.1, which lasted for almost eight years.

The show was loosely based on the Arabian Nights story. It was originally intended to run for 48 episodes but it went off-air in June 2001 abruptly due to a conflict between the production house and Zee TV. It was directed by Vijay Pandey, who has earlier directed shows like Sword of Tipu Sultan, Great Maratha, Arth, Des Mein Nikla Hoga Chand and Saat Phere. It was also syndicated on sister channels Zee Next and Zee Smile and Zee Anmol. == Synopsis == Set in the Middle East during an era of marvellous adventures and magical folk tales as narrated in the Arabian Nights, 'Thief of Baghdad' tells the story of Jafar, a ruthless warlord serving under the command of the evil genie 'Shah Jinn' and his obsession with conquering the entire world to become its undisputed king. Shortly after invading the city of Baghdad with his army and brutally vanquishing a secret rebellion led by Mukhtar, a spiritual leader and revolutionary, Jafar is informed by Shah Jinn and his sorceress aide Badi about a prospect which can greatly assist him in achieving his seemingly overwhelming objective. Jafar must convince a princess belonging to a peaceful kingdom of fairies to marry him of her own volition in order to gain complete authority and control over the inhabitants of both realms. Immediately, he decides to interrupt the birthday celebration of the beautiful princess Yasmeen and take her away from her kingdom to imprison her in his palace full of grim spells preventing her from escaping back to her home. As the princess begins to develop feelings of despair and anguish, hope appears in the form of a notorious thief known only throughout the city as the 'Thief of Baghdad', a sly and artful hero who steals from the rich to help the poor and oppressed. One night during an intrusion into Jafar's palace to retrieve a collection of magical items stolen from three visiting merchants, the Thief coincidentally encounters the captive princess and they both recall their romance with each other prior to the events which unfolded with the appearance of Jafar. Realising the severity of the situation and its impact on every inhabitant in both realms, the Thief decides to do whatever he can to stop the tyranny of Jafar and rescue the Princess from his vile grasp. As the series progresses the Thief and several allies he forms relationships with all have to endure and overcome the dangerous obstacles and ghastly traps Jafar has set to secure his position as the ultimate king of kings. (Unfortunately, due to a dispute between the production house and Zee TV, the remaining episodes of the series were never completed or aired on television and the final resolution to the story remains unknown.) == Cast == *Ahmed aka Thief Of Baghdad ‚Äì Narendra Jha *Yasmeen ‚Äì Kim Lasrado *Jafar ‚Äì Vikrant Chaturvedi *Tugral - Shiva *Abbas - Javed Khan *Masood - Surinder Pal *Qasim - Browney Prasher *Jamal Zardari - Puneetchandra Sharrma *Faridgul - Shailendra Shrivastav *Zareen ‚Äì Pallavi Solanki *Badi - Zahida *Neki - Jaya Mathur *Khanam - Asha Bachani *Yusuf Sani - Sunil Nagar *Malika Nasreen - Seema Pandey *Firoz Bakht ‚Äì Sumit Pathak *Alim Haqqani - Prithvi Zutshi *Azra ‚Äì Shashi Sharma *Kulsum - Prerna Agarwal *Chitrasen - Radha Kishan *Zahoor Malkooti - Sanjay Batra *Usman - Mukesh Ahuja *Rustam - Master Mohit Makkad *Hakimbaba - Shahnawaz *Raziya - Rajshree * == References  * Category:1990s Indian television series Category:1999 Indian television series debuts Category:2000 Indian television series endings Category:Zee TV original programming Category:Indian fantasy television series Category:Works based on One Thousand and One Nights Category:2000s Indian television series Category:Indian epic television series Category:Genies in television Category:Television series about dragons ","title":"Thief of Baghdad (TV series)"},{"id":"56861182","text":"Statistics of Empress's Cup in the 1991 season. ==Overview== It was contested by 20 teams, and Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies won the championship.RSSSF ==Results1st Round=== *Toyama Ladies SC 0-3 Fujita Tendai SC Mercury *Ishinomaki Women's Commercial High School 1-0 Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences *Ube Super Ladies 0-4 Ozu High School *Matsushita Electric LSC Bambina 0-0 (pen 3-0) Shiroki FC Serena ===2nd Round=== *Yomiuri SC Beleza 3-0 Fujita Tendai SC Mercury *Sagamihara LSC 1-2 Asahi Kokusai Bunnys *Nissan FC 11-0 Shibecha Ladies *Ishinomaki Women's Commercial High School 0-5 Nikko Securities Dream Ladies *Prima Ham FC Kunoichi 7-0 Ozu High School *Uwajima Minami High School 0-2 Tasaki Kobe *Shinko Seiko FC Clair 0-0 (pen 4-2) Nippon Sport Science University *Matsushita Electric LSC Bambina 0-3 Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Quarterfinals=== *Yomiuri SC Beleza 3-0 Asahi Kokusai Bunnys *Nissan FC 2-1 Nikko Securities Dream Ladies *Prima Ham FC Kunoichi 3-1 Tasaki Kobe *Shinko Seiko FC Clair 0-5 Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Semifinals=== *Yomiuri SC Beleza 4-0 Nissan FC *Prima Ham FC Kunoichi 0-1 Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Final=== *Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies 3-1 Yomiuri SC Beleza Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies won the championship. ==References== Category:Empress's Cup Category:1991 in Japanese women's football ","title":"1991 Empress's Cup"},{"id":"56861210","text":"Statistics of Empress's Cup in the 1992 season. ==Overview== It was contested by 20 teams, and Nikko Securities Dream Ladies won the championship.RSSSF ==Results1st Round=== *Gifu Ladies FC 0-4 Tasaki Kobe *Toyama Ladies SC 3-1 FC Sera Fuchu *Sapporo Linda 3-2 Ozu High School *Shinko Seiko FC Clair 10-0 Ota Gal ===2nd Round=== *Yomiuri Nippon SC Beleza 6-1 Tasaki Kobe *Fujita Tendai SC Mercury 2-0 Ishinomaki Women's Commercial High School *Prima Ham FC Kunoichi 5-0 Nippon Sport Science University *Toyama Ladies SC 0-8 Matsushita Electric LSC Bambina *Nikko Securities Dream Ladies 11-0 Sapporo Linda *Shiroki FC Serena 0-3 Asahi Kokusai Bunnys *Nissan FC 4-0 Takatsuki FC *Shinko Seiko FC Clair 0-1 Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Quarterfinals=== *Yomiuri Nippon SC Beleza 2-1 Fujita Tendai SC Mercury *Prima Ham FC Kunoichi 1-1 (pen 6-5) Matsushita Electric LSC Bambina *Nikko Securities Dream Ladies 7-0 Asahi Kokusai Bunnys *Nissan FC 0-1 Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Semifinals=== *Yomiuri Nippon SC Beleza 1-1 (pen 4-3) Prima Ham FC Kunoichi *Nikko Securities Dream Ladies 3-3 (pen 5-3) Suzuyo Shimizu FC Lovely Ladies ===Final=== *Yomiuri Nippon SC Beleza 0-1 Nikko Securities Dream Ladies Nikko Securities Dream Ladies won the championship. ==References== Category:Empress's Cup Category:1992 in Japanese women's football ","title":"1992 Empress's Cup"},{"id":"56861255","text":"Satish Sardar or Satish Chandra Sardar (1902 - 19 June 1932) was a Bengali revolutionary and martyr of the civil disobedience movement in Bengal. ==Early life== Satish Sardar was born in British India at Chanderghat village presently in Tehatta subdivision, Nadia.

Penerbad is considered as an integral part mainly in cases of Air assault operations parallel to other Armament Corps of the Indonesian Army. Other additional tasks conducted by the unit can be implemented to support non-combat operations such as Search and rescue, Disaster relief, etc. ==History== Indonesian Army - MBB (IPTN) NBO-105CB-4 Indonesian Army Aviation helicopters training in Natuna Island, Riau Island The Indonesian army aviation was born in 1959 when the doctrine of Heliborne Troops or Air Mobile was being developed in various countries. In Sarawak, the British SAS launched an air assault operation with Westland Wessex Mk.1 helicopter containing 16 personnel. During the Vietnam War, the United States Army operated in the form of Air Cavalry by the 1st Cavalry Division and Sky Soldiers by the 173rd Airborne Brigade using UH-1N Huey, UH-1 Iroquois and CH-47 Chinook helicopters supported by AH-1S attack helicopter Cobra and CH-54 Flying Crane. In Algeria, the French Army conducted a similar operation earlier with the Alouette-III. When the Chief of Staff of the Army made a Decree on the establishment of the Army Aviation Detachment (Detasemen Penerbad) on November 14, 1959 with the task of taking care of all activities concerning the field of organic army aviation, at that time Detasemen Penerbad did not have any aircraft at all. At that time the news was heard that Dr. AK. Gani's DHC-2 Mk.1 Beaver plane which was being overhauled in Singapore will be sold, then the army immediately bought it. As a follow up, some officers including Captain Binjamin Hadi, Captain Burhan Ali and Captain Sukartono were sent to the United States to attend an aviator training at the US Army Aviation School in Fort Rucker, Alabama in 1959 followed by a second batch in 1962 consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Juono, Captain Dolf Latumahina, Captain Sudewo, Captain Daud Natawiyoga, 1st Lt T.M.F. Worang and several other officers. It bore fruit when the Detachment later acquired two Cessna L-19 aircraft in the framework of the US Military Assistant Program in 1964, followed on by 15 Soviet-made Mil Mi-4 medium and 1 Mil Mi-6 heavy multipurpose helicopters, together with 2 American made Aero Commander 680FL utility aircraft in 1965. These purchases made Indonesia the one of the pioneer countries in Southeast Asia to have a strong army aviation force, and thus, the Detachment was transformed via Decision Kep/853/VII/1963 of the Chief of Staff of the Army on 22 July 1963 into the Army Aviation Service (Dispenerbad), which adopted its current name on 15 January 1966 (name readopted on 26 May 2000).http://www.puspenerbad- tniad.mil.id/index.php/profil == Mission == The mission of Indonesian Army Aviation is to find, fix, and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver; and to provide combat, combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations as an integral member of the combined arms team. On the modern battlefield, Indonesian Army Aviation, unlike the other members of the combined arms team, has the organic flexibility, versatility, and assets to fulfill a variety of maneuver, CS, CSS, roles and functions. These cover the spectrum of combined arms operations. Aviation can accomplish each of these roles‚Äîwithin the limits of finite assets and capabilities‚Äîduring offensive or defensive operations and also for joint, combined, contingency, or special operations, as well as in civil-military operations such as disaster relief. As a Central Executive Agency of the Army with greater importance, its Commander and Deputy Commander, filled up by officers of Major General and Brigadier General rank, respectively, are appointed and relieved from their positions by the Chief of Staff of the Army. Training is imparted to all enlistees and graduate officers assigned at the Army Aviation Corps Training school in Semarang, where they receive specialized training in helicopter warfare. ==Squadrons== Puspenerbad currently has five squadrons and one training center, which are: *11th Squadron/Assault (Semarang, Central Java) *12th Squadron/Assault (Waytuba, Lampung) *13th Squadron/Assault (Berau, East Kalimantan) *21st Squadron/Sena (Pondok Cabe, South Tangerang, Banten) *31st Squadron/Assault (Semarang, Central Java) *Army Aviation Corps Training school (Pusdik Penerbad) located at Semarang, Central Java ==Airbases== #Army Airbase Ahmad Yani, at Semarang #Army Airbase Pondok Cabe, at South Tangerang #Army Airbase Gatot Subroto, at Way Kanan regency, Lampung ==Equipment== {  ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Aircraft ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Origin ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Role ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Versions ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"In service ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Note - ! style=\\"align: center; background: lavender;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"  Aircraft -  Beechcraft Premier I   VIP transport  Premier I  1 https://www.indomiliter.com/beechcraft-390-premier-i-pesawat-jet-vip- puspenerbad-tni-ad/  - -  CASA C-212 Aviocar   Maritime Patrol & Tactical Transport  NC-212-200  4  Manufactured under license by Indonesian Aerospace - ! style=\\"align: center; background: lavender;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"  Helicopters -  MBB BO 105   Utility/Assault gunship  NBO-105https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibbpPlDpSw8  30  -  Mil Mi-17 Hip-H   Utility  Mi-17V-5https://www.indomiliter.com/mil-mi-17-v5-helikopter- angkut-multi-peran-andalan-puspenerbad  16  -  Mil Mi-35 Hind   Assault gunship  Mi-35Phttps://www.indomiliter.com/enam-tahun-beroperasi-mil- mi-35p-puspenerbad-tni-ad-jalani-overhaul-di-rusia  5  -  Bell 412   Utility/Assault gunship  Bell 412 \\\\---- Bell 412SP \\\\---- Bell 412EP  14 \\\\---- 14 \\\\---- 9https://www.janes.com/article/93186/ptdi-receives-two- bell-412epi-helicopters-for-indonesian-army  Manufactured under license by Indonesian Aerospace -  Airbus Helicopters Fennec   light attack helicopters  AS550 \\\\---- AS555  6 (single-engine)\\"Indonesian Army receives the first helicopter Fennec\\", www.strategic-bureau.com, 10 November 2014 \\\\---- 6 (twin-engine)  -  Boeing AH-64 Apache   attack helicopters  AH-64E  8 Ellis Taylor, \\"Boeing awarded Indonesian Apache contract\\", www.flightglobal.com, 27 Januari 2015  } ==References * Video profile of Puspenerbad * http://www.penerbad.my.id/ Category:Indonesian Army Category:Military of Indonesia Category:Army aviation Category:Military units and formations established in 1959 Category:1959 establishments in Indonesia Category:Army aviation units and formations ","title":"Indonesian Army Aviation Command"},{"id":"56861278","text":"Bhargavi Narayan is an Indian film actress in the Kannada film industry, and a theatre artist in Karnataka, India.

La Torre died on July 5, 1984. ==Early life== La Torre was born on March 12, 1886, in Montedoro, Sicily, to Giuseppe La Torre and Maria Marranca. He entered the United States in May 1903,Passenger Manifest for the S.S. Sicilian Prince, May 16, 1903, available at Ellis Island: The Statue of Liberty. settling in Pittston, Pennsylvania. He set up a criminal empire in Pittston- Scranton-Wilkes-barre areas of Pennsylvania. La Torre paid for the passage of Mafia boss Santo Volpe to Pennsylvania in 1906. They formed \\"the men from Montedoro\\". In April 1907, La Torre was arrested with Santo Volpe, Charles Bufalino, uncle of future crime boss Russell Bufalino, and twenty other men for a protection racket against mine workers in the region.

Presently, he is Judge of Kerala High Court.Appointment order The High Court of Kerala is the highest court of Judicature for the State of Kerala and Union Territory of Lakshadweep. == Early life == Devan Ramachandran did his schooling from Bhavan's Vidya Mandir, Elamakkara, Ernakulam and completed Pre-degree (plus two) from the Sacred Heart College, Thevara. Thereafter, took his law degree from Government Law College, Ernakulam. He started practice as an advocate in 1991, under the guidance of his father Senior Advocate Mr. M.P.R Nair, Barrister-in-Law (Middle Temple- London). == Career == He practiced in various modern branches of law including corporate, company and constitutional matters. In recognition of his eminence, the Kerala High Court had engaged services of Sri Devan Ramachandran to be its advocate/counsel when he was just 35 years, making him the youngest one to do so till date. Mr Devan Ramachandran also served as standing counsel for the CBSE, various Private and Public companies, various banking and financial institutions, including the Indian Banks Association, the principal financial advisory mechanism to Reserve Bank of India. == Achievements == He was designated as a 'Senior Advocate' by the High Court of Kerala, in 2015. Justice Devan Ramachandran and his father are credited to be the first; and until now, the only father-son duo till date to be designated as 'Senior Advocates' by the High Court of Kerala. The High Court of Kerala had also appointed Justice Devan, while he was a Counsel, to assist as an Amicus Curiae (friend of court) in a suo motu Public Interest Litigation pertaining to the illegal trafficking of children from North India to Kerala. The Indian Express recognised Justice Devan Ramachandran as a Newsmaker in 2019 for his judgments that impacted public life. == Notable cases == , The recent notable judgement authored by Justice Ramachandran relates to a controversial contract granted by the Government of Kerala to an American company called ‚ÄúSprinklr‚Äù for processing the data of patients and persons suspected of COVID-19 in Kerala. Objections came to be raised from several quarters that this will lead to data confidentiality breach and petitions were filed by several persons against the said contract. Through an order, Justice Ramachandran, sitting with Justice Ravi, directed the Government to anonymise the entire data before it is handed over to Sprinklr for processing; further injuncting Sprinklr from committing any breach of confidentiality or dealing with the data against the terms of the confidentiality clauses in the agreement. The Government is also directed to obtain the consent of each citizen, at the time their data is collected, before handing it over to Sprinklr or other third party data processors. The Columbia University Journal has hailed this order to be ‚Äúextra ordinary‚Äù from the angle of data protection. The condition of bad roads and flooding in Kochi City and other parts of Kerala has been engaging the High Court through Justice Ramachandran. He has been issuing several orders in succession with respect to this and have delivered a judgement asking engineers and officers in charge of all the roads in Kerala to repair it by the end of January, 2020. On account of this the condition of roads have vastly improved. However, in the meanwhile a young person died in a pothole and Justice Ramachandran took note of it suo Motu and issued urgent directions, at the same time showing his humanistic face by apologising to the victim's family for the systemic failure that lead to the accident. Justice Devan Ramachandran has also now constituted a High Level Committee, constituted of the District Collector, Commissioner of Police and other responsible officers to repair and maintain all the Canals and drains in the city of Kochi by March, 2020 to ensure that there is no flooding in monsoons in future. Reacting to the death of a pedestrian by electrocution from a snapped overhead line on a public street, Justice Devan initiated a suo motu case against the Electricity Board and issued directions to it to avert such in future. Justice Devan Ramachandran has very recently delivered a long needed judgment directing the State Police Chief to ensure that the Police Force behaves as a modern, civilized and professional force; saying :\\"The Police force is a professional Force and every civilized nation requires its Police Department to act with equanimity even in the face of extreme vexation, instigation or stress.\\" Justice Ramachandran has been writing judgments on the need for protection and conservation of environment, ecology and nature. He has, sitting in Division, banned the use of plastics at the Sabarimala Hills and shrine, including in the \\"irumudikettu\\", the traditional offering carried by pilgrims. This judgment has now forced Government of Kerala to ban single-use plastics in the whole of Kerala. Again, Justice Devan Ramachandran, reacting to the horrific damage being caused to ecology by what is commonly called the \\"Flex Boards\\" found carelessly placed all over public spaces in Kerala, ordered strict legal regulation of installation and erection of unauthorised Flex boards/ Advertisement Boards/ Bill Boards / Flags in any public space all over Kerala. This case is still pending and several further orders have been issued, under the concept of continuing mandamus, to ensure that such boards are implicitly regulated as per law. As a direct impact of these orders, the Government of Kerala has issued an order banning ‚ÄúFlex Boards‚Äù in the state Expressing deep empathy with an ‚Äúendosulphan victim‚Äù who got entangled in recovery proceedings consequent to default of loan availed by him to meet medical expenses of his children, Justice Devan directed the Government to write off the loan. Further exhibiting deep humanism, Justice Devan, evolving a new principle termed \\"Lost Life\\", ordered payment as special compensation to be paid to the mother of a minor victim in a motor accident case for the first time ever, recognising her to be the ‚Äúreal victim‚Äù. The accident victim had been reduced to a permanent vegetative state pursuant to the accident and has remained as such for the past 13 years. Justice Devan Ramachandran ruled, again in a first of its kind judgment, in November 2017, that a minister whilst he is holding such a position cannot file a case against one's own government or its functionaries. The judgment was rendered in case filed by Sri Thomas Chandy, an erstwhile minister in the State of Kerala. Through a separate judgment, a first and unique of its kind in Indian Legal Jurisprudence touching upon the aspects of 'Cabinet Confidentiality' and 'Cabinet Solidarity', Justice Devan explained the concept of 'Cabinet Collective Responsibility' as follows: \\"Article 164(2) of the Constitution of India makes it indubitable that the Cabinet shall be collectively responsible to the legislature. The word used is ‚Äòcollectively‚Äô, which means that the legislature will act cohesively as one unit. Viewed from that angle, it is certain that when a person acts as a Minister, he acts as a constituent of the Cabinet, and he cannot act against it or, in any matter, against the interests of the Government\\" Through a Judgment delivered in October 2017, in T.M. Thomas v State of Kerala, Justice Devan had called for mechanism ensuring active participation of victims in criminal proceedings along with the State, rather than being a mere outsider to such proceedings. The Director General of Police, in compliance with the above judgment has subsequently issued a circular to honor in letter and spirit the terms of the said judgment. Justice Devan upholding the autonomy and independence of Universities in granting No Objection Certificates (N.O.C's) to start new courses, further held that they are not subservient to any Government. Describing the long human chain formation (queue) in front of liquor shops across the state as an \\"affront to the dignity of citizenry and loss of self respect\\", Justice Ramachandran, issued various directions to the State Excise Department to do away with such a practice with consideration for self respect and upholding humanitarian values In a batch of writ petitions concerning the illegal encroachments and damages caused to lakes and biodiversity, Stressing on the Constitutional obligation of every citizen under Articles 49 and 51A he opined that \\"Conservation of biodiversity is vital to response to climate change and in the delivery of key ecosystem services like food, flood management, pollination, clean air and water. Conservation includes restoring and enhancing species, populations and habitats and in the optimal sustainable yield in the use of natural resources\\". In a judgment delivered in 2016, Justice Devan Ramachandran, expressed deep anguish and concern over the deteriorating status of Legal education across the country. Justice Devan, who penned the judgment sitting in Division Bench, directed that the legal education imparted across the country should be done with a trajectory (vision) towards the future. == References  External links == * http://www.livelaw.in/tag/justice- devan-ramachandran/ * http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/High-Court-to- get-two-new-judges/article14991171.ece * https://scroll.in/latest/865381/kerala-documents-not-enough-to-substantiate- land-grab-allegations-against-thomas-chandy-says-hc Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:Judges of the Kerala High Court ","title":"Devan Ramachandran"},{"id":"56861372","text":"Hendrik van der Meer (12 January 1916 ‚Äì 25 April 1985) was a Dutch rower who won the European title in the double scull event in 1947, together with Tom Neumeier.

A former undocumented immigrant (DREAMer), Cruz has worked as an advocate for immigration rights, including as Director of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's 2016 Exploited Task Force. Cruz was elected as the Democratic candidate in the Fall 2018 election for the 39th district of the New York State Assembly, representing Corona, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights, Queens. == Early life and education == Cruz was born in Medell√≠n, Colombia. In 1992, when she was nine years old, Cruz and her mother came to the United States under a six month tourist visa. They remained in the U.S. and she was undocumented for over 10 years after her initial tourist visa expired. Cruz grew up in Brooklyn and Queens. She has five siblings, three of whom are U.S. citizens. Cruz became the first former undocumented immigrant who identifies as a DREAMer to be elected in New York state. (Both Adriano Espaillat and Gabriela Rosa were former undocumented immigrants who served in the New York State legislature, but neither identifies as a DREAMer.) She is also the first Colombian-American in the district, and only the third DREAMer to serve in an elected position in the United States.In 2001, Cruz graduated from John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. In 2005, Cruz received a bachelor's degree with honors in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In 2009, Cruz received a J.D. from the City University of New York School of Law. == Career == After law school Cruz worked as a Volunteer Assistant Attorney General for the New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, where her case work included focusing on fraud related to immigration services and working on prosecution efforts. From 2009 to 2012, Cruz was counsel at the Goddard Riverside SRO Law Project at the Goddard Riverside Community Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. From 2012 to 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Division of Immigrant Policies and Affairs at the New York State Department of Labor. In 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Immigration Committee for the New York City Council, where she worked to improve coverage of issue related to domestic worker trafficking. She worked on the Unaccompanied Minors Initiative and the IDNYC program. She also oversaw the Key to the City program. She was in this position until 2015. From 2015 to 2017, Cruz was the Director of the Office of the New York State Governor, Andrew Cuomo. During this time she was the Special Assistant for Labor & Workforce. She was also the Director of the Joint Task Force on Worker Exploitation and Employee Misclassification, also known as the Exploited Workers Task Force, a working as assistant counsel in Cuomo's taskforce. In 2017, Cruz became Chief of Staff for New York City Council Member, Julissa Ferreras-Copeland until Ferreras-Copeland made the decision not to seek re- election. == New York Assembly == In February 2018, Cruz announced her candidacy for Francisco Moya's vacated position on the New York State Assembly's Assembly District 39. The District's Democratic leadership instead unanimously selected Ari Espinal as the Democratic candidate in the April 2018 special election. Cruz then won the Democratic primary for District 39 on September 13, 2018 over Espinal, and won the seat on November 6, 2018. She had received campaign training from New American Leaders that she believes helped her ultimately fundraise nearly $200,000 to win the primary race. == Personal life == Cruz identifies as a DREAMer under the unadopted DREAM Act that was introduced in 2001, which addresses citizenship of children brought to the United States by their parents and living as undocumented citizens. Cruz married her high school boyfriend in 2003, which allowed Cruz to get her green card in 2005 and become a U.S. citizen in 2009. Cruz' citizenship allowed her to sponsor her mother's citizenship. The marriage ended in divorce. Cruz is married to a New York Police Department police officer. She and her husband live in Jackson Heights, Queens. Cruz has said that the attorney who did her immigration papers inspired her to go to law school and become a lawyer. == References  External links == * at New York State Assembly Category:Politicians from Queens, New York Category:American people of Colombian descent Category:American politicians of Colombian descent Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Political activists Category:Living people Category:1980s births Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:Members of the New York State Assembly Category:Women state legislators in New York (state) Category:People from Jackson Heights, Queens Category:Hispanic and Latino American state legislators in New York (state) Category:Undocumented immigrants to the United States ","title":"Catalina Cruz"},{"id":"56861449","text":"J√∏rn Peter Snogdahl (1 October 1922 ‚Äì 1 July 2012) was a Danish rower.

It flows through Castile and Leon (specifically the provinces of Segovia and Valladolid). It has a total length of 134 km and drains a basin with an area of 2940 km¬≤. == Name == The name of the river has been derived from the Iberian \\"Iri-sama\\" which means \\"that which surrounds the big city\\". The city referred to here is not Segovia itself as sometimes thought, but rather the town of Coca located some 50 km away. == Geography == The Eresma River starts in Valsa√≠n valley of the Sierra de Guadarrama, where the confluence of several streams forms the river. Most of these streams descend from the slopes of mountains like Pe√±alara, Siete Picos and Mont√≥n de Trigo. Its most important tributaries are Moros and the Voltoya that flow northward. After passing through San Ildefonso and Palazuelos, it reaches the city of Segovia, which it surrounds in a closed meander. Eresma river then runs northwest, passing near Hontanares, Los Huertos, Bernardos, Navas de Oro, Coca and Villeguillo. It enters the province of Valladolid through Olmedo, Pedrajas, Alcazar√©n and Hornillos. Later it flows from the right into the Adaja in Matapozuelos. Eresma river has pluvio-nival regime, which means that it has a period of high water flow in autumn and winter season in proportion to precipitation and short, violent water flow in the spring when the snow melts. == References == Category:Rivers of Castile and Le√≥n Category:Rivers of Spain Category:Tributaries of the Adaja ","title":"Eresma River"},{"id":"56861466","text":"Uni.T (; stylized as UNI.T) was a South Korean girl group formed by The Unit Culture Industry Company through the KBS survival show The Unit.

Papin was noted in St. Louis Roman Catholic circles because of his friendship with high dignitaries of the church and the fact that he had been granted private audiences by Popes Leo XIII and Pius X. He went to Vatican City in 1912 to deliver to Pope Pius the testimony taken in connection with the canonization of Rose Philippine Duchesne of the Sacred Heart Convent in St. Charles, Missouri. He booked a ticket on the SS Titanic for his return trip, but canceled at the last moment, thus avoiding the sinking of the liner when it struck an iceberg.

The main artery is Ban Khrua Nuea in Soi Kasem San 3, Rama I Road, the boundary between Ratchathewi and Pathum Wan Districts. ==History== The community dates back to the reign of King Rama I, who granted the land to Islamic Cham troops after they had fought with the Siamese Army in the Songkhram Kao Thap, the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War in 1785‚Äì1786, the last major battle fought against Burmese invaders. The Cham had migrated from the Champa realm (currently in central and southern Vietnam) during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Ban Khrua is the oldest Islamic community in Bangkok. Khlong Saen Saep was dug during the reign of King Rama III as the main supply route for troops fighting in what is now Cambodia and part of southern Vietnam in the 14 year-long Siamese-Vietnamese wars. It runs from Bangkok to the Bang Pakong River in eastern Chachoengsao Province. Years ago, silk fabric was a well-known product of the community and a major source of income for most households. The community served as a factory for the American businessman Jim Thompson whose home, now a museum called the Jim Thompson House, is nearby on the south bank of the canal. Thai silk became highly prized, and was used as for costuming in the Broadway musical The King and I in 1951 and Hollywood film Ben-Hur in 1959. Ban Khrua became a centre of the silk industry in Thailand. The Disappearance of Jim Thompson in 1967 marked the peak of silk production in Ban Khrua. Three mosques remain in the community. Silk production continues in a few workshops, where traditional production methods survive. Adding to the cost of progress, Ban Khrua residents have been at odds with the government for more than 25 years as they fight to keep their community from being razed for a proposed tollway. ==Of note nearby== *Chaloem La 56 Bridge or Saphan Hua Chang (Elephant's Head Bridge) *Siam Square *Sa Pathum Palace *Ratchaprasong Shopping Center *Erawan Shrine *Pratunam Market == Transportation == * BTS Skytrain: Ratchathewi Station, National Stadium Station * BMTA bus: route 2, 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 47, 48, 50, 59, 60, 67, 73, 73‡∏Å, 79, 93, 99, 113, 183, 204, 508, 511 * Khlong Saen Saep Boat Service: Baan Krua Nua Pier, Saphan Hua Chang Pier, Sapan Charoenpol Pier, Pratunam Pier ==See also References  *Baan Khrua from Lonely Planet *BAAN KRUA NHUA COMMUNITY from Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) Category:Neighbourhoods of Bangkok Category:Ratchathewi District Category:Pathum Wan District category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok category:Islam in Thailand ","title":"Ban Khrua"},{"id":"56861692","text":"Fortunato Maninetti (born 19 August 1926) is an Italian rower.

Accessed online November 26, 2009. White was the son of the farmer Robert A. White and Hannah E. Newbrough.Marriage Certificate of 1851 at FamilySearch. Records have White's mother's name often misspelled, like \\"Newbro\\" and \\"Newbo\\". At the age of 19, he left home for Hamilton County, Nebraska, where he taught school and bought 240 acres of farmland. Between 1883 and 1886 he was manager of a nursery company at York, Nebraska. On December 31, 1885, White married Anna E. Morrow, born in 1864 in Ohio, but living in Harvard, Nebraska. The marriage seems to have remained childless.Harry and Anna White in the 1900-1930 censuses In 1887, they moved to Seattle, where he founded the Harry White & Co. real estate and brokerage firm, in which his younger brothers Will R. and George H. White joined him. His company invested heavily in Seattle, buying large swats of land and spending more on advertising than any other organization in Seattle. In July 1889, a month after the Great Seattle Fire that destroyed the entire central business district, he was elected a member of the city council from the First ward. He took great effort in the rebuilding of downtown, for which he was awarded a nomination and election as mayor in July 1890. When Washington became a state on November 11, 1889, Seattle adopted a new charter, and new elections were already held again on October 1, 1890. White was reelected for two years. However, under criticism for his management of public affairs, he resigned on November 30, 1891. The remaining months of his term were completed by fellow progressive Republican George Hall. Clarence B. Bagley wrote about him in his 1916 3-volume history of Seattle that, while in the year after his election \\"Gambling of every known variety flourished openly, as did harlotry and drunkenness, under the fostering eyes of the police\\", White had rebuilt Seattle \\"along modern, progressive lines\\" and that the \\"story of Seattle‚Äôs advancement since 1889 without mention of Mr. White would be like the play of Hamlet without the appearance of the Danish prince\\". White left the public eye, but his investments, especially in Alaska, had made him a rich man. At the end of the century the Whites moved to Los Angeles, California, and before 1900, they had bought a house at 220 S. Bunker Hill Ave., where they lived until at least the 1930s. In the censuses White's profession is listed as \\"mining promoter\\" (1900) and \\"real estate brokerage\\" (1920,1930). He managed his investments through offices in Seattle and London. White died in 1940 at the age of 81 in Los Angeles. ==References== Category:1859 births Category:1940 deaths Category:American real estate brokers Category:Mayors of Seattle Category:People from Louisa County, Iowa Category:Washington (state) Republicans ","title":"Harry White (Washington politician)"},{"id":"56861827","text":"Zospeum percostulatum is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Ellobiidae, the salt marsh snails.

It forms the initial part of the multi-volume Blackwood saga. which follows the adventures of several generations of Royal Marine officers over 150 years. ==Plot== The year is 1850 and a young Queen Victoria is on the throne. Philip Blackwood, a captain in the Royal Marines, and son and grandson of marine officers, rejoins his ship, HMS Audacious, which is to sail to West Africa to help stamp out the remains of the slave trade. The ship is part of a squadron commanded by Vice- Admiral Sir James Ashley-Chute. Blackwood‚Äôs younger step-brother Harry, a marine second lieutenant, is also aboard, as is Sir Geoffrey Slade, a senior government official. At Gibraltar, disquieting news reaches Slade by despatch- boat concerning a possible native uprising north of Freetown. Slade needs to proceed as quickly as possible to investigate. He and a detachment of marines transfer to HMS Satyr, a new and faster steam ship, of the type being newly constructed for the Royal Navy; admired by some but derided by others including Ashley-Chute. After coaling at Tenerife, they arrive in the Bight of Benin. Following the marines dictum of ‚ÄòFirst to Land-Last to Leave‚Äô, Blackwood lands a detachment of marines. They find themselves facing a superior force of natives, led by King Mdlaka. They are clearly trained and armed by white slavers. Despite the British government‚Äôs attempts to persuade the natives to take up palm oil production, they have returned to the vastly more lucrative slave trade. Many marines are killed and wounded in the battle, but they are able to relieve the besieged trade fortress, finding few survivors. Major Rupert Fynmore takes command for the next landing, and further battles take place with the well-entrenched slavers. They are well- armed with cannon and newer rifle-bored weapons that the marines have not yet been issued with. Blackwood is badly wounded and evacuated to ship, initially to Freetown and then back to England. But the hard-fighting marines are victorious, and Lessard, the leader of the slavers, falls, or is pushed, into the hold of a laden slave ship, where he‚Äôs torn apart. Slade‚Äôs niece, Davern Seymour, who Blackwood had met in Portsmouth and is fascinated with, is also rescued. She had been captured and ill-treated by the slavers. Her father, a doctor, has been horribly killed. Blackwood‚Äôs recovery is slow. His domineering step-mother insists that he will recover better at the family home of Hawks Hill. and he is taken there, with his faithful valet, Private Smithett. He finds his father, the Colonel, bedridden but in good spirits and happy to hear of his son‚Äôs exploits. Blackwood decides to leave home and stay at his club. He accidentally overhears a conversation in which he learns that his step-mother was the mistress of the late Lord Lapidge, from whom she inherited her wealth. He reports for duty in Portsmouth. The marines are posted to Malta, where Blackwood finds the climate even more stifling than that of West Africa. They spend most of their time on ceremonial duties and drilling with new weapons. Harry Blackwood has an affair with Fynmore‚Äôs young wife. Then under Ashley-Chute‚Äôs command, they sail for the Black Sea to participate in the Crimean War. From the port of Varna, the squadron joins battle with Russian ships off the coast near Odessa. The flagship, HMS Tenacious, is almost overwhelmed, but Blackwood‚Äôs marine sharpshooters manage to save the day. Ashley-Chute is killed in the battle. The marines are ordered to Crimea and land at Balaclava. They march inland, where they are to support the army in storming a well-defended Russian redoubt. The marines are put into the attack. Fynmore, who has learned that his wife has given birth to a baby, almost certainly Harry‚Äôs, angrily gives the latter a dangerous assignment with a grenade party. Harry not only survives, but distinguishes himself. Blackwood is again badly wounded and wakes up in hospital where he finds Davern nursing him. He is evacuated home to England; the doctors fear for his life, but he does survive. He returns home to Hawks Hill, his marine career almost certainly over. The Colonel has died and he takes up his family inheritance, whilst his step-mother leaves for France. Davern, now amicably separated from his husband, comes to him. ==External links== *Douglas Reeman official site *Kirkus Reviews Category:Novels set on ships Category:Novels about slavery Category:Nautical fiction Category:Crimean War fiction Category:1982 novels Category:Fiction set in 1850 Category:Hutchinson (publisher) books ","title":"Badge of Glory"},{"id":"56861905","text":"thumb Eurobasket 2011 ball Akropolis is the largest shopping mall in the Baltics by floor area, a shopping center and entertainment center in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.

It was initiated by Takeyuki Hida in his 1975 Carleton Mathematical Lecture Notes. The term white noise was first used for signals with a flat spectrum. == White noise measure== The white noise probability measure \\\\mu on the space S'(\\\\mathbb{R}) of tempered distributions has the characteristic function : C(f)=\\\\int_{S'(\\\\mathbb{R})}\\\\exp \\\\left( i\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\omega ,f\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right) \\\\, d\\\\mu (\\\\omega )=\\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} f^2(t) \\\\, dt\\\\right), \\\\quad f\\\\in S(\\\\mathbb{R}). === Brownian motion in white noise analysis === A version of Wiener's Brownian motion B(t) is obtained by the dual pairing : B(t) = \\\\langle \\\\omega, 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1_{[0,t)}\\\\rangle, where 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1_{[0,t)} is the indicator function of the interval [0,t) . Informally : B(t)=\\\\int_0^t \\\\omega(t) \\\\, dt and in a generalized sense : \\\\omega(t)=\\\\frac{d B(t)}{dt}. == Hilbert space == Fundamental to white noise analysis is the Hilbert space : (L^2):=L^2\\\\left( S'(\\\\mathbb{R}),\\\\mu \\\\right), generalizing the Hilbert spaces L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^n,e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} x^2}d^n x) to infinite dimension. === Wick polynomials === An orthonormal basis in this Hilbert space, generalizing that of Hermite polynomials, is given by the so-called \\"Wick\\", or \\"normal ordered\\" polynomials \\\\left\\\\langle {:\\\\omega^n:} , f_n\\\\right\\\\rangle with {:\\\\omega^n:} \\\\in S'(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) and f_n \\\\in S(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) with normalization : \\\\int_{S'(\\\\mathbb{R})}\\\\left\\\\langle :\\\\omega^n:,f_n \\\\right\\\\rangle^2 \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\omega) = n!\\\\int f_{n}^2(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\, d^n x, entailing the It√¥-Segal-Wiener isomorphism of the white noise Hilbert space (L^2) with Fock space: : L^2\\\\left( S'(\\\\mathbb{R}),\\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus\\\\limits_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\operatorname{Sym} L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^n,n! \\\\, d^n x). The \\"chaos expansion\\" : \\\\varphi(\\\\omega) =\\\\sum_n \\\\left\\\\langle :\\\\omega^n:, f_n\\\\right\\\\rangle in terms of Wick polynomials corresponds to the expansion in terms of multiple Wiener integrals. Brownian martingales M_t(\\\\omega) are characterized by kernel functions f_n depending on t only by a \\"cut off\\": : f_n(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n;t)= \\\\begin{cases} f_n (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) & \\\\text{if } i x_i\\\\leq t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} === Gelfand triples === Suitable restrictions of the kernel functions \\\\varphi _{n} to be smooth and rapidly decreasing in x and n give rise to spaces of white noise test functions \\\\varphi , and, by duality, to spaces of generalized functions \\\\Psi of white noise, with : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\\\\\! \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi ,\\\\varphi \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\!\\\\right\\\\rangle :=\\\\sum_n n!\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi_n,\\\\varphi_n \\\\right\\\\rangle generalizing the scalar product in (L^2) . Examples are the Hida triple, with : \\\\varphi \\\\in (S)\\\\subset (L^2)\\\\subset (S)^\\\\ast i \\\\Psi or the more general Kondratiev triples. == T- and S-transform == Using the white noise test functions : \\\\varphi_f(\\\\omega ):=\\\\exp \\\\left( i\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\omega ,f\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right) \\\\in (S),\\\\quad f \\\\in S(\\\\mathbb{R}) one introduces the \\"T-transform\\" of white noise distributions \\\\Psi by setting : T\\\\Psi (f):=\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\\\\\!\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi ,\\\\varphi _{f}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\!\\\\right\\\\rangle . Likewise, using : \\\\phi_f(\\\\omega ):=\\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int f^2(t) \\\\, dt\\\\right) \\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\omega ,f\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right) \\\\in (S) one defines the \\"S-transform\\" of white noise distributions \\\\Psi by : S\\\\Psi (f):=\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\\\\\!\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi ,\\\\phi_f\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\! \\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\quad f \\\\in S(\\\\mathbb{R}). It is worth noting that for generalized functions \\\\Psi, the S-transform is just : S\\\\Psi (f)=\\\\sum n!\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi_n,f^{\\\\otimes n}\\\\right\\\\rangle. Depending on the choice of Gelfand triple, the white noise test functions and distributions are characterized by corresponding growth and analyticity properties of their S- or T-transforms. === Characterization theorem=== > The function G(f) is the T-transform of a (unique) Hida distribution \\\\Psi > iff for all f_1,f_2\\\\in S(R), the function z\\\\mapsto G(zf_1+f_2) is analytic > in the whole complex plane and of second order exponential growth, i.e. > \\\\left\\\\vert G(\\\\ f)\\\\right\\\\vert where K is some continuous quadratic form on > S'(\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\times S'(\\\\mathbb{R}). The same is true for S-transforms, and similar characterization theorems hold for the more general Kondratiev distributions. == Calculus == For test functions \\\\varphi \\\\in (S) , partial, directional derivatives exist: : \\\\partial_\\\\eta \\\\varphi (\\\\omega ):=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\frac{\\\\varphi (\\\\omega +\\\\varepsilon \\\\eta )-F(\\\\omega )} \\\\varepsilon where \\\\omega may be varied by any generalized function \\\\eta . In particular, for the Dirac distribution \\\\eta =\\\\delta _{t} one defines the \\"Hida derivative\\", denoting : \\\\partial_t \\\\varphi (\\\\omega ):=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(\\\\omega +\\\\varepsilon \\\\delta_t)-F(\\\\omega )} \\\\varepsilon. Gaussian integration by parts yields the dual operator on distribution space : \\\\partial_t^\\\\ast =-\\\\partial_t+\\\\omega(t) An infinite-dimensional gradient : abla :(S)\\\\rightarrow L^2(R,dt) \\\\otimes (S) is given by : abla F(t,\\\\omega) =\\\\partial_t F(\\\\omega). The Laplacian \\\\triangle (\\"Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator\\") with : -\\\\triangle =\\\\int dt\\\\;\\\\partial_t^\\\\ast \\\\partial_t \\\\geq 0 plays an important role in infinite-dimensional analysis and is the image of the Fock space number operator. == Stochastic integrals == A stochastic integral, the \\"Hitsuda-Skorohod integral\\" can be defined for suitable families \\\\Psi (t) of white noise distributions as a Pettis integral : \\\\int \\\\partial_t^\\\\ast \\\\Psi (t) \\\\, dt\\\\in (S)^\\\\ast, generalizing the It√¥ integral beyond adapted integrands. == Applications == In general terms, there are two features of white noise analysis which have been prominent in applications. First, white noise is a generalized stochastic process with independent values at each time. Hence it plays the role of a generalized system of independent coordinates, in the sense that in various contexts it has been fruitful to express more general processes occurring e.g. in engineering or mathematical finance, in terms of white noise. Second, the characterization theorem given above allows various heuristic expressions to be identified as generalized functions of white noise. This is particularly effective to attribute a well-defined mathematical meaning to so-called \\"functional integrals\\". Feynman integrals in particular have been given rigorous meaning for large classes of quantum dynamical models. Noncommutative extensions of the theory have grown under the name of quantum white noise, and finally, the rotational invariance of the white noise characteristic function provides a framework for representations of infinite- dimensional rotation groups. == References == Category:Stochastic calculus Category:Generalized functions ","title":"White noise analysis"},{"id":"56861938","text":"Jari Seppo Aarnio (born 5 September 1957) is the former head of Helsinki's anti-drugs police.

Its lineup consists of Miho on bass, Haruna on drums, Midori and Miyako on guitar, and Asami on vocals. After signing to Victor Entertainment, the group released both their self-titled debut EP and their first album in 2017 before performing their first overseas concerts at the end of the year. With another EP and album released in 2018, Lovebites quickly garnered international attention and won that year's Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. They released their third album, Electric Pentagram, in 2020, and it reached number 9 on the Oricon chart, becoming their highest-charting to date. ==HistoryFormation and first album (2016‚Äì2017)=== Lovebites was formed in Tokyo in 2016 by bassist Miho and drummer Haruna. The two met while members of Destrose, another all-female metal band that disbanded in 2015. After recruiting guitarist Midori and support guitarist and keyboardist Miyako (then known as Mi-Ya), the four chose vocalist Asami based on a demo she made. Midori was in the band Gekijo Metalicche, Miyako was a member of A Drop of Joker and 21g, while Asami was a backup singer for Vamps and Uverworld. During one rehearsal, the musicians performed \\"Love Bites (So Do I)\\" by Halestorm. Feeling that the song fit well with Asami's voice, it left an impression on all of the members and they chose Lovebites as the name for their new band. They had their first concert on November 18, 2016 at Tsutaya O-West. Lovebites released their debut EP, The Lovebites EP, in May 2017 via Victor Entertainment. Miho explained that it was more of a demo to get the band signed, but the label liked it so much they had it properly mastered and released. It was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila, who have worked with acts like Nightwish, Children of Bodom, and Stratovarius, at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland. The EP was released in the United Kingdom on August 25 by JPU Records and in North America by Sliptrick Records on August 31. Support member Miyako became a full member of the band in August 2017. Their first full-length album Awakening from Abyss was released in Japan and North America on October 25, and in the UK two days later. It was again mixed and mastered by Karmila and Jussila and includes re-recordings of the four tracks from their debut EP. The group played just a handful of shows before their first gigs outside Japan: two nights at Hyper Japan Christmas and one show at Camden Underworld, both in London at the end of November 2017. ===International recognition (2018‚Äìpresent)=== In 2018, Lovebites performed on the Japanese leg of Warped Tour and released their second EP Battle Against Damnation on June 6. Days later, they won the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. They performed at Wacken Open Air on August 4, becoming the first Japanese all-female rock band to appear at the German festival. They also performed on the main stage at Bloodstock Open Air on August 10, 2018. In November, Lovebites held their first European tour that saw them visit the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. The band released their second album Clockwork Immortality on December 5 in Japan. Limited editions of the album include a DVD or Blu-ray of the concert video Battle in the East, which was recorded on June 28, 2018 at Tsutaya O-East. It was released in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand two days later by Arising Empire, and in the UK by JPU Records on January 18, 2019. Lovebites was the opening act for Arch Enemy at two shows in Shanghai and Beijing, China on March 23 and 24, 2019. In June, they performed at the Download Festival in both Donington, UK and Madrid, Spain and at the Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Belgium. Their set at Donington was cited by its organizers and Metal Hammer as one of the festival's highlight performances, including when Asami joined Halestorm on stage to sing her band's namesake song, which she had also done earlier at Download Festival Japan on March 21. On July 10, Lovebites released their first standalone concert video and live album, Daughters of the Dawn - Live in Tokyo, recorded on January 27, 2019 at Mynavi Blitz Akasaka. They were a support act on DragonForce's UK tour throughout the first half of November, and opened for Halestorm in Tokyo on December 2. The band's third studio album, Electric Pentagram, was released on January 29, 2020. It was set to be supported by a seven-date Japanese tour from February 14 to April 12, but the last three concerts were postponed until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. On July 22, Lovebites released their second standalone concert video and live album, Five of a Kind - Live in Tokyo 2020, recorded on February 21, 2020 at Zepp DiverCity. == Music and influences == Although hailing from Tokyo, Lovebites' music is heavily influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal which led their music to be compared to Iron Maiden and Rage. Miho said she always wanted to play a combination of power metal and \\"a little bit of old school [heavy metal].\\" She also noted that their decision to wear all-white clothing, as opposed to the genre's stereotypical black, was made to contrast with their old school sound and have them stand out. Their lyrics are written in English even though the musicians do not speak the language fluently. An exception is the Haruna-penned song \\"Bravehearted\\" on their debut EP, which was written in Japanese and intended for Destrose. The group frequently collaborates with former Light Bringer keyboardist Mao on composing and arranging songs. All of their releases have been mixed and mastered by Finnish audio engineers Mikko Karmila and Mika Jussila, and all of their album cover illustrations since Awakening from Abyss have been created by Spanish artists David L√≥pez G√≥mez and Carlos Vincente Le√≥n. These album covers all feature a wolf to symbolize that, by playing the non-mainstream genre of heavy metal, Lovebites are a \\"lone wolf\\" in the music scene. The wolf is a mascot to represent the band, like Eddie for Iron Maiden or Vic Rattlehead for Megadeth. Miho has been strongly into hard rock and heavy metal since junior high, and started playing bass in high school. Her favorite bands are Iron Maiden, Pantera, M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Anthrax. She referred to her playing as more showmanship than technical, and cited Steve Harris as a particular influence alongside the style of Nikki Sixx. Haruna has played drums since she was thirteen years old, and began writing songs on a keyboard at fourteen. From elementary school up to high school her favorite band was B'z, but she became interested in heavy metal after hearing Helloween's Master of the Rings. As a result, she stated her basic drumming style is that of Uli Kusch. Midori started to learn piano at around two years of age and electric organ at eight, but gave up both upon entering university and started to learn guitar at 20. She is a graduate of Musicians Institute Japan in Osaka, and listed Kiko Loureiro, Nuno Bettencourt and Yngwie Malmsteen as her biggest guitar influences. Generally speaking, Midori said that she plays the \\"flashy and aggressive\\" guitar solos in the band, while Miyako plays the \\"slower, more melodic\\" ones. Miyako has played classical piano since she was three and guitar since high school. Having grown up listening to classic rock bands like Deep Purple and Rainbow with her mother, Miyako ended up being very influenced by Ritchie Blackmore. But she has also been influenced by more modern guitarists, such as Timothy Henson and Scott LePage from Polyphia. It was Disarmonia Mundi's Ettore Rigotti who inspired Miyako to start composing and arranging songs. Asami comes from a R&B; and soul music background and likes artists such as Alicia Keys and Aretha Franklin. Starting at the age of two, she performed classical ballet for about 16 years before moving to America after high school to study jazz and hip-hop dance. ==Band members== *Miho ‚Äì bass, backing vocals, bandleader (2016‚Äìpresent) *Haruna ‚Äì drums (2016‚Äìpresent) *Midori ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (2016‚Äìpresent) *Miyako ‚Äì guitars, keyboards, backing vocals (2017‚Äìpresent) as a support musician (2016‚Äì2017) *Asami ‚Äì lead vocals (2016‚Äìpresent) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== {  !

Tamar√≥n y Romeral, Demostraci√≥n del vat√≠simo obispado de la Nueva Vizcaya, 1755. Durango, Sinaloa, Sonora, Arizona, Nuevo Mexico, Chihuahaa y porciones de Texas, Coahuila y Zacatceas.

This gave us some anxiety, but when we continued our journey, we began to realize that the great amount of smoke indicated that a forest was burning. And a little farther on, opposite the conflagration, we found a black cross about a vara and a half high and as thick as a man‚Äôs thumb at the side of the road, and at its foot a deerskin sack containing two pieces of fresh venison and a deerskin. The Apaches, who must have been in the Do√±a Ana sierra, put it there. By this means they indicated that they were at peace and that we should give them food and buy the deerskin. The experienced guides gave this interpretation. And therefore they left a knife in exchange for the deerskin and kept putting pieces of bread and tobacco leaf in the sack. And a short distance away, for we were on the lookout, two Indians on horseback were sighted. They were coming to see what had been left for them.\\" :\\"On this day, the twelfth of the month and the sixth of the journey, we came to the Jornada del Muerto. To prepare for it, a detour is made to seek the river at a place called San Diego (paraje de San Diego). The night is spent there. Everything necessary is made ready. It is about half a league from the river. Barrels are brought for the purpose. These are filled with water for the people. On the morning of the thirteenth the horses were taken to the river to drink. Somewhat later all the food for the journey was prepared, and at half past seven we left that post with considerable speed, stopping only to change horses.\\" During this thirteenth day they had traveled 20 leagues until eight- thirty at night, when they halted opposite the Sierra de Fray Crist√≥bal. After a 10 league journey on the 14th of May, the Bishop reached the Rio Grande again at eleven‚Äëthirty, at the Paraje de Fray Crist√≥bal, leaving the Jornada del Muerto. The location given by Bishop Tamar√≥n places Paraje de San Diego on the heights overlooking the Rincon Valley north of San Diego Mountain above Tonuco Draw, southeast of the location of Rincon, New Mexico. At the time the Bishop wrote the Rio Grande must have had a different course than today to be half a league away. It would have to pass close to the east side of the valley close to the foot of the bluffs where the paraje was located and at the foot of San Diego Mountain. ==References== Category:Pre-statehood history of New Mexico Category:Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Category:Jornada del Muerto ","title":"Paraje de San Diego"},{"id":"56862044","text":"Sodag is a small Village/hamlet in Khunti Block in Khunti District of Jharkhand State, India.

He was the second son of a knife maker from Langres in Champagne who had relocated to Berlin where he believed - correctly, as matters turned out - that there would be more possibilities for expanding his business than in small-town eastern France. He was able to afford a good education for his children: Peter attended Berlin' well-regarded Friedrichswerdersches Gymnasium (secondary school) until he was 14. He then embarked on an apprenticeship with the \\"Franckesche Buchhandlung\\" (book dealer). In a conscious move to prepare himself for work in the book trade, in his spare time he studied the history of literature, bibliography and encyclopaediae. His excellent memory and excellent knowledge of languages enabled him to gain a broad education in this way. Meanwhile, on the international front an uneasy peace had been restored by the Peace of Basel in 1795, and in 1798 Humblot relocated to Braunschweig where his transferred his apprenticeship to the \\"Thomassche Buchhandlung\\". Two years later, having concluded his apprenticeship, but finding the opportunities in Braunschweig somewhat limited, he moved south to Basel where he worked with the \\"Deckersche Buchhandlung\\". He built up excellent business relationships in Basel, but in 1802 was drawn back to Berlin to take up a position with the book dealer and publishing house, Haude & Spenersche Verlagsbuchhandlung where an opportunity had arisen following the death of one of the proprietors of the business. Shortly afterwards, however, he moved to Paris, which appeared to offer more promising commercial prospects. However, by 1806, he was back in Berlin where, between October 1806 and December 1808, matters were complicated by French military occupation of the city. Meanwhile Humblot's friend, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker, was running the publishing business built up by Heinrich Fr√∂lich. Fr√∂lich had recruited Duncker as an assistant and then, just six weeks later, died suddenly in March 1806. Duncker spent the next two years returning the business to solvency, despite the unwavering opposition of Fr√∂lich's widow. In 1808, Duncker persuaded his former employer's widow to sell him the business. To do this, he needed a partner, presumably for financial reasons. On 1 January 1809, Duncker and Humblot acquired the business, agreeing to share profits and losses on an equal basis. The business was renamed Duncker & Humblot, which is the name under which it continues to trade (2018). In 1828, Peter Humblot was elected a deputy in the Berlin city council. He died later that same year. == Personal == In 1812, Peter Humblot married Am√©lie Jordan (1789‚Äì1877), the daughter of a Berlin jeweller. Their daughter Bertha later married the physicist-chemist Heinrich Gustav Magnus. == References == Category:19th-century publishers (people) Category:German booksellers Category:Businesspeople from Berlin Category:1779 births Category:1828 deaths ","title":"Peter Humblot"},{"id":"56862324","text":"The 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final was an Australian rules football match held on 24 March 2018 to determine the premiers of the 2018 AFL Women's season, the league's second season. It was contested by the and and was won by the Western Bulldogs. The Bulldogs claimed their first AFL Women's premiership, whilst Brisbane suffered their second consecutive loss by six points in a Grand Final. ==Background== The Australian Football League (AFL) continued with the top-two qualification system, whereby the two highest ranked clubs would qualify for the grand final, rather than having a finals series. The date of the match clashed with the opening round of the 2018 AFL season, however the start time of 12:35 pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time allowed the match to conclude before the first AFL premiership match to be held later that day, which featured the Brisbane men's team. ===Qualification=== Entering the final round of the regular season, five clubs were a mathematical chance of qualifying for the grand final, with the Bulldogs tied with on points but ahead on percentage in the top two positions. The Brisbane Lions were considered the least likely to qualify, as they were in fifth place and needed to defeat away from home and then rely on results in other matches. Brisbane's surprise 40-point win against Greater Western Sydney saw them leapfrog , and into second place. The Bulldogs narrowly defeated Melbourne the following night, thereby clinching qualification and keeping Brisbane's season alive. were considered strong favourites in the final match of the regular season against , but Collingwood ran away with a surprise victory to ensure that Brisbane retained second position and qualified for their second consecutive grand final. Adelaide's match was watched on television by the Brisbane players, who celebrated wildly after it concluded. Despite the loss, Adelaide coach Bec Goddard congratulated the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions for clinching the two spots in the grand final, saying \\"the two sides...are in there and I'm sure they will have a cracking contest next week.\\" ===Venue=== It was announced by the AFL that the 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final would be played at Ikon Park. The decision was made on the basis that Ikon Park could manage a greater capacity than the Western Bulldogs' home ground the Whitten Oval. It was the first time an AFL Women's Grand Final was played in Melbourne. ==Match summary== The game was played in wet and blustery conditions, with heavy rain falling in the hours leading up to the game. This kept the crowd numbers down, with most huddled under the sheltered areas, and caused the scheduled pre-match entertainment by Missy Higgins to be cancelled. The first quarter opened with a Brisbane goal. Speedster Kate McCarthy brought the ball out of the centre and delivered it to forward Jess Wuetschner, who found Sophie Conway unmarked 20 metres out from goal with a precision pass. Conway then converted. Monique Conti was voted best on ground Conway had another opportunity a few minutes later, but chose to attempt a snap shot herself rather than send the ball to Wuetschner, who was alone in the goal square, and missed everything. Conway's goal was the only one kicked by either side in the first half. The Western Bulldogs seemed unable to get past key Brisbane defender Kate Lutkins. Kaitlyn Ashmore also had an opportunity from 15 metres out just before the half time siren, but also missed everything. After the half time break, the rain abated, and Bulldogs midfielders Ellie Blackburn and Emma Kearney began to wrest control of the centre of the oval. The game remained tough and physical, with Kearney, who was well-contained by Brisbane tagger Nat Exon for most of the day, turning aside assistance offered by one of the trainers, and there were injury concerns for Kirsty Lamb. Deanna Berry somehow evaded two defenders and managed to kick the Bulldogs' first goal with a long shot from outside the 50 metre arc. This was followed in quick succession by another, dribbled in by Kirsten McLeod, who had been brought in to replace the suspended Katie Brennan, but had not touched the ball in the first half. Monique Conti, an 18-year old who also played in the basketball grand final with the Melbourne Boomers, and wound up being voted best on ground, concluded the third term with a goal from a ball delivered to her by McLeod, giving the Bulldogs a 14 point lead. The Brisbane Lions fought back in the final quarter. Wuetschner dribbled in a goal to peg the Bulldogs' lead back to eight points. Kearney responded with a fourth Bulldogs goal, but Wuetschner kicked her second in reply. In the dying minutes of the game, the Brisbane Lions surged forward, seeking a fourth major that would tie the game and send it into extra time. The ball was marked in the dying seconds of the game by Bulldogs' defender Naomi Ferres, who grasped it as the final siren sounded. When it came time to raise the winner's cup at the end of medal presentations, acting captain Ellie Blackburn declared: \\"I can't hold that cup up alone ‚Äì KB, get up here!\\" The two raised the cup together, Brennan lifting her shirt to reveal the Bulldogs' guernsey beneath. The gesture invoked memories of the 2016 AFL Grand Final, when injured Bulldogs skipper Robert Murphy was similarly called up on stage to raise the cup. ==Teams== The teams were announced on 22 March. Western Bulldogs captain Katie Brennan was a prominent exclusion from the team, after she was suspended by the Tribunal for a sling tackle executed in the final match of the home-and-away season against Melbourne. The tribunal's decision to reject Brennan's appeal was met with surprise by some, who thought the punishment was not in line with expectations in the men's game. Brennan subsequently lodged a proceeding with the Australian Human Rights Commission in an attempt to have the AFL amend the differences between the AFLW regulations and the AFL regulations. Brisbane named an unchanged line-up. {  valign=\\"top\\"   valign=\\"top\\"  } ==ScorecardMedia coverage== The 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final was broadcast on the Seven Network, as part of a broadcasting rights deal that saw Seven West Media gain broadcasting rights to all matches of the 2018 AFL Women's season, airing on the Seven Network, 7mate, or the video on demand service, PLUS7.

It first aired on 18 March 2018, and concluded the run on 10 June 2018. The previous judges (actor Goran Navojec, vocalist Sandra Bagariƒá and musician Tomo in der M√ºhlen) have left the show and have been replaced by the winners of the previous four seasons. ==Format== The show challenges celebrities (singers and actors) to perform as different iconic music artists every week, which are chosen by the show's \\"Randomiser\\". They are then judged by the panel of celebrity judges. Each celebrity gets transformed into a different singer every week, and performs an iconic song and dance routine well known by that particular singer. The Randomiser can choose any older or younger artist available in the machine, even a singer of the opposite sex, or a deceased singer. In third season (Week 3), ability to use a joker was introduced. If celebrity wasn't happy with the Randomiser's output or thought that the task is too hard, they could ask some other celebrity to perform instead of them, but just once per season. It was announced that the show will get even more new content in the fourth season, but the 'Joker' ability was removed. The new content in the fourth season was the introduction of holographic performances. If the \\"Randomiser\\" chooses a celebrity should perform a duet, they can do it using the pre-recorded hologram for one of the given singers. In the fifth season, celebrity contestant can perform as another celebrity with a child transformed in the same celebrity. The child-contestant duo acts include: Damir Poljicak & David Bojcic as Elvis Presley, Davor Dretar & Ivor Leskovar as Will Smith, Paola Valic Bekic & Tara Roki as Taylor Swift, Amel Curic & Vito Ljubicic as Miso Kovac, Maja Bajamic & Elena Brnic as Beyonce Knowles, Marko Knesaurek & Ursula Divosevic as Katy Perry, Katarina Baban & Gabrijel Rodic as Bruno Mars, and Ana Vilenica & Eva Biljan as Whitney Houston. The winner of every episode gets to donate 10 000 HRK, while the overall leader gets to donate 40 000 HRK at the end of the season. The show lasts for 13 weeks. ===Voting=== The contestants are awarded points from the judges (and each other) based on their singing and dance routines. Judges award from 4 to 12 - excluding 11 - points to each contestant. After that, each contestant gives 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice (known as \\"Bonus\\" points). In week 12 (semi-final week), four contestants with the highest number of votes will qualify to the final. In week 13 (grand final), previous points will be transformed into a 4-7 system, the jury will award from 8 to 12 points, and contestants will give 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice. ===Judges=== *Nives Celzijus - Croatian actress and singer. *Sa≈°a Lozar - Croatian singer. *Mario Petrekoviƒá - Croatian comedian and actor. *Damir Ked≈æo - Croatian singer. ==Contestants== { class= - !

With the Tamil literary tradition's practice of identifying a poet by a phrase or word from his or her poem, Sempulapeyaneerar came to be known so owing to his usage of the imagery \\"red earth and pouring rain\\" to denote the union of loving couples in his Sangam verse. ==Contribution to the Sangam literature== Sempulapeyaneerar wrote a sole Sangam verse, verse 40 of the Kurunthogai, and also compiled the Kurunthogai anthology. It is arguably one of the most renowned and oft-quoted of the Sangam anthology.

My father and yours, how were they kin? I and you, how do we know each other? and yet like water that has rained on red fields, our hearts in their love have mixed together. (George L. Hart translation) } ==Legacy== Verse 40 of the Kurunthogai inspired many down the centuries, chiefly by its powerful imagery in the words \\"red earth and pouring rain\\" which is considered very evocative. It is the inspiration behind the title of Vikram Chandra's award-winning English novel, Red Earth and Pouring Rain. The poem was exhibited in the London metro train service in 2001. The original lyrics of the Yayum poem was part of the album Sandham: Symphony Meets Classical Tamil by American composer Rajan Somasundaram and was featured in Amazon's Top#10 International Music albums in July 2020. The poetry has also inspired several Tamil film songs, including 'Oru Thanga rathathil' from Dharma Yuddham, 'Narumugaye' from movie Iruvar, 'Solai poovil malai thenral' from movie Vellai Roja, 'Pattam poochi' from movie Chithiram Pesuthadi, 'Munbe Vaa' from movie Sillunu Oru Kaadhal, 'Yaayum' from Movie Sagaa. ==See also== * Kurunthogai * Sangam literature * List of Sangam poets ==Notes * A blog on Red Earth and Pouring Rain‚ÄîKurunthokai 40 Category:Tamil philosophy Category:Tamil poets Category:Sangam poets ","title":"Sempulapeyaneerar"},{"id":"56862494","text":"Statistics of Empress's Cup in the 2009 season. ==Overview== It was contested by 32 teams, and Nippon TV Beleza won the championship.RSSSF ==Results1st Round=== *Hinomoto Gakuen High School 3-7 Waseda University *Je Vrille Kagoshima 1-4 Tokiwagi Gakuken High School *AS Elfen Sayama FC 11-0 Oita Trinita *Bunnys Kyoto SC 1-6 Kanagawa University *Shimizudaihachi Pleiades 5-0 ASC Adooma *Iga FC Kunoichi 2-0 Osaka Toin High School *JFA Academy Fukushima 7-1 Renaissance Kumamoto FC *Ehime Women's College 0-3 Fukuoka J.

It is endemic to New Zealand, and critically endangered, occurring in a very narrow and specialised habitat at just two small coastal sites near Invercargill. == Description == Asaphodes frivola is a small straw-coloured moth with a wingspan of nearly 30 mm. Only the males can fly; females have twisted, useless wings but have long legs and are swift runners. Several other New Zealand moth species have flightless females; flightlessness allows females to carry more eggs, but severely limits the ability of the species to disperse to new home ranges. Eggs are laid in autumn and hatch after a month. Larvae are a dull greenish-grey with pink tinges, developing a herringbone pattern on their back as they slowly grow to 20 mm long. They likely pupate after nine months, but this has not yet been observed. Adult A. frivola emerge between mid March and mid April and are active on warm nights. Males are easily disturbed in the daytime and will fly short distances before resettling. == Taxonomy and nomenclature == A. frivola was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1913 under the name Xanthorhoe frivola, from a single male specimen collected \\"in swampy forest near Invercargill\\" in 1912 by Alfred Philpott and sent to the British Museum, where it remains today. Philpott later noted when listing the moth species of Otago that \\"The type specimen is said to have been taken at Invercargill by myself, but I am quite unable to identify the species.\\" Hudson mentioned X. frivola in his 1928 Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand, but did not have access to the holotype so did not illustrate it. Dugdale later determined this species was actually a member of the genus Asaphodes. After the collection of a single specimen in 1912 this moth were not seen again for almost 70 years. On 19 March 1981 lepidopterist Brian Patrick was collecting Asaphodes oraria at the Invercargill suburb of Otatara, and at Sandy Point just across the Oreti River he discovered the males and flightless females of what appeared to be a new Asaphodes species. They turned out to be A. frivola. This species has no universally accepted common name in English or MƒÅori, and is sometimes simply called \\"little brown moth\\", but it has been referred to as the Foveaux looper moth, after nearby Foveaux Strait, and the bonking grass moth or remuremu looper moth after its presumed host plant. == Distribution and habitat == Philpott likely collected the holotype specimen at the New River Estuary, at the mouths of the Waihopai and Oreti Rivers, the same area where the Sandy Point population was discovered in 1981. In 1984 a second population was found at Tiwai Point near Bluff, and 10 males and 5 females were collected there in a 2011 survey. On 18 April 2013 a third population was discovered by Department of Conservation entomologist Eric Edwards at the Three Sisters Sand Dune, on the southern side of the New River Estuary between Bluff and Omaui. A 2014 survey could no longer find A. frivola at Sandy Point; it seems to have disappeared from a combination of human disturbance (off-road 4WD vehicles have badly damaged the site) and the replacement of native vegetation with exotic weeds. The world population therefore appears to be confined to Tiwai Point and Three Sisters. As of 2014, only 34 males and 6 females of this species had ever been found. A. frivola only occurs along a small area of the Southland coast, in a narrow (30‚Äì50 cm) and fragmented strip of short tussock grassland right next to shell or gravel beaches. The dominant plants in this habitat are knobby club rush (Ficinia nodosa) and silver tussock (Poa cita). After a 2014 survey, Brian Patrick and botanist Brian Rance hypothesised that A. frivola's host plant was the coastal buttercup species Ranunculus glabrifolius, based on observed feeding damage on the leaves; Ranunculus species are popular hosts for the genus Asaphodes. Subsequent surveys suggest the host is more likely to be the succulent creeping herb Selliera radicans, known as remuremu or bonking grass. == Conservation == A. frivola is at high risk of extinction, and has already disappeared from one of its three known localities. Its main population, at Tiwai Point, occupies less than 25 m¬≤ of coastal vegetation, and the second population at Three Sisters Sand Dune is likely to be a similar size.

She was an officer of the Women's Football Association (WFA) from its formation in 1969 until its incorporation into The FA in 1993. Bilton's involvement in football began in 1963, when she put together a female team from the Reckitt & Colman factory where she worked to play a nearby Smith & Nephew factory. Reckitt & Colman won 2‚Äì1, with Bilton playing as a veteran goalkeeper. She remained as Reckitt & Colman manager and was secretary of the nascent Hull League. She later helped local players Carol Thomas and Gail Borman progress to the England national team. As a founding member of the WFA, Bilton undertook a variety of unglamorous but important off-field roles during the organisation's 24-year history. She borrowed an England national football team cap from her neighbour Raich Carter and then made copies for England's female national team players. Former England player Wendy Owen praised Bilton in her 2005 autobiography: \\"She was a wonderful person who could and did turn her hand to just about anything that might help other women to get enjoyment out of the game.\\" In 1997 Sue Lopez declared: \\"Flo Bilton is one of the unsung heroines and one of the greatest supporters of women's football.\\" In 2018 Bilton was awarded a commemorative plaque by her home city of Kingston upon Hull. At the Guildhall unveiling, former England captains Karen Walker and Carol Thomas both made speeches in Bilton's honour. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:English women's football managers Category:1921 births Category:2004 deaths Category:English women's footballers Category:Sportspeople from Kingston upon Hull Category:Footballers from the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Women's association football goalkeepers ","title":"Flo Bilton"},{"id":"56862582","text":"Henrietta Nevill, Baroness Bergavenny, by William Hoare Henrietta Nevill, Baroness Bergavenny (1 August 1730 - 31 August 1768), formerly Henrietta Pelham, was the wife of George Nevill, 1st Earl of Abergavenny.

He befriended many African Americans, providing support for their welfare. ==Early life and education== Born in San Francisco on 25 December 1890, No√´l Sullivan was the son of Alice Phelan and Francis \\"Frank\\" J. Sullivan whose father, the Irish immigrant John Sullivan, had arrived in California in 1844. He was given the name No√´l (French for Christmas) as he had been born on Christmas Day. He was the nephew of James D. Phelan who was a banker and politician serving as mayor of San Francisco and Senator. Sullivan was brought up in an affluent, influential home, attending first St. Ignatius College and then Santa Clara College. Although not academically inclined, he was interested in music, developing his singing talents abroad and performing as an amateur singer. For a time, he had a home in Paris. In World War I he served with the American Field Service as an ambulance driver. During this period, he wrote a number of letters to his aunt, Mary Louise Phelan (1896‚Äì1930). ==Adult life== Following serious problems with his father's health, in 1925 Sullivan returned to San Francisco to take care of him in the family home on 2323 Hyde Street. The house had initially been acquired by his mother for the Carmelite nuns who later moved to Santa Clara. He lived in the house for many years, frequently entertaining friends from the world of art and literature. He developed an excellent relationship with his household staff, most of whom were African Americans. These included his housekeeper, his cook and his chauffeur. He later was a supporter of Langston Hughes. In the early 1930s, he supported the music scene in San Francisco, gaining a reputation as an adept amateur concert singer himself. As chairman of the California branch of the American League to Abolish Capital Punishment, he also campaigned vigorously for the abolition of capital punishment. As a result of depressed markets in the 1930s, Sullivan increasingly experienced financial difficulties despite being an heir of his wealthy uncle, James D. Phelan, who died in 1930. Sullivan had a 30-year-long friendship with actor Ramon Novarro (1899‚Äì1968). At Senator Phelan's funeral, Sullivan accompanied at the organ Novarro, who sang. Richard Halliburton, a family friend, was in attendance. Sullivan maintained close relationships to his family. After the death of his married sister Gladys S. Doyle in 1933, he helped bring up her five children. As a result of his strong affection for his sister Ada, a Carmelite nun known as Agnes of Jesus, he provided support for the monasteries in Santa Clara, Carmel and San Diego while establishing an additional community in Berkeley. From 1939, Sullivan lived in Hollow Hills Farms in Carmel Valley where he continued to entertain his artistic friends as well as participating in the Carmel Bach Festivals. He also played the organ at the Carmel Mission and headed the Carmel Music Society. == Death == No√´l Sullivan died of a heart attack in Carmel Valley on 15 September 1956. He is buried in the Carmelite Monastery Cemetery. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American philanthropists Category:Singers from San Francisco Category:American patrons of the arts Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"No√´l Sullivan"},{"id":"56862665","text":"Tohmat (English: Accusation) is a 2018 Pakistani drama serial directed by Shafqat Moinuddin which aired on Geo TV on Friday and Saturday nights at 7:00 p.m from 9 March 2018.

While Sun Quan and Liu Bei had initially formed an alliance in 208 against their common rival Cao Cao, both sides got into a territorial dispute over the territories in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in the early 210s. The dispute ended when both sides agreed to divide the territories along the Xiang River between their respective domains: Sun Quan took the lands east of the river while Liu Bei kept those west of the river. Despite a peaceful settlement to the territorial dispute, Sun Quan ultimately sent his forces to attack Liu Bei's territories in an invasion in 219 and succeeded in capturing all of them. ==Background== In the winter of 208, the warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan formed an alliance to counter another warlord Cao Cao and defeated him at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. Shortly after the Battle of Red Cliffs, the allied forces followed up with the Battle of Jiangling and succeeded in capturing Jiangling County and the rest of Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) from Cao Cao's forces. After the Battle of Jiangling, Nan Commandery remained under the control of Sun Quan, who appointed his general Zhou Yu as the commandery's administrator. The commandery's administrative centre was at Jiangling County and its jurisdiction included the counties of Xiajun (‰∏ãÈõã; northwest of present-day Tongcheng County, Hubei), Hanchang (Êº¢Êòå; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan), Liuyang and Zhouling (Â∑ûÈôµ; northeast of present-day Honghu, Hubei).(Ê¨äÊãúÁëúÂÅèÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈ†òÂçóÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆà„ÄÇ‰ª•‰∏ãÈõã„ÄÅÊº¢Êòå„ÄÅÁÄèÈôΩ„ÄÅÂ∑ûÈôµÁÇ∫Â•âÈÇëÔºåÂ±ØÊìöÊ±üÈôµ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. In the meantime, Liu Bei nominated Liu Qi, the elder son of Jing Province's former governor Liu Biao, to succeed his father as the new governor. At the same time, he led his forces to attack and conquer the four commanderies further south in Jing Province: Wuling (Ê≠¶Èôµ; around present-day Changde, Hunan), Changsha, Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) and Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan). After Liu Qi died in late 209, Sun Quan nominated Liu Bei to replace Liu Qi as the new governor of Jing Province. Liu Bei then made Gong'an County the administrative centre of his territories. To further strengthen the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance, he also married Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun. ===Sun Quan \\"lending\\" Jing Province to Liu Bei=== In 210, Liu Bei travelled to Jing (‰∫¨; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to meet Sun Quan and request to govern Nan Commandery. During this time, Zhou Yu secretly wrote to Sun Quan, urging his lord to lure Liu Bei to Wu Commandery (around present- day Suzhou, Jiangsu), distract him with luxuries and women, and keep him separated from his generals Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.(...

Before his death, he wrote to Sun Quan to recommend Lu Su to succeed him as the commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Sun Quan approved and put Lu Su in charge of the troops and territories which used to be led and governed by Zhou Yu. Between 212 and 214, Liu Bei embarked on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang. He left his general Guan Yu behind to guard his territories in Jing Province during his absence. ==The conflict== At the time, tensions were rising at the Sun‚ÄìLiu border in Jing Province as both sides became more suspicious and wary of each other. Around July 215, Sun Quan asked Liu Bei to \\"return\\" three commanderies in southern Jing Province ‚Äì Changsha, Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) ‚Äì since the latter already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan decided to seize the three commanderies by force. He stationed himself at Lukou (Èô∏Âè£; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) while ordering L√º Meng, Ling Tong and L√º Dai(Âª∫ÂÆâ‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÁù£Â≠´ËåÇÁ≠âÂçÅÂ∞áÂæûÂèñÈï∑Ê≤ô‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60. to lead troops to attack the three commanderies, and Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu.(ÂèäÁæΩËàáËÇÖÈÑ∞ÁïåÔºåÊï∏ÁîüÁãêÁñëÔºåÁñÜÂü∏Á¥õÈåØÔºåËÇÖÂ∏∏‰ª•Ê≠°Â•ΩÊí´‰πã„ÄÇÂÇôÊó£ÂÆöÁõäÂ∑ûÔºåÊ¨äÊ±ÇÈï∑Ê≤ô„ÄÅÈõ∂„ÄÅÊ°ÇÔºåÂÇô‰∏çÊâøÊó®ÔºåÊ¨äÈÅ£ÂëÇËíôÁéáË°ÜÈÄ≤Âèñ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ===L√º Meng capturing the three commanderies=== L√º Meng wrote to the administrators of the three commanderies to ask them to submit to Sun Quan. All of them agreed except Lingling's administrator, Hao Pu (ÈÉùÊôÆ). In the meantime, upon learning of Sun Quan's advances, Liu Bei returned from Yi Province to Gong'an County and ordered Guan Yu to lead troops to stop L√º Meng and take back the three commanderies. After hearing that Guan Yu and his army was heading their way, Sun Quan sent an urgent order to L√º Meng, ordering him to give up on Lingling and lead his troops to Yiyang to assist Lu Su.(ËíôÁßªÊõ∏‰∫åÈÉ°ÔºåÊúõÈ¢®Ê≠∏ÊúçÔºåÊÉüÈõ∂ÈôµÂ§™ÂÆàÈÉùÊôÆÂüéÂÆà‰∏çÈôç„ÄÇËÄåÂÇôËá™ËúÄË¶™Ëá≥ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåÈÅ£ÁæΩÁà≠‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇÊ¨äÊôÇ‰ΩèÈô∏Âè£Ôºå‰ΩøÈ≠ØËÇÖÂ∞áËê¨‰∫∫Â±ØÁõäÈôΩÊãíÁæΩÔºåËÄåÈ£õÊõ∏Âè¨ËíôÔºå‰ΩøÊç®Èõ∂ÈôµÔºåÊÄ•ÈÇÑÂä©ËÇÖ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. When L√º Meng pacified Changsha, he passed by Ling County (ÈÖÉÁ∏£; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (ÈÑßÁéÑ‰πã), an old friend of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, L√º Meng summoned all his officers and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed L√º Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to L√º Meng. When L√º Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling but it was too late. L√º Meng left Sun He (Â≠´Ê≤≥) behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.(ÂàùÔºåËíôÊó£ÂÆöÈï∑Ê≤ôÔºåÁï∂‰πãÈõ∂ÈôµÔºåÈÅéÈÖÉÔºåËºâÂçóÈôΩÈÑßÁéÑ‰πãÔºåÁéÑ‰πãËÄÖÈÉùÊôÆ‰πãËàä‰πüÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª§Ë™òÊôÆ„ÄÇÂèäË¢´Êõ∏Áï∂ÈÇÑÔºåËíôÁ•ï‰πãÔºåÂ§úÂè¨Ë´∏Â∞áÔºåÊéà‰ª•ÊñπÁï•ÔºåÊô®Áï∂ÊîªÂüéÔºåÈ°ßË¨ÇÁéÑ‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÉùÂ≠êÂ§™ËÅû‰∏ñÈñìÊúâÂø†Áæ©‰∫ãÔºå‰∫¶Ê¨≤ÁÇ∫‰πãÔºåËÄå‰∏çÁü•ÊôÇ‰πü„ÄÇÂ∑¶Â∞áËªçÂú®Êº¢‰∏≠ÔºåÁÇ∫Â§è‰æØÊ∑µÊâÄÂúç„ÄÇÈóúÁæΩÂú®ÂçóÈÉ°Ôºå‰ªäËá≥Â∞äË∫´Ëá™Ëá®‰πã„ÄÇËøëËÄÖÁ†¥Ê®äÊú¨Â±ØÔºåÊïëÈÖÉÔºåÈÄÜÁÇ∫Â≠´Ë¶èÊâÄÁ†¥„ÄÇÊ≠§ÁöÜÁõÆÂâç‰πã‰∫ãÔºåÂêõÊâÄË¶™Ë¶ã‰πü„ÄÇÂΩºÊñπÈ¶ñÂ∞æÂÄíÁ∏£ÔºåÊïëÊ≠ª‰∏çÁµ¶ÔºåË±àÊúâÈ§òÂäõÂæ©ÁáüÊ≠§ÂìâÔºü‰ªäÂêæÂ£´ÂçíÁ≤æÈä≥Ôºå‰∫∫ÊÄùËá¥ÂëΩÔºåËá≥Â∞äÈÅ£ÂÖµÔºåÁõ∏ÁπºÊñºÈÅì„ÄÇ‰ªä‰∫à‰ª•Êó¶Â§ï‰πãÂëΩÔºåÂæÖ‰∏çÂèØÊúõ‰πãÊïëÔºåÁå∂ÁâõËπÑ‰∏≠È≠öÔºåÂÖæË≥¥Ê±üÊº¢ÔºåÂÖ∂‰∏çÂèØÊÅÉ‰∫¶ÊòéÁü£„ÄÇËã•Â≠êÂ§™ÂøÖËÉΩ‰∏ÄÂ£´Âçí‰πãÂøÉÔºå‰øùÂ≠§Âüé‰πãÂÆàÔºåÂ∞öËÉΩÁ®ΩÂª∂Êó¶Â§ïÔºå‰ª•ÂæÖÊâÄÊ≠∏ËÄÖÔºåÂèØ‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂêæË®àÂäõÂ∫¶ÊÖÆÔºåËÄå‰ª•ÊîªÊ≠§ÔºåÊõæ‰∏çÁßªÊó•ÔºåËÄåÂüéÂøÖÁ†¥ÔºåÂüéÁ†¥‰πãÂæåÔºåË∫´Ê≠ª‰ΩïÁõäÊñº‰∫ãÔºåËÄå‰ª§ÁôæÊ≠≤ËÄÅÊØçÊà¥ÁôΩÂèóË™ÖÔºåË±à‰∏çÁóõÂìâÔºüÂ∫¶Ê≠§ÂÆ∂‰∏çÂæóÂ§ñÂïèÔºåË¨ÇÊè¥ÂèØÊÅÉÔºåÊïÖËá≥ÊñºÊ≠§ËÄ≥„ÄÇÂêõÂèØË¶ã‰πãÔºåÁÇ∫Èô≥Á¶çÁ¶è„ÄÇ„ÄçÁéÑ‰πãË¶ãÊôÆÔºåÂÖ∑ÂÆ£ËíôÊÑèÔºåÊôÆÊáºËÄåËÅΩ‰πã„ÄÇÁéÑ‰πãÂÖàÂá∫Â†±ËíôÔºåÊôÆÂ∞ãÂæåÁï∂Ëá≥„ÄÇËíôË±´ÂãëÂõõÂ∞áÔºåÂêÑÈÅ∏Áôæ‰∫∫ÔºåÊôÆÂá∫Ôºå‰æøÂÖ•ÂÆàÂüéÈñÄ„ÄÇÈ†àËáæÊôÆÂá∫ÔºåËíôËøéÂü∑ÂÖ∂ÊâãÔºåËàá‰ø±‰∏ãËàπ„ÄÇË™ûÁï¢ÔºåÂá∫Êõ∏Á§∫‰πãÔºåÂõ†ÊãäÊâãÂ§ßÁ¨ëÔºåÊôÆË¶ãÊõ∏ÔºåÁü•ÂÇôÂú®ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåËÄåÁæΩÂú®ÁõäÈôΩÔºåÊÖôÊÅ®ÂÖ•Âú∞„ÄÇËíôÁïôÂ≠´Ê≤≥Âßî‰ª•Âæå‰∫ã„ÄÇÂç≥Êó•ÂºïËªçËµ¥ÁõäÈôΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ===Standoff at Yiyang between Guan Yu and Gan Ning=== In the meantime, Guan Yu claimed to be leading an army of 30,000. He selected 5,000 of his best troops, led them to the upstream shallows located some 10 li away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates on how to deal with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning, who had only 300 men under him, told Lu Su: \\"If you give me another 500 troops, I will go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. But if he does, I will capture him.\\" Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead ordered his men to make camp there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (ÈóúÁæΩÁÄ®).(ÁæΩËôüÊúâ‰∏âËê¨‰∫∫ÔºåËá™ÊìáÈÅ∏Èä≥Â£´‰∫îÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÊäïÁ∏£‰∏äÊµÅÂçÅÈ§òÈáåÊ∑∫ÁÄ®Ôºå‰∫ëÊ¨≤Â§úÊ∂âÊ∏°„ÄÇËÇÖËàáË´∏Â∞áË≠∞„ÄÇÂØßÊôÇÊúâ‰∏âÁôæÂÖµÔºå‰πÉÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂèØÂæ©‰ª•‰∫îÁôæ‰∫∫ÁõäÂêæÔºåÂêæÂæÄÂ∞ç‰πãÔºå‰øùÁæΩËÅûÂêæÊ¨¨ÂîæÔºå‰∏çÊï¢Ê∂âÊ∞¥ÔºåÊ∂âÊ∞¥Âç≥ÊòØÂêæÁ¶Ω„ÄÇ„ÄçËÇÖ‰æøÈÅ∏ÂçÉÂÖµÁõäÂØßÔºåÂØß‰πÉÂ§úÂæÄ„ÄÇÁæΩËÅû‰πãÔºå‰Ωè‰∏çÊ∏°ÔºåËÄåÁµêÊü¥ÁáüÔºå‰ªäÈÅÇÂêçÊ≠§ËôïÁÇ∫ÈóúÁæΩÁÄ®„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. ===Negotiations between Lu Su and Guan Yu=== Lu Su invited Guan Yu to attend a meeting to discuss the dispute. During the negotiations, both sides stationed their soldiers more than 100 paces away from the meeting area, while the officers present at the talks were each armed with nothing more than a sword or blade weapon. This event is hence sometimes referred to as \\"attending a meeting armed with only a sword\\" (ÂñÆÂàÄËµ¥ÊúÉ).(ËÇÖ‰ΩèÁõäÈôΩÔºåËàáÁæΩÁõ∏Êãí„ÄÇËÇÖÈÇÄÁæΩÁõ∏Ë¶ãÔºåÂêÑÈßêÂÖµÈ¶¨ÁôæÊ≠•‰∏äÔºå‰ΩÜË´ãÂ∞áËªçÂñÆÂàÄ‰ø±ÊúÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Lu Su told Guan Yu: Before Lu Su could finish what he was saying, an unnamed person interrupted him: \\"Whoever has the ability to govern the land shall have control over it.

Wei Zhao's Book of Wu (Âê≥Êõ∏) provided more details on the meeting. Before the talks started, Lu Su's subordinates feared that Guan Yu would try to harm Lu Su, so they advised Lu Su against attending the meeting. However, Lu Su replied: \\"It's better for us to settle this dispute in a peaceful manner. Liu Bei may have acted against our lord's interests, but we haven't agreed on who is right and who is wrong.

This was because Cao Cao was attacking Hanzhong Commandery, then under the control of the warlord Zhang Lu. As Hanzhong was the \\"northern gateway\\" of Yi Province, if Cao Cao succeeded in seizing Hanzhong from Zhang Lu, he would be able to launch attacks on Yi Province from Hanzhong. Liu Bei thus decided that it was better for him to make peace with Sun Quan at the moment, and shift his focus towards countering Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan then withdrew their forces after agreeing to divide the territories in southern Jing Province between their respective domains along the Xiang River: Liu Bei would keep Nan, Lingling and Wuling commanderies in the west, while Sun Quan would take Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang commanderies in the east.(ÂÇôÈÅÇÂâ≤ÊπòÊ∞¥ÁÇ∫ÁïåÔºåÊñºÊòØÁΩ∑Ëªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Aftermath== Although the Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute of 215 ended in a peace settlement, Sun Quan did not give up his goal of acquiring all of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. In the winter of 219‚Äì220, when Guan Yu was away at the Battle of Fancheng against Cao Cao's forces in northern Jing Province, Sun Quan ordered L√º Meng to lead a stealth invasion of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. L√º Meng and his army succeeded in their mission and conquered all of Liu Bei's territories without Guan Yu knowing. By the time Guan Yu returned from Fancheng, it was already too late. Guan Yu was subsequently captured in an ambush and executed by Sun Quan's forces after refusing to surrender. \\"Guan Yu attending a meeting armed with only a blade\\", portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace in Beijing ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== In Chapter 66 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the meeting between Guan Yu and Lu Su is dramatised into an event known as \\"Guan Yunchang (Guan Yu) attending a meeting armed with only a blade\\" (). In the novel, the meeting is actually a mask for an attempt by Lu Su and his subordinates to force Guan Yu to hand over Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan's side. Their plan is as follows: Lu Su will pretend to invite Guan Yu to attend a meeting and demand that he \\"return\\" the territories. L√º Meng, Gan Ning and the others will lead their men to hide near the meeting area. If Guan Yu refuses to hand over the territories, Lu Su will give a signal for them to immediately come out of hiding and assassinate Guan Yu. Guan Yu knows that it is a trap but he still arms himself with only his Green Dragon Crescent Blade and attends the meeting. After a short exchange with Lu Su over a few drinks, Guan Yu senses the hidden danger so he pretends to be drunk, grabs Lu Su and holds him hostage while carefully retreating back to his boat. He releases Lu Su after boarding his boat and sails back to his base safely.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 66. ==NotesReferences== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

In the subsequent period, under Svyatoslav I of Kiev and Vladimir the Great, Druzhina played a dominant role. It consisted of senior members ‚Äì the boyars ‚Äì along with the rank-and- file ‚Äòyouths‚Äô (\\"otroki\\"). The regiments of city militia, raised by the decision of the Veche, were formed in the 11th century. These regiments received weapons and horses for a campaign from the prince. === Tactics and equipment === Warriors of Rurik (9th century) Vsevolod I (11th century)left Before Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 13th century, a Prince would be accompanied by his Druzhina, a small retinue of heavy cavalry, who would often fight dismounted (eq. Battle on the Ice). Massively heavy armor was used, mostly Scandinavian-style. However, these squads, as a rule, did not exceed the number of several hundred men, and were unsuitable for united actions under a single command. At the same time, the main part of the Kievan Rus' army was the militia infantry. It was inferior to Druzhina in armament and the ability to own it. The militia used axes and hunting spears (\\"rogatina\\"). Swords were rarely used, and they had no armor other than plain clothes and fur hats. For the infantry, consisted of poorly armed peasants and tradesmen, numbers are uncertain. The only specific numbers mentioned for the Russians are 1.700 men of Evpaty Kolovrat (The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan) and 3.000, men under Voivode Dorozh (Battle of the Sit River). However, these were exceptionally large numbers for Russian standards at the time. In 1242, Prince Alexander Nevski in Novgorod could muster no more than 1.000 Druzhina and 2.000 militia for the Battle on the Ice. So, it is safe to estimate that, on average, a Russian Prince had hundreds of warriors in his retinue, rather than thousands. == Mongol invasions == aketons. aketons. Nobleman in brigandine. After Mongol invasion of Rus' many independent principalities were destroyed. Remaining petty states were under growing pressure from Tatars, Sweden and Lithuania. Constant warfare precipitated the development of feudalism, and diminished the importance of the Veche. The feudal militia, raised by the Boyars-landowners and individual Princes, came to replace popular militia. Princes (except in the Novgorod Republic) gathered and commanded the army. In the second half of the 14th century, Druzhina was replaced by feudally organized units headed by Boyars or dependent Princes, and these units consisted of landed gentry (so called \\"Boyar's children\\" or \\"service people\\") and their armed servants (\\"military slaves\\"). In the 15th century, such organization of detachments replaced the city regiments. === Landed Army === The process of reforming the army was associated with the unification of the Russian lands in the 15th century. Gradually, the Grand Duchy of Moscow included new petty princedoms, courts of independent princes were dismissed, and \\"service people\\" passed to the Grand Duke. As a result, the vassal Princes and Boyars were transformed into state servants, who received estates for service in conditional holding (less often - in fiefdom). Thus, the \\"landed army\\" () was formed, the bulk of which were noblemen and \\"Boyar's children\\", with their armed slaves. This army organization would remain unchanged till 1550 (military reforms of Ivan the Terrible). When the centralized state was formed, the people's militia was liquidated by the Grand Prince of Moscow. The prince called the masses to military service only in the event of serious military danger, regulating the extent and nature of this service at his own discretion. === Tactics and equipment === mail and plate. Russian mirror armour. During the period of the Mongol invasions, Russia adopted much of Mongol military tactics and organization. While militia infantry still existed, they were, from XIV onward, mostly armed with ranged weapons, and delegated auxiliary duties, such as defending cities. The chronicles describe the Muscovites using arquebuses against the Tatars in 1480. The men shooting these weapons were the forerunners of the Streltsy. The bulk of the army were mounted archers, who included Boyars, landed gentry (\\"Boyars' children\\") and armed slaves. Under Tatar influence, the mail and lamellar armour of Kievan Rus' was replaced with brigandine (\\"Kuyak\\"), mail and plate (\\"Behterets\\") and mirror armour(\\"Zertsalo\\"), while poor noblemen and armed serfs wore long aketons (\\"Tyegilyai\\").center == References == Category:Military of the Russian Empire Category:Military history of Russia Russia Category:Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' ","title":"Medieval Russian army"},{"id":"56863106","text":"X-Road is a \\"centrally managed distributed Data Exchange Layer (DXL) between information systems\\".

It aims at highlighting the benefit of the European Union for an average citizen in their daily lives by adopting an innovative communication style. Since September 2017, WhyEurope e.V. is an officially registered association based in T√ºbingen, Germany. It has approximately 30 members from over 10 European states. == Background and History == The initiative was founded by the three students Hans-Christoph Schl√ºter, Benedikt Erasmus Kau and Mirko Moser-Abt. All three shared a concern about the rise of euroscepticism and right-wing-populism. The outcome of the Brexit referendum was the trigger for them to become active. They decided to publish pictures with simple pro-European messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. == Communication Style == WhyEurope has adopted a communication style they refer to as ‚ÄúPositive Populism‚Äù. The founders describe the approach as simple, emotional and personal. They refrain from including difficult, political or legal terms in their slogans and make their messages as catchy and short as possible. Furthermore, WhyEurope aims to trigger positive emotions by connecting political issues to every-day topics such as love or happiness. The initiative aims at pointing out the concrete advantages complex benefits of European integration have in people's daily lives. The founders have repeatedly stated that Positive Populism is to be seen as a simple and emotional communication style, but sustains a foundation of hard facts and evidence. In contrary to actual ‚Äònegative‚Äô populists, they want to provide factual evidence and explanations for their claims. WhyEurope considers Positive Populism an approach to oppose current populist and extremist movements. According to them, the technical communication of the European Union might have contributed to the lack of support those institutions have received during the past years. Adopting a more appealing communication approach might help the Union to regain confidence. == Independence == Since their foundation, WhyEurope has always emphasized their character as a non- partisan and independent initiative. Despite being in contact with actors of the European Union, they have repeatedly stated their distance to the EU institutions. They refuse to accept any financial support in any form from the European Union and other political institutions or actors. == Relationship to other initiatives == WhyEurope has had a number of cooperations with other pro-European initiatives. Since beginning of 2016, Benedikt Kau and Hans- Christoph Schl√ºter were in contact with Daniel R√∂der and Sabine R√∂der when they launched the demonstrations under the name Pulse of Europe. Pulse of Europe adopted the campaign and the slogan of the campaign ‚ÄúBlijf bij ons‚Äù focusing on the Dutch General elections. Together, the initiatives mobilized ten thousands of people joining pro-European demonstrations. Further cooperations included projects with the Young European Federalists and Laute Europ√§er. == Reception == On 31 January, Marine Le Pen (Front National) filed a parliamentary request in the European Parliament asking about the funding of WhyEurope through the European Commission. Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger, then responsible person for the EU budget, replied that the Commission has not funded WhyEurope in any way and the name were not found within the central accounting system. November 2017, WhyEurope has been awarded European Public Communication Award by the European Committee Of The Regions. The prize was received during the EuroPCom in the hemicycle of the European Parliament. In May 2018, WhyEurope has been awarded the Arno-Esch-Preis by the Association of Liberal Academics in Germany. == References  * Category:Pro-Europeanism Category:Organisations based in T√ºbingen Category:Political organisations based in Germany Category:Organizations established in 2017 ","title":"WhyEurope"},{"id":"56863202","text":"Norman (also known as Norman III, 1905 - after 1918) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was exported from the United States as a yearling and showed some promise as a juvenile in 1907 when he won twice from nine starts. In the following spring he recorded a 25/1 upset victory in the 2000 Guineas. He was unplaced when favourite for the Epsom Derby and finished last in the St Leger but ended his second season with a victory in the Newmarket St Leger. He raced for another two seasons but never recaptured his classic winning form. He made no impact as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Norman was a bay horse bred in the United States by his American owner August Belmont Jr. Like several major American owners Belmont had moved most of his hoses to Europe following the passing of the Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law. The colt was sent to England as a yearling and entered training with John Watson at the Palace House stable in Newmarket in Suffolk. Both of Norman's parents were bred and owned by Belmont. He was sired by the Kentucky-bred stallion Octagon whose wins included the Toboggan Handicap, Withers Stakes and Brooklyn Derby. His dam Nineveh was a descendant of the broodmare Mildred, making her a relative of Kalitan and Souffle (Kentucky Oaks). ==Racing career1907: two-year-old season=== Norman ran nine times as a two-year-old in 1907. He won two races, including the Exeter Stakes, and finished third twice. When tried against top-class opposition in the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October he finished unplaced behind the filly Rhodora. ===1908: three-year-old season=== August Belmont, Jr., who owned and bred Norman On 6 May 1908 Norman started a 25/1 outsider against sixteen opponents for the 100th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Otto Madden he upset the odds as he took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by three lengths clear of Sir Archibald with White Eagle three quarters of a length back in third. The result of the race saw Norman promoted to the position of favourite for the Epsom Derby. In the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 3 June Norman started the 11/2 favourite and was againpartneed by Madden. He was in second place at half way but then faded out of contention and finished fifteenth of the eighteen runners behind the 100/1 outsider Signorinetta. In September he was fancied to run well in the St Leger but made no impact as he came home last of the ten runners behind Your Majesty. In October, the colt returned to winning form when he took the Newmarket St Leger over one and three-quarter miles. ===Later career=== Norman remained in training for at least two more years but failed to win any more major races. In March 1910 he finished third behind Cinderella and Forerunerr in the Lincolnshire Handicap. Later that month he a second when favourite for the Newark Plate at Nottingham Racecourse. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Norman a \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Norman was exported to become a breeding stallion at the Abony Stud in Hungary. He had no success as a sire of winners. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1905 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United States Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 12-b Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Norman (horse)"},{"id":"56863204","text":"Statistics of L.

Carly Motors started tuning racing engines but grew into one of the top teams of the European Touring Car Championship and the Guia Race of Macau between 2001 and 2004. ==History== Carly Pellinkhof started her chip tuning company in 1979. Her company supported the Mercedes-Benz factory supported teams in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. In 1992 Pellinkhof started her own racing team. ===Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft=== Carly Motors ran a BMW M3 in the 1991 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. Entered under Marlboro BMW Dealer Team Cor Euser was the team's sole driver. Eusers best result was a thirteenth place at the Norisring. ===Dutch Touring Car Championship=== Carly Motors entered four BMW 325i's in the 1992 Dutch Production Car Championship. Marcel van Vliet, Ger van Krimpen, Heikki Salmenoutio and Salvatore Santisi raced the cars in the 'over 2000cc' class. Van Vliet was the first driver to win during the season, at Circuit Zandvoort. While Team Lotus driver Tom Langeberg won the championship, Carly Motors drivers Van Vliet and Salmenoutio finished second and third. Starting in 1997 the Dutch Touring Car Championship following Group N regulations was formed. Under the name H&P; Panorama Team Carly Motors started the season with Duncan Huisman and Sandor van Es. The duo dominated the inaugural season with Huisman taking the title and Van Es finishing second in the series standings. Van Es and Huisman remained at the H&P; Panorama Team for 1998. The team faced heavy competition, mainly from Renault. Van Es won three races and placed second in the series standings. Cor Euser returned to the team in 1999. Euser won five races and clinched the championship in the final weekend over Frans Verschuur. For 2000 the team returned to dominance with Huisman and Van Es but it was sometimes controversial. In the second round of the championship the team won both races but was later disqualified on technical grounds. During the third round of the championship Van Es was leading the race but let Huisman pass in the last round. Pellinkhof ordered Van Es to slow down to let Huisman pass. The team won nine out of thirteen races with Huisman winning the championship over Van Es. Huisman won the series championship over Van Es. In 2001 the Carly Motors built BMW's again caused controversy. Their dominance was questioned by other teams. Some of the teams wanted the organisation to add weight to the Carly Motors cars. Van Es won two races but was a constant top five finisher to clinch the championship. Teammate Tom Coronel made his debut in the series winning three races and ended fifth in the standings. In 2002 the Dutch Touring Car Championship struggled to attract a representative grid. A low point was reached in July when only nine cars started the race. The championship was won by Huisman winning nine races out of fifteen. Teammate Molenaar finished third in the championship. The duo was split by Renault works driver Jeroen Bleekemolen. ===European Touring Car Championship=== With the Super Production class added to the European Touring Car Championship in 2001 Carly Motors joined the series. The team raced the championship with two BMW 320i's for Dutchman Duncan Huisman and Swede Peggen Andersson. The duo competed the full season while Carly Motors entered three other cars in selected races. Huisman started the season strong with two second place finishes, only beaten by countryman Peter Kox. Huisman won at Magny-Cours, Zolder and the Hungaroring. Huisman settled for second in the championship, behind Kox. Andersson settled for seventh in the championship with two fourth places as his best result. At the season finale at Estoril two guest drivers scored the best results for Carly Motors. Sandor van Es and Tom Coronel finished second and third, behind CiBiEmme Team driver Gianni Morbidelli. For 2002 the Super Production, FIA Group N, became the main class of the championship, replacing Super Touring. ===Current company=== Carly Motors continues to fine-tune engines, with a focus on software remapping for raceteams with cars competing on the highest level of motorsport as well as regular street and muscle cars.

In 1928, Biswas came first in an entrance examination among the district, later joining the revolutionary independence movement led by Master Da Surya Sen. In 1930, he was seriously wounded while preparing bombs. ==Revolutionary activities and death== Surya Sen and his followers decided to assassinate one Mr. Craig, the Inspector General of Police for Chittagong. Biswas and Kalipada Chakrabarty were assigned to this task. On 1 December 1930, they went to Chandpur station, but mistakenly killed a rail inspector, Tarini Mukherjee, instead of Craig. Biswas and Chakravarty were arrested on 2 December 1930. Biswas's family and friends lacked the funds required to travel to Chittagong and visit him in Alipore Jail, Kolkata. At that time, another revolutionary nationalist Pritilata Waddedar was staying in Kolkata and was asked to meet Biswas. She was successful in pretending to be his sister, in order to gain access. Biswas' martyrdom later inspired Pritilata. Biswas was sentenced to death after his trial. In the morning of 4 August 1931, he was executed at Alipore Central Jail.

While working for the Wuhan TV Station, he tried to make some documentary films, the first film he made is about a professor of philosophy, Xiaomang Deng who works at Wuhan University, and an engineer Ping Xiao works for Wuhan Meat Processing Factory, these two person seem to be irrelevant in terms of occupation, whereas Chen finds there are some common aspects in their daily life, so this becomes one of his filming style, putting irrelevant person into same story and see the magical effects. He also suggests young filmmakers to get more experience from their daily life. \\"If you really want to make a good film, you should treat your friends, partners and children, all these relationships sincerely. Your feeling maybe incomplete because your life experience is not completed. If you don't support a family, you won't know the expense; If you don't get married, you won't know how hard to keep a relationship; If you don't have a baby, you won't know how difficult to raise he/her. The life experience just like a tree, shade grows with the tree branches spread out.\\" He stated that most things happen in real life is more exciting than script, people in real life are more touchable than actor/actress, documentary films are not synonymous with dullness, it should be seen by more people. He believes that documentary films are able to bring experience for audience instead of solving problems or making statements. == Accolades == * To Live is Better Than to Die (2003) ** 2003 Peabody Awards ** 2003 Sundance Film Festival ‚Äì World Documentary (Nominated) ** 2003 IDFA Competition ‚Äì Feature-Length Documentary (Nominated) ** 2004 The Grierson Awards ‚Äì Best International Television Documentary * Please Vote for Me (2007) ** 2007 Traverse City Film Festival ‚Äì Founders Prize ** 2007 DOCNZ ‚Äì Best Medium Length Documentary ** 2007 DOCNZ ‚Äì Best Educational Documentary ** 2007 Silverdocs Film Festival ‚Äì Sterling Feature Award ** 2008 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival ‚Äì Working Films Award ** 2008 Jackson Hole Film Festival ‚Äì Best Documentary ** 2008 Danish TV Oscar ** 2008 Ashland Independent Film Festival ‚Äì Best Documentary ** 2008 Grierson Award ‚Äì Most Entertaining Documentary ** 2008 Chicago International Children's Film Festival ‚Äì Children's Jury, 2nd Prize ** 2008 Chicago International Children's Film Festival ‚Äì Adult's Jury, 1st Prize ** 2008 Taiwan International Children's Film Festival ‚Äì Special Jury Prize ** 2008 Roshd International Film Festival ‚Äì Golden Stature ** 2008 International Emmy ‚Äì Best Documentary (Nominated) ** 2008 10th Seoul International Youth Film Festival ‚Äì SIYFF Eyes Award == Major works == To Live is Better Than to Die (2003) is Weijun Chen's first documentary film, he records a poor family living in the rural area of Wenluo in Henan province, where 60% of the residents are HIV positive.

He played college basketball for the UMBC Retrievers. He also competed for the VCU Rams in his freshman season but played a limited role before transferring. Prior to college, Lyles attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he was a three-star recruit. At UMBC, he earned all-conference honors for three consecutive years. He most notably led the Retrievers to a first- round victory over Virginia at the 2018 NCAA Tournament, the first time a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed in men‚Äôs tournament history. ==Early life== Lyles was born in Silver Spring, Maryland to Lester Lyles and Carol Motley. His father Lester was a four-year football player for the Virginia Cavaliers, for whom he won the 1984 Peach Bowl, before spending seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). His mother Carol attended the University of Virginia as well. In addition, Lyles' sister Symone played four seasons of basketball for the Ohio Bobcats. His parents later divorced, and Jairus was mainly raised by his mother. ==High school career== Lyles attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he was a combo guard. As a freshman, he was teammates with future NBA All-Star player Victor Oladipo. In his junior season, he averaged 11 points and three assists per game and helped his team reach the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) finals. As a senior, he averaged 13.4 points and 4.3 assists per game but his team finished with a 14‚Äì17 record, one of the worst seasons in program history. Lyles also played for Team Takeover on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit, competing alongside Josh Hart. Lyles was rated a consensus three-star recruit and chose to play for VCU in college despite drawing interest from Oklahoma State, who gave him an offer, as well as Penn State and Virginia Tech. ==College career== Lyles competed for the VCU Rams as a freshman in 2013‚Äì14 under head coach Shaka Smart, averaging 0.7 points, 0.2 rebounds, and 0.3 assists in only 2.9 minutes per game. He only recorded two field goals in the season, scoring a season-high three points on two occasions, against Fordham and Rhode Island. Following the season, he transferred to play for the Robert Morris Colonials but was forced to sit out in 2014‚Äì15 due to eligibility rules. After one semester at Robert Morris, Lyles transferred to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where he would play for the Retrievers starting in the 2015‚Äì16 season. He made an instant impact as a sophomore for UMBC, averaging 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game and garnering second-team All-America East Conference accolades. In his junior season, Lyles averaged 18.9 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 2.6 assists en route to second-team All-America East honors. He scored a total of 604 points, breaking the school record for most points by a junior. Lyles made his senior debut on November 10, 2017, in a loss to SMU, scoring 24 points with five assists for UMBC. In his next game, he recorded 31 points, five rebounds, four assists, and three steals in a defeat to Arizona. On November 19, Lyles had a double-double of 26 points and 11 rebounds against Colgate. He scored a season-best 35 points to help UMBC beat Hartford on January 15, 2018. By the end of his regular season campaign, Lyles was named first-team All-America East. On March 10, in the championship game of the 2018 America East Tournament vs. Vermont, Lyles scored 27 points, including a game-winning three-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. He was named most outstanding player (MOP) of the tournament. On March 16, at the first round of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, Lyles notched a game-high 28 points, shooting 9-of-11 from the field, to lead UMBC to a 20-point upset over top-seeded Virginia. The game marked the first time in tournament history that a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed. After his performance, Lyles drew national attention, being featured in stories by The Washington Post and USA Today. ==Professional career== Lyles went undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft but subsequently joined the Utah Jazz for the NBA Summer League. He is the first Retriever to play in the 12 years the NBA has had a Summer League. On July 12, 2018, he signed with the Utah Jazz. After appearing in five preseason games, Lyles was waived on October 14. The Jazz added Lyles to their NBA G League affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stars. On July 25, 2019, Lyles signed with MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg of the Basketball Bundesliga. On December 15, 2019, he signed with L√∂wen Braunschweig of the German Basketball Bundesliga (BBL).

Jonathan Howard and Jonathan Demurger star as friends who antagonize a Paris taxi driver (Jess Liaudin) by not paying the fare. The taxi driver chases them through the city, killing several people who get in his way. == Plot == Englishman Chris returns to Paris after abruptly leaving two years ago. He meets his ex-girlfriend, Ludivine, and friend, Luc, frustrated to learn they are now dating. Luc takes them to a party, where Chris talks to Ludivine. She reminds him that he left without any explanation and says she is over him. Ludivine takes Luc's car when she leaves early. Upset, Chris also leaves the party, and Luc follows him, attempting to persuade him to attend another party. As they drunkenly walk through Paris, Luc suggests they steal a car. Chris refuses and suggests getting a taxi instead. Luc snorts cocaine in the cab, further upsetting Chris. The driver does not react and remains silent during the entire trip, unnerving them. Luc says he needs to get money from an ATM but runs off, laughing. Chris apologetically flees the cab, joining Luc. Luc reveals he has a large amount of cash on him and refused to pay on a whim. As Chris and Luc argue, the taxi driver stalks them, chasing them down several streets. Eventually, Luc is confronted by several hostile police officers. Though Luc protests they have done nothing wrong, their leader searches them and steals Luc's cash. One policeman declines to accept the money, and the rest split it. After the police leave, Luc and Chris blame each other for the current situation and something that happened two years ago, only for the taxi driver to chase them again. They lead him to an underground car park, where a security guard confronts him. The guard beats his dog when it refuses to attack the driver. Enraged by the man's actions, the driver beats him and rescues the dog. The driver once again finds them and chases them through Paris. Frustrated and unwilling to go to the police, Luc takes them to Detox, a violent gangster. There, Luc claims that the taxi driver stole his money, which he owes to Detox. When Detox sees the driver outside his house, he leaves with a sword. The driver easily kills him, enters the house, and kills everyone but Chris and Luc, who flee. Finally convinced their danger, Luc calls the police. Chris looks for a street sign to tell them their location, but the driver hits him with the car. Now slowed down, they flee again, only to be stopped by the same policeman who earlier robbed Luc. The police arrest Chris and Luc for the massacre, ignoring their warnings that the driver is nearby. The driver attacks the policemen but spares the life of the one who refused to take Luc's money. Luc and Chris rescue a wounded officer and flee into a nearby park in his car. After the officer dies, they panic, knowing that they have no witnesses left to implicate the driver. They fight each other to a draw, eventually revealing what happened two years ago: Chris and Luc drunkenly harassed a homeless person, pouring alcohol on him as they mimed urinating. When he fought back, they beat him, accidentally causing him to catch on fire and die. They discuss the possibility that the driver knows about this somehow and is punishing them. Luc receives a call from Ludivine, who says the driver has kidnapped her and brought her to a factory. Luc suggests they abandon her, but Chris refuses. Chris rescues Ludivine but is overpowered by the driver. Luc appears and helps him, but the driver easily overpowers both of them. Chris begs the driver to leave Ludivine alone. The driver releases her but silently demands that Luc accompany him. Luc, sure that he is to be killed, enters the taxi. He is surprised to be put in a jail cell naked. After an undisclosed amount of time, the driver gives him a book to read that details the history of a secret society of vigilantes that recruits from people who have repented from selfish and violent lives. Overcome by the realization that he, too, has lived a selfish life, Luc agrees to join the driver's secret society. After training with him, the driver drops off Luc in front of violent mugging, leaving him to stop it himself. == Cast == * Jonathan Howard as Chris * Jonathan Demurger as Luc * Fanny Valette as Ludivine * Jess Liaudin as the driver * √âdouard Montoute as the police officer == Production == The ‚Ç¨560,000 budget was raised through a combination of private investors and crowdfunding. == Release == After a festival run, Night Fare opened in France on 16 January 2016. == Reception == On French review aggregator website AlloCin√©, Night Fare has an average rating of 2.4/5 stars based on nine reviews. British magazine Starburst rated it 8/10 stars. Their reviewer, Joel Harley, praised the film's twist ending but said it will likely divide audiences. Writing for American horror website Bloody Disgusting, Patrick Cooper called the premise \\"ripe for excitement\\" but said the film degenerates into moralizing and has an unbelievable ending. Gareth Jones of Dread Central rated it 5/5 stars and called it one of the best films of the year. Night Fare won Best Feature Film at the Mile High Horror Film Festival. == References  External links == * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 action thriller films Category:French films Category:French action thriller films Category:English-language films Category:French-language films Category:Films about taxicabs ","title":"Night Fare"},{"id":"56863893","text":"Avner Laskin (; born May 11, 1969) is an Israeli chef, restaurateur, and caterer. == Career == Avner's career began in his teens, when he started working at Eidan Bistro in 1987 as a shift manager.

As founder and longtime director of the Fort Worth Boys Club, she devoted her life to improving the lives of boys in Fort Worth and Tarrant County. She was the first, and for many years, only female director of a boys' club in the United States. Leigh was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. == Early life == Hazel Elizabeth Vaughn was born July 27, 1897 in Fort Worth to Bessie Elizabeth DeCory and Sam Vaughn. Both parents' families were early Texas settlers. Her maternal great- grandfather had arrived in Tarrant County in 1845, and subsequent generations were raised on family land on Oak Grove Road, in present-day southeast Fort Worth. Hazel's mother was a graduate of Fort Worth's Polytechnic College; her father worked for Axtell Windmill Supply and was known for his sense of humor. Hazel and her older brother, Howard, grew up in a house at the corner of Lipscomb and Rosedale Streets in the area now known as the Near Southside; the family later moved to a home on Travis Avenue. She attended the DeZavala School, Alexander Hogg School, took piano lessons at Fort Worth University, and graduated from Fort Worth Central High School in 1915. She did not immediately attend college due to ill health. == Career == Hazel was active in Fort Worth society. She was an active member of the Ich Ka Bibble Club, Yaki Ki Yi Club and Falcolm Hegbeth Social Club until the latter was dissolved after a fatal drunk driving accident resulting from spiked punch at a club party; the club was re-formed as the Junior League of Fort Worth. She attended dances and other social events at Camp Bowie during World War I, and worked at the camp filing personnel records after its closure in 1918. In 1920, Hazel voted in the first election open to women. The same year, she was hired to handle truancy at Daggett Elementary School; in 1923 she became assistant to the school's principal. === San Francisco === In 1925, Grover accepted a position at Marland Oil Company and the couple moved to San Francisco. Hazel took a job writing classified ads at the San Francisco Chronicle under an assumed name so that her husband‚Äîand his employer‚Äîwould not find out about her work. Within six months she was promoted to manager of classified advertising and supervised a staff of 34. When Grover eventually found out how she was spending her days and Hazel's newspaper career came to an abrupt halt, she joined the Daughters of the Confederacy and took an interest in the Columbia Park Boys' Club in the Mission District. === Return to Fort Worth === The Leighs returned to Fort Worth in 1926 when Marland Oil opened a Fort Worth office. Hazel worked at the Fort Worth Press and was again active in Fort Worth society, becoming a member of the Fort Worth Woman's Club. Grover left the oil business for law enforcement, joining the Secret Service and eventually becoming deputy sheriff of Tarrant County and a deputy U.S. Marshal. In 1931, Hazel joined St. Andrews Episcopal Church, although raised a Baptist, and took a public speaking course at Texas Christian University. === Panther Boys' Club === Funded by members of the local Rotary Club, the Panther Boys' Club opened on 3rd Street in downtown Fort Worth in 1926, becoming the second-oldest boys' club in Texas. In 1927 Fort Worth society women formed the Panther Boys' Club Women's Council to support the club. Hazel's mother became president of the women's auxiliary in 1930, and Hazel accepted the role of vice-president in 1933. Only a month later, Hazel assumed the presidency, and by 1934 had tripled membership in the group. In 1934, the Panther Boys' Club hired a new executive director, causing a rift between the boys' club administration and the women's auxiliary. A group from the women's auxiliary, led by Hazel Vaughn Leigh, broke away from the Panther Boys' Club and formed the Fort Worth Boys Club in 1935. === Fort Worth Boys Club === The new Fort Worth Boys Club was established in Fort Worth's Northside with funding from the Kiwanis Club of North Fort Worth. Northside was chosen because it was the most populous part of the city with the \\"greatest delinquency\\" among children and teens. The new club opened at Boulevard Methodist Church on February 1, 1935, available to boys ages 6‚Äì14. 205 boys enrolled on opening day; enrollment had more than tripled by October of the same year. The club opened a new building at 100 Northwest 28th Street in 1937. The club offered free medical care, eyeglasses, and clothing; after-school snacks were provided when boys began fainting from hunger. In addition to such necessities, boys attended free movies at the New Isis Theatre, received music lessons, and were given lectures on first aid, good citizenship, and the Bible. Boys were taken on hikes by students from Texas Christian University and led in other activities by Works Progress Administration and National Youth Administration workers between the ages of 16 and 25. Under Hazel's leadership, the women operating Fort Worth Boys Club held parties and bridge tournaments as fundraisers and worked tirelessly to secure financial backing for the club throughout the remainder of the Great Depression. The club's needs increased rapidly during World War II as many more families had working parents due to war industries and tours of duty. Special training was also provided for older boys preparing to enter the armed services. In 1957, Hazel was awarded the Boys Club of America's Bronze Keystone Award for her work with the Fort Worth Boys Club. In 1959, she was appointed by governor Price Daniel to represent Texas at the White House Conference on Children and Youth and to serve a ten- year term on the State Committee for the Study of Juvenile Delinquency. In 1960, she was awarded the Boys' Club Professional Association's Golden Boy Award at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. She led the expansion of the Fort Worth Boys Club to include a recreation center at Eagle Mountain Lake in the 1970s and retired as the club's director in 1973, having grown membership to over 3500 boys. She continued to serve on the organization's board until 1985 when the core group of women leading the club lost an internal power struggle. The new leadership of the Fort Worth Boys Club honored Hazel with a Lifetime of Philanthropy award in 1987; in 1990, the club merged with the Panther Boys' Club to become the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Fort Worth. Among its notable alumni are professional football player and Texas House representative Yale Lary, pastor John Osteen, and Olympic shot putter Darrow Hooper. == Other associations and honors == Hazel was a charter member of the American Legion Auxiliary. She and her mother were both active in the Democratic Party. She was invited to attend a dinner honoring John F. Kennedy in Austin on November 22, 1963, but he was assassinated in Dallas earlier that day. She also attended the inauguration of Texas governor Dolph Briscoe in 1975. Hazel was one of the first 150 boys' club directors to be certified as Professional Workers of Boys Clubs, and a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers. She represented the American Association of University Women on the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in 1960. In 1979, she was the recipient of the American Association of University Women's Hercules Award and the Boys' Clubs Professional Association Gold Award. Hazel was a member of the Texas Social Welfare Association, Girls Protective Association, and Tarrant County Historical Society. Hazel was the president of the '93 Club, active in The Woman's Club of Fort Worth, the honorary vice president of the TCU Frog Club, an honorary Tarrant County deputy sheriff, and an honorary member of the Theta Epsilon sorority. She served on the Fort Worth Public Library board of trustees and citizen advisory board from 1973 to 1979 and was the recipient of the North Fort Worth Historical Society's Tad Lucas Life Achievement Award in 1993. In 1993, Hazel was also nominated to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. == Personal life == In 1923, Hazel Vaughn married Grover Cleveland Leigh (1888‚Äì1943), whom she had met through her brother. Grover, an Illinois native, had moved to Fort Worth as an employee of Empire Gas and Fuel. He was then relocated to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where the couple was wed and lived for two years. These were the first years that Hazel, raised in a wealthy family, had lived without servants. In the 1930s, Hazel and Grover's relationship became strained as he developed a problem with alcohol. The couple, who suffered a deeply unhappy marriage, lived with Hazel's parents for several years even though Grover had a successful career. They never had any children and Grover died from head injuries caused by an accident at the Texas & Pacific Railway yards in 1943; he is buried at Shannon Rose Hill Cemetery in east Fort Worth.Ancestry.com. Texas, Death Certificates, 1903-1982 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2013. In the 1980s, a \\"billionaire friend\\" from Hazel's Bartlesfield, Oklahoma days proposed marriage, but she declined. Hazel Vaughn Leigh died on April 27, 1995.

Nicoll is Director and Louise Ines Doyle '34 Chief Curator of the Smith College Museum of Art. She was previously the Chief Curator and Curator of American Art of the Portland Museum of Art. She is an authority on American art and culture. == Education == In 1979, Nicoll attended Smith College, from where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and American Studies in 1983. In 1986, Nicoll received her Master of Arts degree in Early American Culture and a certificate in Museum Studies from the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture at the University of Delaware. == Career in the arts  1986-1992: Old Sturbridge Village === From 1985 to 1986, Nicoll completed a post-graduate curatorial fellowship at the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur, Delaware. Upon completion of the fellowship, Nicoll returned to Massachusetts to accept a post as Curator of Exhibits at the Old Sturbridge Village, a living museum. During her time there, she served as project director for the exhibitions ‚ÄúMeet Your Neighbors: New England Portraits, Painters and Society, 1790-1850‚Äù and ‚ÄúChanging Times, Changing Lives: Women in Rural New England in the early 19th century.‚Äù === 1992-2005: Portland Museum of Art === In 1992, Nicoll was hired as Curator of American Art at the Portland Museum of Art. She was later promoted to Chief Curator and William E. and Helen E. Thon Curator of American Art in 1995. During her tenure, Nicoll curated numerous noteworthy exhibitions featuring folk art, fabric collages, contemporary abstract works, paintings, drawing, prints and photography. Major exhibitions include \\"The Allure of the Maine Coast: Robert Henri and His Circle, 1903-1918\\" (June 1995), \\"Neil Welliver Prints: The Essence of Maine\\" (February 1996), \\"Andrew Wyeth at 80: A Celebration\\" (July 1997), \\"A Legacy for Maine: Masterworks from the Collection of Elizabeth B.

Nicoll also oversaw the restoration, interpretation, and reinstallation of the Museum‚Äôs Federal-era McLellan House and the historic L. D. M. Sweat Memorial Galleries, and she also reinstalled the Museum‚Äôs permanent collection galleries in the Charles Shipman Payson Building, allowing for a more integrated interpretation of the collection. Nicoll also authored numerous exhibition catalogues and gallery guides, and published many scholarly articles on topics including the architecture of Federal-era mansions and Quaker quilts; American artists such as Will Barnet, Abraham Bogdanove, Charles Codman, Winslow Homer, William and Marguerite Zorach; the art collection of American philanthropist Elizabeth B. Noyce; and the artistic community formed by Robert Henri on Monhegan Island. Under Nicoll's leadership, Nicoll helped the Portland Museum of Art build a larger, professional curatorial staff, and grow its collection through major gifts and purchases. Among the many major purchase initiatives overseen by Nicoll were Marsden Hartley‚Äôs Kinsman Falls (1930, oil on canvas), Marguerite Zorach‚Äôs The Garden (1914, oil and charcoal on canvas) and Diana of the Sea (1940, oil on canvas), and Louise Nevelson‚Äôs Untitled (circa 1976, painted wood). === 2005-2018: Smith College Museum of Art === In 2005, Nicoll returned to her alma mater where she succeeded Suzannah Fabing as Director and Chief Curator of the Smith College Museum of Art. Fabing retired after a 13-year tenure, during which the museum underwent an extensive renovation and expansion. > ‚ÄúThe Smith College Museum of Art‚Äôs elegant new facility, outstanding > collection and wonderful staff make the institution a powerful educational > resource for its community and have made this an irresistible opportunity > for me.

Among its permanent collection includes works by Manet, Monet, Picasso, Copley, Eakins, Stella, Motherwell, O‚ÄôKeeffe and many other famous painters, along with noteworthy sculpture and classical antiquities, prints, drawings and photographs. Under Nicoll's leadership, the museum has given particular attention to American female artists. In 2017, Nicoll oversaw the exhibition, \\"A Dangerous Woman: Subversion and Surrealism in the Art of Honor√© Sharrer,‚Äù which took a fresh look at American artist Honor√© Desmond Sharrer (1920-2009). The exhibition featured about 60 works, predominantly paintings, many of which came from Sharrer's estate. The exhibition, which represented the first public survey of Sharrer's work in many years, was organized by the Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and funded by the support of Smith alumnae Judith Plesser Targan '53, Art Museum Fund and the Charlotte Frank Rabb '35 Fund. == Personal life == Nicoll serves as a member of the New England Advisory Committee of the Archives of American Art, a research center within the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, he published several papers over a period of 2‚Äì3 years. The first paper introduced the priority method, a common technique in computability theory, in order to prove the existence of recursively enumerable sets with incomparable degrees of unsolvability. ‚ÄúTwo Recursively Enumerable Sets Not Recursive in Each Other‚Äù, [solution of Post‚Äôs problem], Proc.

Friedberg, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Volume 23, Issue 3 September 1958, pp. 309-316 In 1968, Friedberg proved independently what became known as Bell‚Äôs inequality, not knowing that J. S. Bell had proved it a few years earlier. He showed it to the physicist and historian Max Jammer, who somehow managed to insert it into his book ‚ÄúThe Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics‚Äù,The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966 2nd ed: New York: American Institute of Physics, 1989. although the latter bears the publication date 1966. This caused Friedberg some embarrassment later when classmates at Harvard, knowing of the result only through Jammer‚Äôs book, supposed that Friedberg was the first discoverer. (A letter from Friedberg to Jammer dated May 1971 begins, ‚ÄúIt was nice of you to remember what I showed you in 1968. I finally got around to writing it up in 1969, but just then I found out about Bell‚Äôs 1964 paper (Physics 1, 195) which had anticipated my ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô by three years. So I did not publish.‚Äù) More recently, Friedberg worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics in collaboration with the late Pierre Hohenberg. ‚ÄúCompatible Quantum Theory‚Äù, R. Friedberg, P.C. Hohenberg, Rep. Prog. Phys. 77, 2014, 092001 - 092035 ; ‚ÄúWhat is Quantum Mechanics? A Minimal Formulation R. Friedberg, P. C. Hohenberg‚Äù, Published by Springer-Verlag 21 February 2018 by Springer-Verlag in Foundations of Physics, Feb 21, page 1 (2018). Friedberg is also known for his love of music and poetry. He wrote poems in several letters http://physics.gmu.edu/~isatija/R2D2.pdf http://physics.gmu.edu/~isatija/R2D3.pdf http://physics.gmu.edu/~isatija/R2D4.pdf http://physics.gmu.edu/~isatija/R2D5.pdf to cognitive scientist and writer Douglas Hofstadter in 1989. The last letter contains two sonnets ‚ÄùThe Electromagnetic Spectrum‚Äù and \\"Fermions and Bosons\\". These letters also include critiques and analyses of topics in Metamagical Themas, a collection of articles that Hofstadter wrote for Scientific American during the early 1980s. Friedberg wrote an informal book on number theory titled \\"An Adventurer's Guide to Number Theory\\".\\"An Adventurer‚Äôs Guide to Number Theory\\", R. Friedberg. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968; reissued by Dover Publications, 1994. In the book, he states, \\"The difference between the theory of numbers and arithmetic is like the difference between poetry and grammar.\\" == Early life == Friedberg was born in Manhattan on Oct 8, 1935. His father, Charles K. Friedberg, was a renowned cardiologist whose book ‚ÄúDiseases of the Heart‚Äù, published by W.B. Saunders (1949, 1956, 1966), was translated into many languages and became the undisputed ‚Äùbible‚Äù for its thorough explication of physiologic mechanisms combined with its straightforward clinical advice to physicians, drawn from the author‚Äôs own practice. His mother, Gertrude Tonkonogy, wrote a play, ‚ÄúThree-Cornered Moon‚Äù, whose success on Broadway in 1933 was felt to have ‚Äúrescued‚Äù a season in which the theatrical world was uncertain whether any play would draw audiences in the depth of the Great Depression. ==Selected Published Works== * \\"Two Recursively Enumerable Sets Not Recursive in Each Other\\", Richard Friedberg, Proc.

She is best known for her vocational programming created at Radcliffe starting in the Great Depression and also for her help in restoring Dorshester Abbey. == Biography == Stedman was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the family later moved to Belmont, Massachusetts where she attended high school. Stedman enjoyed high school, writing, \\"I think I worked harder and got more academic pleasure out of some of my work in high school than I ever did in college.\\" She went on to Radcliffe College where she graduated in 1910. After school, she worked for a time at the Framingham Reformatory for Women until her brother convinced her to quit in order to run the family's candy store, a job she later discovered she hated. After two years, she quit and went to Europe with the YMCA to help the war effort there in 1917. She was a canteen worker in France and Germany working for the YMCA until 1919. Back in the United States, Stedman did not find work that interested her. Stedman then traveled to China in 1920, where she worked as a medical social worker in Hankou at an Episocopal Mission. She stayed until 1927, returning to Boston where she started working as an executive secretary for the Judge Baker Foundation. Ada Louise Comstock invited Stedman to come for the Appointment Bureau at Radcliffe in 1930. Stedman developed vocational programs for women in the 1930s. Undergraduates and graduate students were both helped by Stedman in finding employment. She created and directed the Training Course in Personnel Administration and supported professional training for women. Stedman worked as the director of the Training Course until 1941. Students could be awarded a fellowship grant in her name. Stedman stayed at Radcliffe until 1954, when she retired. As a retiree, she worked as a volunteer in different capacities. Between 1955 and 1959, Stedman volunteered at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. In 1959, she started spending half the year living with friends at the Manor House, Dorchester. Stedman created a group, the American Friends of Dorchester Abbey, which raised money for both the Abbey and the surrounding gardens. Stedman also wrote during her retirement. Her last years were spent living in Sherrill House, a nursing home in Boston run by the Episcopal church. She suffered from Menieres disease and had deafness. Stedman died in Boston on July 16, 1978. == Legacy == Stedman was awarded as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 for her work supporting the restoration of Dorchester Abbey.

Fleming skipped Scotland at two straight World Junior Curling Championships. At the 2012 World Junior Curling Championships, she led her rink of Lauren Gray, Alice Spence and Abi Brown to a 7-2 round robin record. In the playoffs, they knocked off the Czechs (skip: Zuzana Hajkova) twice to claim the gold medal. At the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships, Fleming led her rink of Gray, Jennifer Dodds and Brown to an 8-1 round robin record. In the playoffs, they beat the Japanese team (skip: Sayaka Yoshimura) in the 1 vs. 2 game, but lost in the final to Team Russia, skipped by Alina Kovaleva. Fleming capped off her youth career by skipping her Edinburgh Napier University team at the 2013 Winter Universiade with teammates Gray, Dodds and Spence. The team would finish the round robin with a 6-3 record, but lost both their playoff matches, settling for fourth place. ===Women's=== Fleming was invited to play alternate for Scotland (skipped by Kerry Barr) at the 2014 Ford World Women's Curling Championship. The team finished a disappointing 11th place, with Fleming losing all four games she played in. Fleming played third for Scotland at the 2014 European Mixed Curling Championship on a team skipped by Kyle Smith. They would finish fourth.

Beginning in 1857, Clement began platting Pilot Grove as well as established a general store and post office. Lee- Peacock Feud of 1867-1871 Pilot Grove also played host to several incidents involving the Lee-Peacock Feud of the area. In 1867, Captain Bob Lee, having fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, ran into a Unionist named James (Jim) Maddox in the Pilot Grove general store. Lee, having been held hostage by Maddox and a party of sympathizers some time earlier, offered to duel, however, Maddox declined. Later that day, Maddox shot Lee and \\"friends took the wounded man to the home of Doctor William H. Pierce, who took care of Lee until he was up ready to go back home. On February 24, a Union man named Hugh Hudson came to Pierce‚Äôs home, perhaps looking for Lee. Not finding him, Hudson shot and killed the doctor in front of his house\\" in Pilot Grove.

The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) continued to lead the way, opening or having a financial interest in new tracks opening in Ramsgate, Cardiff, Nottingham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Brighton and Stoke-on-Trent. The GRA also moved venues in Leeds from Fullerton Park to Elland Road Greyhound Stadium which was literally next door. Other major tracks to open included three London venues; West Ham Stadium with the capacity to accommodate 100,000 spectators, Clapton Stadium designed by the famous architect Sir Owen Williams and Wimbledon Stadium which would become one of the most prominent tracks in the industry. The latter was owned by Bill (W.J) Cearns. Three tracks also opened in Wales; White City Stadium, Cardiff, White City Swansea and Cardiff Arms Park. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) was formed, the purpose of this organisation was to govern greyhound racing and the body would be responsible for regulation and the rules of racing that came into force on 23 April. The NGRC consisted of twelve stewards usually chosen from military or police backgrounds. The first stewards included E.A.V.Stanley, Lt General Sir Edward Bethune and Major B.D.Corbett. The rules of racing were introduced and updated annually and any track wishing to be associated with them were required to agree to the rules and apply for licences. Tracks that were not licensed were called independent or 'Flapping' tracks, the latter description was not welcomed by the independent tracks. Calendars were formulated containing information for all licensed personal and anyone falling foul of the rules was subject to investigation and punishment. A passport or official identity book for every greyhound was introduced and was a vital component to ensure the policing of greyhounds at every track. The total annual attendance across the country for 1928 increased to 13 million 695,275 from 5,656,686 (in 1927). With the rise in popularity there was also the growth of opposition to greyhound racing. In March a decision by Salford City Council to cease permitting advertisements of greyhound races on the back of tram tickets was passed by a vote of 26 to 14. ==Competitions== Six new major events were inaugurated during the year. The Cesarewitch at West Ham and St Leger at Wembley for stayers and the Scurry Gold Cup at Clapton for sprinters were introduced in London. Three national Derby competitions were started - the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Carntyne, the Welsh Derby at Welsh White City (Cardiff) and the Irish Greyhound Derby at Harolds Cross. The Welsh Derby was not considered a classic event at this stage. ==Mick the Miller== The first great champion of greyhound racing emerged when on 18 April, Mick the Miller won on debut at Shelbourne Park but was overshadowed by his brother Macoma five days later. Macoma also trained by Horan broke the world record time for 500 yards beating the existing record holder Kriesler in a time of 28.80 sec. Later in the same month the pair went to Celtic Park to contest the Abercorn Cup and during a gallop Macoma caught his leg in the mesh traps breaking his hock. Mick the Miller finished third in the final but made a name for himself when equaling the world record of 28.80 at Shelbourne, a race sandwiched in between the semi and final at Celtic Park. Then Mick the Miller was struck down with distemper. There were no vaccine available and his chances of survival were slim but Arthur 'Doc' Callanan, who was the manager of Shelbourne Park as well as being a qualified veterinary surgeon on site nursed him back to health. In the August, both Mick the Miller and Macoma were put up for sale by Father Brophy. Macoma was sold for 290 guineas but Mick the Millers reserve was not met, a fortunate moment for his owner Father Brophy. ==Ireland== The Irish Derby was unofficial because Harolds Cross decided to run a 'National Derby' without consulting the Irish racing authorities. This was a practice they would continue to do until the formation of classic races in 1932. Also in Ireland it was clear that the 1926 Betting Act passed by the Oireachtas, D√°il √âireann was benefitting the Irish government with funds from the tax it received from gambling. The 5% off course tax and 2.5% on course tax also seemed to be a catalyst for new track builds in Ireland. However a proposed government amendment to tax the unregulated Irish flapping tracks was defeated 66 votes to 48. In Ireland the Harolds Cross Parish Church held sermons called \\"The Moral Challenge of Greyhound Racing\\" and the \\"Religion and the Gambling Spirit\\". ===1928 Unofficial Irish Derby=== The winner of the 1928 Irish Greyhound Derby was Tipperary Hills. On Thursday 16 August, Tipperary Hills (Billy Quinn), Curristown (John Shannon) and Happy Man won the semi finals. Tipperary Hills defeated PJ Graham's Battle Island by one length in 30.72 sec, Curristown defeated Gilly Gooly by two lengths in 30.95 sec and the third and final semi final was won by Happy Man (M Hammond) from False Favourite (C Forde) by four lengths in 31.10 sec. ==Tracks opened== {   + -

The film is produced by Swapnil Shetkar and Madhav Gad under the banner of Go Goa Gollywood Productions. This film is inspired from real life incidents of land scam in Goa. It was released commercially all over Goa on 26 December 2014 and became an instant hit with unprecedented box office performance for a Konkani film despite being pitted against Amir khan starrer PK, one of the biggest Hindi film. It ran for 101 days in Goa during its initial release and completed a record number of 600 shows. This film has completed more than 1000 shows theatrically by December 2016, thus becoming the most successful konkani film on the box office. == Plot == The film is about John D' Silva, who migrates to U.S. after the death of his parents leaving his ancestral house in Goa called \\"Home Sweet Home\\" to be looked after by his one and only friend Kaytan. When he returns to Goa after 20 years, he is shocked to see a huge residential complex standing in place of his ancestral house. Only the famous landmark, old Holy Cross outside the complex, stands there to convince the taxi driver Raj that it is the same location for certain. Now it becomes very crucial for John to find out the mystery behind this and Kaytan is the only person who can help them solve it but soon John and Raj get one more shock when they come to know that Kaytan stays in the very same complex. The relation between John and Raj, that of customer and driver turns into close friendship during the course of these events and they decide to fight for justice. During this tough journey John comes across various social issues, colourful characters and vast transformation in Goa that has taken place during his stay in U.S. Eventually they conclude that it is time to raise their voice to demand the justice and change the \\"SUSHEGAD\\"(laid-back) image of Goans. As Raj & John unearth more & more evidence it becomes clear that this whole thing is part of the \\"biggest but most silent\\" land scam run by powerful and greedy builders with the help & blessings of politicians. Raj & John risk their life to expose this scam and the people involved in it. == Production == This film is inspired from land scams happening in Goa. One incident in particular is in which Arjuna awardee Dr. Otilia Mascarenhas saw her ancestral property in Porvorim fraudulently 'sold' to a land shark. This was a time when Goa had hardly one or two theatrical konkani releases in a year, that too in maximum of 2 screens so the filmmakers had to produce the films by themselves as no producer was ready to fund the project. It was made on a very minimal budget. The film was shot at various real locations in Goa. Principal photography began on 18 October 2014 and went on till 3 November 2014. == Release == The film was released commercially all over Goa on 26 December 2014 in 12 Screens. The premiere of the film, held at Inox Panjim was attended by then Honourable Defence Minister of India, Mr. Manohar Parrikar as the chief guest. Every show was houseful for the first week. It complete 100 houseful shows in 14 days. It ran for 84 days in 12 screens and completed 101 days in 6 screens resulting in more than 1000 shows theatrically. Due to limited numbers of screens the producers came up with an alternate way of taking the film to the audience. The film was screened in Auditoriums like Ravindra Bhavan all over Goa, Panchayat halls and church halls. Special screenings were also arranged in remote villages of Goa by renting equipments like projector, screen and 5.1 surround sound system. After its successful performance in India the word of mouth spread and there was a huge demand for the film from Konkani speaking community in Gulf countries. So far 7 special screenings have taken place in Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Muscat & Oman. Home Sweet Home was also screened in IFFI 2015. Home Sweet Home was also re-released on 15 January 2016, three weeks after the successful release of its sequel Home Sweet Home 2 - Now the game will be rough In October 2016, the film was also made available out of India on a digital portal called goencho balcao. == Accolades == The film won 6 awards in the 8th Goa State Film Awards including the award for best screenplay, best director and second best feature film. == References  External links == * Category:2014 films Category:Films set in Goa Category:Films shot in Goa Category:Konkani cinema Category:Indian films Category:2010s Konkani-language films Category:2014 comedy films ","title":"Home Sweet Home (2014 film)"},{"id":"56864370","text":"View of the mountain ridge of the Hoher Bogen in the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park Location of the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park The Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park () covers an area of 1,796 km¬≤ and is thus one of the largest nature parks in the German state of Bavaria. == Landscape == The nature park covers the whole territory of the county of Cham and the eastern part of the county of Schwandorf. In the northwest it borders the Upper Palatine Forest Nature Park, in the east, the Czech Republic, and in the south on the Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Its highest summits are the Gro√üer Osser (1,293 m), Hoher Bogen (1,079 m), Kaitersberg (1,133 m), Enzian (1,285 m), Schwarzeck (1,238 m), Zwercheck (1,333 m) and Kleiner Arber (1,384 m). The proportion of forest today is about 40 percent. 76 percent of the nature park territory is protected and 2,084 hectares have been designated as nature reserve. == Geology == The mica schist on the Osser and the chalk transgression in the Obertr√ºbenbach Quarry are among Bavaria's most attractive geotopes. In addition to the dominant crystalline bedrock of granite and gneiss there are various sedimentary layers, siliceous and calcareous rocks, ancient limestones, mica schists and, in the geological feature of the 150-kilometre-long Pfahl ridge, quartzite and slate, which in places form rock pinnacles and towers. Guided tours in the F√ºrstenzeche Lam are offered for mineral collectors. == Nature == The spignel plant, which occurs in these mountains and from which the B√§rwurz spirit is distilled, is well known.

Today it is one of the 'Camelot Churches' of South Somerset in the Diocese of Bath and Wells and has been a Grade II* listed building since 1961.Church of St Thomas √† Becket, South Cadbury - Historic England database The church was much restored in the 1850s and 1870s. View towards the chancel Wall painting, supposedly of St Thomas Becket The pulpit dates to 1874 The baptismal font dates to about 1871 The Domesday Book of 1086 states that a priest (clericus) here had half of geldable land, which indicates an important church was on the site then. The dedication is to Thomas Becket who was martyred at Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. The first recorded Rector at South Cadbury is Peter de Burg in 1265, when the Cult of St Thomas would have been at its height and which makes it likely that the early wall painting (restored in 1984) of a bishop in cope and mitre seen on the splay of a window in the south aisle may represent St Thomas himself.South Cadbury: A Brief Guide with Historical Notes (N.D.) pg 1 Built of cary and lias stone, mostly ashlar, with some Doulting stone dressings, the church largely dates from the 13th and 15th centuries, but was widely restored in 1874. Many of the fittings date from this time. However, the tower with its turret, pinnacles and gargoyles was built in the 14th-century and has a peal of six bells, while the church also boasts a 15th-century roof with angel brackets and carved bosses, and an early wall painting of St Thomas. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Church of St Thomas √† Becket, South Cadbury - Camelot Churches database The porch has been much restored but the inner and outer doorways, windows and the chancel arch belong to the later Perpendicular Period. The arcade is part of the original Early English building and dates from about 1280. The pillars are quatrefoil and have moulded capitals and decorative rings; the tower arch dates from the same period. In 1780 the gallery was moved from the bottom of the body of the church, where it hid the belfry arch. The Mary and Martha Window is a memorial to the Rev. James Arthur Bennett who was Rector from 1866 to 1890. It was due to his scholarly supervision that the restoration of 1874 was so successful. The chancel itself was entirely rebuilt in 1874 with the exception of the two windows to the North, which were preserved so far as the stonework allowed. Early in the 19th-century the East window was cut down to form a window for the vestry. The present East Window dates to the restoration of 1874 and the glass depicting the Ascension is by Clayton and Bell, as is all the glass in the church from that period. The finely carved Crucifixion Scene which stands above the altar was erected in 1870 and is by Thomas Earp.Guide, pg 2 The pulpit stands on an old entrance to the rood loft. It is made of Bath stone and was carved for the restoration of 1874. A single panel from the earlier pulpit survived at the time and was used as a model for the pew-ends in the nave. All the wood in the church dates to this period with the exception of the tower door and screen. The niche behind the pulpit is in its original position, as is the squint or hagioscope in the south chancel arch, which was made to allow worshippers a view of the altar during Mass. The baptismal font was placed in the church in 1871; no trace of an earlier font survives except for a pewter bowl which was used for baptisms for many years until it was stolen in 1991.Nikolaus Pevsner, Buildings of England, South and West Somerset (1958) The south aisle was rebuilt during the restoration of 1853 but holds a 14th-century piscina. The nave roof is 15th-century and has been repainted so that the carved bosses and angel brackets stand out. The rib and panel barrel vault roof in the chancel dates to 1874 and replaces one of 1790 which proved not to be effective. The 18th century poet and satirist Charles Churchill was at one time curate at South Cadbury. ==References *Church of St Thomas √† Becket, South Cadbury - A Church Near You - Church of England website Category:13th-century church buildings in England Category:13th- century churches in the United Kingdom Category:15th-century church buildings in England Category:Church of England church buildings in South Somerset South Cadbury, Saint Thomas √† Becket Church South Cadbury, Saint Thomas a Becket Church Category:Churches in Somerset Category:South Somerset ","title":"Church of St Thomas √† Becket, South Cadbury"},{"id":"56864571","text":"Yamiche L√©one Alcindor ( ; born November 1, 1986) is an American journalist who is the White House correspondent for the PBS NewsHour and a political contributor to NBC News and MSNBC.

She has been described as \\"China's most mysterious first lady\\", as she rarely appeared with her husband in public. ==Biography== Han was born in 1930 to a peasant household in a small village in Wutai County. Her father participated in training drills organised by the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino- Japanese War and reportedly returned home to teach his daughter revolutionary songs. Han would then teach these songs to the members of the Children's Corps (). An uncle later described her as a smart and alert young girl, who was more use than the older male youths, and led the Children's Corps in guard duty. Han later recalled that the years 1941‚Äì1943 as the most desperate living under the Japanese army's white terror. In 1945, Han's mother joined the Communist Party and worked for the National Salvation Women's Corps (), using the family's crops to feed members of the Eighth Route Army, and Han entered the workforce in 1945. In 1948, Han was a cadre in a provincial organisation. She married Hua Guofeng in November that year. In August 1949, she went with Hua when he became party secretary of Xiangyin County. Their eldest child, Su Hua, was born in early 1950. The family moved to Beijing in 1951, after Hua was transferred to the State Council. ==As first lady== Han never accompanied Chairman Hua on business trips abroad and the two rarely appeared in public together. Reportedly, Han continued to cycle to and from work. She served as director of the cadre department of the import-export company of the Ministry of Light Industry () from 1975. In 1978, she participated in the 4th executive committee of the All-China Women's Federation. Since Hua's death, Han has made public appearances at his memorial services, and the 2013 and 2014 Spring Festival celebrations, where she was publicly greeted by Xi Jinping and Zhang Dejiang, respectively. == References == Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Shanxi Category:Politicians from Xinzhou Category:Women in war in China Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shanxi Category:Women in warfare post-1945 ","title":"Han Zhijun"},{"id":"56864579","text":"Katherine (Katie) Hinde is an Associate Professor of Evolutionary Biology and Senior Sustainability Scientist at Arizona State University, where she researches lactation. She is also a science writer and science communicator. == Education == Hinde attended Seattle Central College and was part of the Running Start and College Transfer programs. She earned a bachelor's of arts in anthropology from the University of Washington in 1999. She joined University of California, Los Angeles for her doctoral studies, where she was awarded the Chancellor‚Äôs Dissertation Fellowship in 2007. She completed her PhD at UCLA in 2008. == Career == Hinde served as a postdoctoral scholar in Neuroscience in the Brain, Mind, and Behavior Unit of California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis until 2009. She joined Harvard University as an Assistant Professor in 2011, where she remained until 2015. Hinde is now the Director of the Comparative Lactation Lab at Arizona State University. Here she investigates the hormones, food and medicine contained within mother's milk. She argues that we know twice as much about erectile dysfunction than we do about breast milk. Hinde identified that the combination of fat, protein, mineral, sugar, bacteria and hormones contained within mother's milk are equivalent to fingerprints and influence infant outcomes from postnatal life to adulthood. Human breast milk contains oligosaccharides, of which there are more than 200 varieties. These cannot be digested by babies, but instead provide the right community of microbes to prevent pathogens from establishing. Hinde identified that the milk of young monkey mothers contained fewer calories but more of the stress hormone cortisol than that of their older counterparts. She found that more cortisol contributes to infants that are more active and playful, as well as infants who are better at coping in stressful situations. She is recognised as a young researcher who has made outstanding, original scientific contributions to the study of human milk. Hinde is a member of the Executive Council of the International Society for Research in Human Milk and Lactation. Her research has been featured in National Geographic, Slate (magazine), Science News, The Washington Times and The New York Times. She speaks regularly at international conferences. == Public engagement == In 2011 Hinde began the popular science blog \\"Mammals Suck ... Milk!\\", which has since had over one million views. She is associate editor of Splash! Milk Science Update. She created Mammal March Madness in 2013, a month of science outreach events used in classrooms across America. In 2014 she wrote Building Babies. She appeared on the Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny YouTube channel, discussing Childrearing in Human Evolution. She was a guest on the comedy show \\"You're the Expert\\" with Wyatt Cenac. In 2016 Hinde was named the Milk Maven in GRIST 50, an annual list of innovators who are working toward a more sustainable future. She part of the SAFE13 study, which looks to expose how widespread sexual harassment and assault are in scientific fieldwork. In 2017 Hinde delivered a TED talk What we don't know about mother's milk. == Awards == 2016 ‚Äì Ehrlich-Koldovsky Early Career Award, International Society for Research in Human Milk & Lactation 2016 ‚Äì Sustainability Innovators, Organizers, & Visionaries #Grist50 Grist Magazine 2014 ‚Äì Early Career Achievement Award, American Society of Primatologists 2014 ‚Äì Distinguished Alumni Award, Seattle Central College 2013 ‚Äì Most Valuable Presentation Award 10th Annual Milk Genomics and Human Health Meeting == References == Category:Evolutionary biologists Category:American women anthropologists Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Women science writers Category:American science writers Category:Science communicators Category:21st-century anthropologists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st- century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American scientists Category:21st-century biologists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:American women biologists Category:American women non- fiction writers ","title":"Katie Hinde"},{"id":"56864580","text":"Juana Mord√≥ (April 26, 1899 ‚Äì March 12, 1984) was born in Thessaloniki, Greece and was an art dealer and gallery director in Madrid, Spain. == Early years == Juana Naar Scialom was born in Salonica, Greece on April 26, 1899. Daughter of Elise Scialom and Le√≥n Naar, of Sephardic descent. She moved to Paris with her family. Mord√≥'s first marriage was to Albert Yacoel who worked in the textile trade in Paris. The marriage ended, and at the end of the 1920s she married Enrique Mord√≥. She moved to Berlin, with her second husband who ran an import and export business of oriental rugs. She lived in Berlin during the rise of Nazi power. Mord√≥, a Spanish passport holder, decided to leave for Switzerland with her husband shortly before the start of World War II. == Arrival in Madrid == In 1942, Enrique Mord√≥ dies of heart failure in Switzerland. By 1943, Mord√≥ decides to move to Madrid with her mother. Shortly after their arrival her mother, Elise Scialom passes away and Mord√≥ decides to continue living in Madrid. A friend from Berlin who worked in intellectual media, puts Mord√≥ in touch with contacts. She obtains work on the French RNE broadcast, reading her articles and signs them with the pseudonym Carmen Soler. The first of these collaborations was an interview with Spanish novelist, essayist and literary critic, Azor√≠n. Other interviews and works on various topics would follow including travel, visits to Spanish cities, literary, social, and festive themes, all announced with her signature greeting, \\"Mes chers auditeurs\\". == The \\"salons\\" of Juana == Throughout the years, the image of Mord√≥ has achieved great prestige in the cultural world of Madrid. In a desire to animate the intellectual environment of Madrid, Mord√≥ summoned writers and artists on Saturdays to her home on Rodriguez de San Pedro Street. These meetings became known as the \\"salons\\" of Juana. Mord√≥'s friends, Jos√© Luis L√≥pez Aranguren, Dionisio Ridruejo, Pedro La√≠n Entralgo, Luis Felipe Vivanco, Antonio Tovar, Rodrigo Ur√≠a Gonz√°lez, Luis Rosales, Jos√© Luis Sampedro, Pedro Mourlane Michelena, Antonio de Zubiaurre, Gerardo Diego, Antonio Saura, Carlos Saura were among the attendees. == Introduction into the art world == In the Autumn of 1953, the first International Outdoor Sculpture Exhibition was inaugurated in the Retiro Park, which promoted the General Direction of Fine Arts and the Society of Friends of the Landscape and the Gardens. Mord√≥ joined the organizing committee as the Secretary that was chaired by Antonio Gallego Bur√≠n, the general director of Fine Arts, with vice-president Joan Ainaud de Lasarte, the director of the Museums of Barcelona, Jos√© Luis Fern√°ndez del Amo, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art. In addition to Secretary of the organizing committee of the exhibition, Mord√≥, was the time coordinator. In this role, Mord√≥ managed numerous details to facilitate the realization of the project which culminated in the assembly of the works. Through this project she built a wealth knowledge and experience about mounting an exhibition. == Director of the Biosca Gallery == In 1958, the gallery owner Aurelio Biosca was looking for someone to run his gallery and met Mord√≥. The gallery showcased artists of El Paso and the generation of the great Spanish informalism in which Mord√≥ curated some very influential exhibitions. == Juana Mord√≥ Gallery == Encouragement from Mord√≥'s artist friends and colleagues gave her the confidence to open her own gallery. Mord√≥ formed the gallery with Ernesto Wuthenow, Mar√≠a Luisa Maristany and Jos√© Ayll√≥n. The Juana Mord√≥ gallery was located on Villanueva Street No. 7, and opened on March 14, 1964. It was inaugurated with a group exhibition of artists: Vicente Ameztoy, Amalia Avia, Jaime Burguillos,BURGUILLOS, Jamie, Sevilla (1930‚Äì2003) Jos√© Caballero, Rafael Canogar, Eduardo Chillida, Enrique Gran,GRAN, Enrique, Santander, 1928-Madrid, 8.I.1999.

In December 1975, with Manuel Mendoza, Mord√≥ opened a new gallery on Calle Castell√≥, number 7. In the late 1960s Mord√≥ started a long- term collaboration and friendship with the gallery owner Margarete Lauter in Mannheim. Thanks to this cooperation, Lauter was able to give Spanish contemporary art a platform in Germany.Exhibitions with the artists Manolo Millares, Antonio Saura, Manuel Hernandez Momp√≥, Anton√≠ T√†pies, Manuel Rivera, Eusebio Sempere, Rafael Canogar and others took place. For more info: https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Galerie+Lauter&qt;=results_page == Death and legacy == On June 27, 1983, King Juan Carlos presented Mord√≥ with the Gold Medal of the Fine Arts at the Prado Museum. A few months later she died in Madrid on March 12, 1984. Mord√≥ was an influential gallery owner and defender of avant-garde art, promoting painters and sculptors of the time. From Mord√≥'s collection, multiple works have come to public institutions. Mord√≥'s legacy is part of the artistic heritage of the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes of Madrid and it is composed mostly of works of unquestionable artistic value and many of the pieces are accompanied by affectionate dedications because they were gifts that artists created for a special event, such as the founding artist of Grupo El Paso, Manuel Rivera. Her archive was given to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid. Additional acquisitions (legacy Mord√≥-Alvear) arrived at the San Fernando Academy including 57 pieces by authors such as Rafael Canogar, Gustavo Torner, Bonifacio Alfonso and an engraved plate by Dal√≠. == Bibliography == * GALLEGO, Joaqu√≠n, Juana Mord√≥ * VV.

It allowed non-criminal inebriates to be admitted to reformatories for up to three years if they had been convicted of drunkenness four times in one year. Criminal inebriates were also included if they had been convicted of an imprisonable crime. State inebriate reformatories could be established by the Secretary of State paid for by the Government. Certified inebriate reformatories satisfying the certification process of the Secretary of State could be created on the application of the council of any county or borough or of any persons desirous of establishing an inebriate reformatory. The Habitual Drunkards Act 1879 had allowed authorities to establish retreats for inebriates but payment by the inmate was required, thus excluding those working-class drunkards most at risk and with the least financial support.G.B. Wilson Alcohol and the Nation (London: Nicholson & Watson, 1940) A year after the Inebriate Act's passage, the Journal of Mental Science viewed the results as disappointing in part due to lack of funding, with no reformatories at all in Scotland or Ireland and with those in England insufficient to meet demand. The immediate need for a reformatory for men was noted. As of December 1900, no state reformatories were built and councils did not fund any. Some councils made use of privately owned homes, such as Brentry, near Bristol, Duxhurst, near Reigate, and St Joseph's Reformatory at Ashford, Kent. A review of the Act reported \\"During the first year‚Äôs working of the new Act, only eighty-two patients were received, five under Section 1, upon conviction for an offence punishable by imprisonment or penal servitude; and seventy-two under Section 2, on a new conviction, after three previous convictions within a year, of an habitual drunkard. Of these, London has supplied sixty-one cases.\\" By 1904, women accounted for 91% of those in inebriate retreats while accounting for 20% of convictions for drunkenness. Out of the 3636 compulsory admissions between 1899 and 1910, 84% were women. By 1906, nine of the eleven reformatories in England were exclusively for women, with the other two having space for both genders. The act was superseded by the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, reclassifying many inebriates as mental defectives. The last inebriate reformatories closed by the 1920s, though many were reclassified and operated as mental institutions. ==References== Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1898 Category:Mental health law in the United Kingdom Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:Alcohol law in the United Kingdom ","title":"Inebriates Act 1898"},{"id":"56864588","text":"Trees bent by the b√∂hm The Bohemian wind or b√∂hm ( or B√∂hmischer Wind) is a katabatic downslope wind, which occurs in East Bavaria, eastern Upper Franconia, the Vogtland, the Ore Mountains, Upper Lusatia, the Sudetes and the Austrian Granite and Gneiss Highland.

Companies are quoted as saying that they use Korean idols to change their brands' image to a young, fresh one and promote their goods to a younger, wider, and global audience. This page focuses specifically on Korean idols in domestic and foreign advertisements. The items or goods that Korean idols advertise are not limited and can include shopping malls, school uniforms, health insurance, cars, and water filtration devices. They can also appear in commercials that promote common goods such as driving safety, environmental health, and safe cell phone use. ==Songs and music videos as forms of advertisements== BigBang's Advertisement for LG Smart Phone An AOA Member Promoting for Project Anne, a Clothing Brand Including the cost of travel, costumes, staffs, special effects, and many other factors, most K-pop music videos have high costs; T-ara's song \\"Lovey-Dovey\\" and B.A.P's \\"One Shot\\" are said to have cost about 1 million dollars each.Like Money ‚Äì k-Pop Music Video Production Costs Explained website KPOPALYPSE, 19 Nov. 2015. To support these costly videos, product placements frequently appear in idol groups' music videos. Most common product placement in idols' music videos tends to food, clothing, cell phones, headphones, beauty care, and drinks. Idols emphasize their product placements by using them, playing with the, or holding the items close to their faces. Examples include \\"Level headphones\\" in Exo's \\"Call me Baby\\", \\"Baskin Robins ice cream\\" in Red Velvet's \\"Ice Cream Cake\\", \\"Mr Pizza's pizza\\" in SNSD's \\"Lion Heart\\", and countless more.MV That Feature Product Playment website YouTube, YouTube, 29 July 2017K-POP MV'S THAT ARE ACTUALLY ADVERTISEMENTS! website YouTube, YouTube, 1 Aug. 2016 SNSD Cooky Phone Advertisement Addictive melodies and tunes are common marketing techniques used in commercials. In some commercials, idols sing a short song dedicated to the product they are selling, such as SHINee's short commercial song that emphasized characteristics of a Korean snack called \\"bbushuh bbushuh\\". Sometimes, idols alter their songs or trending songs to advertise a good. More uncommon but not rare, there are some instances when idol groups develop whole, new songs or music videos solely to advertise goods. For example, a girl group, Apink, and a boy group, B.A.P., collaborated to create a song and a music video called \\"Skoolooks\\" that advertised Skoolooks' new uniform for girls and boys. Another example is SNSD's song and music video, \\"Cooky\\".\\"Cooky\\" was also the name of an LG smartphone, and in the music video, the members can be seen dancing and playing with the \\"Cooky\\" smartphones as they sing \\"Cooky, cooky\\". These commercial music videos have the same characteristics of standard K-pop music video with its addictive hook and 3‚Äì4 minutes time length. In other cases, idols use concepts or themes, which they had incorporated into their music videos, in commercials. For example, the idol group, Exo, used a superpower concept, where each member had a special superpower, in their music video \\"MAMA\\". And in a KFC commercial, each of the group members used a superpower concept, which they had in their music video, to promote the flavors and characteristics of KFC's new menu, hot chicken mala.16 Times K-Pop Idols Turned CFs Into More Than Just Ads website Soompi, Soompi, 24 Oct. 2016. ==Idols in advertisements targeting international audiences== Korean idols not only advertise domestic products, they often advertise global or international products. For example, in SNSD's music video, \\"Party\\", members can be seen playing with a toy figure of an airplane with a \\"Thai Air\\" logo. In other commercials, groups got7 appear in TV commercials in Thailand or groups like Twice appear in Japanese TV commercials for mobile. Continuing on, in various countries, there are Pop-up stores that sell fan-goods, such as Twice-themed cafe in Japan and BTS (band)-themed cafe in Pakistan. These international pop-up stores are examples of idols being used as marketing tools to sell goods overseas.OFFICIAL, P.B.A. BTS Themed Restaurant in Lahore, Pakistan > BTS 4th Anniversary Project website  ARMY's Amino.‚Äù ARMY's  Aminoapps.com, AminoApps, 5 June 2017 In addition, online shopping websites such as Amazon and other websites help distribute goods, advertised by Korean idols, to international fans. Korean online shopping websites help this distribution by including multiple language functions (such as English, Chinese, and Japanese) and allowing foreign-language speakers to navigate their websites easily. These websites often specifically target international fans by providing coupons or incentives for international shoppers from specific countries (Examples of this include providing free shipping from certain countries).International Shipping Fee Discount Up to 50% Off website Gmarket-Korean No.1 Shopping Site, Hottest, Trendy, Lowest Price, Worldwide Shipping Available. ==Advertisements promoting Korean idols== In Korea, posters promoting debuting idols or popular idols can be found on buses and posters in movie theaters. On several occasions, idol groups' fans often use their own money to promote their favorite group or group members. For example, on an idol group's anniversary or a member's birthday, posters advertising them or a single idol can be seen in many Korean subways. In Times Square at New York, idols had appeared in Times Square advertisements as international fans attempted to celebrate a group's anniversary or a member's upcoming birthday.

At the same time it connects the Upper Palatinate with Bohemia. The German part has an area of 281 km¬≤, a length of 40 kilometres and a width of five to ten kilometres. The Czech part covers 206 km¬≤. The valley runs in a west-southwest-east northeast direction. It is divided into the Cham basin in the west at a height of 360 to 400 metres, which extends from Roding roughly as far as Arnschwang, and the smaller Furth depression in the east, which extends to Bohemia at heights of 400 to 500 metres. The Furth valley is bounded in the east by the European watershed. Its highest point is Kame≈à√°k (Steinwald, 751 m) near Svat√° Kate≈ôina (St. Katharina). The geologically ancient depression is filled with Pleistocene and alluvial sediments and drained by the rivers Chamb and Regen and their tributaries. These rivers meander through the undulating, hilly region. In the Cham Basin, gneisses and granites predominate. In the Furth valley melanocratic rock of the gabbro-amphibolite mass is dominant. The climate is warmer and drier than the surrounding mountains, but winters are relatively cold and often characterized by b√∂hm winds from the east. The hilltops of the typically rural landscape are covered with islands of spruce and pine. While the Cham Basin has been inhabited almost continuously since the Stone Age, the Furth valley was not fully developed until the High Middle Ages. Farming dominates, followed by grassland use. The Cham-Furth Depression has always been an important communication route between Bavaria and Bohemia. Cham Castle, built around 976, guarded the eastern border of the Empire. The Bavarian-Bohemian border of the vast area has remained highly disputed throughout the early modern period, which led to different negotiations and agreements between the kings of Bohemia and the dukes of Bavaria in 1564, 1580, and finally in 1764. Today the area is part of the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park. == External links == * Cham-Furth Depression at bfn.de == Literature == * Volker Voggenreiter (1971). ‚Ä≥Geobotanische Untersuchungen in der Cham-Further Senke und ihren montanen Randh√∂hen‚Ä≥.

Jagapathi Babu was also signed to play the main antogonist and Shakthi Kanth Karthick joined as a music composer. === Filming === Principal photography began on 5 January 2018 in Hyderabad. Films's shoot was wrapped up n early May 2018. ==Soundtrack== The music is composed by Shakthi Kanth Karthick, and was released by Lahari Music Company, who held the audio launch on 10 May 2018 with Pawan Kalyan. ==Reception== In its review of the film, The Times of India gave a rating of 1.5/5 and wrote ‚ÄúMindless action scenes, love at first sight (quite literally), a dozen comedians who fail to evoke laughter, an evil politician and an aloof, goofy young man who suddenly turns into a saviour. Sounds familiar? Ravi Teja‚Äôs latest venture Nela Ticket is as predictable as they come. Loud and boorish, this Kalyan Krishna directorial lacks imagination and creativity.‚Äù The Hindustan Times gave a rating of 1.5/5 and wrote ‚ÄúNela Ticket scores low on sensitivity though with its rape jokes and the lead‚Äôs stalker- like behavior. Was it necessary to have a character threaten rape to get his way? Isn‚Äôt it time for Tollywood to lose this trope to get audiences to laugh, because it is tone-deaf and insensitive. And really, what is funny about it?‚Äù. 123telugu gave a rating of 2.25/5 and wrote \\"The film completely falters at the script level itself. Though the key points are joined well at the end, the way they are brought into the plot look logicless. Too many loopholes are clearly visible in the proceedings right throughout the film. Yet another drawback of the film is that it is painfully long. There was no need to stretch the plot to such extent in both the halves. After a point in time in the first half, you get so irritated to see the first half never coming to an end. The selection of heroine is pathetic as there is absolutely no chemistry between the lead pair and they don‚Äôt look good as a pair\\". SMTV 24X7 gave a positive review, praising the story, direction and performances. They commented: \\" ... The director has made the film an entertaining watch by including the regular masala elements of Ravi Teja's movies. Its comedy and an emotional quotient will strike a chord with the audience. ... As usual, Ravi Teja has delivered a brilliant performance.\\" == References  External links == * Category:2010s Telugu-language films Category:2018 action drama films Category:Indian action drama films Category:Films shot in Hyderabad, India Category:Indian films Category:Films shot in Andhra Pradesh Category:Films shot in Visakhapatnam Category:Films shot in Vijayawada ","title":"Nela Ticket"},{"id":"56864712","text":"Hilda (also known as Hildafolk) is an award-winning British children's graphic novel series written and illustrated by Luke Pearson and published by Nobrow Press. == Content == The graphic novels are set in a fantastic world resembling a late 20th century Scandinavia and draw inspiration mainly from Scandinavian folklore and folk tales and the Moomins. The titular character is a small girl, who in the first two books lives with her mother in a cottage on a plain surrounded by mountains and forests, but later moves to the city Trolberg. Hilda's world is inhabited by regular people and fantastical creatures like trolls, giants, elves and spirits. In the fourth book, Hilda joins Trolberg's Sparrow Scouts. == Main characters == * Hilda - The main heroine, a headstrong, smart, kind and curious girl, keen on exploring the world around her with an open mind. Even though she does not avoid other kids and interacts with her classmates and fellow scouts, she mostly keeps to herself and makes friends with fantastical creatures instead. * Twig ‚Äì Hilda's faithful pet that is half deer half fox (deerfox). * Hilda's Mum ‚Äì Hilda's mother is caring and supportive, but at times she can worry too much.

The New York Times review by Pamela Paul of the volume Hilda and the Bird Parade draws comparisons between Pearson's fantastic worlds and the creations of Hayao Miyazaki, further stating: \\"In Hilda‚Äôs world, daytime is drawn in burnt orange, maroon and drab olive, and the night is an icy, eerie wash of dark teal and minty blue. Each landscape contains its own tantalizing visions.\\" Alexandra Lange's article about the whole series for The New Yorker also stresses the similarities with Miyazaki's works and talks about the complexity of Pearson's creations and their appeal to kids and adults alike: ‚ÄúPearson‚Äôs aesthetic is sophisticated for the often candy- colored world of children‚Äôs animation, and the plots fit neatly into a number of present-day parenting preoccupations.‚Äù In July 2013, Hilda and the Midnight Giant was featured in The Best 7 Books for Young Readers list released by Deutschlandfunk, the German public radio. The same year in November Hilda and the Bird Parade was included in the list of Notable Children‚Äôs Books of 2013 by The New York Times. === Awards and nominations === {  - ! Year !! Book !!

He made his first appearance in the main show during the episode broadcast on 22 September 2016. The character was introduced alongside his twin brother David Tanaka (Takaya Honda), and they arrive in Erinsborough to find their long-lost biological father. Both Kano and Honda auditioned for both Tanaka roles and were later awarded their respective parts. The show's producer Jason Herbison had planned their stories months in advance. The shows writing team meticulously researched the show's history to find a way to introduce the two characters into the show's long-standing Robinson family. Leo and David's search ended in the revelation that the show's villainous character, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) was their father. Leo is characterised as a flirtatious and charming businessman who takes entrepreneurial risks. He is portrayed as both \\"ruthless and driven\\", which Kano believed was his character's personality flaw. He thought Leo was an interesting addition to the Neighbours cast because his attitude clashes with the show's moralistic female residents. Leo's stories have focused on business decisions and romance. He arrives in Erinsborough to start a new business. Despite a history in bar management he decides to open a new hostel for backpackers. Romance stories feature a near incestuous relationship with his half-sister Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) and more prominent relationships with Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas) and Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). Other storylines include Leo getting crushed under concrete, feuds with other characters, and Kano filming overseas in London. Leo and Amy's near romance attracted some media attention, with Alex McCarthy from TV Week branding it \\"awkward\\" and a Metro reporter viewing it as \\"gross\\". In 2019, Kano's management confirmed he would be leaving the serial and he filmed his final scenes in June. Leo's departure aired on 10 September 2019, but he made a guest appearance from 11 December 2019. ==Casting== On 22 August 2016, Neighbours announced its intention to introduce two new regular characters. It was revealed Leo and David Tanaka would be twin brothers played by Tim Kano and Takaya Honda respectively. Kano was delighted to be cast in the show because he believed Leo is \\"such a great character to play\\". Leo and David arrive in Erinsborough to solve \\"a family mystery\\". The character was billed as having a \\"superficial facade\\" whilst being a good-hearted man. The casting directors prepared themselves for a long audition process. They were adamant they wanted to find actors who looked alike to accurately portray twins. Honda, who plays David recalled the process as being a strange experience which involved many call backs. Each actor originally auditioned for both roles because directors wanted to see who best suited which character. Kano has stated that his first ever audition had him switching character from Leo to David in seconds. Kano praised Neighbours for introducing two ethnic actors into their show. He believed it was \\"fantastic\\" that the Tanakas were regular characters with a \\"really strong plot line\\". ==DevelopmentCharacterisation=== Leo is characterised as a charming individual who is image conscious and boasts a \\"flashy exterior\\". He is a self-involved entrepreneur who is unafraid to take risks to fund his materialistic lifestyle. Leo can behave in an underhanded manner to achieve success. His official character biography states that \\"he is not averse to using dubious methods to improve his lifestyle and believes people have to spend money to make money.\\" In comparison to his serious minded brother, Leo does not make long-term plans. His career aspirations are driven by his entrepreneurial persona. He managed nightclubs prior to arriving in Erinsborough but decides to start his own business. There are stark differences in the twin's personalities. Leo has been touted as a \\"shameful opportunist\\" and \\"ruthless\\" in comparison to David who harbours a social conscience. Kano and Honda quickly built a good rapport off-set which helped them create brotherly bond on-screen. Both have other siblings and were able to draw from those sibling rivalries to form the on-screen relationship. Kano told Kerry Harvey from Stuff.co.nz that \\"he's really cheeky, really playful but under all the layers he's definitely a good guy with a good heart. It's nice to know all that's there and I don't just have to play this ruthless, superficial, bad boy all the time.\\" Leo is cheeky and charming but quite selfish. Kano believed that his character was flawed because he is \\"ruthless and driven\\" and lacks consideration for other character's feelings when achieving his goals. Many female characters in Neighbours are family orientated and Leo's attitude does not fit their strong morals and values. Kano believed this created a \\"great dynamic and tension\\" for his character. Leo is surprised by other people's perceptions of him and it proves \\"a good reflective process\\". Kano added \\"for Leo, to come to this down to earth town in Erinsborough where people call you out on your lies, it‚Äôs a great learning curve to learn there is more to life than what he was previously used to.\\" ===Introduction=== The Tanaka's storyline was planned six months in advance by the show's executive producer Jason Herbison. He was \\"delighted\\" with the work Kano and Honda had done, describing watching them as a \\"very thrilling\\" experience. Ahead of his first appearance in the main show, the character was featured in a series of webisodes titled Road Trip. The mini-series focuses on the twins' road trip on the way to Erinsborough, where they were joined by Leo's love interest Milly (Eliza Charley). The webisodes were designed to give viewers a chance to watch the \\"brotherly dynamic\\" the Tanaka brothers share. In addition they could witness the contrasting personalities they have. Leo made his first screen appearance in the main show during the episode broadcast on 22 September 2016. They arrive to look after their great-grandmother Kazuko Sano (Linda Chin), who has been admitted to the local hospital. Kano revealed that the twins had another motive for being in the area as they were searching for lost relative. When David and Leo spend more time in Erinsborough they befriend Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond), Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson), setting the characters up to become intertwined in one another's storylines. Leo's main story following his arrival focuses on his and David's search for their biological father. Kano stated that they wanted to solve the mystery of their \\"interesting and messed-up past\\". The show's writers played a series of plot twists throughout this story. Initially, David's findings lead him to a Bradley Satchwell (Alfred Nicdao), a local homeless man. He was at the hospital when their mother gave birth and was banned from visiting her. The character is reluctant to reveal details and runs away. But various scenes were included in episodes to suggest Bradley is their father. Months later Leo finds Bradley and bribes him with money to spend time with David. Bradley goes for a medical check up and is again reluctant to talk about his past. Writers introduced a \\"new twist\\" into their mystery story by ruling out Bradley as the twins father. David runs a blood test which reveals Bradley cannot be related to them. Writers developed the paternity mystery further with the introduction of hotel investor Jasmine Udagawa (Kaori Maeda-Judge). She quickly develops a vendetta against Leo and keeps a secret file titled \\"Tanaka\\". Amy overhears Jasmine telling Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) that Leo could potentially inherit Lassiters and she informs him about the news. This leads Leo to believe he is related to the Udagawa family, who are also Japanese. Jasmine offers the Tanakas ten thousand dollars to leave Erinsborough. He refuses and it leads Leo to suspect that Jasmine's uncle Hiro Udagawa is their father. Amy is featured more frequently in the story and joins Leo in his search to track down Hiro to his last known address. But their search is shortened when they discover Hiro died the previous year. The show wanted to mislead viewers by publicising a red herring suggesting that historic character Scott Robinson was Leo's father. Jenny Young reprised her role as Kim Taylor after producers rehired her following thirty-two years off-screen. She is revealed to be David and Leo's mother. The link was made because Kim and Scott had previously been romantically involved. On-screen Kim denies that Scott is the twins father this but is shocked to learn Leo has taken Amy away for a romantic weekend. She rushes to prevent the pair from sleeping together. This makes David think his theory is correct because Kim would not want Amy, who is Scott's relative, to sleep with Leo. This episode brought about the culmination of the mystery storyline as the Tanaka's biological father was revealed. In one final \\"twist\\" in the storyline, Scott's brother Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) was revealed to be their father. The actors knew about the outcome of the story when it began but were forced to be secretive. Kano told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that Kim was not certain Paul was their father but knew he could be. He added that could not wait for the audiences reaction to the shock revelation. ===The Robinson family=== Integrating Leo and David into the Robinson family had to be planned out meticulously. The script department did not want the story to appear randomly put together. They had to delve into the show's history and create a link to early characters while staying true to the story. Kano and Honda also had to research the Robinson's family history. Honda told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that the Tanaka \\"family hierarchy is so strange\\" and Paul's is \\"insane\\" because of numerous siblings and children. He said it held such a \\"great history\\" and felt honoured that the Tanakas would become part of one of the shows long-standing families. Prior to the reveal that Paul Robinson is Leo's father, he had been dating Paul's daughter Amy Williams. This meant that Amy was Leo and David's half-sister. The revelation leaves the pair devastated that they nearly consummated their relationship. Kano told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that his character had \\"finally let down his guard\\" around Amy. He thought he had found \\"an amazing soulmate\\" and it was a \\"huge step\\" for someone like Leo to be ready to commit to someone. He concluded that the drama leaves Leo stunned. Leo and Amy decide they cannot be together and try to avoid one another. But Amy becomes jealous when Leo dates someone else and is a suspect in the investigation into the backpackers car crash. Her jealousy causes other characters to assume she is guilty. Cramond told a reporter from Tenplay that Leo and Amy's story post-discovery would be a hard journey. She believed they would never really get over what had happened between them. She noted that in time Leo and Amy learn to get along, but \\"many ups and downs\\" mar their sibling relationship. One such instance is when Leo takes too much of an interest in Amy's romance with Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou). He and Paul try to keep the pair apart. Other characters accuse Leo of behaving like a jealous boyfriend rather than a brother. Leo's relationship with Paul was originally hostile. Paul had tried to damage Leo's backpacker business which caused the initial rift. David embraces his newfound father and despite Paul's best efforts, Leo snubs him on multiple occasions. He makes it clear that he resents Paul for missing thirty years of his life. Honda told Deepika Rajani from OK! that Leo and Paul would struggle to form a bond. He explained that \\"he's so independent and headstrong and that will lead to some interesting storylines for them.\\" He added that Paul gaining Leo's trust would be an interesting \\"long road\\" for the characters. Viewers had often drawn comparisons between Leo and Paul because they have similar personalities. Kano was happy that viewers had likened the two. He told a reporter from TV Soap that \\"I think he's definitely one to match Paul and it's nice to have someone come in and test Paul as well who's a bit younger and I think they can learn a lot from each other too. It's going to be an interesting dynamic to see how that pans out between the two of them to see whether they'll ever come to an agreement or team up.\\" Writers later started to build their father and son relationship up. In one story, Leo becomes concerned about Paul's romantic life when he announces his engagement to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). Leo views their relationship as unconventional and is suspicious about Courtney's true intentions. Leo decides to befriend Courtney but is wary when she appears to flirt with him. This behaviour is enough for Leo to believe he must put an end to the engagement for Paul's sake. A writer from TV Soap noted that this plot marked the point Leo and Paul's bond became amicable. ===Relationship with Mishti Sharma=== Writers decided to pair Leo with Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas) and their relationship takes a while to form. Initially, the pair befriend each other but Mishti's reluctance to discuss her past causes problems. Vas told Alison James from Soaplife that \\"Mishti starts dropping her guard and she begins to confide in him.\\" Writers also began including Leo's more caring side of his persona when he featured in scenes with Mishti. The pair would contemplate a relationship on numerous occasions, but change their minds and remain friends. Producers finally decided to unite the pair in September 2017. When Amy wants Leo to sell his share of the Robinsons hotel she concocts a plan to get him and Mishti together. She assumes that Mishti will be able to convince Leo to sell. Mishti is unaware of Amy's scheme and Leo is furious when he finds out. But Mishti later convinces him of her innocence and they decide to begin a relationship. Problems soon followed focusing on the issue of trust. Mishti becomes secretive over her rogue investigation into the death of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). She lies about her whereabouts and Leo discovers the truth. This caused Leo to believe he can no longer trust Mishti and they nearly break-up. Other obstacles included Elly drunkenly kissing Leo leading Mishti to believe they were seeing each other. Leo spends more time with Mishti's family and argues with her sister Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal). She believes that Leo has ill-advised her husband Shane Rebecchi (Nicholas Coghlan) in order to benefit from his urine powered generator. This is not true and Mishti is left with the task of solving the rift. They continue to bicker and fall into a swimming pool. Johal revealed that she and Kano get along well off-screen so they really enjoyed filming the brief feud and pool scenes. In March 2018, Neighbours confirmed a new pregnancy story featuring Mishti and Leo. Leo is hurt at the Robinson Heights development site. A slab of broken concrete falls on top of him and leaves him trapped. Mishti is called out to the incident and is shocked to find Leo. Vas told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Mishti is worried and can only reassure her boyfriend. But he is taken to hospital and recovers. The events lead Mishti to reveal her pregnancy. Vas explained that Mishti and Leo's relationship is still new, so she is unsure of how he will react. They had not thought about having children so are unsure about keeping it. But their families discover their news and are excited. The actress added \\"she and Leo aren't even sure they want to have the baby yet - but they're forced to go along with the family's celebrations.\\" Their next problem is telling Paul because Mishti is nervous about his approval. To her surprise he is supportive. Vas told Sally Brockway from Soaplife that Mishti thinks everything will be okay once Paul accepts the news. But she warned of many \\"twists and turns\\" for her relationship with Leo. It was later announced that Neighbours had planned a miscarriage story for the pair. Writers planned a break-up story for Leo and Mishti which begins when Leo invites her friend Monique Hughes (Madeleine Vizard) to stay. She worked with Mishti and Zander at the police academy and expresses an interest into Leo's business. She discovers that Lassiter's have sold alcohol to Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) who is under the legal age to drink. Monique blackmails Leo and requests money in order for her not to report his family business. Kano told Stephen Downe (TV Week) that \\"It's pretty shocking, he doesn't know how to take her.\\" Leo realises that Monique has the upper-hand and he is left ponder whether or not to meet her demands. Kano told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that he was upset that Leo and Mishti had broken up because they had just begun to find trust in their relationship. He added that Mishti showed the audience a different side to his character and hoped they would reconcile in the future. ===Chloe Brennan=== April Rose Pengilly plays Chloe Brennan.Leo with embarks on a casual relationship with his personal assistant Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly). The story begins when his boss Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) wants to fire Chloe. He tries to tell her but she comes up with a new business idea which has potential. When Mishti breaks-up with Leo he wants fun and thinks Chloe will be a good distraction. A Neighbours publicist told Claire Crick from Soaplife that Leo realises that Chloe is not just the \\"bolshy\\" character she presents herself as and tries to seduce her. They added that Chloe initially refuses because she wants to behave professionally. Following a kiss, Chloe decides to seduce Leo and they have sex at work. David and Chloe are caught being intimate by her mother Fay Brennan (Zoe Bertram), who is not impressed by her conduct at work. Kano believed his character's casual arrangement with Chloe provided a \\"great distraction and rebound\\". He described it as a \\"really nice, light and fun storyline\\" following a turbulent time in Leo's life. Chloe is the type of woman Leo used to date during his time working the Sydney club scene. But Kano believed that Leo just wants fun, despite a potential relationship and added that it was another reminder of how alike Paul he is. Their affair does have consequences for them professionally because Lassiters policy tries to dissuade colleagues from pursuing each other romantically. Kano added \\"that's what makes it so exciting. The possibility of getting caught creates a thrill.\\" ===Relationship with Terese Willis=== Writers developed Leo's next romance with his boss Terese Willis. She is also Leo's father's ex-girlfriend and Paul still loves her. Elmaloglou was shocked when producers told her about the relationship because she could not imagine them together. But she said that the story received positive feedback from the viewers. Kano told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that Leo is \\"majorly guilty\\" for developing feelings for Terese and betraying Paul. Initially Terese does not reciprocate his feelings but Paul places Leo under Terese's mentorship and they spend more time together. Kano explained that Terese is \\"smart, strong and beautiful\\" and \\"business minded\\" which are the qualities Leo likes in women. Leo spends time with Terese in the city and she realises she likes him. Kano add \\"there's a really nice, intimate moment\\" and they get to know each other better. This gives Leo hope and he is allured to her caring nature. Kano was excited about the story because he believed it is controversial. He thought it made sense that the writers had both father and son falling in love with the same woman. Kano added that Leo would get with Terese regardless of Paul and then \\"just pray his dad would forgive him.\\" The pair conduct their relationship in secret to avoid hurting Paul. Kano said that Neighbours required himself and Elmaloglou to film \\"the raunchiest scenes we‚Äôve done on the show yet\\". Elmaloglou told Ellis that Leo and Terese genuinely love each other. Terese is initially flattered because a younger man likes her but she realises he is a good person. Writers continued to include Paul in the story, which causes problems for them. The actress stated that Terese would always be in love with Paul and Kano felt that left Leo always feeling feeling insecure. The actor explained that there was an inevitable showdown between Leo and Paul, while Elmaloglou warned that \\"all hell will break loose\\" when Paul discovers the truth. Leo's criminal past with the Renshaw family is explored in late 2018. Producers introduced Delaney Renshaw (Ella Newton) and she blackmails him. Kano explained that Delaney had been in love with Leo since he worked for her family. She knows he is the police informant that helped land her father in prison and blackmails him \\"hoping that he'll fall in love with her.\\" Leo had been estranged from Paul since he discovered his deceit with Terese. Kano stated that Delaney's presence helps bring him close to his father again. Delaney makes threats about Terese which makes Leo realise he needs to protect her. The actor added that \\"if Terese knew what was going on, it would put her in danger, Leo has to try to find a way to keep his partner safe.\\" Leo dumps Terese and creates fakes a relationship with Delaney to keep her happy. This leaves Terese hurt and questioning whether she should be with Paul. Delaney's uncle Ivan Renshaw (Michael Shanahan) locates Leo and pulls a gun on him. Terese lunges in front of Leo to protect him and takes the bullet. She is rushed to hospital and holds other characters hostage in Harold's cafe by Raymond Renshaw (Frank Magree). Terese survives and reunites with Leo, but she cannot stop thinking about Paul. Terese decides to continue with Leo until he proposes marriage in public and embarrasses her. Kano explained that Terese's shooting and a family friend's cancer diagnosis makes him feel that life is short and prompts him to propose. Terese then decides to end their relationship and confesses her love for Paul. Leo walks in on them kissing and feels betrayed. The actor branded it the \\"ultimate humiliation\\" and believed that being betrayed by your girlfriend and father is the worst form. He added that it was a sad end to the relationship and that Leo never imagined Terese reuniting with Paul. ===Departure=== In 2019, Kano's management confirmed that he would be departing Neighbours that year to pursue new roles in Hollywood. On 10 July, Kano told a reporter for the Herald Sun, \\"I'm really excited for a change. It's been two weeks since I finished and I've had a few meetings with people from LA. Neighbours is such a good launching pad and you have to be really adaptable. I'm looking forward to new roles.\\" The reporter added that following his exit, Kano would return to the serial for a stint later in the year. Kano's exit scenes aired on 10 September 2019. Leo leaves Erinsborough without telling anyone, after his part in the reappearances of Paul's former wives is revealed. Leo teamed up with his half-sister Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) to test Paul and Terese's relationship ahead of their wedding. The character returns for a short guest stint on 11 December 2019, after learning that his brother, David, has been seriously injured and needs a kidney transplant. However, Leo is soon informed that he is not a match. He also attempts to put Amy off from contacting her son, Jimmy Williams (Darcy Tadich), due to pressure from his father. ==Storylines== Leo blocks Amy's truck in and tells her he will not be long when she complains. While he is sat in The Waterhole, Leo watches on as Aaron plays Terese and Paul against each other. Leo is surprised when David is caught looking at hospital records in a bid to find their father. Terese hires Leo to act as a consultant for Lassiter's, in the hope that he will improve takings at The Waterhole. Leo also secures an apartment for himself and David. Aaron invites Leo to the Back Lane Bar, along with David, Amy and Elly, who Leo knows from his job in venue management. Aaron leaves early after realising Leo is straight. Leo flirts with Amy. When she goes on a date with David, Leo tells her she is with the wrong brother. Paul attempts to blackmail Leo, after learning he managed a nightclub that was involved in money laundering, but Leo tells him it is public knowledge. Paul then offers to pay Leo to ruin Terese's business. Terese catches Leo out and he saves his job by agreeing to spy for Terese. After Jasmine tries to bribe Leo into leaving he becomes convinced he is related to the Udagawas and possible heir to the Lassiter's hotel inheritance. This later turns out to be untrue as Kim denies it. Leo wins the bid for the Men's Shed tender, which he plans to turn into a backpackers' hostel, with Tim Collins (Ben Anderson) as a partner. Leo finds it difficult to work with him. Tim tries to make Leo carry out illegal activities in exchange of selling his share. Amy offers to invest in the backpackers and the two grow closer. Leo takes Amy away for the weekend where they open up about their feelings for each other. As they are about to have sex, Paul arrives and announces that he is the Tanaka twins' father. Leo and Amy admit that they are in love, but try to avoid each other in the wake of the revelation. Leo buys Amy out of her shares in the hostel. He also attempts to move on by dating Mishti. Paul tries to make amends with Leo, but he tells Paul to keep his distance. After Amy's ute is driven into the Backpackers, Leo helps to rescue an injured David. Leo begins to worry that he is bankrupt because he never got the backpackers insured. He knows he cannot afford the repairs so Paul buys Leo's backpacker hostel. Leo makes it clear to Paul that his gesture has not changed anything between them. When Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) admits that she was responsible for the crash, he orders her to sell her nursery to obtain compensation for the damage. Her friend Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) pays Leo $10,000 for him to leave Sonya alone. Leo is alarmed when his old friend Mannix Foster (Sam Webb) arrives. He puts him up at the Robinsons motel and owner Steph Scully (Carla Bonner) notices Mannix behaving strangely. She demands that Leo tell her the truth and Mannix leave the premises. He refuses and tells her that he will sort the problem out. When Mannix is stabbed following an altercation, he tells Leo not to involve the police. Mannix blackmails him using his past secrets involving a family he used to work for. Leo begs David to help treat Mannix outside hospital grounds and therefore risking his career. David is upset that Leo would make him compromise his career and refuses to speak to him for a while. Paul discovers the situation and threatens Mannix into leaving Erinsborough for good. Paul's actions lead to him and Leo bonding and Leo agrees to go into business as a shareholder of Robinsons. When Steph and Amy want to transform the motel into a wellness center for cancer patients, Leo and Paul refuse. They snub Steph's suggestions of a buy out and this forces Amy to concoct a plan. Mishti convinces Leo to reconsider his stance, but is angry when he discovers that Amy has planned it. Leo changes his mind when he realises Mishti was oblivious to Amy's scam and Steph gains control of Robinsons. Leo becomes concerned that Courtney is taking advantage of Paul when she flirts with him. He tries to seduce Courtney to prove she is untrustworthy. Mishti witnesses a kiss between the pair and breaks up with Leo for scheming. Paul is angry when he discovers the truth, but admits that his relationship with Courtney is sham and an attempt to snare his former lover Terese. Mishti forgives Leo but he becomes angry when he discovers that Mishti has been keeping secrets. The pair have a conversation and agree to be honest with each other in future. Leo offers Shane business advice for his urine- powered generator which proves unhelpful when his client drops out of their deal. Feeling he is to blame, he offers Shane a compromise, that he will install a generator at the backpackers but is not willing to pay for it. Dipi is furious and sees this as an attempt at scamming Shane for a free generator. The pair argue over the incident but she later realises he was being genuine. While at the construction site of the Robinson Heights housing development, Leo is crushed by a concrete slab. He is found by Mark and taken to hospital where he soon recovers. Mishti then tells him she is pregnant. She contemplates an abortion but loses the baby anyway. Leo decides to invite Mishti's friend Monique to stay. She blackmails Leo, requesting ten thousand dollars in exchange for her silence regarding under age drinking occurring at Lassiters. He refuses and hires a private investigator to look into Moniques past. He discovers that Monique and Zander are both corrupt officers who were linked to gang crime. When Mishti discovers the truth she ends their relationship. Leo is promoted to the temporary manager of Lassiters while Terese is forced to take an extended holiday. Chloe is hired to work as his assistant but an attraction develops between them. Terese asks Leo to fire Chloe but he asks her to reconsider when he notices how business minded she is. He begins a sexual relationship with Chloe which is later discovered by Paul and Terese. Leo is demoted for his actions but he and Chloe agree to end their affair. Terese begins to mentor Leo and forces him to do basic staff duties. Terese reveals that she wants him to know every aspect of the business. When Mishti is the victim of harassment from Dilhan Ozdil (Kyle Hazebroek), he tries to force him to break his bail conditions by trying to fight him. The plan backfires and he accidentally punches Ned Willis (Ben Hall). Mishti forgives Leo for his interference in the case. Leo unsuccessfully tries to matchmake Paul and Terese, but develops a crush on Terese himself. When Terese discovers Leo's feelings, she ends their mentorship, but the attraction between them grows and they have sex on the day of David and Aaron's wedding. They begin a secret fling, which is eventually discovered by a furious Paul; he reacts by evicting Leo from the penthouse, firing him from Lassiter's and sabotaging the Backpackers. Leo moves in with Terese and their relationship strengthens, despite continual opposition from Paul. With Amy's help, Leo schemes to bring Jane Harris (Annie Jones) back to Australia, hoping that a new relationship will distract Paul from his tirade against his family. Their plan is successful, and Jane convinces Paul to forgive Leo. Soon after, Delaney comes to Erinsborough, hoping to reconcile an old attraction with Leo from Sydney. Delaney is aware that Leo was the police informant on her criminal family, so blackmails him into ending his relationship with Terese and starting a new one with her. Delaney's uncle Ivan Renshaw (Michael Shanahan) shoots at Leo, but Terese jumps in front of him and is hit by the bullet. Piper blames Leo for getting Terese shot and refuses to let him see her at the hospital. When Delaney's father Raymond Renshaw (Frank Magree) holds a group of hostages at Harold's, Leo goes in to reason with him and Raymond is arrested. Leo then discovers that Mannix is alive and has been helping Delaney. Delaney apologises to Leo for what her family have done before she leaves town. Leo and Terese get back together and Leo proposes to Terese, but she turns him down and then breaks up with him. Leo later walks in on her kissing Paul. He throws a large Valentine's Day's display across the complex, which hits Vera Punt (Sally-Anne Upton). She decides to sue Lassiter's. Leo also gets drunk and makes a scene in the street when he begs Terese to take him back. He finds comfort in his friendship with Piper, but when he tries to kiss her, she pushes him away. Leo struggles to get over Terese and forgive Paul, but he continues to hang out with Piper. During a movie night, they end up kissing and having sex. They agree to have a casual relationship, but it is soon discovered by Piper's sister, Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan), who demands Piper tell Terese. When Leo is making an apology to Vera, he argues with Paul and Terese, and then tells them he has moved on and is with Piper. Terese accuses Leo of seducing Piper out of revenge. Leo apologises to Piper and they continue their arrangement. Leo accompanies Elly to a hospital appointment, where she learns she is not pregnant. He advises her to keep it from Mark and try and get pregnant in the meantime. Piper breaks up with Leo ahead of her departure from Erinsborough. Leo learns from Terese that Piper has reunited with Tyler after her departure and Leo starts drinking again. Leo later moves in with David and Aaron. Leo befriends Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson) and they buy the Back Lane Bar together, although he later learns that Vance Abernethy (Conrad Coleby) is his business partner, as Vance gave Roxy the money. Vance later takes off with his share of the proceeds and his cousin scams Leo out of the rest of his money, forcing him to sell the bar. Paul and Terese get engaged, leading Leo to team up with his half-sister, Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) and four of Paul's former wives to test Paul and Terese's relationship. David is disappointed when he learns of Leo's involvement. Leo decides to leave Erinsborough for New York City without saying goodbye, although he leaves David a note. He returns a couple of months later, after learning that David needs a kidney transplant. Leo is tested, but he is not a compatible match. Leo comforts Paul when he breaks down in fear for David's life. Leo later leaves with Amy and Jimmy and return to New York with them. ==Reception== Alex McCarthy from TV Week branded the relationship and sibling revelation between Leo and Amy an \\"awkward\\" storyline. Katie Baillie Metro believed a hook-up between the pair would be \\"really gross\\", adding they had been \\"dancing around the fact they are in love with each other\\". She later added that she \\"couldn't watch\\" as the pair shared a romantic meal. She concluded that the reveal was \\"one heck of a truth bomb.\\" Neela Debnath from the Daily Express branded the story a \\"controversial incest plot\\" and \\"explosive twist\\". Claire Crick from Soaplife said \\"Leo Tanaka and Mishti Sharma are certainly something of a power couple. Not only are they both massively successful in their beloved jobs, but they also make a beautiful pairing to boot.\\" Melanie Blake of The People said \\"Paul's cute son Leo clearly has an eye for his future step-mum.\\" The Liverpool Echo included Leo working for Paul in their \\"pick of the day\\" feature. Their writer added that Leo was playing with fire. Digital Spy's Comor McMullan criticised Leo's revenge plot against Paul and Terese. He bemoaned the repetitiveness of Leo and Paul constantly seeking revenge against one another. He added that while Kano played Leo's anger \\"excellently [...] these Robinson men need to find healthier ways to deal with their feelings.\\" ==References * Leo Tanaka at the Official Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2016 Category:Fictional twins Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional Japanese people ","title":"Leo Tanaka"},{"id":"56864807","text":"Events in the year 2018 in Ivory Coast. ==Incumbents== * President: Alassane Ouattara * Prime Minister: Amadou Gon Coulibaly ==Events== *24 March ‚Äì scheduled date for the Ivorian senatorial election, 2018 ==Deaths== S√©ry Bailly *12 February ‚Äì Jean-Jacques B√©chio, politician (b. 1949). *27 May ‚Äì Jean Konan Banny, politician (b. 1929). *2 December ‚Äì S√©ry Bailly, writer and politician, Minister of Communication (b. 1948).C√¥te d'Ivoire : Sery Bailly, l‚Äôex-ministre de Gbagbo est d√©c√©d√© ==References== Category:2010s in Ivory Coast Category:Years of the 21st century in Ivory Coast Ivory Coast Ivory Coast ","title":"2018 in Ivory Coast"},{"id":"56864811","text":"William \\"Bill\\" R.

Ahmad (born Rosemary Llanchie Stevenson), formerly known professionally as Llanchie Stevenson, is an American ballet dancer who was the first African-American dancer at Radio City Music Hall Ballet Company, the first African-American female dancer at the National Ballet of Washington, and an original company member and former principal dancer with Dance Theatre of Harlem. She retired from dancing upon her conversion to Islam. ==Dance training== Rosemary Llanchie Stevenson began her dance training at the Bernice Johnson Dance Studio. She enrolled at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts as a dance major with an emphasis on classical ballet but was dissuaded from continuing classical dance training due to her race, and was switched over to modern dance studies. Her father complained about the change, as Stevenson wanted to become a professional ballet dancer, and she was put back in her classical studies. ==Career== After graduating from LaGuardia when she was seventeen years old she took a class at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. She was noticed by Alvin Ailey and he invited her to join the professional company. She toured with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater as a modern dancer, but kept up her ballet and pointe training, upon Ailey's insistence. Ailey encouraged Stevenson to audition for the ballet company at Radio City Music Hall. She auditioned and was told to work on her fouett√©s and come back in two weeks. She auditioned again and was accepted, joining the Radio City Music Hall Ballet Company as its first African-American dancer. Due to her race, original roles were created for her as there weren't many roles within classical ballets that were traditionally for black dancers. Stevenson left Radio City Music Hall and auditioned to be a student at the School of American Ballet with hopes of joining the New York City Ballet. She was accepted and received a scholarship to study at the school. She was a student at the School of American Ballet for two years but was not offered a position in the company, despite many of her classmates joining. She asked George Balanchine, director of the School of American Ballet and New York City Ballet, what her prospects were for dancing professionally. Balanchine expressed that although Arthur Mitchell, an African-American male dancer, was dancing with New York City Ballet, the company was not ready to have a woman of color, stating that a black woman would \\"break the corps line.\\" Stevenson later auditioned for Frederic Franklin's National Ballet of Washington and was accepted as a member of the corps de ballet. She was the only African-American dancer in the company at the time she joined. After dancing in the corps at the National Ballet of Washington for a few years, she was contacted by Arthur Mitchell, who had retired from New York City Ballet and founded Dance Theatre of Harlem, to join his company. She joined Dance Theatre of Harlem as a founding member and was the company's first principal dancer. She danced many principal roles at Dance Theatre of Harlem, including one of the lead roles in Balanchine's Concerto Barocco. She toured with the company and even performed at Jacob's Pillow Dance. While at Dance Theatre of Harlem, Stevenson wore brown tights over her pink tights, paving the way for ballet dancers of color to start wearing brown tights and pointe shoes, breaking from the tradition of pink tights and shoes. ==Conversion and retirement== Stevenson began feeling discouraged after she stopped being cast in roles she wanted at Dance Theatre of Harlem despite being a principal dancer, believing the cause to be her weight. She began reading the book How to Eat to Live by Elijah Muhammad to help her lose weight and was inspired by the book's messages about Islam. She lost weight and began receiving desired roles again at Dance Theatre of Harlem. After reading about Allah in Muhammad's book, she decided to attend Nation of Islam meetings. She identified with many teaches and practices of the Nation of Islam and officially converted from Christianity to Islam, changing her name to Aminah. She and her husband practiced Islam through the Nation of Islam, but later left the Nation and joined mainstream Islam. Due to traditional Islamic teachings forbidding women to perform in front of men, perform in public, and dancing uncovered, Stevenson decided to retire from ballet. After retiring she taught ballet and gymnastics to Muslim girls with the focus on discipline and physical health, not with the intention of pre- professional training. ==References== Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century African- American people Category:21st-century African-American people Category:20th- century ballet dancers Category:American ballerinas Category:African-American ballet dancers Category:African-American female dancers Category:Dance Theatre of Harlem dancers Category:National Ballet of Washington, D.C. dancers Category:School of American Ballet alumni Category:Fiorello H.

It documented Swartz's Key Shop, an illegal bookmaking establishment located at 364 Massachusetts Avenue in Boston. It was narrated by Walter Cronkite and producer/reporter Jay McMullen. ==Production== Filming began as early as May 30, 1961. According to Fred W. Friendly, Swartz's Key Shop was chosen because \\"there was a prolonged attempt by law agencies to close up this one place\\". CBS's crew concealed cameras in an apartment across the street. McMullen used an 8mm camera hidden in a lunch box to get footage of bookmakers accepting bets from hundreds of people inside the shop.Vet investigative reporter Jay McMullen dies ==Overview== The film showed 10 uniformed officers of the Boston Police Department and one recently retired BPD detective entering the establishment while illegal betting took place. Cameras also captured members of the BPD walking past a burning trash can. One of the bookmakers was filmed leaving the shop around 8:30 AM to drive to his regular job at the Metropolitan District Commission headquarters. On September 29 the shop was raided by members of the United States Department of the Treasury. The shop reopened again a week later. On October 27 it was raided again, this time by members of the Massachusetts State Police. In addition to footage of the key shop, Biography of a Bookie Joint featured interviews with members of the Internal Revenue Service's intelligence unit, the Massachusetts State Police, and the New England Citizen's Crime Commission. State Representative Harrison Chadwick spoke about the influence bookmakers had on the state legislature. MSP Col. Carl Larson stated that he had informed Boston Police Commissioner Leo J. Sullivan on at least four occasions that illegal gambling was occurring at the key shop. Each time, Sullivan sent back word to Larson that members of his department had visited the shop and found nothing to warrant an arrest. ==Broadcast history== CBS elected not to air the program in Boston, Hartford, and Providence due to pending charges against the gamblers. It was rebroadcast nationally and for the first time in New England on March 20, 1963. ==ReactionCritical reception=== George McKinnon of The Boston Globe called Biography of a Bookie Joint \\"a brilliantly handled documentary, far more intriguing than any TV private eye drama\\". Jerome Sullivan stated that it may have been \\"the biggest thing that has hit Boston in 20 years\\". Biography of a Bookie Joint was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Program of the Year. It lost to the Hallmark Hall of Fame episode Victoria Regina. ===Political reaction=== The day after the program aired, Governor John Volpe announced that he would have a \\"showdown\\" with commissioner Sullivan. On December 8, Volpe asked Sullivan for his resignation. Sullivan refused and Volpe hired James D. St. Clair to prepare removal proceedings against Sullivan. Sullivan was brought before the Massachusetts Governor's Council's on charges of neglecting his duty by not ordering an investigation into the officers who were filmed visiting Swartz's Key Shop as well as three unrelated offenses. Sullivan resigned on March 15, 1962, during the hearings on his removal. Following Sullivan's resignation, a number of changes were made to the department. Fiscal control of the BPD and the power to appoint the police commissioner was transferred from the Governor of Massachusetts to the Mayor of Boston. Edmund McNamara was brought in from the FBI to become police commissioner and Quinn Tamm was hired to perform a survey of the department. Harrison Chadwick was publicly censured by the Massachusetts House of Representatives for his remarks in the film. In 1964 the House voted to reverse its censure. ===Arrests=== Abraham Swartz, proprietor of the shop, was fined $1,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in November 1961. He died on February 26, 1962. Harry Portnoy, principal in the gambling operation, was not arrested because he possessed a federal wagering stamp. He was later convicted of assaulting a U.S. Marshal who attempted to serve him a summons. Michael DiNunzio, a key maker who served as a front for the operation, was fined $1,000 and spent three months in jail. In 1963, DiNunzio was arrested in a raid of gambling operation located in a key shop across the street from Swartz's. ==References== Category:1961 American television episodes Category:CBS Reports Category:Political scandals in Massachusetts ","title":"Biography of a Bookie Joint"},{"id":"56865176","text":"Wife of a Mayogo chief, early 1900s.

The raid involved the British vessel and the French 24-gun frigate Duc de Choiseul. ==Background== During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities,Benjamin Franklin also engaged France in the war, which meant that many of the privateers were also from France. such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. Liverpool's struggle for identity during the revolutionary war has been the subject of considerable study by historians. The town was at first sympathetic to the cause of the American Revolution, with outlying outports like Port Medway and Port Mouton almost continuously visited by American privateers,Brebner. Neutral Yankees. 334-335 but after repeated attacks by American privateers on local shipping interests and one direct attack on the town itself, Liverpool citizens turned against the rebellion. The defence of the town and the outfitting of privateers was led by Colonel Simeon Perkins. Captain William Duddingston of was stationed at Liverpool. Just off Liverpool, on 26 August 1776, HMS Liverpool (28 guns) captured Warren (ex Hawk), which subsequently served as a tender for HMS Milford and ran aground in a storm near Portsmouth, New Hampshire at the end of December 1776. The Battle off Port Medway took place on 27 September 1776 during the American Revolutionary War. The American privateer (8 guns, 14 men), under the command of Captain Agreen Crabtree, captured five Nova Scotia vessels.Boston Gazette, November 4, 1776; New Hampshire Gazette, November 26, 1776.https://archive.org/details/navyofunitedstat00emmo/page/142?q=privateer+%22bay+of+fundy%22 In 1777, Joseph Dexter was imprisoned for helping American Privateers.

There was an exchange of cannon fire lasting over three hours. A number of the French crew were killed, drowned and wounded. The 100 remaining French crew were taken prisoner. The arms that were on the wrecked ship continued to attract American privateers over the following month. Consequently, on May 1, American privateers raided Liverpool, ravaging and pillaging a number of the houses and stores, including the store of Simeon Perkins, a significant town leader. Three weeks later, on May 21, the same privateers returned and tried to tow the wreck of Duc de Choiseul out to sea. Perkins mustered ten men at the shore. Cannon fire was exchanged by the British militia and the American privateers. The privateers continued to fire at the town for almost an hour. Perkins marched his men along the shore, closer to the privateers. One of the militia was wounded in the ensuing exchanges. The privateers stayed off shore for a number of days. Perkins kept a sergeant and six men on guard duty twenty four hours a day until the privateers left the area.Simeon Perkins' Diary entries ==Aftermath== After suffering three years of similar sporadic raids, the people of Liverpool, in June 1779 began re-building Fort Morris (Nova Scotia) and on October 31 launched their own privateer vessel named Lucy to bring battle to their adversaries. As well, Perkins wrote a successful appeal to the authorities in Halifax, and on December 13, 1778 Captain John Howard's company of the King's Orange Rangers arrived aboard the transport Hannah. The company consisted of Howard, 2 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 3 sergeants, 2 or 3 corporals, 48 privates, and several camp followers, both women and children.\\"King's Orange Rangers\\", John G.

It was \\"apparently based on Cleveland Amory's 1952 book, Last Resorts\\", and was written \\"with Amory\\".

His artistic inclinations and talent for drawing were evident in his youth, however his father compelled him to study commerce; he went to boarding school in Bern and later worked in Milan for a brief period. In 1889, when his father died leaving him a substantial inheritance, he decided to dedicate himself entirely to painting. He enrolled the following year at the Rossetti Valentini School of Fine Arts in Santa Maria Maggiore, where he took courses in painting, drawing and ornamentation taught by Enrico Cavalli. During these years of study, he became close friends with Carlo Fornara, who had enrolled at the school in 1883. Enrico Cavalli transmitted to his students the aesthetic and emotional values of Impressionism, to which the youthful Lorenzo responded in a very personally inflected way that won the sympathy of his teacher. When Enrico Cavalli gave up his teaching position at the Rossetti Valentini School, his best students were given the opportunity to widen their horizons and immerse themselves in French culture. In 1892, Peretti, together with Fornara and Giovanni Battista Ciolina (another of Cavalli's former students), made plans to accompany the master to Provence, Lyon and Paris. In the end they set out on the journey in 1893 without Ciolina, who would travel to France only in 1896, with Fornara. Peretti was finally able to see for himself the solutions engendered by the research of the masters Cavalli had constantly invoked during the ten years he taught in Santa Maria Maggiore. In Lyon, Peretti explored the painting of Eug√®ne Delacroix; in Paris he discovered the Pointillism of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, whose painting of light led him to Divisionism without the mediation of Giovanni Segantini, Plinio Nomellini or Angelo Morbelli. A second journey, in 1894, led Peretti to deepen his study of the work of Adolphe Monticelli, already cited at the time by Vincent van Gogh and Paul C√©zanne. Although Peretti had already been noticed by the tight and clearly defined circle of the Italian Divisionists (Morbelli mentions him several times, at first in admiring tones, later with a certain pique, in a series of letters addressed to Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo), Peretti chose not to align himself totally with the movement, in particular with a group whose schematic, scientific approach he judged to be too strict and too restrictive. Lorenzo Peretti Junior then moved away from Divisionism and set out along a solitary pathway, a personal synthesis of research, a scientific approach and mathematical rules with the spontaneity of the gesture, the immediacy of the sign and the emotional and sensory values inherited from Cavalli: a rejection which definitively excluded him from the avant-garde movements and the attention of contemporary criticism. The artist now privileged the technique of the \\"non finito\\", the unfinished ‚Äì already apparent in earlier paintings like Lavandaie alla lanca di Toceno (Washerwomen at the oxbow lake near Toceno, 1894) ‚Äì where masked or flattened colour, superimposed signs and a variety of techniques are made to coexist within a single work with the aim of involving, provoking and embarrassing a hypothetical public. The paintings Conversazione campestre (Conversation in the Fields) and Il bosco dei druidi (The Woods of the Druids) also date from this period. The latter work expresses Peretti Junior's lively interest in esotericism: a follower of Ren√© Gu√©non, a passionate reader of Rudolf Steiner and Allan Kardec, of Eliphas Levi, and of Buddhist and yoga texts, the artist and scholar created a large library of esoteric and theosophical works together with his friend Adolfo Papetti, a collector and the executor of his will. An increasingly solitary and eccentric figure, often mystified by the diffidence of his fellow townspeople (who believed he knew the secrets of the archaic sorcery of the Valley) and the superficiality of the criticism of his work, Lorenzo Peretti Junior spent the last decades of his life living in seclusion at Toceno, devoting himself mostly to studying and critiquing art. An analytical, in- depth reassessment of his role in the art of Valle Vigezzo and Italy generally at the turn of the 20th century would not be carried out until the 1990s, with the research of the Piedmontese critic Dario Gnemmi (1957-2005), in particular the volumes Retour √† la ferme (Return to the farm) (1993) and the posthumous Vigezzini di Francia.

Phillip Spiegel, author, Triumph over Tyranny 2008 == Early life == Born in Siberia in 1944 to a middle-class Jewish family from Riga. The family escaped the Nazis and returned to Riga in 1945, after the Soviets defeated the Nazis and liberated Latvia. Zalmanson family in Riga 1952 Zalmanson graduated Riga Polytechnic University in 1968, worked as an engineer and dreamed of living a in Israel. Repeatedly requesting and being denied an exit visa to leave the Soviet Union for Israel, Zalmanson and her husband Eduard Kuznetsov became members of a group of activists who came up with a plan to escape. == The Leningrad plane hijackers case == The plan was called \\"Operation Wedding,\\" (AKA Dymshits‚ÄìKuznetsov hijacking affair): the group would buy all the tickets to a local flight, as if they are going for a wedding. Once on board, they would take over the controls of the \\"borrowed\\" government plane and Major Mark Dymshits, a former Soviet military pilot and Jewish refusenik, would fly the aircraft, under the radar, over the Soviet border. Sylva recruited most of the group members, including her husband Eduard Kuznetsov and two brothers: Wolf Zalmanson and Israel Zalmanson. Aware that the KGB was watching and waiting, they nevertheless decided to go through with the plan. On 15 June 1970, the group were arrested and tried for \\"high treason,\\". Sylva was the only women on trial that took place in 15 December 1970, and the first to go up the stand, she said: \\"If you would not deny us our right to leave Russia, this group wouldn't exist. We would just leave to Israel with no desire of hijacking a plane or any other thing that's illegal. Even here, on trial, I still believe I'll make it someday to Israel.

Sylva's husband Edward Kuznetsov and the group's pilot, Mark Dymshits, received a death sentence. The death sentences were reduced to 15 years after only 8 days, due to massive free world pressure.

During his imprisonment, Amnesty International designated Pai a prisoner of conscience. Raised in Changhua County, Pai studied law at National Chengchi University. His political involvement began in 1969, campaigning for Huang Hsin-chieh, who won election to the Legislative Yuan. Suspected of sedition, Pai was jailed for four months in 1971, then released. In 1973, he supported a number of tangwai candidates for Taipei City Council. Pai chose to contest the legislative election of 1975, but was arrested in October for distributing campaign fliers which contained 29 questions addressed to Chiang Ching-kuo, as well as political policies suggested by Pai. The next month, he went to trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment by a military court. While imprisoned he went on hunger strikes to protest foreign policies and political repression. In February 1986, legislators Chiang Peng-chien and Fang Su-min petitioned for Pai's release. Instead, Pai's prison sentence was commuted to fifteen years upon the lifting of martial law in July 1987. Throughout the year, Pai's health continued to decline, and he was released in April 1988. In November 2018, Pai contested the Changhua County magistracy as an independent candidate. {class=\\" collapsible\\"  - ! colspan=\\"6\\"2018 Changhua County magistrate election results - !width=35 No. !width=150 Candidate !width=120 Party !width=75 Votes !width=75 Percentage !width=49 -  1 Wei Ming-kuDemocratic Progressive Partystyle=\\"border- left:4px solid #1B9413;\\" align=\\"right\\"283,269 align=\\"right\\"39.87% align=\\"center\\" -  2 Wang Huei-mei20px Kuomintangstyle=\\"border- left:4px solid #000099;\\" align=\\"right\\"377,795 align=\\"right\\"53.18% align=\\"center\\"20px -  3 Pai Ya-tsan20px Independent style=\\"border- left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"7,402 align=\\"right\\"1.04% align=\\"center\\" -  4 Huang Wen-ling20px Independent style=\\"border- left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"34,690 align=\\"right\\"4.88% align=\\"center\\" -  5 Hung Min-xiong (Ê¥™ÊïèÈõÑ)20px Independentstyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"7,263 align=\\"right\\"1.02% align=\\"center\\" - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Total voters  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  1,031,222 - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Valid votes  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  710,419 - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Invalid votes  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Voter turnout  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  68.89% } ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:National Chengchi University alumni Category:People from Changhua County Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Taiwan Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Taiwan Category:Taiwanese prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment ","title":"Pai Ya-tsan"},{"id":"56865335","text":"Tullio John Proni (born 18 March 1948) is an American psychologist and artist, known for producing ray guns. Tullio Proni, psychologist and artist, on 1 January 2007. == Early life and career == Proni, son of Oscar Proni and Maria Zampiera Proni, was born in Monfalcone, Italy. The family emigrated to the United States in June 1954, settling in Broward County, Florida. Tullio Proni attended Nova High School in Davie. He later graduated from the University of Miami and worked briefly for Coulter Electronics in Hialeah, Florida. Proni moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan for graduate study in experimental psychology at Western Michigan University. There, with his adviser Ronald R. Hutchinson, he participated in a research team investigating the measurement of human anger. Proni undertook thesis work on the response of human subjects to varying rewards of money, receiving a master's degree in psychology in 1973. He serves as Vice President and Information Technology Director at the Foundation for Behavioral Resources, a nonprofit organization based in Augusta, Michigan that operates charter schools and daycare centers, among other activities. With other inventors, he holds a patent on tracking the progress of students through a system of programmed classroom instruction. == Ray guns and Isher Enterprises == In 1976 Proni, a skilled machinist, began fabricating \\"ray guns\\" resembling the futuristic handguns in illustrations of science fiction stories. A typical \\"weapon\\"‚Äîdecorative but not functional‚Äîwas fashioned from polished, transparent acrylic plastic, which acted as a light pipe for a pulsating colored bulb. Batteries and electronics were concealed in opaque parts such as the handgrip. Some models featured audio circuits and speakers to produce an eerie warbling tone. Proni Model B ray gun. A laser pointer made by Tullio Proni, circa 1995 Proni began attending science fiction conventions, selling these weapons in their dealers' rooms alongside booksellers and jewelry vendors. In time, other members of Proni's household assisted in manufacturing products he designed. Under the name of \\"Isher Enterprises,\\" his tables offered a variety of products. handguns, larger weapons, and other handmade trinkets with flashing lights or bleeping sounds. He told the Battle Creek Enquirer: \\"Most of our artifacts are made from acrylic plastic, though we have literally used every material imaginable. Most of the artifacts are handguns which light up and make a ray gun sound. The light shines through the plastic, providing a translucent, icicle effect.\\" Isher Enterprises took its name from the Weapon Shops of Isher series, science fiction stories by A. E. van Vogt. The business also adopted the motto of the fictional Weapon Shops, \\"The finest energy weapons in the known universe.\\" In later years, the business adopted the name Isher Artifacts. The Isher table at conventions became a gathering point for other science fiction fans interested in technology. Proni collaborated on projects such as a remote-control robot fashioned from a cylindrical garbage can with a hemispherical top. With the release of Star Wars in 1977, public interest grew in ray guns and robots. Proni manufactured custom lightsabers. Artist Gordon Carelton said \\"He also made Artoo Detoo out of garbage cans. He took it to the premiere and got his picture in the papers.\\" In Chicago, Proni was introduced to Star Wars actors Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, then on a promotional tour. Isher continued to manufacture science-fictional weapons and props for several years, selling them at conventions and by mail order. Proni frequently introduced new, more sophisticated designs. As Chris Tower wrote in the Kalamazoo Gazette, \\"In stage one, he designs the gun, often on scraps of paper. In stage two, he figures out the lighting effects, mixing the integrated circuits, diodes, capacitors, resistors, and the like to get the sequencer and other effects to work. For step three, he constructs the body of the gun from aluminum, acrylic, brass, and Delrin [...] Then he tries to fit the circuit in the body casing, often 'an amusing step,' Tullio added.\\" In 1993, a science fiction convention in the Chicago area, DucKon 4, invited Proni to be its Scientist Guest of Honor. Proni also co-founded General Technics, an organization of science fiction fans interested in do-it-yourself technology. == Game design and other activities == In 1966 Proni designed War of the Empires, a play-by- mail space opera game, called by game designer Gary Gygax \\"possibly the earliest science fiction wargame.\\" Enticing prospective players, he wrote in an advertisement, \\"Leap into the future and command your own Space Navy! A small group is needed to defend Sol. Send qualifications but remember a good background in S. F. is needed.\\" \\"Science-fiction fans will surely recognize here some trappings of A. E. van Vogt's Isher setting,\\" wrote game historian Jon Peterson in 2018. War of the Empires provides a key example of the sorts of paper-and-pencil campaigns Gygax and others were playing in the years leading up to Dungeons & Dragons.\\" In 1969, Gygax himself ran a revised version of Proni's game. Proni has been involved in encouraging grade school students to explore science, founding an after-school model rocketry program. In 2002, Proni ran unsuccessfully as a Libertarian Party candidate for the Kalamazoo County Commission District 3. == References  External links == Isher Artifacts home page Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American psychologists Category:University of Miami alumni ","title":"Tullio Proni"},{"id":"56865365","text":"Hotel Polonia Palst is a hotel in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. ==History== Hotel Palast was built in the years 1910 to 1912, at the then intersection of Dzielna and Widzewska streets.

In 1939, the name was changed again, this time to Polonia. After the Second World War, the building was occupied by the Red Army and it set up a military hospital there. In January 1946, the hotel was handed over to the city authorities, which subordinated it to Hotel Miejskie. The building was completely renovated in the years 1969‚Äì1972.

Based in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, he is one of the most accomplished and admired grassroots football coaches in Malaysia. Samuel holds an English FA International Coaching Licence, is a certified Premier Skills Coach Educator and a qualified Asian Football Confederation (AFC) 'C' Licence Coach. Samuel is also the founder of Dream Village Football Academy based in Subang Jaya, Selangor, a football academy which has reached over 500 children in the Klang Valley through its weekly programmes and soccer clinics. In February 2018, Samuel was appointed Head of Grassroots at Football Association of Malaysia to pioneer its grassroots development work on a national level through football. == Biography  Early life and career === As a child growing up in the small town of Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Samuel loved playing football. From the age of 7, he dreamt of becoming a footballer. He picked up basketball and squash, too, but it was the team effort in football that brought him out to the field every evening. He is a strong supporter of Manchester United FC and the player he admired most while growing up was David Beckham. In 2006, Samuel moved to Selangor to attend college at INTI International University & Colleges in Subang Jaya. While studying for a computer science diploma in Network Security, it was there that his football career began. Throughout college, Samuel was captain and player of WAJA FC, a district-level football club. Together with a friend, he also founded Elastico FC, a semi-professional futsal club based in Subang Jaya for boys under-18. As captain and head coach, he led the team of 30 to train weekly, leading the club to play its first official friendly match in November 2010. Throughout his football coaching career, Samuel launched a total of five community football and futsal programs, reaching more than 500 children living in government low-cost flats in the Klang Valley such as Kampung Muhibbah, Kampung Pandan and Angsana in USJ1. == Youth Coaching  Asian Youth Ambassadors (2010‚Äì2013) === As a college student, Samuel was actively involved with football coaching through community projects run by Asian Youth Ambassadors, a non-governmental organization based in Subang Jaya. One of his first roles was to serve as a futsal tournament referee in PPR Kampung Muhibbah, a lower-income housing estate in Puchong, Selangor. It was his experience at Kampung Muhibbah that inspired him to take coaching beyond the community and onto a professional level. Upon graduating from college in 2010, Samuel worked full-time as Sports Coordinator with Asian Youth Ambassadors. He was responsible for coordinating weekly futsal programmes for underprivileged youths, teaching football skills as well as developing their character and confidence. Throughout his community work, it was Samuel's belief that impacting young lives is the key to breaking the poverty cycle. In 2011, Samuel participated in Premier Skills, a community coaching course conducted by the English Premier League and the British Council. At the end of the initiative in 2013, he was awarded the Premier Skills Coach Educator certification. That same year, his grassroots work also brought him to Pekanbaru, Indonesia to conduct soccer clinics for 150 children. === Dream Village Football Academy (2014‚Äì2017) === By the end of 2013, Sam‚Äôs work with the grassroots community in Malaysia had caught the attention of The Football Association (FA) in England. In 2014, he received a full scholarship to train at St George's Park National Football Centre in Staffordshire, England to obtain the FA's International Licence. Samuel was one of two fully sponsored participants from Southeast Asia, training alongside international coaches from 17 other countries. That same year, he came back to Malaysia to establish Dream Village Football Academy (DVFA), a social enterprise and football academy aimed at \\"nurturing the dreams of young players\\" for boys and girls under the age of 16. As co-founder, Head Coach and Technical Director, Samuel's vision for the academy was to develop children and youths in a holistic manner and to nurture local football talents focusing on skills, character and personality. Throughout his time at DVFA, Samuel trained more than 150 volunteer coaches and reached out to more than 500 children. In 2015, he also led a women‚Äôs coaching course in Bandar Sunway, Selangor for 22 aspiring women coaches in Malaysia. Organized by the Premier Skills initiative, the community coaching course aimed to train new coaches and strive for gender equality in football. In 2017, DVFA under Samuel‚Äôs leadership also partnered with German football club Borussia Dortmund (BVB), a top-tier Bundesliga club to organize a 5-day BVB Evonik Soccer Camp, teaching 34 youths aged between 7-14 the ways of the German Cup champions. The camp is part of an effort to forge closer ties between Malaysian football and German football. The DFB-Pokal German Cup was accompanied by the special visit of Football legend and 1990 FIFA World Cup Winner Karl-Heinz Riedle, who inspired the youths with his story. === Football Association of Malaysia (2018‚Äìpresent) === In February 2018, Samuel was appointed Head of Grassroots at Football Association of Malaysia. In his new role, he will pioneer grassroots development work in Malaysia through football. == Media == Since coming to the forefront as a national grassroots football coach, Samuel has appeared on BFM89.9, an independent business radio station in Malaysia to talk about Dream Village Football Academy (DVFA).

The political fall of Hu came immediately following the 1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations when he was removed by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping for being too liberal in his policies. Upon Hu's death on April 15, 1989, large gatherings of people began forming across the country. Most media attention was put onto the Beijing citizens who participated in the Tiananmen Square Protests, however, every other region in China had cities with similar demonstrations. The origins of these movements gradually became forgotten in some places and some regions began to demonstrate based on their own problems with their Provincial and Central Governments. The protests would align at times with the largest demonstrations in Beijing, and most were affected by the military crackdown in the nation's capital. Many of the sources for these events are from leaked government documents, Chinese dissidents, or reports from foreigners who were in China at the time. The following is a list of cities by region outside of Beijing that had protests of their own. ==Protests in North ChinaHohhot=== Students in Hohhot, ranging at times up to 3,000 people, started protesting between May 11 and May 14, 1989, demanding inflation control, governmental corruption reforms, and better funding for education. Many also asked for information regarding possible shady dealings being done by the region's most senior Party official, Ulanfu.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. New York: PublicAffairs, 2001. . p. 170. On May 19 roughly 10,000 students were still taking to the streets.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 228. By May 22 most demonstrations began to decline in numbers. Students would still remain on strike for the next four days with less than a third staying on campuses.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 304. Anger towards Premier Li Peng once again riled students in Hohhot on May 29, and approximately 4,000 marched in the city demanding his resignation.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 322. Students and teachers marched in a crowd of 4,000 when they heard of the June 4, massacre in Beijing. Chanting slogans about revenge, they were greeted by roughly 10,000 citizens when they reached the city's main square.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 393. ===Shijiazhuang=== Shijiazhuang saw its first student demonstrations with the release of the April 26 Editorial. Four days later a report came to the central government warning that the students in the city were becoming more rebellious.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 81. On May 17, 1989, roughly 10,000 students and 200 journalists marched in support of the Beijing students and demanded dialogue and freedom of the press. Later in the day, 5,000 broke off and were able to get into the provincial government buildings and present their petitions to the authorities. The next day, May 18, saw some government employees, medical staff, and high school students join in the protests and the total crowds of marchers and onlookers swelled to about 150,000.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 215. ===Taiyuan=== Student demonstrations began in Taiyuan after the April 26 Editorial. After the failed Yuan Mu dialogue on April 29, 1989, the protests were reported to the central government as becoming more rebellious in nature on April 30.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 98. After a declaration by Beijing student leaders on May 4 most students around the country returned for classes except for many in Taiyuan who were in the midst of protesting a remark made by a city official.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 125. Five days later approximately 5,000 students sat in near the provincial government offices demanding to talk to party official Wang Senhao after a failed dialogue on May 8.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 132. On May 10 a major event happened when demonstrators interrupted opening ceremonies for an international economic technology conference, import-export fair, and an art and culture festival.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 139. The students‚Äô slogans drew the interest of some of the onlookers and the total crowd is estimated to have reached 20,000. Once again demanding to meet Wang Senhao, the students went to the outside the provincial buildings and tried to enter them three times. That evening students returned to their campuses when they were promised that they would be able to meet with the governor at a later time.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 140. The local government followed through on May 15 when, after a crowd of 10,000 had gathered once more outside of the provincial buildings. Wang Senhao and other officials met with 33 student representatives. After students made their major point, that the luxury in which the new government buildings had been suited with was a waste of money, Wang agreed to additional talks with students. This ended the demonstrations for the evening.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 172. Three days later on May 18 roughly 230 hunger strikers had been fasting for two days and demonstrator numbers reached 30,000. That morning saw violence break out near the provincial government building when some people threw bricks at the police lightly injuring over 80 police and another 8 people. Roughly 60 people were arrested due to this. Later that day over 130,000 marchers took to the streets chanting anti- Chairman Deng Xiaoping and President Yang Shangkun slogans.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 216. From May 20 to May 22, in reaction to the declaration of martial law in Beijing, students created propaganda teams to try an elicit additional aid from workers, with a reported 1,000 students going to a steel company to distribute pamphlets.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 274. Three days later on May 25, the first workers started to march in demand of the resignation of Li Peng. In reaction to the crackdown in Beijing on June 4, students numbering around 4,000 marched with banners with slogans demanding justice for those killed in the nation's capital. ===Tianjin=== On the evening of April 15, after the death of Hu Yaobang, approximately 2,000 students marched in mourning around the campus of Nankai University in Tianjin.Cosbey, Robert C. Watching China Change. Toronto: Between the Lines, 2001. . p. 220. On April 17 and 18, 1989, students were mostly confined to the campus of the university,Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 24. however, by April 24, students at Nankai had begun to boycott classes.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 62. They marched in crowds that gathered to over 20,000 and now carried banners and signs.Cosbey, Robert C. Watching China Change. p. 222. Large student protests occurred again to the April 26 Editorial two days later. These student protests would carry on into the Yuan Mu debate which sparked other demonstrations across the country.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 96 According to a report the next day on April 3, more posters were seen in Nankai University after these two incidents and roughly half of the student population was now boycotting classes. According to Robert C. Cosbey, who was teaching at Nankai in 1989, between the Yuan dialogue and May 16, some student protests managed to gather as many as 50,000 additional onlookers.Cosbey, Robert C. Watching China Change. p. 227. On May 25, Tianjin saw even more protests not just by students, but by intellectuals and writers. These protests were again viewed by over 50,000 onlookers.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 295. ==Protests in Northeast ChinaChangchun=== Some of the earliest demonstrations to have at least occurred in Changchun were in response to the April 26 Editorial. Roughly 3,000 students from Jilin University, and other universities, began to hold a sit-in demanding that officials talk with them. Eventually, the crowd was dispersed peacefully by police, party, and education officials.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 76. After the failed dialogue between Yuan Mu and several Beijing student leaders, students in Changchun took to the streets on April 29, 1989.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 96. Students would continue to march on May 19 in numbers of around 10,000, and two days later tried to garner support from workers at a nearby automobile factory. Changchun citizens reacted to the June 4 crackdown in Beijing by marching in numbers of around 4,000 and chanted about their shock at the violence.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p.393. ===Harbin=== The capital of Heilongjiang saw around 9,000 students demonstrate in front of the provincial government buildings on May 15, 1989. They declared their support for the student protests in Beijing and demanded that the governor of the province, Shao Qihui, come out to for dialogue. After a long standoff with police, the vice governor came out to try and pacify the crowd by taking the petition and said that the governor would talk with them on May 20. The students, unhappy with this, continued to demand Shao come out until he finally did. Unable to immediately appease the students, dialogue between the demonstrators and the governor went on well into the night. After several days of continuous protesting, May 17 saw the student protesters in Harbin numbering at 25,000, nearly half of the entire student population in the city. Participants started to see the movement as more than just temporary and started to create their own autonomous student organizations and prepared for their own hunger strikes.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 197. By May 31 things managed to settle down in the city and students started to calm down. In Heilongjiang University officials made an agreement with the student federation to continue their operation and the federation, in good will, recalled students from Beijing.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 329. As early as the night of June 3 people in Harbin started to hear about the military crackdown in Beijing. The next day more than 7,000 protesters took to the streets mourning those that died in Beijing all the meanwhile chanting anti-Li Peng slogans. ===Shenyang=== Two days after it first broadcast in Shenyang, the April 26 Editorial drew enough ire from students that the city saw its first major demonstrations. These demonstrations sparked again when the Yuan Mu dialogue was televised. After four consecutive days of demonstrations, more than 20,000 students marched on May 17, 1989. More spectators began to watch the students as well, with nearly 10,000 onlookers in Shenyang's Zhongshan Square alone. At the end of the day, onlookers around the students at the government buildings reportedly number at around 100,000. ==Protests in Northwest ChinaLanzhou=== One of the earliest instances of student protest in Lanzhou was in response to the inconclusive televised discussion between Yuan Mu and the Beijing student leaders on April 29, 1989. On May 9 roughly 3,000 students protested after a number of dialogues that individual campuses had with party officials and demanded a unified dialogue. Reportedly around 1,000 of these students, when conducting a sit-in outside of the Gansu provincial building, tried to break into the building itself. They were stopped by several rows of police, but not before seven police officers were injured. By May 29 around 100 students were encamped in the main square of the city but were reportedly exhausted and looked like they were going to give up. After hearing the news about the crackdown in Beijing, more than 3,000 students and teachers began to protest again in Lazhou in the early morning of June 4. Many separate groups comprising around 1,000 people chose to protest by lying down on train tracks going out of the city to try and shut down transportation. ===√úr√ºmqi=== The city of √úr√ºmqi saw a minor demonstration between May 11 to May 15, 1989, when over 100 uranium miners staged a sit-in, partially in support of Beijing students, but mostly over concerns about radiation sickness and the government's apathy to it. The provincial government eventually did talk to them and assuaged their worries which ended the affair with the miners going home peacefully.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 170. When they heard of the crackdown in Beijing, about 100 students in √úr√ºmqi conducted a sit-in outside of the government building on June 5.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 400. ===Xi‚Äôan=== Official reports sent to the central government suggest that student mourning of Hu Yaobing started as early as April 15, 1989 in Xi'an.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 28. Joseph Esherick, who was teaching in Xi‚Äôan at the time, noted that students from Northwest, Shaanxi Normal, and Jiaotong universities were gathering in small groups.Esherick, Joseph W. \\"Xi'an Spring\\" The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces, ed. Jonathan Unger. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1991, retrieved online at https://web.archive.org/web/20160404094930/http://tsquare.tv/links/ESHERICK.html paragraph, 6. The next day the Shaanxi Party Committee remarked that roughly 10,000 people were gathering daily and that the crowds included not just students but workers, officials, and other residents of Xi‚Äôan.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 44. The subject matter that the marchers were discussing was also starting to include topics such as inflation, salaries, and housing problems. On April 20 a large crowd of 10,000 students broke into the Provincial Government's Office area and demanded to talk to the governor. One of their main demands was an explanation of why Hu Yaobang had been forced to resign two years earlier.Esherick, Joseph W. ‚ÄúXi'an Spring‚Äù. paragraph, 7. Police that had already been stationed there earlier managed to hold them off. After several hours with no dialogue, the students returned to their campuses and the remaining crowds left when it began to rain. The April 22 Incident originally started as a gathering of roughly 40,000 people who were gathered in New City Square, outside the Provincial Government Building, to watch a live feed of Hu Yaobang's funeral. Pushing back and forth between protestors and police occurred with some of the crowd angry that they could not tell if a petition concerning Hu Yaobang's resignation was accepted by the Provincial Government. Several rocks were thrown from the crowd at the police. The police responded by hitting crowd members with leather belts. Soon after this, a police vehicle with a tarp on it was set on fire and a few hours later the front gates were as well. At some point during the day some student's wreaths were received by the government and provincial governor, Hu Zongbin, even showed up. It was around this time that police in the square became more aggressive as their members who had riot gear charged the crowd with batons. By 5 p.m. most students had left the square but many private employees who finished work were brought into the melee as they passed the square. Some reports suggest that some officers and party cadres tried to halt the violence, but they were ignored. Roughly around 7 p.m. several hundred people broke into, and burned, several buildings to the west of the provincial government. One high official from these buildings was reported to have asked the police to cease violence against the protestors. An hour later police managed to clear and close down the main square. At the same time some members of the crowd fled into a nearby clothing store. The government would later say that any police brutality that occurred in the store was in response to looters that had went in there. Although many photos and eyewitnesses attested to the violence in Xi‚Äôan on April 22, no official account acknowledges any casualties.Esherick, Joseph W. ‚ÄúXi'an Spring.\\" paragraphs, 10-31. On April 24 another incident occurred during one of the demonstrations wherein there was reportedly ‚Äúbeating, smashing, robbing, and burning.‚ÄùZhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 67. Around 270 people were taken into custody, and after preliminary interrogation, 106 were released. An official account of the April 22 Incident was released on April 28, which downplayed the violence and causes of the incident. This caused resentment among many people throughout the city, with anti-Deng Xiaoping posters being seen on university campuses in the city.Esherick, Joseph W. \\"Xi'an Spring.\\" paragraph, 34. With around 12,000 marchers on May 4, the students in Xi‚Äôan demanded the accusatory remarks made in the newspapers about the April 22 incident be redacted and that the government come to speak with the students. Shaanxi Province vice governor Sun Daren was reported to have come out and talked with some of them.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 114. By May 17, students were again demonstrating with large posters sporting various slogans expressing their discontent, and demands, of the central government. An estimated 2,000 students departed at some point during the day by train to Beijing to join with the student movement there.Esherick, Joseph W. ‚ÄúXi'an Spring.‚Äù paragraph, 40. After the May 20 declaration of martial law in Beijing by the Central Government, many students in Xi‚Äôan began to return to their institutions or homes in fear of government repression.Esherick, Joseph W. \\"Xi'an Spring.\\" paragraph, 52. However, among the most ardent students, large protests started when rumours started floating around about several Xi‚Äôan students being killed in the nation's capital. Six days later on May 26 roughly 10,000 students rallied and called for public freedoms as well as establishing a province wide autonomous student federation. The reactions to the June 4 crackdown in Beijing saw groups, ranging from several hundred to 2,000 participants, in Xi‚Äôan marching to express their grief. Additional demonstrations would occur over the following days and it was not until June 11 that the Xi‚Äôan government cracked down on these.Esherick, Joseph W. ‚ÄúXi'an Spring.‚Äù paragraphs, 56-62. ===Xining=== Xining was one of two cities to have reportedly had student demonstrations during the May 3, 1989, lull.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 112. Likewise on May 5, while students around the country had started to return to class after a declaration from Beijing student leaders, those in Xining continued to stay out of class in protest of a report printed by the local newspaper. Several weeks later on May 26, 15 students who had returned from Beijing staged their own hunger strike in front of the provincial government building in an attempt to garner more support for demonstrations. ===Yinchuan=== Some of Ningxia‚Äôs first major protests to have occurred were in Yinchuan with students angrily responding to the April 26 Editorial. On May 28 numbers dropped drastically when only 3,000 students took to the streets.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 316. A similar number of people would march again, this time with wreaths and banners, when they heard the news about the June 4 crackdown in Beijing. ==East ChinaFuzhou=== On May 4 several thousand students marched through Fuzhou. The marchers carried few banners, but were heard to be chanting anti-corruption and pro-China chants. The marchers, students from Fujian Teacher's University and Fuzhou University, went to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Once there, they found the building closed off and surround by police. Although there were some brief moments of pushing back and forth between the crowd and police, most of the crowd left after a few hours without incident.Erbaugh, Mary S. and Kraus, Richard Curt. \\"The 1989 Democracy Movement in Fujian and its Aftermath,\\" The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces, ed. Jonathan Unger. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1991. retrieved online at https://web.archive.org/web/20160404095110/http://tsquare.tv/links/KRAUS.html, paragraph, 8. From May 16 to May 18 the demonstrations in Fuzhou increased in sizes to over 10,000 but remained peaceful. By May 20, with the declaration of martial law in Beijing, those students in Fuzhou who were especially upset with the Central Government blocked an express train to Beijing. This crowd of approximately 1,000 also demanded to see provincial Vice-governor Chen Mingyi, but after five hours of waiting they dispersed. On May 27, a group of protesters reportedly blocked a bridge that spans the Min River for roughly one hour.Erbaugh, Mary S. and Kraus, Richard Curt. \\"The 1989 Democracy Movement in Fujian and its Aftermath.\\" paragraph, 17. In reaction to the military crackdown in Beijing on June 4, people marched in the thousands towards Fuzhou city centre. The next day marchers became more organized with elaborate banners expressing grief.Erbaugh, Mary S. and Kraus, Richard Curt. \\"The 1989 Democracy Movement in Fujian and its Aftermath.\\" paragraph, 20. ===Hangzhou=== Protests in Hangzhou were sporadic until April 27, 1989, the day after the April 26 editorial. Another large reaction by Hangzhou students to the central government was after the Yuan Mu dialogue of April 29. May 4 saw even larger student demonstrations when around 10,000 students marched demanding liberalization of the press, controls on inflation, and the removal of corrupt officials. At the same time, Party members in Hangzhou were explicitly told not to fraternize with the students, including the offering of any food or water like other Hangzhou citizens.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou,\\" The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces, ed. Jonathan Unger. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1991, retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20160404094915/http://tsquare.tv/links/KEITH.html paragraph, 17. Demonstrations started again on May 14 with 2,000 people also marching through to May 16 and another 40 beginning a hunger strike in solidarity with students in Beijing. By the evening of May 17 the number of hunger strikers grew to several hundred.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 20. On May 18, officials including Party Committee Secretary Li Zemin (not to be confused with Jiang Zemin) and Governor Shen Zulun visited the hunger strikers and implored them to end their fast. The China Daily was reported to have said that around 100,000 people either participated in, or watched, the demonstrations.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 26. Partially in response to the declaration of martial law in Beijing, and lack of local government action, workers began striking on May 23 and demonstrated alongside students.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 39. The same day also saw 300 students renounced their membership from the Communist Youth League by destroying their membership cards.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 287. On May 26, some city newspapers ran urgent pleas from the government for students to return to classes,Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 40. but 5,000 students still went to Wulin Square and announced that they would demonstrate until the very end. By May 27, however, most students went back to classes, with the only notable exception of many from Hangzhou University. Li Zemin would demand on June 1 that the boycotts by the students end.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 46. Reports from Hangzhou suggest that the ordinary protests changed with the June 4 Beijing crackdown. Trains and traffic were said to have been intermittently halted due to resulting protests.Forster, Keith. \\"The Popular Protest in Hangzhou.\\" paragraph, 51. ===Hefei=== Some of the earliest student demonstrations to have occurred in Hefei started on the evening of April 25, 1989, with the broadcasting of the April 26 Editorial.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 76. By April 27 the demonstrations started to pick up momentum with large crowds participating. On May 17 over 10,000 students, teachers, and writers started marching demanding internal government reform. Students from the Chinese University of Science and Technology, who had participated in the 1986 protests, also joined in saying they would be silenced no longer.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 199. Roughly 3,000 students and 400 workers and demobilized soldiers demonstrated during a Great Chinese Protest Day demonstration on May 28. Four days later on June 1 another 1,500 students would march in a show of solidarity with students in Shanghai. On the same day another 300 would pay homage to a student who died by falling under a train on his way back from Tiananmen Square.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 354. ===Jinan=== One of the earliest demonstrations reported from Jinan, which happened on April 27, 1989, was due to the April 26 Editorial. By at least May 18 thousands were marching in Jinan in support of the Beijing students and demonstrated about problems in their own province.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers p. 216. On May 24 for the first time in the city roughly 1,000 workers went on strike. A day later an estimated 10,000 students, workers, and citizens marched. May 25, also saw students try to force their way onto trains that were now off limits to them. On June 4 over 4,000 students marched in Jinan holding wreaths and mourned for the deaths in Beijing. Reportedly, they painted anti-Li Peng slogans on public transport vehicles like buses. ===Nanjing=== April 17, 1989, saw a petition to the police from roughly 10,000 students from different campuses across Nanjing for permission to march in mourning of Hu Yaobang‚Äôs death. The police response was to ask students to not to protest citing difficulty in maintaining public order. Although the students acquiesced to this, the Public Security Department still expected demonstrations to occur. By April 20 students began blocking traffic and espousing radical ideas unrelated to Hu's death. The Jiangsu Party Committee filed a series of reports mentioning the students moving to the Bell Tower Square and demanding that their movement be recognized as patriotic and that officials do something about corruption and government transparency. People began demonstrating in larger crowds after the release of the April 26 Editorial. By May 19 over 10,000 protesters were marching in the streets of Nanjing. Two days later workers from the nearby Nanjing Rubber Plant announced a strike, and journalists and teachers joined the protesting students.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 275. Nanjing saw over 30,000 demonstrators turn out on May 28 whose targets were Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng. ===Nanchang=== While most other cities were in a lull during the student movements, Nanchang students continued demonstrating into May 3, 1989.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 110. Over 10,000 students would march again on May 19. Around 2,000 students would march after they heard about the June 4 crackdown in Beijing. They carried banners and chanted slogans on subjects about revenge and condemning Li Peng.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 394. ===Shanghai=== On April 17, 1989, small posters related to Hu Yaobang's death started to show up around Shanghai university campuses. During the next day several impromptu groups comprising thousands of students started to publicly mourn Hu. One group went so far as to demand to meet officials of the municipal government but ended up unsuccessful. Until April 23 most student activity had been relatively lax, but after incident in which Qin Benli of the newspaper the World Economic Forum published unedited accounts from the leadership in Shanghai, students and journalists became more agitated. Large protests in Shanghai occurred after the publication of the April 26 Editorial and would continue well through the Yuan Mu dialogue of April 29. After having taken a break, on May 2 the students in Shanghai marched on towards the People's Square in crowds that roughly conjoined into one of roughly 7,000. While in the square the students conducted sit-ins, heard and made speeches, and signed petitions to the cities leadership. After police barred bystanders from entering the Square, the students then moved onto the Bund where their numbers swelled to about 8,000 and where they also conducted a sit-in that lasted into the late evening.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 100. Two days later, on the seventieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, 8,000 Shanghai students again led a sit-in in front of the Municipal Government asking for dialogue. The pamphlets and handbills they circulated reportedly also garnered support from many citizens. On May 16 over 4,000 students from 12 different universities went to the municipal government buildings and began a sit-in demanding the resignation of Jiang Zemin. They also continued with previous slogans and presented new demands to the government which included recognizing the student movement as patriotic, agree to not punish any demonstrators, to reinstate Qin Benli at the Herald, and for open dialogue between student representatives and the government on an equal footing.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 182. With the threat of even larger protests, the municipal leadership agreed to meet with student leaders the next day. By the morning May 17, with no dialogue having happened yet, 200 students remained at the sit-in and around 40 followed the students in Beijing's example and began their own hunger strike.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 183. Later that day, more than 23,000 protesters assembled outside of the government buildings, with an additional 60 hunger strikers. Dialogue between the students and government were boycotted by many because the student representatives were from official organizations and not the autonomous ones created by the students. Likewise, there was discontent when Jiang Zemin did not attend the dialogue and the following day would see over 100,000 citizens, including writers and workers, march in support of the students. In response to the declaration of martial law in Beijing, more than 20,000 students, factory workers, and intellectuals marched in the rain to protest. Three days later on May 23 roughly 55,000 marched in Shanghai with non-students coming into university campuses and students going to workplaces to lecture. Upon hearing the news of the June 4 crackdown in Beijing, Shanghai students protested in the streets and reportedly blocked off 42 areas. Throughout the day they put up roadblocks and shouted angry speeches.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 392. ==Protests in South Central ChinaChangsha=== During a student demonstration on April 22, 1989, disorder occurred in Changsha when roughly 20 shops were looted resulting in the detention of 96 people.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 51. April 24 saw students putting up posters with anti-Deng Xiaoping slogans around universities in the city, including Hunan Normal University. A day later on April 25 the police arrested 138 people for violence including ‚Äúbeating, smashing, and robbing.‚ÄùZhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 69. Later that night, with the broadcasting of the April 26 Editorial, new demonstrations broke out that would grow larger by April 27. Demonstrations continued in response to the poorly received Yuan Mu dialogue on April 29. By May 4, roughly 6,000 students in Changsha handed out letters to people asking for the support of farmers, workers, and entrepreneurs. Hunger strikes in Changsha are reported to have started as early as May 13.Tang Biaoqing and Dimarco, Damon. My Two Chinas: The Memoir of a Chinese Counterrevolutionary. (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2011). p. 93. On May 19 students from Changsha University continued demonstrating and numbers from other colleges and high schools totaled the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000. Out of 300 students who were hunger striking, 26 fainted by midday and one student is reported to have tried committing suicide by banging his head against a wall.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 229. June 1 also saw another 300 students go to the government building and commence a hunger strike. Around 500 students would march towards the train station on June 4 when they heard about the military crackdown in Beijing. That night they stopped locomotives from moving and placed wreaths mourning the students killed in Beijing around the station.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 395. ===Shaoyang=== Things remained relatively calm in Shaoyang during the early parts of the student demonstrations even though things were picking up in the provincial capital, Changsha. The first demonstrations in Shaoyang to have happened were due to the publication of the April 26 Editorial. By May 19, 1989, more than 10,000 demonstrators and onlookers took to the cities square. Incidents of property damage reportedly occurred and some even tried to break into the municipal building by destroying windows and the front gate. About 45 were arrested with 12 immediately being let go. None of the vandals that participated were students. ===Wuhan=== Between April 19 and 22, 1989, reports started to come to the central government from the Hubei Party Committee describing that the student demonstrations occurring in the city were becoming increasingly political.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 45. Major demonstrations began in Wuhan when the central government broadcast its April 26 Editorial. These demonstrations turned into protests on and off of Wuhan campuses after the broadcast of the Yuan Mu dialogue on April 29. On May 4, an estimated 10,000 students marched and demanded inflation control and voiced their opposition to bureaucratic corruption in government. Likewise, on May 18, thousands continued to take to the streets.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 127. After hearing the news of the crackdown in Beijing on June 4, more than 10,000 students from universities across the city marched. They blocked off the main roads between Wuhan, Wuchang, and Hanyang as well as blocked off the railroad tracks of the Beijing-Guangzhou line.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 396. ==Protests in Southwest China== For the demonstrations in Chengdu see: Chengdu protests of 1989 ===Chongqing=== Some unrest began in Chongqing on university campuses after the news of Hu Yaobang's death was announced. Large outdoor demonstrations developed in Chongqing at least as early as the publication of the April 26 Editorial. These demonstrations would continue with the televised dialogue between Yuan Mu and the Beijing student leaders on April 29, 1989. The May 4 demonstrations in Chongqing saw 7,000 people stage a sit-in at municipal government buildings asking for the government to acknowledge their movement as legitimate and also ask for fair treatment in the media.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 144. On the same day the organization between student protesters broke down as two non-students who had returned from Beijing with news were ousted as lay workers.Chan, Anita and Unger, Jonathan. \\"Voices from the Protest Movement in Chongqing: Class Accents and Class Tensions,\\" The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces, ed. Jonathan Unger. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1991, retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20160403112809/http://tsquare.tv/links/Chan.html paragraph, 12. Between May 17 and May 19, roughly 10,000 people demonstrated and at least 82 are thought to have started their own hunger strike.Chan & Unger This would, however, started to fracture as tired students who flagged down rides back to campuses caused major traffic congestion and ordinary people began worrying about food shortages caused by the demonstrations.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 230. From May 3 to May 20 fourteen people were reported by the Chongqing Ribao to have been arrested, although this number may be higher.Chan, Anita and Unger, Jonathan. \\"Voices from the Protest Movement in Chongqing: Class Accents and Class Tensions.\\" paragraph, 39. On May 20, city officials acceded to having a dialogue with demonstration leaders, but with factionalism and the hastiness of the meeting, nothing came of it.Chan, Anita and Unger, Jonathan. \\"Voices from the Protest Movement in Chongqing: Class Accents and Class Tensions.\\" paragraph, 26. Over 20,000 demonstrators marched in the streets of Chongqing on May 23. In response to the Beijing crackdown on June 4, many students in Chongqing started additional boycott class movements. People from all walks of life blocked roads, trains, and even overturned vehicles in the city. For two days the city was essentially paralyzed, although on the night of June 5 some officials were able to negotiate a dispersal of the protesters blocking the railways. Most traffic in the city would start to resume the following day.Chan, Anita and Unger, Jonathan. \\"Voices from the Protest Movement in Chongqing: Class Accents and Class Tensions.\\" paragraph, 48. ===Guiyang=== Guiyang saw some of its major student protests happen on the early morning of May 18, 1989, when 3,000 saw some of their cohort off at the train headed for Beijing. Later, 2,000 of the students moved to the provincial government building chanting slogans and criticizing the province's lack of financial development. In the afternoon, after earlier being deterred by the police, roughly 4,500 students marched again outside the provincial building and demanded objective news coverage of their movement as well as transportation for those students who wished to go to Beijing. The government, reportedly at a loss as to what to do, ordered several thousand box dinners and decided to try and wait the students out. By the evening 2,000 students were still waiting with a police estimate of 100,000 onlookers as well.Zhang Liang. The Tiananmen Papers. p. 198. Over 1,000 students in Guiyang would protest on June 4 after hearing about the crackdown in Beijing. They laid wreathes in the city square and some even called on people to riot against the government.Zhang Liang.

Today it is the seat of the municipality of Binasco. ==History== The castle originated from a stronghold built by the Visconti in the 14th century to take care of their land in the area. Probably between 1315 and 1319 the nearby church of Saint Stephan was founded and the castle built by Luchino Visconti, Lord of Milan. The first mention of a castle in Binasco dates back to 1329, when it was used by Azzone Visconti and his uncle Giovanni as a prison for their political opponents. In the 17th century the castle underwent transformations and restorations. At the end of the 19th century it was sacked during the Napoleonic age and in 1869 hit by a ruinous fire. The current aspect is the result of subsequent restorations that gave back the sense of the ancient fortress.

The band is composed of guitarist Josh Price, drummer Matt Boggis, and bassist and vocalist Eamon Sandwith. Notable for their songs about Australian culture, they initially went viral for their song \\"Smoko\\" and its music video in 2017. To date they have released two EPs, The Chats (2016) and Get This in Ya!! (2017), and their debut studio album High Risk Behaviour was released on 27 March 2020. ==HistoryFormation (2016)=== Josh Price, Matt Boggis and Eamon Sandwith met in music class at St. Teresa's Catholic College in Noosa, Queensland. When they were 17, in September 2016, they formed the Chats, with Price on guitar, Boggis on drums, and Sandwidth on bass and vocals. Former member Tremayne McCarthy also played bass and guitar in the original lineup. The band takes its name from the phrase \\"that's chat\\" - (Australian slang to describe something terrible). Their debut self-titled EP, recorded at their high school, was released on 7 November 2016. Triple J described the EP as \\"seven joyous sky-punching tracks that combined 60s garage punk and 70s new wave punk\\". === Get This in Ya!! (2017) === Bassist Eamon Sandwith performing live with the Chats in 2017 Their second EP, Get This in Ya!! was released on 31 July 2017, \\"another thrilling seven-song slice of economic, stripped-down, early Buzzcocks-styles punk tension\\". It was tracked/recorded at Eleven PM Studios in Nambour, Queensland, Australia, by Finn Wegener and Michael Currie on 24 June 2017. Former member, Tremayne McCarthy, actually played bass on the \\"Smoko\\" track and spoke the line \\"Is it Smoko?\\". Michael Currie was the producer and decided that the best way to record the band was all in the same room together live. Only very minimal overdubbing was done. It was then mixed and mastered by Michael Currie at his Polished Turd Studios in Brisbane, Australia. The music video for the track \\"Smoko\\", filmed with no budget at a building site, was directed by Matisse Langbein, who also did the cover art for the EP, and was released on the 3rd of October, quickly becoming a viral hit and drawing attention from popular rock musicians Josh Homme, Iggy Pop, and Dave Grohl. Triple J argued that the song \\"was an instant classic of a youth anthem on a par with 'You Really Got Me', 'My Generation' or 'Teenage Kicks'\\". ===Universal deal and High Risk Behaviour (2018‚Äìpresent)=== On 3 July 2018, the Chats released the single \\"Do What I Want\\", announced to be included in their forthcoming studio album. The band signed a global deal with Universal Music Publishing Australia on 19 March 2019, and founded their own label, Bargain Bin Records. On 21 March, The Chats released \\"Pub Feed\\" alongside an accompanying music video. Throughout July, the band toured the United States. On 26 July, they released the single \\"Identity Theft\\" alongside an accompanying music video, which contains references to the video game Guitar Hero. The band performed at the UK Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2019. In October 2019, the Chats commenced an Australian national tour. The band performed a headlining tour in the UK during December 2019. When asked about the then-untitled High Risk Behaviour during an interview at the Reading Festival, Sandwith revealed that the songs were already recorded: \\"We're gonna call it done...we're not perfectionists or anything.\\". In late December 2019, Sandwith posted a song criticizing Prime Minister Scott Morrison for his perceived apathy and carelessness towards the 2019-20 bushfire crisis to Instagram, titled 'I Hope Scott's House Burns Down'; according to Pedestrian.tv, the song is being used to aid fundraising efforts for numerous volunteer firefighter groups. The band debuted the song \\"The Clap\\" on 17 January 2020 and revealed the name of their debut studio album, High Risk Behaviour, as well as a release date of 27 March 2020. Weeks before its release, the band released a music video for the album track \\"Dine & Dash\\". ==Musical style== The band coined the term \\"shed rock\\" to describe their sound, and their self-contained approach has been likened to that of King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. They cited Australian bands Cosmic Psychos, Dune Rats and Eddy Current Suppression Ring as major influences. ==Members== Current * Eamon Sandwith ‚Äì lead vocals, bass guitar * Josh \\"Pricey\\" Price ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals * Matt Boggis ‚Äì drums Former * Tremayne McCarthy ‚Äì bass, guitar, backing vocals ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" +List of studio albums, with selected chart positions shown ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\"  High Risk Behaviour  * Released: 27 March 2020 * Label: Bargain Bin Records, Cooking Vinyl Australia * Format: CD, digital download, streaming, LP  5 } ===Extended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of extended plays, with selected details about release date and label ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" EP details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Chats  * Released: 7 November 2016 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download, streaming - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Get This in Ya!!  * Released: 31 July 2017 * Label: Self-released * Format: Cassette, digital download, streaming, vinyl, CD } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of singles, showing year released and album name ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Smoko\\"  2017  Get This in Ya!! - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Do What I Want\\"  2018  rowspan=\\"5\\" High Risk Behaviour - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Pub Feed\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Identity Theft\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Clap\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2020 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Dine N Dash\\" } ===Music videos=== {  + !

The home burned down in 1867. Between 1888 and 1941, the property housed a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and a feed mill. By 1944, the buildings were demolished. ===From Prohibition to cheesemaking (1931-1945)=== Born in Stazzema, Italy in 1886, when Celso Viviani was 24 years old he moved from Italy to Sonoma, California, where his brother lived. Viviani worked at a local quarry and managed a distillery at Sebastiani Vineyards. When Prohibition began, the Sebastiani Vineyards stopped producing wine and Viviani started to make cheese at the now defunct Sonoma Mission Creamery. The Sonoma Mission Creamery was founded by Joseph Vella and John Iacono in 1915. While learning to make cheese, Viviani met Joseph Vella's younger brother, Gaetano \\"Tom\\" Vella. The two men became friends and decided, after their training was complete, to start their own creamery: Sonoma Valley Creamery in 1931. Sonoma Valley Creamery became one of the first companies in Sonoma Valley to only make cheese. The Creamery was located at a former pre-prohibition brewery in downtown Sonoma. Eventually, the name changed from Sonoma Valley Creamery to Sonoma Valley Cheese Factory and finally, the current incarnation: Sonoma Cheese Factory. In its inaugural year, the Factory had $58,000 in sales. The Factory started making hard cheese of the Italian variety. They also produced cottage cheese and cream cheese. Viviani and Vella expanded production, purchasing a production plant in nearby Marin County and one in the state of Oregon. They decided to open a new headquarters in downtown Sonoma in 1944. ===Post-war era (1945-1955)=== Construction of the Sonoma Cheese Factory started in 1944 and was completed by 1945. The building included areas for retail sales, offices and cheese production. The building was designed by Pietro G. Canali, an Italian-American architect. Sonoma Cheese Factory's flagship cheese: Sonoma Jack As the company prepared to open the new facility, Viviani and Vella decided to go their separate ways professionally, with Viviani opening the new facility and Vella eventually founding the Vella Cheese Company at the old Sonoma Valley Creamery building, where the family- owned Vella Cheese Company continues to operate today. During the mid to late 1940s, Sonoma Cheese Factory sold cottage cheese and cream cheese to the Kraft Foods. Eventually, the lack of easy access to fresh milk, due to dairy farm industrialization, caused the Viviani's to focus strictly on semi-hard cheese. It was during this time when they created Sonoma Jack, their most famous cheese. Celso Viviani died in 1955 and his son, Pete Viviani oversaw full operations. ===Late 20th-century (1960-1981)=== The Sonoma Cheese Factory struggled in the 1960s due to supply chain challenges regarding dairy production, which almost caused the company to close. Towards the end of the 1960s, Pete Viviani relocated to Mexico with his family to produce powdered milk and cheese. His son, David Viviani, and business partner Fred Harland operated the Factory. The business saw success again with the expansion of a sandwich shop at Sonoma Valley High School and expanded retail operations at the Factory, which included offering local wines, and they implemented a new marketing campaign for Sonoma Jack cheeses. Pete Viviani returned from Mexico in 1971. Cheese production increased as a result of the increase of tourism in Sonoma Valley. In 1981, they released Sonoma Jack Hot Pepper, the first cheese in California that was made with jalape√±os and crushed red pepper. ===The Sonoma Cheese Factory today=== > ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt been there, go there. It‚Äôs a delightful place with a huge > variety of excellent cheeses and you can watch the cheese-making through big > window.‚Äù - Michele Anna Jordan, Sonoma West Times and News, 1988 Sonoma Cheese Factory in 2008 By the end of 1985, David Vivani served as president and Harland oversaw the cheese plant as general manager. Peter Vivani served as vice president of the company. The Sonoma Cheese Factory had annual sales of $5 million and was distributing their cheese nationwide. The company had 50 employees and produced 3 million pounds of Sonoma Jack annually. The following year, the television program Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous shot an episode in Sonoma. The show's host, Robin Leach toured the town with actor Judith Ledford, including sampling cheese with David Vivani at the Sonoma Cheese Factory. In 2001, listeria was found in a cheese sample at their production facility in Crescent City, California, which stopped production and required production to be relocated to a new facility. The next year the Viviani's split management of the retail operations to Pete Viviani and David Viviani oversaw cheese production. Monterey Gourmet Foods became an 80% stakeholder in Sonoma Cheese Factory in 2005. Since the majority, if not all, of the cheese was no longer being produced at the Sonoma Cheese Factory site in Sonoma, the facility underwent renovations to focus on retail in 2005. In 2012, the Viviani family re-acquired full ownership of the company. The Native Sons of the Golden West placed a plaque on the front exterior of the Sonoma Cheese Factory in 2009 to celebrate the legacy founder Celso Viviani and the Viviani cheese-making family. Pete Viviani died shortly after the dedication in June 2009. Today, the Viviani family continues to own the property and operate the company as part of their Sonoma Creamery brand. The Sonoma Cheese Factory sells their cheese online and at their store. Onsite, they also sell other California cheeses and artisan foods; have a wine store with wine tasting; made-to-order sandwiches; a grill; and an ice cream and dessert parlor. ==Cheese== At its inception, the Sonoma Cheese Factory produced Italian-style hard cheeses and fresh cheeses, specifically cottage and cream cheese. Eventually, production shifted towards semi-hard cheeses, including their flagship cheese: Jack. Made from pasteurized cow milk, the Factory's Jack is a semi-hard cheese. They were the first cheese company in California to make a pepper Jack, which uses jalape√±o and chili flakes for a spicy flavor. Today, they produce other Jack cheeses including garlic, Mediterranean, haba√±ero, chipotle, pesto, smoked, lavender and a mild Cheddar cheese. In 1987, the Sonoma Cheese Factory became the first California cheesemaker to win a medal in the United States Championship Cheese Contest, winning a gold and a bronze medal for their Sonoma Garlic Jack. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Chenel, Laura and Linda Siegfried.
