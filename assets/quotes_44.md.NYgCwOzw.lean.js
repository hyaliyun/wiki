The emotional story shows the boys struggles in life as his grandfather dies and leaves him with his dog. It shows how the hopes of becoming a great classical painter have been seemingly crushed by his grandfathers passing and the way he takes after that tragedy. Production The animators conducted extensive research on 19th century Flanders. Although it has to be said that a lot of features in the series are not Flemish but typically Dutch (the girl's hat and the tulips for example). The buildings depicted in the series were modeled after the Bokrijk open-air museum.. Although there have been some changes from the original story by Marie Louise de la Ramée, it has been faithful in keeping the storyline accurate.

He is the founder of the Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park (now known as the Australia Zoo). He is the father of the late conservationist and television personality Steve Irwin. He continues to campaign for wildlife and its environment through his foundation, Bob Irwin Wildlife and Conservation Foundation Inc. Personal life Robert Irwin was born in Melbourne, Victoria. He married Lyn Hakainsson, a maternity nurse who was killed in a car accident in 2000. Together, they had three children, a daughter, Joy, son Stephen (Steve, who died in a stingray accident in 2006), and a second daughter, Mandy. While Irwin made a living as a plumber, and Lyn as a maternity nurse, the family's consuming passion was rescuing and rehabilitating local wildlife. Steve Irwin, the couple's son, would not only come to fulfill the roles of curator and director of the Beerwah Reptile Park, but also produce and star in his highly popular educational documentary series, The Crocodile Hunter. Steve would enlarge the park to its present size of 76 acres and rename the park the Australia Zoo. Steve Irwin wrote on his website: > What a childhood! My mum was the \\"Mother Teresa\\" of wildlife rehabilitation. > Our house was a giant maternity ward fair smack-dab in the middle of the > Beerwah Reptile Park. It was nothing for us kids to be sharing our house > with orphaned joey kangaroos, sugar gliders, ringtail or brushtail possums, > koala joeys, baby birds and untold amounts of other injured Australian > animals. What a wild menagerie, and an exceptional household to be raised > in. Steve Irwin died in 2006. While filming a documentary, he swam too close to a stingray that pierced his heart with its barb, and Steve died from his injuries and blood loss. Bob has since remarried to Judy, and was Queensland's Grandfather of the Year in 2008. Bob and Judy live on a rural property near Kingaroy, from where Bob continues to campaign for wildlife and environmental conservation through his foundation, Bob Irwin Wildlife & Conservation Foundation Inc. Career Irwin was a successful plumber from Melbourne who, in addition, had also spent time building sheds and houses. His career in animal conservation began in 1970, when Irwin moved his family from Essendon, located west of Melbourne, to Queensland. He had decided to turn his love for animals from a hobby into a career and purchased of land to construct a wildlife refuge. As a builder, Irwin personally turned his hand to building and designing the Beerwah Reptile Park. Irwin dedicated so much time to constructing the Reptile Park and the enclosures that, for the first years in their new life of exhibiting native fauna, the Irwins lived in an old RV caravan. Irwin would build a shed, and then the Irwin house, which the Irwin family and Bob Irwin lived in until Bob gave the wildlife park to his son Steve. \\"The family home was itself a mini zoo and wildlife hospital,\\" said son, Steve Irwin, on his website, \\"With makeshift marsupial 'pouches' slung over the backs of chairs and snakes stashed everywhere. Later, the park would be significantly expanded to cover .\\" Irwin's memoir, The Last Crocodile Hunter: A Father and Son Legacy, was released on 25 October 2016. On 2 March 2008, it was announced that Bob Irwin had resigned from Australia Zoo (the renamed Beerwah Reptile Park) in order to \\"keep his son's dream alive\\". He thanked all the zoo staff for all their support with the notable exception of his daughter-in-law, Terri Irwin, with whom, according to zoo staff and volunteers, Irwin had an ongoing feud over treatment of staff, management of Wildlife Warriors and the commercial direction of the world-famous attraction. Irwin also resigned from his role as manager of Ironbark Station at Blackbutt where he lived, moving to a new property surrounded by forest and national park between Kingaroy and Murgon where he would continue his son's conservation work.Green, Glenis (2 March 2008). \\"Help for Bob Irwin as he retires from Australia Zoo\\". The Sunday Mail (Qld). Innovations Irwin's foresight and innovation in captive care, breeding, and handling of native Australian animals set a new benchmark for wildlife welfare in Australia. Irwin was noted in the conservation sector for utilizing non-violent capture techniques which were then largely unemployed, such as proximity lassoing, hooding, trapping, and netting instead of the more common tranquilizers, chains, or other potentially harmful methods. Irwin would also come to strike bargains with the government, catching problematic or intruding crocodiles in Queensland and in return bringing them to the Reptile Park. Irwin, later aided by son Steve, personally caught and raised every crocodile in the Reptile Park, ultimately tallying over 100 crocodiles. Politics On 1 July 2011, Bob Irwin announced he was considering challenging Labor incumbent Kate Jones and Liberal National Party leader Campbell Newman for the seat of Ashgrove in Brisbane. On 5 September 2011, it was reported that Irwin had become disenchanted with politics and felt he could best carry on his passion for animal conservation and fight against the coal seam gas industry from outside of the political arena. Activism On 12 April 2011, Bob Irwin was arrested and charged for contravening police direction as part of his civil disobedience actions against the Queensland Gas Company.

The curriculum is often referred to as Investigations or simply TERC. Patterned after the NCTM standards for mathematics, it is among the most widely used of the new reform mathematics curricula. As opposed to referring to textbooks and having teachers impose methods for solving arithmetic problems, the TERC program uses a constructivist approach that encourages students to develop their own understanding of mathematics. The curriculum underwent a major revision in 2005–2007.  History  Investigations was developed between 1990 and 1998. It was just one of a number of reform mathematics curricula initially funded by a National Science Foundation grant. The goals of the project raised opposition to the curriculum from critics (both parents and mathematics teachers) who objected to the emphasis on conceptual learning instead of instruction in more recognized specific methods for basic arithmetic.. The goal of the Investigations curriculum is to help all children understand the fundamental ideas of number and arithmetic, geometry, data, measurement and early algebra. Unlike traditional methods, the original edition did not provide student textbooks to describe standard methods or provide solved examples. Instead, students were guided to develop their own invented algorithms through working with concrete representations of number such as manipulatives and drawings as well as more traditional number sentences. Additional activities include journaling, cutting and pasting, interviewing (for data collection) and playing conceptual games. Investigations released its second edition for 2006 that continues its focus on the core value of teaching for understanding. The revised version has further emphasis on basic skills and computation to complement the development of place value concepts and number sense. It is also easier for teachers to use since the format is more user friendly, though some districts have failed to carefully implement the second edition as well, and moved back to textbooks that teach traditional arithmetic methods.  Research  A systematic review of research into Investigations was conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences and published as part of the What Works Clearinghouse in February 2013. This found \\"potentially positive effects\\" on mathematics achievement, supported by a \\"medium to large\\" evidence base.U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, What Works Clearinghouse (2013, February). Elementary School Mathematics intervention report: Investigations in Number, Data, and Space®. Retrieved from http://whatworks.ed.gov. A variety of measures of student achievement and learning including state-mandated standardized tests, research-based interview protocols, items from research studies published in peer-reviewed journals and specially constructed paper- and-pencil tests have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of Investigations Research featured at the TERC website states that students who use Investigations, among other things, 'do as well or better than students using other curricula.' To support the assertion that children do better when they are not taught traditional arithmetic, Anne Goodrow, in her PhD thesis at Tufts University, compared subtraction strategies of students taught traditional methods with those who used constructivist methods with Investigations curriculum. Although negative numbers are not taught in the 2nd grade, \\"constructivist\\" student subtracting 9 from 28 explains that \\"8 minus 9 equals negative 1\\" and then argues that \\"-1 plus 20 is the same as 20-1 and equals 19.\\" On the basis of this, and of the average score of this group of 10 students, the author concluded that \\"although they did not receive instruction in the use of the standard algorithms, the children in the Constructivist group were the most successful at both two-digit addition and subtraction.\\" Many research reports demonstrating the success of the program are criticized by opponents of this curriculum as having poor methodology or for being conducted by the publisher. NSF-sponsored curricula are required to conduct and report such studies, something that is not required of traditional mathematics textbooks. See also a recent study conducted with the revised edition, for more evidence of efficacy. Some school districts report their own data about success with the program.  Criticism  Investigations initially was commercially successful. But parents and math educators have criticized its lack of traditional arithmetic content, of decimal math, of multiplication tables, of division and multiplication of fractions, or even of addition and subtraction of ordinary fractions apart from a small subset, its emphasis on \\"kindergarten activities\\" (cutting, folding, taping, etc.) in class and homework, its lack of a traditional textbook; its incompatibility with high- school and international mathematics methods; its non-traditional homework assignments; its high cost (a concern mainly of home-schooling parents); and other factors. A common complaint is that the curriculum does not teach any of traditional arithmetic methods familiar to those taught in other nations and to parents with as little as an elementary-school education. The critics assert that \\"the TERC computational methods are cumbersome, inefficient, and only work for carefully selected simple problems\\" and that \\"conscious thought is regularly required for both TERC method selection and TERC method execution\\" even at the simplest levels, thus precluding automaticity and the ability to focus conscious thought on higher-level cognitive tasks later on. TERC defenders' response is that the traditional arithmetic methods familiar to Americans are not necessarily those used in other nations. Research has shown that students are capable of developing algorithms that are as correct, efficient, and generalizable as the \\"standard\\" algorithms. A common parent complaint is that there is no recognizable arithmetic and that homework is frequent and very time-consuming, with some tasks requiring help from family members and cutting, pasting, and coloring, whereas a traditional worksheet may take little time. Other critics claim that there is not enough homework, and children should simply be given a procedure and told to practice it on a large number of exercises. Non-traditional materials and content * Student materials included in the 2002 Grade 5 package for TERC Investigations: 4 rolls of adding machine tape; 36 blank 5/8\\" cubes; 1,000 stickers for blank cubes; 200 1-cm cubes; 16 transparent blank spinners; 4 450-piece sets of power polygons; 4 buckets of square color tiles (400 per bucket); 1,000 Snap(TM) cubes; 1 set of elementary bar mass set-Ohaus; 4 graduated measuring prisms (2-cm x 5-cm x 21-cm); 4-liter measuring pitcher (calibrated 100 ml - 1,000 ml); 4 spectrum school balance (includes 7-piece mass set); 4 sets standard measuring pitchers (3 pitchers: quart, pint, cup per set); 10 measuring tapes; 12 meter/yard sticks. *The total package for Grade 5 is listed at $1,388.42, and within that total the cost of the just mentioned student materials, for a class of 32, is $817.00 Reviews of TERC Many mathematics classrooms where active learning occurs already own many of these materials, so it is not necessary to purchase all of these items from the publisher. * In the original edition, there was no multiplication table presented. Instead, students were instructed to color-code multiples of numbers on a 100s chart and evaluate these charts to find common multiples and patterns. * There is no formal presentation of decimal addition. Students are instructed to begin by using colored pencils on 10,000 grid chart. The addition of decimals is related to students' work with whole number addition, with attention paid to place values so that students understand the reasoning behind lining up decimal points. * Students are not instructed to compute an average by \\"adding up the items, and dividing by the number of items\\" because it is judged to be too complex for students of some groups to justify. Instead, the teacher is given a chapter on different ways to compute the median. Students using this curriculum could easily perform the calculation. It is important, however, to develop the underlying reasoning along with the procedure, which is done further into the data module rather than at the beginning. * Students who demonstrate knowledge of a standard method of calculation are encouraged to demonstrate at least one other method of calculation, in order to demonstrate a complete understanding of the operation and numbers involved. Students who are later taught 'standard' methods can be ready to compare and contrast methods, and be able to flexibly move among their options. * Students are asked to compute the volume of a rectangular solid. They are do not immediately use and are not told the standard formula of length multiplied by width and height. This formula, which is the formula given on standardized tests such as the SAT, is developed as a connection to previous work with multiplication, area, and the associative property. Parody The textbook series has been parodied by the on-line cartoon series \\"Weapons of Math Destruction\\", including one panel of a student declaring that he can't finish his homework because they have run out of glue, or writing two different ways to determine if 2 is even or odd, and explaining the answer. Adoptions An incomplete listing of school districts that have adopted TERC materials * Bellevue School District adopted it for 10 years, dropped in favor of Math Expressions as \\"outdated and inefficient\\" for 2008.Bellevue Reporter March 22, 2008 * Stillwater School District * Ridgewood Public Schools * Seattle School District. Dropped in favor of Everyday Mathematics in 2007-08. * Reading City Schools (Cincinnati, OH) * Frederick County Public Schools (Maryland), dropped in 2011 * State College Area School District (State College, PA) * Prince William County, VA Public Schools In 2009, a coalition of parents in Prince William County, VA sponsored a study of those districts cited in 2007 by Pearson publishing as having successfully adopted TERC Investigations. They found that many of these districts either had dropped the curriculum or were supplementing it with other materials. They consolidated and published their findings in 2009. This list is indeed incomplete; there are hundreds of districts using this curriculum.

It takes its title from a 1982 exploitation film - La Morte Vivante - from Jean Rollin The line, \\"Who is this irresistible creature who has an insatiable love for the dead?\\" in the beginning of the song is from the trailer of the film Lady Frankenstein. The music in the beginning of the song is taken from the trailer of the Wes Craven film, The Last House on the Left. The spoken words \\"What are you thinking about?/The same thing you are\\" at the beginning of the verses are taken from the 1971 film Daughters of Darkness (a dialogue between the characters played by Delphine Seyrig and Andrea Rau). In this song, Zombie sings, \\"Goldfoot's machine creates another fiend so beautiful they make you kill\\". This relates to the villain played by Vincent Price in the 1965 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and the 1966 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. Also, he sings \\"Operation Filth they love to love the wealth of an SS whore making scary sounds.\\" This is possibly a reference to the notorious 1974 film Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS. The song also appears on Rob Zombie's Past, Present & Future, the greatest hits album The Best of Rob Zombie, and a remix is contained on American Made Music to Strip By. The original mix was featured in both Bride of Chucky and Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, appearing on the album of the latter, the \\"Naked Exorcism Remix\\" appeared on The Crow: Salvation Soundtrack in 2000. The song was covered by Sinus Giddy for The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie in 2002. Also a version of the song is played in a club in the TV show Angel, while the character Faith tears apart a dance club. The sleeve for the CD single features an image of Rob Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon. A trance remix of the song also featured on the English trailer for the film Day Watch in late 2007. Music video The music video for \\"Living Dead Girl\\" derives its imagery from Robert Wiene's 1920 silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with Zombie in the role of The Doctor (played by Werner Krauss in the original film) and Sheri Moon in the place of The Living Dead Girl, whose appearance is inspired from the character White Zombie from White Zombie (in the original film a somnambulist named Cesare played by Conrad Veidt). The video imitates the appearance of aged, silent films, using intertitles and artificially grainy and herky-jerky images. Like Caligari, it also uses black and white film that has been tinted sepia, aqua and violet for Expressionistic effect. The video was directed by both Joseph Kahn and Rob Zombie.

Succession matters prior to the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 could be contentious, especially during the Ayutthaya period from the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1924, King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) attempted to clarify the succession process by laying down the Palace Law of Succession. It was promulgated and came into effect in November 1924 as, in part, an attempt to eliminate the vagueness relating to succession within the Thai monarchical regime and to systematically resolve previous controversies. In 1932, after Siam became a constitutional monarchy, various amendments relating to succession were introduced. The 1997 Constitution of Thailand relied on the law with regards to succession, but the 2006 Interim Constitution made no mention of succession, leaving it to \\"constitutional practice.\\" The 2007 Constitution again relied on the Palace Law. The preamble of the 2014 interim constitution of Thailand abrogated the 2007 Constitution, with the exception of chapter 2, concerning the monarchy and the succession.  Background  The original Palace Law of A.D. 1360 relating to succession since Ayutthaya Kingdom period (1351–1767) did not lay out a clear system for determining a successor upon the death of a king. Rather, it provided a frame of reference from which the next king could be chosen. Typically, the new king would be either the late king's son born of a major queen or consort (; ), or one of his brothers.Voraporn Pupongpunt (2005) \\"Phap Luk Sataban Kasat Nai Kot Monthien Ban\\" (The Image of the Monarchical Institution Through Palace Law), Bangkok: Thailand Research Fund p. 211. The Law also provided rules by which someone who was neither a son nor a brother of the deceased king could accede to the throne, should the situation or circumstances require it.This could occur, for instance, when the god Indra provided such person with \\"the quintet of royal objects\\", or when someone sought out came from a rich Brahman family or possessed high abilities in warfare, Voraporn, p. 212. Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke However, the Palace Law was not always followed and did not ensure smooth successions. At least one third of Ayutthaya's royal successions involved bloodshed. Indeed, the history of the kingdom at that time is a chronicle of frequent usurpations and of ambitious men thwarting the final wishes of recently departed kings. Historian David K. Wyatt observed that \\"virtually all successions to the throne of Ayutthaya in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were, at the least, irregular, and in many cases either disguised or real usurpations.\\"David Wyatt (1984) \\"Thailand: A Short History\\", New Haven and London: Yale University Press. Buddha Loetla Nabhalai King Taksin (reigned 1767–1782) established himself as King of Siam by right of conquest. He, however, alienated the ecclesiastical support to secure the legitimacy of his reign, and was overthrown in a palace coup. His chief military commander, then on an expedition to enforce recognition of his friend and king by the current ruler of Cambodia, hastened to the rescue. When apprised of the full seriousness of situation, however, he concurred in the overthrow and founded the Royal House of Chakri as King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (later styled Rama I, reigned 1782–1809.) He next established the office of the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. Then, following the precedent of the newly crowned King Wareru of the 13th century, the newly crowned king of Siam commissioned scholars to collect and revise laws from the Ayutthaya era. The Code of Wareru is reflected in successive codes, but the Siamese went beyond it to establish a true code of laws. The Palace Law was a constituent part of this new legal compendium called The Three Seals Code, which was needed, Rama I said, because old laws were often misinterpreted and this led to injustice. Succession under the Three Seals Code took into account the potential of the next king to be, as prescribed by ancient Buddhist texts, a dhammaraja (righteous king). This was manifested in his upholding of the Ten Virtues of Kingship. Lineage, however, still played a very important role. Jessadabodindra/Nangklao All of the transfers of power in the Royal House of Chakri that followed the introduction of the Three Seals Code were accomplished with almost no bloodshed – although they were not without some complications.At the time of Rama I's death, a succession plot was uncovered that led to the execution of 40 people, including the contender for the throne, a son of King Taksin, and all of his male offspring. B.J. Terwiel (2011) \\"Thailand's Political History\\", Bangkok: River Books, p. 101. In part, greater adherence to the idea that the wisest and most capable possible successor should be chosen has tempered the eight successions of the Royal House of Chakri during the Rattanakosin (Bangkok) era. At a special council of senior members of royalty and officials, it was agreed that King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai or Rama II (reigned 1809–1824) should succeed his father.Terwiel, p. 101. After the death of Rama II in 1824, a grand assembly of the royal family, high officers of state and members of the Buddhist monkhood led by the supreme patriarch was convened. The assembly chose a son born of Rama II and a royal consort, a prince who had a proven record, over the king's much younger and less experienced half-brother, Prince Mongkut, who had recently been ordained as a monk. Although as the son of a full queen, Prince Mongkut might have had a superior claim to the throne in terms of lineage, he remained in the temple. This averted a potential succession crisis and any conflict with King Nangklao or Rama III (reigned 1824–1851).Wyatt, pp. 166–167. Mongkut The nuances of all this were beyond the understanding of many European observers raised in the presumably less complicated tradition of primogeniture, in which the oldest male heir always succeeds by right of lineage. In the eyes of some Westerners, it appeared that new king had usurped the throne. Later, Rama III's own succession nearly became a crisis. As his health continued to deteriorate in 1851 following months of fruitless discussions about possible successors, the heir to the throne remained unnamed. A foreign observer of the time recounted that: \\"All parties concerning the question of the succession were preparing themselves with arms and troops for self-defence and resistance.\\" Before they could come to blows, \\"there was convened at the king's palace ... a meeting of all the princes, nobles, and chief rulers of the land to confer on the all engrossing question of who shall become the successor to the present king.\\"Letter by D.B. Bradley, dated 28 March 1851, to the Singapore Strait Times, as quoted in Terwiel, p. 147. One of the possible successors to the throne was Prince Mongkut again. Over the 27 years of Rama III's reign, the royal monk had become the leader of a Buddhist reform order. When considering his heir, Rama III had reportedly expressed reservations about the princes who might succeed him. If Prince Mongkut became king, Rama III feared he might order the Sangha (community of monks) to dress in the style of the [Buddhist] Mons.Terwiel, p. 143. To assuage such doubts, Prince Mongkut wrote a letter to the assembly to make his own case for succeeding to the throne. He also ordered monks in his order to discontinue any practices considered unorthodox or foreign. According to historian David K. Wyatt, who cites an account given by Prince Mongkut to American missionary Dan Beach Bradley about two weeks before Rama III died, the assembly resolved to protect the claims to the throne of Prince Mongkut and his talented younger brother, Prince Chudamani. As it came to pass, when Rama III passes away, Prince Mongkut becomes king Rama IV, reigned 1851–1868, and Prince Chudamani was elevated to the office and residence of Front Palace as Phra Pinklao (or Pin Klao) with equal honor to the King (as was the case with Naresuan and Ekatotsarot.) In English, the office is called \\" Uparaja, \\"Vice King\\" or \\"Second King\\", with Mongkut preferring the latter. In the Chakri dynasty, there were three previous holders of the office – Maha Sakdi Polsep, Maha Senanurak and Isarasundhorn. The latter was the only Chakri Front Palace to succeed as king, as Rama II. Chulalongkorn King Mongkut left the position of second king open after Phra Pinklao died in 1865.Terwiel, p. 167. If King Mongkut had named a replacement second king, the throne could have passed to that person rather than one of his sons. When King Mongkut died in 1868, the Great Council was assembled again. It selected 15-year-old Prince Chulalongkorn, the oldest son of King Mongkut, and Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse, a leading member of the powerful Bunnag family, was appointed regent. The council also named the son of the former second king, Prince Yodyingyot (1838–1885, later known as Prince Bovorn Vichaichan), as the uparatTerwiel, p. 180. (ancient title for \\"vice king.\\") Vajiravudh As uparat, Prince Yodyingyot, who resided in the Front Palace previously occupied by his father, Phra Pinklao, had 2,000 of his own troops and modern military equipment. In the Front Palace crisis of 1875, the troops of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, reigned 1868–1910) and Prince Yodyingyot nearly clashed when it appeared that the latter was challenging the throne. Prince Yodyingyot sought refuge in the British consulate and, after lengthy negotiations, his troops were disarmed and the prince allowed to return to the Front Palace.Terwiel, p. 193. When Prince Yodyingyout died in 1885, King Chulalongkorn discontinued the Front Palace and uparat system entirely.Nuer glao chao Thai (2006) (book from the Exhibition to Commemorate the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of Bhumibol Adulyadej's Accession), Bangkok: Reed Tradex, p. 49. A year later, King Chulalongkorn elevated the oldest, full- blooded prince among his sons, Prince Vajirunhis (1878–1895) to the position of Crown Prince (; ). The investiture came well ahead of any expected succession. It was not surprising that the king at this time should choose a modified system of primogeniture to designate his heir apparent. A succession crisis might have left Siam vulnerable to interference from predatory, encroaching Western colonial powers.JSS Vol. 82.0 1994: Dean Meyers. \\"Siam under siege (1893–1902): modern Thailand's decisive decade, from the Paknam incident to the first flowering of the Chakri reformation\\". Martin Stuart-Fox. \\"Conflicting conceptions of the state: Siam, France and Vietnam in the late nineteenth century\\" As Wyatt noted: \\"By 1910 [the year of King Chulalongkorn's death] the Siamese had abandoned the old rules of succession to the throne and had adopted the Western pattern of designating the heir to the throne long in advance.\\"Wyatt, p. 224. The accession of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, reigned 1910–1925) was the least problematic succession in the history of the Royal House of Chakri up to that point. After the premature death of Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis, his younger half brother, Prince Vajiravudh was invested as crown prince in 1895 and, upon the death of his father King Chulalongkorn, acceded to the throne. Based on his own experience as heir, King Vajiravudh knew that his father had wanted to institute a more ordered system of succession on the basis of primogeniture which unequivocally designated a crown prince. During his reign, he set the precedent for numbering Kings of Thailand as \\"Rama\\" by styling himself as Phra Ram thi Hok (.) Rama VI, however, was unable to produce a male heir and, as a result, succession became an issue again. Of the 77 children fathered by King Chulalongkorn, only seven sons born of queens survived beyond 1910, In the early 1920s, two of King Vajiravudh's three full brothers died. By the end of 1925, only the youngest brother, Prince Prajadhipok, was still alive. As a result, Wyatt writes that, \\"the problem of succession to the throne came to prominence rather suddenly in the last few years of the reign\\". This situation provided important impetus for drafting the Palace Law of Succession or kot monthian ban wa duai kan suep santatiwong in 1924. This law which continues to provide the framework for succession today, confirmed the primacy of the lineage of King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha, as well as the king's sole and authentic right to choose his successor. It also made the determination of succession as legally precise and binding as possible.Wyatt, pp. 233–234.  Details of succession  In the first section, King Vajiravudh states that \\"according to royal tradition, Siamese Kings have the sole power and prerogative to designate any descendant of the royal family as heir to the throne\\".The version of this law comes from the Council of State website. Translation of some articles was provided by an undated, unpublished version provided to a foreign journalist. All other articles are translated by David Streckfuss. Explaining why this new law was needed, King Vajiravudh wrote: > \\"But as it has been in the past, and could be in the future, the king cannot > name his own successor ... resulting in troubling events ... When kings have > died, the vying for royal power has opened an opportunity for persons ... > who have been obstructive to the prosperity of the kingdom. It has also been > the opportunity for enemies, both internal and external, to think of doing > harm to the royal family and the freedom of Siam. [Such situation] has > brought disaster to the Thai nation. The king has thus desired to have a law > determining succession in order to reduce the trouble of contending [for the > throne] within the royal family.\\" According to King Vajiravudh, it was his father's intention to bring Thai royal successions into closer line with those of other nations. The important principles established by the law concern the king's right to name or remove an heir apparent, the procedures to be used if the king has not named an heir apparent, and also a description of the suitable characteristics for an heir to the throne. The reigning king has absolute power to name any royal male as heir apparent, and upon being announced publicly, the \\"position of such heir is secure and indisputable\\": * Section 5 – The king has the sole power and prerogative to designate any descendant of the royal family as heir to the throne, depending on his judgement and trust placed on the ability of the said person to succeed him. * Section 6 – Once the king has designated the heir to the throne and has had such designation proclaimed to members of the royal family, officials and the public at large, the position of such heir is secure and indisputable. When the necessary time comes, the said heir shall immediately ascend the throne to succeed the late king in accordance with the latter's wish. The king also has absolute power to remove an heir apparent from the position. If he does so, \\"his entire lineage is removed from any claim to the throne\\": * Section 7 – The king has the sole power and prerogative to remove the heir to the throne from his position. Anyone who has been removed from the position of heir to the throne shall be considered as broken from [excluded from] any claim to succession and his name shall be removed from the line of succession. His sons and his entire lineage of direct descendants shall also be excluded from the line of succession. The king has the sole power and prerogative to exclude any member of the royalty from the line of succession. * Section 8 and 9 lay out the processes by which a new king is determined when the king dies with no heir designated. In such case, the chief state official is to invite the first in line of succession to be king. Section 9 was set out \\"to clear any doubt\\" as to \\"the order in the line of succession\\", delineated down to 13 levels. Below are the first six levels: ** The first-born son of the king and queen; ** The first-born son of the said prince and his royal consort; ** Younger sons, in order, of the said prince and his royal consort; ** The second-born son of the king and queen when the first-born son is deceased and has no male children; ** The first-born son of the second-born son of the king and queen if the second-born son is deceased; ** Younger sons, in order, of the second-born son [and so on]. While Section 9 ranks those eligible for kingship, the law's next set of clause entitled, \\"On those who must be excluded from the line of succession\\", describes what might disqualify a potential heir to the throne. * Section 10 addresses members of royalty in the line of succession who may be unsuitable to accede. This Section is not really so much a law as a piece of advice. It states: > \\"Whoever is to ascend to the throne should be one from the masses fully > respect and can be contentedly taken as their protector. Therefore any > member of the royalty whom the multitude holds as loathsome, such person > should forswear the path to succession in order to remove the worry from the > king and the people from the realm.\\" * Section 11 states: \\"Descendants of the royal family with any of the following characters shall be excluded from the line of succession: ** Insanity; ** Convicted of a serious crime under the law; ** Unable to serve as Upholder of Buddhism; ** Married to a foreign consort, i.e. a woman whose nationality is originally not Thai; ** Being removed from the position of heir to the throne regardless of during which reign such removal took place; ** Being proclaimed to be excluded from the line of succession. The last exclusion, Section 13, pertains to accession by a princess: * Section 13 – As it is deemed to be untimely for a princess to ascend the throne as a sole sovereign of Siam, inclusion of princesses in the line of succession shall be categorically prohibited. Other points in the law provide guidance for when the new king is a minor under 20 years of age (a member of the royalty is to be named as regent and the two most senior privy councillors are to act as advisers). Procedures were also put in place for future kings to amend the law. They are advised to keep in mind that the law was written to strengthen the dynasty, and that amendments required approval from two-thirds of the Privy Council. Prajadhipok The 1924 Palace Law of Succession was put into effect the following year with the accession of King Prajadhipok (Rama VII, reigned 1925–1935). He had never been groomed for the throne, nor had he ever expected to accede or aspired to doing so. He had spent most of his adult life in military schools (Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in England and L'École Supérieure de Guerre in France) and had only returned to Siam in 1924. When his older brother died late the following year, he was at the top of the succession list and became Siam's last absolute monarch.Wyatt, pp. 234–235; Terwiel, p. 251. Although the Palace Law on Succession worked in 1925, there remained some underlying problems. King Prajadhipok wrote in 1926 that the law still embodied the two distinct and rather contradictory principles that had long characterized succession in Siam: \\"the principle of election and the principle of hereditary succession\\". For example, if the king did not designate his own successor, the throne was to go to one of his sons. King Prajadhipok remarked, \\"This sounded straightforward enough, but a complication arises here owing to the habit of polygamy.\\" The law specified that the next king was to be chosen according to the rank of his mother, the queen. But there were four ranks of queen, and this arrangement was complicated by the fact that the rank of a queen could either be raised or lowered \\"according to the whims of the king\\". Thus several people could still make competitive claims to the throne. King Prajadhipok observed: \\"This, to my mind, creates very great possibilities of complications.\\"Sathaban Phrapokklao, Phaen Pattana Kanmuang, op cit, p. 168. In addition, he was not convinced that the flexibility in the law, which allowed for a monarch to choose a successor who would please the people, could be properly applied.  Historical practice  The Saovabha branch, circa 1900 (from left to right: Prince Asdang, Crown Prince Vajiravudh, Prince Chakrabongse, Queen Saovabha, Prince Prajadhipok, and Prince Chudadhuj) On 11 November 1924, King Vajiravudh amended the Palace Law outlining a list of succession which adhered strictly to the Rules of Primogeniture, clearly stating that the son of a deceased heir would have precedence over the younger brother of his late father. This followed the European concept of primogeniture with added difference that whilst in Europe all male offspring would have their place in the line of succession, in Thailand rights of succession are only to be found in the male offspring who are descended from the King by royal consorts. King Vajiravudh also clearly outlines the various groups of consorts and grants rights of succession to their descendants in order of the seniority of the title of the consort – that is, the descendants of a consort of the first rank come before those of a consort of the second rank in the list of succession, and so on. The system applies equally to his own reign as to all previous and future reigns of the Chakri Dynasty. Thus, if the line of the reigning King fails, on his death one searches amongst the line of his predecessor for an heir, and if that line has failed, amongst the line of his predecessor. Rights of succession are thus clearly vested in all lines of descent from King Rama I through a King and a royal consort. Whilst no specific reference is made to the individual consorts of each reign by name, the interpretation of the list of succession with reference to the Royal Family in 1924 is that the descendants of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) by Queen Saovabha Phongsri (1864–1919) have rights above those of his descendants by Queen Savang Vadhana (1862–1955), and those of Queen Savang Vadhana above those of Queen Sukhumala Marasri (1861–1927), etc. King Chulalongkorn fathered a total of 77 children of which there were 32 sons (however a lesser number survived into adulthood) by 4 different queens and 32 consorts but most of them were born of non-royal wives or Chao Chom Manda. Between the 1910s and 1920s, there were only seven sons born of three principal queens with princely rank of Chao Fa (Thai: เจ้าฟ้า; \\"sky lord\\" or \\"celestial prince\\") as follows:- * 5 princes by Queen Saovabha Phongsri ** Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh (Rama VI, 1881–1925 reigned 1910–1925) had one daughter by his consort, Princess Suvadhana *** Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda (1925–2011) ** Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath (1883–1920) had one son by his Russian wife, Mom Catherine Na Phitsanulok (née Catherine/Ekaterina \\"Katya\\" Ivanovna Desnitskaya) *** Prince Chula Chakrabongse (1908–1963) ** Prince Asdang Dejavudh (1889–1925) ** Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok (1892–1923) had one son by a commoner maid *** Prince Varananda Dhavaj (1922–1990) ** Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej (Rama VII, 1893–1941 reigned 1925–1935) had no issue * 1 prince by Queen Savang Vadhana ** Prince Mahidol Adulyadej (1892–1929) had two sons by his commoner and royally-recognized wife, Mom Sangwan (later known as The Princess Mother) *** Prince Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII; 1925–1946 reigned 1935–1946) *** Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX; 1927–2016 reigned 1946–2016) ****Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn (Rama X; born 1952 and reigning from 2016) * 1 prince by Queen Sukhumala Marasri ** Prince Paribatra Sukhumbandhu (1881–1944) had two sons *** Prince Chumbhotbongs Paribatra (1904–1959) by a royal wife *** Prince Sukhumabhinanda (1923–2003) by a commoner wife During the reign of King Vajiravudh, two of his full brothers, Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok and Prince Asdang Dejavudh died in 1923 and 1925 respectively. Another brother and heir presumptive, Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath died in 1920 not long after divorcing his Russian wife, Katya. Their only son, Prince Chula Chakrabongse, was excluded from the succession because his mother was a foreigner under Section 11 (4) of the 1924 Palace Law. While Prince Varananda Dhavaj, only son of Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok from a morganatic union, was considered, by royal discretion, ineligible to the throne. According to the Palace Law, Prince Prajadhipok, the only surviving full brother of King Vajiravudh via bloodline of Queen Saovabha Phongsri, was then the next in line to the throne. Prince Mahidol Adulyadej became second in line (although older than Prince Prajadhipok, he was son of Queen Savang Vadhana). Third and fourth in line would be his two sons: Prince Ananda Mahidol and Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej. Last in line would have been Prince Paribatra Sukhumbandhu, only son of Queen Sukhumala Malasri, although this was unlikely given he had been exiled in the Siamese revolution of 1932. The law based on the principle of male primogeniture, with first in line being the eldest son of the previous monarch and second in line being the next-oldest son, and so on. The law expressly ruled against women ascending the throne (this clause was abrogated in the 1997 Constitution). This line of succession was followed when King Vajiravudh died on 26 November 1925, with Prince Prajadhipok succeeding as King Rama VII. Neither King Vajiravudh nor his successor had sons. The latter was childless while the former's only offspring was a daughter, who was born two days before his death and was excluded from the line of succession under Section 13 of the Palace Law. The absolute monarchy was overthrown on 24 June 1932 and the king was placed within a constitutional framework, but the new constitution continued to rely on the Palace Law regarding matters of succession. Many of the 18 constitutions that have followed since 1932 contain provisions concerning succession and all of them have affirmed that choosing an heir apparent is a prerogative of the king. In the absence of a designated heir, these constitutions generally left the questions of succession up to the Privy Council or members of the royal family working under the 1924 Palace Law of Succession. In 1935 when King Prajadhipok abdicated without designating an heir, the cabinet took five days to consider possible successors within the Royal House of Chakri bloodline before setting upon Prince Ananda Mahidol, the eldest heir of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej. This choice followed the 1924 Law of Succession and was also approved by the National Assembly. No debate was needed when the unmarried young King Ananda Mahidol died unexpectedly on 9 June 1946. His younger brother, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej, was undisputed heir and succeeded to the throne, reigning until his death on 13 October 2016.  The law today  The 1997 constitution of Thailand, like most preceding Thai constitutions, continued to rely on the Palace Law with regards to succession. However, the 2006 Interim Constitution does not contain any articles regarding succession, and instead, left it to \\"constitutional practice.\\" Sections 22 and 23 of the 2007 Constitution dealing with succession again relied on the Palace Law. King Bhumibol Adulyadej officially appointed Prince Vajiralongkorn, his eldest and only son, as Crown Prince and successor on 28 December 1972. The Thai constitution was amended in 1974 to allow the Privy Council to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, if the monarch had not previously appointed a successor. This change made for the possibility of an eventual female succession in the absence of male heir (something not hitherto allowed for). These rights of succession of a female are strictly defined and apply only to the daughters of a king, and may only come into effect following the approval of the legislative assembly. However this would definitely occur in the absence of a royally appointed successor. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the 1997 \\"People's Constitution\\" and 2007 Constitution, and Section 21 of the 2017 Constitution. > \\"In the case where the throne becomes vacant and the king has not appointed > his heir under paragraph one, the Privy Council shall submit the name of > successor to the throne under Section 22 to the Council of Ministers > [cabinet] for further submission to the National Assembly for approval. For > this purpose, the name of a princess may be submitted. Upon the approval of > the National Assembly, the president of the National Assembly shall invite > such successor to ascend the throne and proclaim such successor king.\\" Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the Palace Law of Succession the sole prerogative of the reigning King. According to Gothom Arya, former Election Commissioner, this allows the reigning king, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the Throne. The Palace Law of Succession, the Constitutions of Thailand, and the appointment of Prince Vajiralongkorn as successor in 1972 left nothing uncertain about the succession - upon the death of King Rama IX, the Cabinet was legally bound to inform the president of the National Assembly, which was in turn legally bound to invite Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn to become king.This is very carefully described in Roger Kershaw, Monarchy in South-East Asia: The faces of tradition in transition (London and New York: Routledge, 2001), pp. 152–3. On the evening of 13 October 2016, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha announced \\"Dear Thai people, His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Ninth of His Dynasty, has passed away. Long live His Majesty the King of the New Reign.\\" Parliament was scheduled for a meeting at 9 pm, and some news outlets assumed that this meant that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn would be proclaimed King. Parliament met at 9:30 pm. An announcement was made about the death of the King. The members of the National Legislative Assembly (NLA) stood for 9 minutes of silence. The president of the NLA announced that the National Legislative Assembly would execute section 23 of the 2007 Constitution and the Palace Law, but he did not specify when. The parliamentary session was closed at 9:45 pm. At 9:40 pm, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha announced that earlier in the evening, he had been granted an audience with Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who told him he would like to take some time to grieve before accepting the invitation to become the new king, and that in the meantime he would undertake the royal duties of the Crown Prince. \\"Right now we have no king,\\" said Peerasak Porjit, vice president of the National Legislative Assembly on 14 October. \\"So, all of the royal duties of a king must be done through the regent.\\" He confirmed that General Prem Tinsulanonda, President of the Privy council, was regent indefinitely, in accordance with the Constitution. Some succession law experts have expressed puzzlement at the lack of succession. On 1 December 2016, after 50 days has passed since the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn granted an audience to Prayut Chan-o-cha the Prime Minister, Pornpetch Wichitcholchai the President of the National Legislative Assembly (NLA), and Prem Tinsulanonda the Regent pro tempore at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall in Dusit Palace and accepted an invitation to ascend the throne from the President of the NLA in order to \\"fulfill the royal intentions of the late King for the benefit and happiness of all Thais\\". He was proclaimed as King Rama X in the name of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun.

Epworth began as a Methodist training camp on the shores of Lake Michigan.

It houses the Marietta Museum of History on its second and third floors. The building is west of the town square, adjacent to the CSX (originally Western and Atlantic Railroad) tracks. History The Kennesaw House was built in 1845, making it one of Marietta's oldest buildings. Intended to be a cotton warehouse, the building was turned into the Fletcher House hotel in 1855 after it was purchased by Dix Fletcher. The Fletcher as it was called was where the Great Locomotive Chase began. While some may claim it started in Big Shanty (now Kennesaw), it began at the Fletcher House. James Andrews, a civilian working with the Union Army, made his way down to Marietta along with disguised Union soldiers in April 1862. On the night of April 11, Andrews and some of the men spent the night at the Fletcher House. A historic reproduction of what the room may have looked like has been re-created at the Marietta Museum of History, in the room that the men supposedly slept. The men, along with their leader James Andrews boarded the train on April 12 with the rest of the passengers. The Kennesaw House was one of the only buildings in Marietta not burned to the ground during William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, partly because Fletcher was a Mason, and his son-in-law was a Union spy. The building, like many others on the Marietta square was converted to a war hospital for the confederate army. Many wounded soldiers were transported to Marietta after the battle of Antietam which was the bloodiest battle in Georgia. In 1920, the first floor was renovated and converted to retail shops. In 1979, the entire building was renovated. The renovation included removing the white facade from the building to expose the original brickwork while completely demolishing the interior. The few original parts of the building are the wooden staircases and some of the fireplaces. The 1979 renovation saw the top two floors were converted into offices, with the bottom being the Brickworks restaurant. Finally, in 1996, the Marietta Museum of History assumed occupancy of the second floor then took over the third floor after the Junior League and Southern Baseball Federation left. The second floor features the Museum's exhibits and Museum Store along with some staff offices. The third floor contains the collections storage and the rest of the staff offices. The recent acquisition of the first floor has allowed the Museum to create a new community and event space with the future having the Museum Store and staff offices being relocated to the first floor as well.

Much of the south side of the island is underdeveloped and retains more of the rural feel that predominated on the island before it was settled by the British. The park extends to Wan Chai Gap on the north. The 4.23 square kilometre country park opened in 1931. Like other country parks of Hong Kong, Aberdeen is based on land surrounding reservoirs, in this case the Upper and Lower Reservoirs. The reservoirs were completed in 1932. Designated in 1977, Aberdeen Country Park is one of the oldest country parks in Hong Kong. The scenery of the park can be appreciated from Peak Road and Guildford Road. Geology This is essentially an area of volcanic rocks of the Repulse Bay Formation formed during the Lower and Middle Jurassic Period. Vegetation As in Tai Tam Country Park, most of the trees in the Aberdeen Country Park area suffered ravages during the Second World War and the Japanese occupation. The now well-shaded woods are mainly the result of post war re-afforestation as well as natural regeneration of many of the broad-leafed species. The dominant trees in the park are the Brisbane box, schima, gordonia, ivy tree and rose myrtle. Wildlife The woods in the area are frequented by birds, and are especially a favourite of the black-eared kite which can be seen flying around the two reservoirs. Other birds frequenting the area are the greater coucal, hwamei, magpie-robin, magpie, crested mynah and kingfisher. Occasionally visitors may also catch a glimpse of the pangolin or squirrel.

Description Dorsal patterning of the Northern Barred Frog The Northern barred frog is a large frog, reaching a maximum length of 10 centimetres. It has powerful legs and arms, with a large head and large eyes. It has a brown or copper dorsal surface with irregular, darker blotches along the middle of its back. A dark line runs from the snout, through the eye, and over the tympanum to the top of the shoulder. Like all frogs of the genus Mixophyes, the Northern barred frog has bars running across its legs. The toes are fully webbed, the fingers are unwebbed, and the tympanum is visible. Ecology and behaviour The Northern barred frog inhabits dense tropical rainforest, close to fast-flowing streams. It usually hides and hunts in leaf litter. Like Mixophyes iteratus and Mixophyes fasciolatus, this species lays its eggs on the banks of streams. Rain then washes them into the stream where the tadpoles hatch. The tadpoles are very large, reaching a length of 12.5 centimetres. The male will call high from the bank, with a deep \\"wahk\\" noise.

It is located less than one kilometre (3,000 feet) from the Blue Line with Lebanon. In its population was . History Mandatory period In 1920, Saliha was designated part of Lebanon under the auspices of the Franco-British Boundary Agreement. It was one of 24 villages transferred to British control in 1924 following the 1923 demarcation of the border between the British Mandate for Palestine and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. It thus formed part of the British Mandate of Palestine. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Saliha was to be included in the proposed Arab state, while the boundary between it and the proposed Jewish state was to run north of the built-up area of the village. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Saliha was the site of a massacre carried out by Israeli forces shortly before the village was completely depopulated. The built structures in the village, with the exception of an elementary school for boys, were also destroyed. Israeli forces blew up the village mosque, killing 60–94 people who were inside. Israeli period Moshav Avivim was founded in 1958, abandoned, and then reestablished in 1963 by immigrants from the Maghreb, mostly Moroccan Jews. South Lebanon conflict The moshav's proximity to the Lebanese border has made it a target for violent attacks, most notably the Avivim school bus massacre. On May 8, 1970, militants of the pro-Syrian Baathist As-Sa'iqa organization fired two bazooka shells at the community school bus, killing nine children and three adults, and injuring 19 others. In October 1970, guerrillas in Lebanon fired mortars at Avivim, triggering an alert along the Lebanese border. Avivim also suffered during the 2006 Lebanon War, and was subject to at least one infiltration attempt by Hezbollah. The moshav also came under fire from Hezbollah forces in the nearby village of Maroun al-Ras, across the border in Lebanon.

Smith, and published in 1984 by Pineapple Press. It is historical fiction set in pioneer Florida. The story covers over a century of Florida history from 1858 to 1968.

Family of artisans The Townsend and Goddard families were two Quaker families that were part of a large cabinetmaking community centered in The Point neighborhood of Newport, a predominately Quaker neighborhood. The founders of this cabinetmaking dynasty immigrated to Newport from other New England towns. Christopher Townsend (1701–1787) and Job Townsend (1699–1765) of Oyster Bay, New York, came to Newport in 1707 with their parents Solomon Townsend and Catherine (Almy) Townsend. Both brothers would become cabinetmakers in Newport. Carpenter and cabinetmaker Daniel Goddard (1697–1764) was born in Jamestown, Rhode Island to Henry Goddard and Mary (Howland) Goddard. He moved from Jamestown first to Dartmouth, Massachusetts, before settling in Newport by 1727. The second generation of Newport cabinetmakers from these families are perhaps the best known. John Townsend (1732–1809) was the son of Christopher Townsend and Patience (Easton) Townsend. He would marry Philadelphia Feke (1742–1802), daughter of famed portrait painter Robert Feke. John Goddard (1723/4-1785) was the son of Daniel Goddard and apprentice of Job Townsend. He married Job's daughter Hannah Townsend (1728–1804).Morrison Hecksher, John Townsend: Newport Cabinetmaker (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005.), 35-60. Twenty-one members of successive generations of these two intermarried families worked as cabinetmakers over a period of 120 years, selling their products not only in New England but also in the coastal trade and in the West Indies.Magazine Antiques; April, 1995 - Ralph E. Carpenter Furniture The furniture associated with the Goddard and Townsend families is identified by a number of unique features. The so-called Block-and-shell motif, a block-front topped by a carved shell in alternating concave and convex pattern, is one of the key features. However, this alone is not proof of Goddard or Townsend origin- recently rediscovered cabinetmakers such as Benjamin Baker (1734–1822) of Newport or Grindal Rawson (1719–1803) of Providence are also known to have used the carved shell pattern when constructing case furniture.Dennis A Carr, \\"The Account Book of Benjamin Baker,\\" American Furniture (2004) Newport furniture of this school is also associated with a distinct ball and claw foot, in which there is an open space carved between the talon and ball. Such a form is thought to be unique to Newport, though not unique to the Goddard or Townsend families. Notable works A single mahogany secretary bookcase made by Christopher Townsend (John's father) in 1740 sold at auction in New York for $8.25 million. John Goddard made a famous six-shell desk-bookcase for Providence merchant Nicholas Brown, Sr. It was sold by the Brown family in 1989, for-- $12.1 million—a record for a piece of American furniture at auction.

The formal act is generally carried out by a representing proxy of the Pope, a Papal legate, or on rare occasions by the Pontiff himself, by ceremonially attaching a crown, tiara, or stellar halo to the devotional image or statue. Originally, the Holy Office issued the authorisation of a canonical coronation through a dicastery, called the \\"Vatican Chapter\\". Subsequently until 1989, the Vatican's Sacred Congregation of Rites was assigned this duty. Since then, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments arranges to execute the ceremonial act which the decree authorizes.  History  The alt= The formal act of coronation towards Marian images began with the Order of Friars Minor Capuchins, who on their evangelising missions collected great quantities of jewellery associated with the practice of indulgences, which funded at the request of the faithful, the gold crowns or accessories for images of the Virgin Mary, mainly in Italy. A particular Capuchin friar, Jeronimo Paolucci di Calboldi di Forli (1552-1620), was a major advocate for this practice, and was known during his life as a self-proclaimed \\"Apostle of the Blessed Lady.\\" After a simple homily, Forli crowned the Nursing Madonna, now enshrined in the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata in the Italian city of Parma on 27 May 1601. Later, on 3 July 1636, the Marquis of Piacenza and Count of Borgonovo, Alessandro Sforza Cesarini died, having bequeathed in his will a large sum of money to the Vatican Chapter, for investment in the production of crowns of precious metals for the coronation of the most celebrated Marian images in the world. Funds from his bequest went towards the restoration of ‘’Madonna della Febbre’’ now enshrined in the sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.  Development of the rite  The famed Madonna della Febbre, first to be canonically crowned by Pope Urban VIII in 27 May 1631. The surrounding marble frame is a ciborium by Donatello - Sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome The 1984 Papal bull of Pope John Paul II which granted ecclesiastical licence to crown the image of Our Lady of Hope of Triana, Seville The enactment of the rite of the coronation of a venerated image became widely popular in the Papal states prior to 1800, when approximately 300 coronation rites were performed. On 29 March 1897, an official rite was included in the Roman Pontifical, for which a plenary indulgence was also conceded to the faithful who participated in such rites.Roman Ritual: Blessings, Praenotanda num. 28; ritual coronation of an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, nos. 10 and 14. * The first Marian image to be ceremonially crowned without direct Papal approbation but performed by Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino was the Black Virgin of Oropa in Piedmont on 30 August 1620. * The first Marian image that was Pontifically crowned was Lippo Memmi’s painting of La Madonna della Febbre (Madonna of Fever) in the sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome on 27 May 1631, by Pope Urban VIII through the Vatican Chapter. * The first Marian image crowned by a Pope himself instead of a proxy papal legate was the “Madonna Del Popolo” on 3 June 1782, by Pope Pius VI, at the Cesena Cathedral.  Enshrinement of the rite  The solemn rite of crowning images is contained in the \\"Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis\\", published by the Holy Office on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls authorising canonical coronations were inscribed manually on parchment. After 1989, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments began issuing the authorisations, thereby authorising a Papal legate to perform the coronation of the approved devotional image on behalf of the Pope.

Philadelphia had now won twice as many championships as any other team in NLL history (the Buffalo Bandits had won three, and the Rock two). The Championship game was one of only two games (out of ten) the Rock lost at home during the 2001 season, and ended Toronto's bid for an unprecedented third straight Championship. The NLL expanded its schedule from 12 games to 14 during this season.

In addition, the Syracuse Smash ended a dismal existence (dead last in the standings for three straight years) in Syracuse, moving to Ottawa, Ontario to become the Rebel. Unfortunately, the Rebel would finish in the basement three straight years as well. The Pittsburgh CrosseFire, formerly the Baltimore Thunder, moved again, this time to Washington, becoming the Washington Power.

Nkoli was born in Soweto in a seSotho-speaking family. He grew up on a farm in the Free State and his family later moved to Sebokeng. Nkoli became a youth activist against apartheid, with the Congress of South African Students (COSAS) and with the United Democratic Front. In 1983, he joined the mainly white Gay Association of South Africa, then he formed the Saturday Group, the first black gay group in Africa. Nkoli spoke at rallies in support of rent-boycotts in the Vaal townships and in 1984 he was arrested and faced the death penalty for treason with twenty-one other political leaders in the Delmas Treason Trial, including Popo Molefe and Patrick Lekota, collectively known as the Delmas 22. By coming out while a prisoner, he helped change the attitude of the African National Congress to gay rights. He was acquitted and released from prison in 1988. He founded the Gay and Lesbian Organisation of the Witwatersrand (GLOW) in 1988. Along with LGBT activist, Beverley Palesa Ditsie, he organised the first pride parade in South Africa held in 1990. He traveled widely and was given several human rights awards in Europe and North America. He was a member of International Lesbian and Gay Association board, representing the African region. He was one of the first gay activists to meet with President Nelson Mandela in 1994. He helped in the campaign for the inclusion of protection from discrimination in the Bill of Rights in the 1994 South African constitution and for the repeal of the sodomy law, which happened in May 1998 in his last months. After becoming one of the first publicly HIV-positive African gay men, he initiated the Positive African Men group based in central Johannesburg. He had been infected with HIV for around 12 years, and had been seriously ill, on and off, for the last four. He died of AIDS in 1998 in Johannesburg. There is a Simon Nkoli Day in San Francisco. He opened the first Gay Games in New York and was made a freeman of that city by mayor David Dinkins. In 1996 Nkoli was given the Stonewall Award in the Royal Albert Hall in London. Canadian filmmaker John Greyson made a short film about Nkoli titled A Moffie Called Simon in 1987.

She is the estranged daughter of the late actress Bette Davis. Biography Born in Santa Ana, California, she is the daughter of film star Bette Davis (1908-1989) and artist William Grant Sherry (1914-1995) and was adopted in 1950 by Davis's fourth husband, actor Gary Merrill. She took back her surname Sherry upon turning 16 years old, claiming that she wished to distance herself from Merrill, who was abusive. She appeared briefly (uncredited) as an infant in her mother's film Payment on Demand (1951). Under the screen name B. D. Merrill, she played a minor role as the next-door neighbor's daughter in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), in which her mother co-starred with her rival Joan Crawford. These were her only acting appearances on film. B. D. met Jeremy Hyman (b 1933 London), the British nephew of Seven Arts Productions owner Eliot Hyman, on a blind date for the film's showing at the Cannes Film Festival, in 1963, and the couple married when B. D. was age 16 and Jeremy was age 29. Her mother Bette Davis gave her consent and publicly supported their marriage. The couple remained married for over 50 years until Jeremy Hyman’s death in November of 2017. They have two sons, Ashley and Justin. Books Hyman wrote two books highly critical of her mother, My Mother's Keeper (1985) and Narrow Is the Way (1987). My Mother's Keeper brought Hyman considerable condemnation for the timing of its publication since Davis was in ill health after suffering a stroke during the book's publication process, even though writing of the book had been completed well before the stroke. My Mother's Keeper chronicled a difficult mother–daughter relationship and depicted scenes of her mother as an overbearing alcoholic. Several of Davis's friends commented that the depictions of events were inaccurate and others with first-hand knowledge vehemently disagreed with the allegations. In her 1987 memoirs This 'N That, Davis wrote a \\"letter\\" to her daughter in which she alleged inaccuracies in Hyman's book. Mike Wallace rebroadcast a 60 Minutes interview he had filmed with Hyman a few years earlier in which she commended Davis on her skills as a mother when she (Hyman) was younger, and said that she had adopted many of Davis's principles in raising her own children. My Mother's Keeper was a best- seller; the second book, however, did not generate the same level of interest. Despite the acrimony of their divorce years earlier, Davis's former husband, Gary Merrill, defended Davis and claimed in an interview with CNN that B. D. was motivated by “cruelty and greed”. B. D.'s brother through adoption, Michael Merrill, ended contact with B.D., and refused to speak to her again. Bette Davis disinherited B. D. and her grandchildren; her estate was instead divided between her adopted son Michael Merrill and her assistant Kathryn Sermak. Ministry A born-again Christian, Hyman is the head of her own ministry and pastor of her church in Charlottesville, Virginia. She has written three books which were published by her ministry: Oppressive Parents: How to Leave Them and Love Them (1992), The Church is Not the Bride (2000), The Rapture, the Tribulation, and Beyond (2002). In popular culture Kiernan Shipka portrays a young Hyman in the FX anthology television series Feud (2017), which chronicles the rivalry between her mother Bette Davis and Joan Crawford during the production of their 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.

Biography Zou Yan was a noted scholar of the Jixia Academy in the state of Qi. Joseph Needham, a British sinologist, describes Zou as \\"The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought.\\" His teachings combined and systematized two current theories during the Warring States period: Yin-Yang and the Five Elements/Phases (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). A depiction of Yan on the Chocolate Frog Card (made by the Harry Potter production team) All of Zou Yan's writings have been lost and are only known through quotations in early Chinese texts. The best information comes from his brief biography in the Records of the Grand Historian (1st century BC) by Sima Qian. It describes him as a polymath (philosopher, historian, politician, naturalist, geographer, astrologer) who came from the coastal state of Qi (present day Shandong), where he was a member of the state-sponsored Jixia Academy. Needham writes: Zou Yan is commonly associated with Daoism and the origins of Chinese alchemy, going back to the (ca. 100 AD) Book of Han that calls him a fangshi (方士 [literally \\"technique master\\"] \\"alchemist; magician; exorcist; diviner\\"). Holmes Welch proposes the fangshi were among those whom Sima Qian described as \\"unable to practice\\" Zou Yan's arts, and says while Zou \\"gradually acquired alchemistical stature, he himself knew nothing of the art. It was probably developed by those of his followers who became interested in physical experimentation with the Five Elements.\\"Welch, Holmes. 1957. Taoism: The Parting of the Way.

It starred Rafael Rivelles, Juan Calvo (who also starred together as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the 1947 Spanish film version of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote) and the young child star Pablito Calvo (no relation to Juan) as Marcelino. The musical score and theme song – sung in full during the action, rather than at the start of the film – are by Pablo Sorozábal. The story, revised and modernised in both the book and film, dates back to a medieval legend, one of many gathered together in a volume by Alfonso el Sabio. It was a critical and commercial success, and other countries have produced versions of it. Plot The story revolves around Marcelino, an orphan abandoned as a baby on the steps of a monastery in nineteenth-century Spain. The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a \\"very big man who will take him away\\" lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the man and tears off back down the stairs. At a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally lets some animals loose, and the new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behavior, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery. Given the silent treatment by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and confidant, and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ. The monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino. One day, the statue notices that Marcelino is pensive and brooding instead of happy, and tells him that he would like to reward his kindness. Marcelino answers: \\"I want only to see my mother, and to see Yours after that\\". The statue cradles Marcelino in its arms, tells Marcelino to sleep - and Marcelino dies happy. The monks witness the miracle through a crack in the attic door, and burst in just in time to see the dead Marcelino bathed in a heavenly glow. The statue returns to its place on the Cross, and Marcelino is buried underneath the chapel and venerated by all who visit the now flourishing monastery-turned-shrine. The main story is told in flashback by a monk (played by Fernando Rey), who, visiting a dying girl, tells her the story of Marcelino for inspiration. The film ends with the monk entering the now completely remodeled chapel in the monastery during Mass, and saying to the crucifix once kept in the attic: \\"We have been speaking about You, O Lord\\", and then, to Marcelino's grave, which is situated nearby, \\"And about you, too, Marcelino\\". Cast  Legacy  The film remains one of the most famous and successful Spanish films ever made in history, and one of the first Spanish films to become successful in the U.S. as well. Three key scenes of the film were filmed in La Alberca (Salamanca). Its Plaza Mayor serves as a stage for the initial scene, in which the narrator friar, Fernando Rey, goes down to the village to tell the sick child the story of Marcellino. The scene of the market, where Marcelino has just climbed into a cockpit after causing the stampede of a yoke of oxen. Finally, back to the convent, they pass in front of the Hermitage of San Blas of said locality. All the atmosphere related to the convent is located in the chapel of the Cristo del Caloco in El Espinar (Segovia) one which has great devotion in the region; The figure of the Christ, however, does not correspond to that of the Caloco, but is a sculpture of the sculptor Antonio Simont and is currently on the altar of the Chapel of St. Teresa of the Convent of the Carmelites of Don Benito (Badajoz). There it ended up at the wish of one of the sound engineers of the film, Miguel López Cabrera, whose sister was a nun in the convent. Remakes *A Philippine remake of Miracle of Marcelino, under its original title, was released in 1979. *An Italian remake, Marcellino, was produced in 1991 in color, and was much less successful than the original film. *In 2000, VIP Toons of Spain, PMMP and TF1 of France and Nippon Animation of Japan created the first TV series adaptation of the story, also titled Marcelino Pan y Vino after the original novel.

He had a further spell at Barnsley, then went back to Thornliebank, followed by games for New Brompton and Renton before moving to Clyde.[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 In 1910, Travers was signed by Jimmy Philip to play for Aberdeen,Paddy Travers, AFC Heritage Trust but only played one season for them before returning to Glasgow, where he had business interests, to play for Celtic.Celtic player Patrick Travers, FitbaStats He had one season with the Bhoys, playing regularly after coming in for the injured Jimmy McMenemy until he himself was injured and Patsy Gallacher took the place, resulting in him missing out on the latter stages of the 1911–12 Scottish Cup as the club won the competition.Final game of the legendary Patsy Gallacher, Celtic FC, 10 October 2015 He then returned to Aberdeen, and this time stayed until the end of the 1913–14 season when he moved on to Dumbarton.Paddy Travers, Sons Archive He spent the remainder of his playing career in the West Dunbartonshire area, also playing for Clydebank, Vale of Leven and Dumbarton Harp. Managerial career Aberdeen Travers coached in Norway and was trainer then player-manager of Dumbarton before being engaged to coach Aberdeen in 1922.Donald Colman, The Vale of Leven He remained in that position until the retirement of Philip in the summer of 1924. One of his first acts as manager was the signing of Alec Jackson, together with his brother George. Jackson went on to be one of the most renowned players of his generation. In spite of this, however, Travers' first season in charge ended with relegation only avoided on goal difference. In the following seasons, many players came and went – Travers worked hard in the transfer market of the time, and his dealings are credited with improving the club's previously precarious financial situation. In 1931, Travers mysteriously dropped three of the club's regular players before a match against Falkirk. In all, five players never played for the club again, and it was reported in the 1970s that this was the result of an alleged plot to win fixed-odds bets on half-time and full-time scores. No police action was ever taken, and many of those involved protested their innocence for the remainder of their lives. The same year, he brought Donald Colman to the club from Dumbarton to act as a coach. In 1937, Travers took his team to the Scottish Cup final, the first time Aberdeen had ever appeared in the event. They were defeated 2–1 by Celtic in front of a record official attendance of 146,433, although many more spectators may have gained illegal entry. That summer, the club were on a tour of South Africa when outside-right Jackie Benyon died suddenly of peritonitis. Travers remained in charge for two more seasons, but feeling that he no longer had the full support of his directors, accepted an offer to manage Clyde in 1938; he was replaced at Aberdeen by Colman. Clyde The success which had eluded him at Pittodrie soon materialised at Shawfield, however, and the Scottish Cup was won by Travers' Clyde team in 1938–39. He was still manager of Clyde in 1954–55, when the Bully Wee beat Celtic in a replay to win their second Cup. He was also a runner up as manager with Clyde in the Scottish Cup in 1948–49 when Clyde lost 4–1 to Rangers in the final. Also notably in season 1951–52, Travers led Clyde to four trophies in a single season; the Scottish Division B league title, the B Division Supplementary Cup, the Glasgow Cup and the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup. His four Scottish Cup finals earned him a reputation as a \\"Cup specialist\\" when named as one of Scotland's 50 greatest managers by the Sunday Herald newspaper.

The name \\"écuyer\\", the French word for squire, is the origin for the French word \\"écurie\\" (stable) and the English word equerry. The position was roughly equivalent to the United Kingdom positions of Master of the Horse and the Crown Equerry. The position of Grand Écuyer was made an Officer of the Crown by Henri III for the benefit of his favorite Roger de Saint-Lary de Bellegarde. The Grand Écuyer was commonly referred to as \\"Monsieur le Grand\\". He was in charge of the royal stables, the transport of the king and his ceremonial entourage (heralds, men of arms, musicians, etc.). As well as the superintendence of the royal stables, he had that of the retinue of the sovereign, also the charge of the funds set aside for the religious functions of the court, coronations, etc. On the death of a sovereign he had the right to all the horses and their equipment in the royal stables. He oversaw personally the \\"Great Stable\\" (\\"grande écurie\\"). The authority of the Grand Écuyer also extended across the realm, as he oversaw horse breeding and provincial military academies created to educate young nobles. Distinct from this officer and independent of him, was the first equerry (\\"Premier Écuyer de France\\"), who had charge of the horses which the sovereign used personally (the \\"Little Stable\\" or \\"petite écurie\\"), and who attended on him when he rode out. The office of Grand Squire existed down to the reign of Louis XVI. Under Louis XVIII and Charles X the duties were discharged by the first equerry, but under Napoleon I and Napoleon III the office was revived with much of its old importance. The Grand Écuyer had the privilege of bearing the king's sword in ceremonies outside of royal residences. From 1643 to the French Revolution, the Grand Écuyer was chosen from the house of Lorraine.

As such, it purposes to induce affective responses from consumers, thereby forming meaningful relationship between person and place. Origins Most often associated with capitalistic function, branding has traditionally been understood as a strategy used upon promoting goods and services to evoke emotional response from consumers. Accordingly, place branding follows the notion that places (e.g. cities and urban spaces) can be \\"shaped and managed just like any other brand.\\"Bookman, Sonia, and Andrew Woolford. 2013. \\"Policing (by) the Urban Brand: Defining Order in Winnipeg's Exchange District.” Social and Cultural Geography 14(3):300–317. Skyline of Toronto, Ontario, including the CN Tower. The practice of place branding is understood to have emerged in the mid-19th century. The United States, in particular, began such strategies in order to attract rural populations to urban centers for labor. Later, the practice would be used for tourism purpose, especially in Europe, with famous posters of places. However, the practice would not become commonplace among cities and countries until recent years. This emphasis is considered to represent a broader phenomenon that emerged around the 1970s known as urban regeneration, whereby systems of production within developed countries became \\"vertically disintegrated,\\" giving way to post- industrial societies,Hiller, Harry. 2014. \\"Canadian Urbanization in Historical and Global Perspective\\".

Such interest seems to have come out of recognition that \\"places of all kinds can benefit from implementing coherent strategies with regard to managing their resources, reputation and image.\\"Dinnie, Keith. 2013. \\"Introduction to the Theory of City Branding\\". Pp. 3–7 in City Branding: Theory and Cases, edited by K. Dinnie. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.  In Academia  Though scholarly interest in the domain of place branding is still in its nascent stages, published academic research has seen considerable increase in recent years. As the world economy becomes more and more integrated and interconnected, this interest will only continue to grow, especially as cities compete for \\"talent attraction, tourism promotion, the hosting of sporting and cultural events, investment attraction, and the many other goals that cities set out to achieve in their quest for urban development and regeneration.\\" Place branding is an interdisciplinary approach that can be focused in on as a field in sociology (including urban sociology, criminology, and cultural sociology), political science, cultural anthropology, cultural studies, communication studies, marketing, international relations, and others. It may even be applied to other arts and humanities, such as film studies or literature, in so far as observing how places are portrayed or imagined (e.g. Thebes in Oedipus Rex or Gotham City in the Batman franchise). Impacts of Globalization Global Cities Index One of the tenets of place branding posits that the struggle for attention and preference is not limited to commercial goods and services; it applies equally to geopolitical entities. Countries and cities compete for tourist income, business, and often tax bases. Even within cities, there is a fierce competition between city centers urban vs. suburban areas; big-box retailers vs. local businesses; shopping malls vs. traditional downtowns. Proponents of place branding argue that this heightened competitive environment makes it important for places, no matter their size or composition, to clearly differentiate themselves and to convey why they are relevant and valued options. This view is supported and defended by Joao Freire, among others, who states that successful destination-brand management can be seen as an exercise of coordination where relevant variables—such as tourism infrastructures, quality of local services, and other destination-brand users need to be managed in order to achieve a coherent and desired destination-brand identity. Thus, contrary to popular conception that destination-brand building is solely an exercise in communication, destination branding is, in reality, an exercise of identification, organisation and coordination of all the variables that affect the destination image. The strategic application of place branding is growing with nations, regions, cities, and institutions as they realize they compete with other places for people, resources, and business. The phenomenon of place branding, as an organic process of image communication without strategy, has been occurring throughout history. Processes Place branding is a process made up of several sub-processes. Unlike branding simpler entities like a product, service, company, person or classical subjects of branding, place branding, and in particular nation and city branding, is a complex process. The complexity comes from the great diversity of stakeholders in the process. In general, a place brand is derived from existing assets of the place such as its value offering or public perception. Otherwise, the place brand is derived from created assets, such as events, policies, abstract concepts of tolerance, and so on. The derived image of the place brand is then communicated through communication channels. These channels vary and range from television advertisements to Internet marketing efforts. These communications are aimed at a specific target market.  City/Urban Branding  The Sydney Opera House during Vivid Sydney (2013), an annual festival of light, music, and ideas. City branding (also known as urban branding) refers to all the activities that are undergone with the purpose of turning a city from a location into a destination. \\"Successful branding,\\" says Robert Jones, consultant director at international brand consultancy Wolff Olins, \\"can turn a city into a place where people want to live, work and visit.\\" City branding is often confused with city marketing. The two differ in the fact that marketing uses consumer wishes and needs as its guiding principle for the operations of an organization, whereas in the case of branding a chosen vision, mission and identity play that role. City branding creates a single brand for the city and extends it to all its offerings and interactions. From a consumer's point of view, this creates a unique picture of the city at every level of interactions. This also helps in removing the need to present a case by case picture of the city for each of its offerings to the customers. A city brand is its promise of value, a promise that needs to be kept. Good branding can assist in making cities desirable, just as bad branding can assist in making cities undesirable. Some examples of well-branded cities are New York City, San Francisco and Paris. It is seen that the successful city brands marketed their history, quality of place, lifestyle, culture, diversity, and proactively formed cooperative partnerships between city municipalities and government in order to enhance their infrastructure. Equally important is the role of positioning in the branding process, i.e. creating a distinct place in the market for the city to occupy. Examples of Urban Branding campaigns England's famous London Eye ferris wheel. Jerusalem has a clear city brand as a holy city. The holy city includes numerous significant holy sites such as the Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Garden Tomb, and the Temple Mount. A study commissioned by the Swedish Research Council suggests that Jerusalem may be one of the oldest city brands, having undergone organic branding campaigns for centuries. Pilgrimage, the religious equivalent of tourism, has been part of Jerusalem's history for millennia. Las Vegas or simply Vegas is used by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority as a brand to market the bulk of the Las Vegas Valley, including the Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada, Henderson, Nevada, North Las Vegas, Nevada and parts of Clark County, Nevada.

Dr Clifford B. Frith is an English born (1949) Australian citizen and ornithologist. He is an independent zoological researcher (mostly ornithological), consultant, natural history author, photographer and publisher. Clifford's early ornithological positions included the Taronga Park Zoological Gardens, Sydney, The Natural History Museum, London, and the Royal Society of London Research Station, Albabra Atoll, Indian Ocean where he met his future wife Dawn Whyatt Frith. Their full-time partnership began in April 1973. In 1974, when Dawn took up a four-year appointment as a senior biologist and advisor at Phuket Marine Biological Center in southern Thailand, Clifford studied aspects of invertebrate and vertebrate zoology while working as a freelance zoological photographer, artist, author and advisor. They married at Bangkok Central Police Station, in October 1975. In December 1977, they moved to tropical north Queensland, Australia, to start decades of field studies of bowerbirds and birds of paradise and other rainforest-dwelling bird species in tropical eastern Australia and in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Together they have published some 150 substantial scientific papers in international peer-reviewed zoological journals. Their studies are largely self-funded by proceeds from their own photography and publishing partnership. Clifford has written and illustrated many semi-scientific and popular articles in magazines worldwide, has acted as scientific and/or technical advisor and/or associate producer to various feature and television film makers. He has much experience in personal presentations at both popular and scientific levels and has also been a specialist ornithological guest lecturer to specialist tours to the highlands of New Guinea. He also carries out ecological and avifaunal surveys for various environmental agencies in tropical north Queensland, Australia. For five years (2003-2007), Clifford was Honorary Book Review Editor of Emu - Austral Ornithology - the international peer-reviewed scientific journal of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, published by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Canberra, Australia. He is presently scientific and book review editor for the journal Australian Field Ornithology. Ornithologist Clifford commenced his ornithological career on the ornithological staff at the British Museum of Natural History, London (1967-1970). Most of 1968 was spent in tropical Australia on the Fifth Harold Hall Australian Expedition to the Kimberley and Arnhemland areas. He was resident ornithological staff scientist on Aldabra Atoll, Indian Ocean for the Royal Society of London (1972–73). He then lived on Phuket Island in Southern Thailand, until moving the Australia to live. Since 1977, Clifford, with Dawn W. Frith, has studied various aspects of tropical rainforest avifauna in Australia, New Guinea and elsewhere for over three decades. His studies have resulted in innumerable scientific publications (136 to date) on the behaviour, nesting biology, mating systems, and systematics of bowerbirds, birds of paradise, and other rainforest-dwelling bird species. His systematic scientific studies have resulted in two major ‘definitive’ ornithological text books - one titled The Birds of Paradise: Paradisaeidae (1998) and the other The Bowerbirds: Ptilonorhynchidae (2004). In 2002 Clifford obtained his PhD at Griffith University, Brisbane, for his 1200-page thesis on Evolutionary studies of bowerbirds and birds of paradise: affinities and divergence. Photographer Clifford is also a professional natural history photographer whose still photographs have appeared in innumerable general and specialist books and magazines worldwide.

Studebaker was the 7th child of eight born on a farm in the small town of West Milton, Ohio. He was a devout member of the Church of the Brethren, and also excelled in sports and played football in high school as well as in college where he attended the small liberal arts school Manchester University in North Manchester, Indiana. He then attended Florida State University for two years pursuing his graduate degree in social work before he left for Vietnam. He also had a great love for music and was a guitarist. On August 27, 1967, Studebaker delivered a message from the pulpit to the congregation at the West Milton Church of the Brethren. He expressed concerns about social issues of the day, including the war in Southeast Asia. \\"The dehumanizing process of war concerns me deeply,\\" Studebaker said. \\"What can I do about man's inhumanity to man?\\"\\"For What It's Worth,\\" a message written and delivered by Ted Studebaker, to the West Milton Church of the Brethren, August 27, 1967. While in Vietnam he volunteered with the Vietnam Christian service where his goal was to follow the example of Jesus Christ. He volunteered for two years working with a Montagnard hill tribe where he helped them with agricultural production. He bought fertilizer and sold it to the tribe at cost to yield a better crop, did the same with a roto-tiller, and also worked on a poultry production project. He believed that working with the people of Vietnam was the only way to pursue true peace and stability in Vietnam rather than war, although he did not side with either the Vietnamese or the US military. He married a Chinese volunteer named Ven Pak in April 1971 although they were only wed for one week before he was killed. He was killed on April 26, 1971 by North Vietnamese when they first attacked the volunteers’ house with rockets and then invaded. The soldiers did not know who Studebaker was, they merely saw him as an American and therefore a threat and so he was executed. The lives of his wife and other volunteers were spared. A record album was released of Ted Studebaker's music. The name of the album is Life is Good, Yea!/Ted Studebaker in Vietnam. According to the liner notes, \\"This record was produced from cassette tape recordings Ted Stedebaker sent from Vietnam to his family, relatives and friends....This project was conceived by Ted's brother, Gary, and Steve Engle.\\" References External links * Pioneer for Peace: Ted Studebaker * PEACE HEROES: The Ted Studebaker Story Category:1945 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American conscientious objectors Category:Manchester University (Indiana) alumni Category:People from West Milton, Ohio Category:Florida State University alumni Category:Studebaker Category:Activists from Ohio Category:American members of the Church of the Brethren ","title":"Ted Studebaker"},{"id":"6878047","text":"The Return is a 2006 American psychological horror film directed by Asif Kapadia and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kate Beahan, Peter O'Brien, and Sam Shepard. It was released theatrically on November 10, 2006, and on DVD on February 27, 2007. The Blu-ray was released on October 6, 2009. Plot Joanna Mills (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a travelling rep for a trucking company, is dedicated to her successful career but something of a loner. Since the age of 11 she has been a troubled person, with episodes of self-mutilation and menacing visions. Normally she avoids returning to her native Texas, but agrees to a trip there to secure an important client. During the trip her visions, which take the form of memories of events not from her life, increase in intensity. She sees a strange face staring back at her in the mirror. Her truck radio plays Patsy Cline's \\"Sweet Dreams\\" no matter what station she selects. She stops at the scene of an accident that, on the following day, seems not to have happened. Joanna cuts herself in a bar restroom and is narrowly rescued by a friend. She visits her father, who observes that from age 11 she was \\"a different girl\\". The visions continue, becoming both more specific and more threatening, centering upon a menacing man she does not recognize and a bar she has never seen, but a picture of which is in one of her catalogs. Drawn by the image to the Texas town where the bar is located, a place she has not been since childhood, Joanna meets a man named Terry Stahl, whose wife, Annie, was stalked, brutally assaulted, and left to die fifteen years before, a crime of which Terry was suspected but not convicted. Joanna continues to have visions of this crime and the events that led up to it, and to discover other links between Annie's life and hers. She meets the real killer and is led by what she has seen in her visions to recover the knife he used from its hiding place. She is then stalked, herself. She finds herself drawn into a repetition of the crime, but this time she stabs her assailant with the recovered knife, using the original weapon to avenge the original crime. The story ends with the revelation that Annie, clinging to life as Terry drove her to the hospital after the original assault, died when his car crashed into one driven by Joanna's father, in which the eleven-year-old Joanna was a passenger. After momentary unconsciousness, the young Joanna seems to have survived the crash. A silent Joanna is seen reflecting on who she is and what has happened to her. She seems to reach an inner resolution of these questions. An alternative ending included on the DVD release more straightforwardly supports the interpretation that Annie's soul has been placed in Joanna's body. Cast *Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills *Sam Shepard as Ed Mills *Peter O'Brien as Terry Stahl *Kate Beahan as Michelle *Adam Scott as Kurt *Darrian Mcclanahan as Young Joanna Mills Reception Reviews of the film were mostly negative with 16% positive on Rotten Tomatoes.The Return Movie Reviews, Pictures. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2010-10-28. The biggest criticism was the very slow pace. The artistic tone and cinematography of the film were praised, as was the film as a whole by some, though the average rating was a 3.9/10. The Return opened with what distributor Rogue Pictures called a \\"very disappointing\\" $4,800,000 weekend gross. Except for trailers and TV spots, there was no publicity nor a premiere for the film, as Sarah Michelle Gellar was busy shooting the movie Possession in Vancouver, British Columbia. The film only earned $7.7 million. Worldwide, it made $14,949,851.The Return (2006). Box Office Mojo. Retrieved 2010-10-28.

Medals are awarded in men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. The event is the culmination of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series; skaters earn points for their placements and the top six from each discipline qualify to the Final. Although not an ISU Championship, the Grand Prix Final has been considered by the International Skating Union to be the second most important competition (after the World Championships) in a season, ahead of the European Championships and the Four Continents Championships. History The first three editions of the competition were titled the Champions Series Final. The current name was first used in the 1998–99 season. The competition omitted the compulsory dance prior to the International Skating Union's decision to completely discontinue the segment. The rules for the final have varied from year to year. In recent years, the skaters perform the short program in reverse order of their rankings, so the top scorer in the Grand Prix series skates last. The skating order for the free skate (free dance for ice dancers) is the reverse order of their placement in the short program or short dance, unlike other competitions where start orders are determined by a random draw.

Copper Crucible: How the Arizona Miners' Strike of 1983 Recast Labor-Management Relations in America, Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 1995, p.217. History In 1981, the price of copper plummeted from a high of $1.40 in February 1981 to $.75 (seventy-five cents) per pound by December 18, 1981, resulting in losses for the entire copper industry. During 1981, the copper industry, as a whole, laid off approximately 50%, or 11,000 workers statewide. Phelps Dodge continued to operate with full manpower throughout most of 1981, although they continued to lose money. In December 1981, Phelps Dodge announced that it would lay off 108 workers in Arizona and New Mexico on January 3, 1982, and place the rest of the workers on a four-day work week in order to minimize the impact of the layoffs. In doing so, unlike the rest of the copper industry, Phelps Dodge was able to continue to operate and pay their workers, while reducing their production by 20%.Kingman Daily Miner, December 18, 1981 Phelps Dodge announced salary cuts to management personnel, and laid off 100 salaried employees. On April 7, 1982, Phelps Dodge announced it would lay off all 3,400 of its hourly workers in Texas and Arizona, because of its losses. Not only did Phelps Dodge lay off workers, but a total of approximately 12,000 copper workers had been laid off across the industry. None of the copper mines in Arizona continued to operate. Company chairman George B. Munroe decided to hold a series of \\"town hall meetings\\" to talk directly to the workers. \\"The copper you produce here\\", he told the miners, had to compete with copper produced in Canada, South America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. Essentially the price for copper is the same all over the world. And no U. S. producer can continue operating for very long when its cost of producing a pound of copper approaches or exceeds the price for which it can be sold. Munroe also pointed out that Arizona miners wages had risen at an annual rate of nearly 15 percent during the 1970s, while the average U. S. manufacturing employee had seen only a 10 percent increase.Copper Crucible: how the Arizona miners' strike of 1983 recast labor \\"The same eight dollars that Phelps Dodge pays for forty minutes of work\\", Munroe went on to say, \\"would buy more than a full shift of work from the average mining employee at a large South American copper company.\\" Many of the unions in other industries had already agreed to pay cuts. Munroe said that the copper industry could be no exception. Although copper prices remained stagnant throughout 1982, Phelps Dodge ended its shutdown, calling more than half the work force back about five months after Munroe's visits.Copper Crucible: how the Arizona miner's strike of 1983 recast labor, by Jonathan D Rosenblaum All of the other copper companies continued their shutdowns. Phelps Dodge lost money in 1982, adding to its debt burden. Other copper companies were at the time owned by large oil companies (Anaconda was owned by Atlantic Richfield, Cypress by Standard of Indiana, and Kennecott by Standard of Ohio), and were able to sustain losses, but Phelps Dodge was by itself. With no expectation of higher copper prices for years to come, management concluded that to survive, Phelps Dodge needed a long-term plan to reduce labor costs. To accomplish that, they determined to eliminate the cost- of-living adjustment (COLA) from the upcoming union contract.Carlos A Schwantes, Vision & Enterprise: Exploring the History of Phelps Dodge Corporation (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2000) 312-327. Contract negotiations In April 1983, rival copper producer Kennecott and its unions agreed on a contract that froze base pay for three years. The union leadership considered that they had accommodated the suffering copper industry by agreeing to no wage increases for three years, except for the usual cost-of- living adjustments. They expected that the new Kennecott agreement would be quickly duplicated with all the other copper producers, the same system of pattern bargaining that had obtained for years in the industry. But Phelps Dodge decided not to follow the Kennecott agreement. It also decided, and announced publicly, that it could not afford to, and would not, shut down for a strike. In April 1983, Phelps Dodge began negotiating with a coalition of its 13 labor unions, led by the United Steel Workers. Phelps Dodge insisted that it required elimination of cost-of-living adjustment, a freeze in wages, worker copays for health care, and a lower wage scale for new hires. The unions believed that to give in to Phelps Dodge would destroy the system of uniform wages in the copper industry, which had served them so well for years. Heading the union bargaining team was Frank S. McKee, a veteran negotiator who rose in the union from working the furnaces at Bethlehem Steel. McKee was preparing to run for the presidency of the United Steelworkers, and did not want to be perceived as weak. At the same time, the unions were also negotiating with Magma Copper and ASARCO. In June, both Magma and ASARCO agreed to contracts on the pattern set by Kennecott, leaving Phelps Dodge the only holdout. The two sides could not agree on cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) and job combinations.Book On 1983 Copper Strike Draws Wrong Lessons, The Militant, Dan Fein, August 21, 1995 The strike Negotiations between Phelps Dodge and the unions failed to reach an agreement, and a strike began on midnight of July 30, including workers from Morenci, Ajo, Clifton, and Douglas, Arizona. Thousands of miners walked out and a picket line was formed at the Morenci Mine. The next day, Phelps Dodge increased security personnel in and around the mine. But then Phelps Dodge did exactly what it had announced what it would do, and what almost everyone had thought was empty bravado: it continued to produce copper during the strike, for the first time since 1959. Since then the company, as did other copper companies, shut down during strikes, often using the down time to perform needed maintenance. Copper mining companies did not want to incur the anger and violence they knew would happen if they maintained copper production during a strike.Thomas Sheridan, Arizona: a History (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2012) 343. Some business analysts considered Phelps Dodge actions to be risky or foolish. A July 1983 cover of Business Week, declared a \\"Management Crisis at Phelps Dodge\\". The Phelps Dodge plants were kept running by plant supervisors and by office personnel, some brought in from the New York headquarters. They worked 12-hour shifts. Joining them were some union workers who ignored the strike, about 700, according to the company. As expected, angry picketers shouted insults at those entering and leaving the plants. Picketers with bullhorns identified picket-line crossers by name. People spread roofing nails on roads going into the plants. Phelps Dodge succeeded in obtaining court orders limiting the number of pickets, but generally did not succeed in getting them enforced. The Greenlee County Board of Supervisors imposed a 9 pm to 6 am curfew, but the Clifton City Council instructed its police not to enforce it. Workers who continued working during the strike received threatening phone calls, and car windows and windows in their homes were smashed by rocks and baseball bats. Company-owned railroad bridges were set afire. At the El Paso smelter, a group of strikers incapacitated a police dog by beating it with steel rebar, baseball bats, and two-by-fours. A bullet fired into the home of a strikebreaker in Ajo lodged in the brain of his sleeping two-year-old daughter. An automobile caravan of more than a hundred cars wound through Clifton, throwing rocks through the windows of strikebreakers’ homes. At the same time, strikers and their supporters claimed that acts of violence by strikebreakers often were not prosecuted by authorities or reported in the media.Kingsolver, Barbara. Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983. Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 1989. In August, miners were subject to undercover surveillance by the Arizona Criminal Intelligence Systems Agency, to identify strikers engaged in violence.Union Busting: How Arizona's 'CIA' Helped Phelps Dodge Destroy The Unions, Tucson Weekly, Jonathan Rosenblum, June 29-July 5, 1995 Meanwhile, the local government passed injunctions limiting both picketing and demonstrations at the mine. Hiring replacement workers On August 5, Phelps Dodge announced that they would begin hiring permanent replacement workers for the Morenci Mine. The company took out large employment ads for new workers in the Tucson and Phoenix newspapers, advertising that the average annual wage for its employees was $26,200, plus what it calculated as $10,500 in benefits. Many people considered this an attractive wage, and that had an effect in curbing sympathy for the strikers. But the advertisements also greatly increased the anger of the strikers, who now faced permanent loss of their jobs. The company offered new workers virtually the same deal it had offered the unions, which had turned them down. Instead of an annual cost of living raise pegged to inflation, Phelps Dodge offered an annual wage review pinned to the price of copper. If copper increased, employees would receive a raise. They offered new workers $7.00 an hour instead of over $9.00. Instead of offering free doctor visits in the company hospital, they began to require a $5.00 co-pay. The union leaders turned this down, but hundreds of workers from Tucson and Phoenix accepted it. Eventually, many of the union workers went back to work as well. Tensions grew as Phelps Dodge prepared to bring in permanent replacements. On August 8, Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt flew to Morenci, and got Phelps Dodge to agree on a ten-day freeze on hiring replacement workers. Babbitt flew back to Phoenix believing that he had averted violence. But the next day, August 9, a crowd of one thousand gathered outside the gates of the Morenci mine and plant. Many in the crowd carried chains and baseball bats, and guns could be seen in many of their cars. Arizona state police officers told Phelps Dodge managers that an attack appeared imminent, and that they would not be able to protect the plant, or those inside it.Jonathan D. Rosenblum, Copper Crucible: how the Arizona Miners Strike of 1983 Recast Labor (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998) 95. Union representatives had stayed out of the assembled crowd, to avoid making the unions liable for any violent actions. But they requested an urgent meeting with company management inside the plant. In a scene that writer Jonathan Rosenblum likened to an Old West showdown, as both sides watched, two Phelps Dodge managers walked out the gate, and onto the middle of US Highway 666 (all traffic had been rerouted). Down the empty highway walked two union representatives to meet them. A state police official joined the group to mediate. The union men told Phelps Dodge that they had no control over the crowd, and that the crowd was planning to storm the mine and plant, unless the company shut down operations by the 3 pm shift change. The company men agreed to shut down.Jonathan D Rosenblum, Copper Crucible, quoted on US Department of Transportation website, US 666. The Phelps Dodge managers at Morenci quickly typed up an announcement that the Morenci mine and plant would immediately shut down for a 10-day cooling off period. Union leaders read the announcement to the crowd, 30 minutes before the deadline, and violence was averted. The plant shut down, and a caravan of 150 cars drove out the gates, through the jeering crowd. It seemed to some strikers that they had won a great union victory.“Violence feared in strike- torn mining town”, The New York Times, 19 August 1983Arthur Rotstein, “Phelps Dodge shuts down for 10 days in bitter copper strike”, Associated Press, Lewiston ID Journal, 10 August 1983. State intervention But the situation turned rapidly against the strikers. Although there had been no fatalities during the strike, the threats of violence increased the political pressure on Democratic governor Babbitt to intervene. Babbitt was no fan of Phelps Dodge. He said: “In my opinion, Phelps Dodge has the worst record in labor relations of any company that has ever operated in Arizona.” But he was also frustrated by what he considered the intransigence of the national union leaders.UPI, “Troops called out after copper strike violence” , Lodi CA News- Sentinel, 7 May 1984. On August 15, despite a request from Governor Babbitt to hold off, Phelps Dodge mailed eviction notices to miners fired for misconduct on the picket line. On August 17, despite his dislike of Phelps Dodge, Babbitt decided that he had a duty to prevent violence when the mines and mills reopened. He sent 325 National Guard soldiers to Morenci, and increased the number of state policemen there to 425. The action drew bitter criticism from union supporters, who accused Babbitt of being in the “back pocket” of Phelps Dodge. He responded that he was “in the back pocket of the American judicial system.”Joseph M. Baily, “Keeping people from being killed”, Mining History Association Journal, 1996, v.3 p.8. Under heavy military and police protection, the Morenci mine and plant reopened on August 20 without incident, and the company again began hiring replacement workers. About 35 percent of the original work force returned. Entering workers were still subjected to obscene gestures, name calling, and threats of violence, but strikers at the gate were unable to prevent the replacement workers from entering the mine. Eight days later, 10 strikers were arrested in Ajo and charged with rioting. From that point on, the strike lost much of its momentum. Although negotiations between the company and the unions continued for the rest of 1983, and union picketing continued for several years, the strike had effectively been lost.William Serrin, “Fury etches strikers’ life in crumbling fight at Arizona mines”, The New York Times, 30 July 1984. The National Guard withdrew at the end of August. On several occasions, strikers blocked the highway from Safford to Morenci, preventing workers from reporting for work. The National Guard returned briefly in May 1984 after another outbreak of violence. Decertification In September 1984, the new workforce began voting in elections deciding whether or not to decertify the unions. The result was the largest mass decertification in US history: 35 locals of 13 different unions representing Phelps Dodge workers were decertified in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. After a series of confrontations and controversies, the strike officially ended on February 19, 1986, when the National Labor Relations Board rejected appeals from the unions attempting to halt decertification. Aftermath Shortly after the strike ended, world copper prices began to climb. This and the introduction of new mining technology led to a marked increase in profits at Phelps Dodge. While their annual profits in 1985 were just $29.5 million, profits rapidly climbed to $205.7 million in 1987 and $420 million in 1988. In 1989, The Wall Street Journal published a front page story describing how Phelps Dodge restructured and avoided bankruptcy.Swasy, A., Long road back: How Phelps Dodge struggled to survive and prospered again, The Wall Street Journal, November 24, 1989 The Arizona copper mine strike would later become a symbol of defeat for American unions. The Economics of Labor Markets and The Transformation of American Industrial Relations singled out the Arizona strike as the start of overt company strikebreaking in the 1980s. Journalists referred to the miners' strike as a precedent for subsequent labor failures. References Further reading *Kingsolver, Barbara.

Andrew Lang included it in The Lilac Fairy Book, and Ruth Manning-Sanders included it in A Book of Mermaids. Synopsis Two cousins, a young man named Houarn Pogamm and a girl called Bellah Postik, grew up together, and their mothers thought they would marry, but when they came of age, their mothers died, and being penniless, they both had to become servants. They lamented their poverty, dreaming of a little farm where they could live, until Houarn decided to go seek his fortune. Bellah gave him a bell that could be heard at any distance, but only rang to warn of danger, and a knife that broke spells with its touch. She kept a stick that could carry a person anywhere, so it could carry her to him in need. He walked until he heard of the Groac'h of the island of Lok, a rich fairy; no one had gone after her treasure and ever come back. He hired a boatman to carry him to the lake. There he found a boat like a swan, even to having its head under its wing. He stepped on it to see it more clearly, and it swam off with him. He prepared to jump off and swim, but it dived and carried him to the lake bottom, where the Groac'h had her palace. She assured him that he was welcome and told him all her wealth came from shipwrecks. She offered to share it if he would marry her, and he agreed, forgetting Bellah. After the marriage, she summoned fish into a net, and put them in a pot. He heard cries from it, and when she served him the fish, he remembered Bellah and pulled out the knife. It turned the fish into men. They told him that they, too, had sought their fortune here. He tried to flee, but the Groac'h caught him in her net and turned him into a frog. The bell rang, and Bellah heard it. She took her stick, and it turned into a horse, and then into a bird that carried her to a nest, where a little black man was. He told her that he was the Groac'h's husband, and that she could free him by freeing Houarn. To do that, she must dress as a man, go to the Groac'h, and get her net. He turned four of his own hairs into tailors to make her a suit out of a cabbage. She went to the Groac'h's, who soon asked her to marry her. Bellah agreed, if the Groac'h would let her use the net to catch a fish in the fishpond. When she got it, she instead turned the Groac'h into a toad with it. With the knife, she freed Houarn and all the others. The little man arrived and gave Bellah and Houarn as much treasure as they could carry. They married, but instead of the little farm, they were able to buy many acres of land, and give all the men freed from the Groac'h money enough to buy little farms of their own.

Mount Russell is one of the major peaks of the central Alaska Range, approximately 35 mi (56 km) southwest of Denali. Though much lower than Denali or its neighbor Mount Foraker, Russell is a steep, dramatic peak and a significant mountaineering challenge in its own right. To give a sense of its size and steepness, note that its summit rises 6,560 ft (2,000 m) over the Chedotlothna Glacier to the northwest in only 1.8 mi (3 km), and almost 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above the lower Yentna Glacier to the south in only 8 mi (13 km). Mount Russell is the highest point in the Kuskokwim River watershed. The first ascent of Mount Russell was made on May 28, 1962 by a party led by Hellmut Raithel. The summit party comprised Klaus Ekkerlein, Robert Goodwin, and Peter Hennig. They ascended the West Face from the Chedotlothna Glacier. The second ascent was in July 1972, by Thomas Kensler, Peter Brown, John Hauck, Dick Jablonowski, and Dan Osborne. That ascent proceeded via the now-standard North Ridge route, from the high basin of the upper Yentna Glacier to the northeast of the peak. This route is rated at Alaska Grade 2+, and is made much shorter by the feasibility of landing at around 8,000 feet in the basin, just outside the wilderness portion of the park. Overshadowed as it is by its larger neighbors, Mount Russell had seen only six recorded ascents by 2001. However guided climbs of the peak are available. __TOC__ See also *List of mountain peaks of North America **List of mountain peaks of the United States ***List of mountain peaks of Alaska *List of Ultras of the United States References External links Category:Alaska Range Category:Mountains of Denali Borough, Alaska Category:Mountains of Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska Category:Mountains of Alaska ","title":"Mount Russell (Alaska)"},{"id":"6878188","text":"\\"Twisted (Everyday Hurts)\\" is a song by Skunk Anansie, released as their second single from their second album, Stoosh.

In an attempt to keep his tenants away from secret societies like the \\"Ribbonmen\\", he brought a socialist named Edward Thomas Craig from England to advise him on the establishment of the commune, which came into existence on 7 November 1831.  History  The purpose of the commune was to acquire common capital or a common wealth, in order to protect its members against the evils of old age and sickness, to achieve the mental and moral improvement of its adult members and to educate their children. The commune consisted of twenty- two single adult men, seven married men and their wives, five single women, four orphan boys, three orphan girls and five infants under the age of nine. It was governed by a committee of nine people, elected twice a year. Under an agreement between Vandeleur and the commune, the estate and property were to remain his at a rent of seven hundred pounds per annum to the commune, until they could afford to buy it. The commune was paid two hundred pounds a year for stock and equipment. A list of rules were written up and each member of the commune had to live by them. Alcohol, tobacco and snuff were banned, as was gambling of any kind. The members had to work twelve hours a day in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, with one hour break for dinner. Instead of money the workers were paid \\"labour notes\\" which they could spend in the co- operative store. In this way the commune would be more self-sufficient as the members would be buying goods they themselves had worked to produce. If they wished to spend money outside the commune the treasurer would change the labour notes into coin for them. The commune prospered for a time and 29 new members joined. New machinery was bought and the first mowing machine in Ireland was introduced by the Ralahine Commune. After two years however, it collapsed. Vandeleur's reckless lifestyle and his gambling habit finally brought an end to the experiment. After losing all his possessions through gambling the members of the commune were helpless to save themselves. The agreement they had signed with Vandeleur regarding his possession of the land meant that the commune was seized and they were duly evicted. The members of the commune met for the last time on 23 November 1833 and placed on record a declaration of \\"the contentment, peace and happiness they had experienced for two years under the arrangements introduced by Mr. Vandeleur and Mr. Craig and which through no fault of the Association was now at an end\\".

He achieved numerous distinctions and high rankings as a prolific goal scoring forward with six senior clubs; St Mirren, Dundee, Sunderland, Arsenal, Manchester City and Clapton Orient. He bookended his senior career playing at then non-league Queen of the South and Yeovil and Petters United. Halliday's three goals in the FA Cup proper for Yeovil give him a career total of 368 senior goals. From being player / manager at Yeovil, he went on to win trophies managing Aberdeen and Leicester City. He is the most recent of only two players to be outright top scorer in both Scottish and English football's top divisions with 38 Dundee goals in 1923–24 and 43 Sunderland goals in 1928–29. He is the quickest player in history to 100 goals in English football's top division, taking 101 games when at Sunderland. He is the only player to score 30 or more goals in four consecutive seasons in English football's top division (achieved again when at Sunderland). He scored at least 35 league goals in each of those four seasons. He is Sunderland's most prolific goals-per-game striker with 165 goals from 175 games. His 211 goals in English football's top division with Sunderland, Arsenal and Manchester City ranks him the 19th highest scorer at that level. Of the 27 players to have scored 200 or more goals in English football's top division, only Dixie Dean scored at a more prolific rate at that level. Managing Aberdeen, he won the 1946–47 Scottish Cup and the 1954–55 Scottish Football League. He managed Leicester City to promotion to the top division in England from winning the 1956–57 Football League Second Division.  Player   Early years and Queen of the South  Dave Halliday was born in Dumfries and started in local schools football where he featured on the left wing. He firstly attended Noblehill Primary School and thereafter Dumfries Academy. Halliday then worked with car manufacturer Arrol-Johnston and played for the company's team. This side was one of three who merged to form Queen of the South in 1919. However, despite having played in the new club's trial matches, Halliday did not join Queens until 17 January 1920 as he had a brief spell with Tayleurians. After joining the club, Halliday played 19 games until the season's end in May 1920. In Queens's first season their fixtures consisted of challenge games and local cup competitions, including the Dumfries Charity Cup which was played over three weekends in May. On 8 May in the first game, Queens thrashed Dumfries 7–1. A week later they saw off Solway Star 4–0 in the semi-final. They then faced up in the final against side Dalbeattie Star. A then-record crowd of 4,500 (with many others situated upon the stadium's roof) watched the game. An early Halliday shot went wide following good link up play with Ian Dickson. However it was Dalbeattie with their physical style of play who took the lead. Queens equalised through Willie McCall before Halliday's play became fruitful. One shot hit the post, another went inches wide before he put Queens ahead five minutes before half time. Connell hit a third a minute into the second half before Halliday beat Borthwick to cross for McCall who scored a fourth goal. Halliday in all scored 13 goals in 19 games for the Doonhamers while playing at outside left. In 1924 Halliday's 16-year-old brother Billy Halliday joined Queen of the South. St Mirren Halliday was asked to sign by St Mirren after the cup final win over Dalbeattie. He requested time to consider the offer before agreeing, with a stipulation that he continued working with Arrol-Johnston and traveled to Paisley on match days. In season 1920–21, as a part-time member of the playing staff, he scored two goals in 13 league games. Dundee Halliday next joined Dundee in 1921, for whom Scotland internationalist Alex Troup played on the left wing. Halliday was thus moved to centre forwards and quickly became one of the most prolific players in the game. He finished as Scottish top scorer in 1923–24 with a return of 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances; remains the club record all-time seasonal league goalscoring record. Halliday scored in the 3-0 1924-25 Scottish Cup tie victory over Airdrieonians whose team contained Hughie Gallacher, Bob McPhail and Willie Russell. Dundee progressed to the 1925 Scottish Cup Final in which, after leading at half-time, they lost 2–1 to a last minute goal by Celtic's Jimmy McGrory.1924–25 Scottish Cup Final line ups and stats at Scottish FA Archive Halliday scored 90 goals in 126 league appearances for the Dees, with another 13 goals from 21 Scottish Cup games in four seasons. While at Dens Park he was capped for the Scottish League XI in a 1–1 draw against the English League at Ibrox Park in March 1924. In end-of- season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid, Valencia CF and FC Barcelona.  Sunderland  In 1925 he joined Sunderland who paid £4,000 for his services. Replacing Charlie Buchan in the team, Halliday instantly became even more prolific south of the border than in the north. He hit his first 100 goals for Sunderland in just 101 games, and remains the quickest player to s century of English top division league goals. His 43 goals in 1928–29 made him top scorer in England's top division that season, making him the most recent of only two players to have been outright top scorer in the top divisions of both Scotland and England (the other was David McLean). He scored at least 35 league goals in each of the four full seasons he spent at Sunderland, and is the only player at any club to score 30 or more league goals in four consecutive seasons in England's top division. His lowest full seasonal league tally of 35 goals is higher than any other Sunderland player has achieved in their best season. Hence Halliday has the top four season-by-season league goal scoring tallies at Sunderland.\\"The Queens\\" by Iain McCartney on Creedon Publications, 2004 Halliday has a Sunderland goals to games ratio of 0.943, the highest of any striker in the club's history. He struck 165 goals in 175 games for the Black Cats comprising 156 league goals from 166 games and nine in nine FA Cup outings. He scored 12 Sunderland hat-tricks, more than any other player. He hit scored 4 goals in a game on three occasions. He is also Sunderland's third highest goalscorer of all time. His 165 Sunderland goals were all in his first 168 games at Roker Park before scoring in none of his last seven games. Despite Halliday's goals feats with Sunderland, he managed no better than third place in the league with the club, achieved in the 1925–26 and 1926–27 seasons. While at Sunderland in November 1927, Halliday's brother Billy joined nearby rivals Newcastle United.  Arsenal  In 1929 Halliday was signed by Arsenal. He debuted against Birmingham City on 9 November 1929. Halliday endured a relatively goalless start for him, playing in an Arsenal team off- form largely attributed at the time to injury affecting key playmaker Alex James. Manager Herbert Chapman tried different combinations in attack before James, and subsequently the rest of the team, began to find form in late January. Jack Lambert had been recalled at centre-forward. With Arsenal's form in upswing, Lambert remained Chapman's first choice for the number 9 jersey for the rest of the season with Halliday only an occasional first teamer, though he played in the 6–6 record scoring game against Leicester City on Easter Monday 21 April 1930. Halliday scored four putting him on six goals from his four most recent first team games at that point. Arsenal's next game after the Leicester match was the 1930 FA Cup Final. Chapman recalled Jack Lambert at centre-forward for the final, and the decision was vindicated with James and Lambert scoring in the 2–0 win over Chapman's previous club, Huddersfield Town. Chapman started the league campaign the next season with the five forwards from the cup final. Arsenal scored 127 goals in 42 games winning the league by seven points in the era of the two points for a win. Halliday scored regularly playing for the reserves (39 goals in 29 reserve games in his year at Arsenal), but with Lambert top scoring for the first team with 38 goals in 1930–31, Halliday stayed out of the first team. Halliday's four-goal game against Leicester was his last Arsenal first team appearance. He scored 8 goals in 15 games for Arsenal (and also played in a game against Middlesbrough which was abandoned after 55 minutes and hence is not counted in official statistics).  Manchester City  Halliday signed for Manchester City in November 1930, a year after joining Arsenal, for a fee of £5,700. At City, Halliday hit 47 goals in 76 league games as well as four goals from six cup appearances that took City to the 1931–32 FA Cup semi-finals when they lost to a last-minute Arsenal goal. He scored a hat-trick against former club Sunderland in just ten minutes in January 1932. Halliday though missed the 1933 FA Cup Final, which City lost to Everton.  Clapton Orient  He saw out his senior playing career with Clapton Orient between December 1933 and June 1935. He top scored for Orient in both seasons in which he played there despite arriving in late December. In his 18 months there he hit 36 strikes in 56 competitive first team games.  Yeovil & Petters United  After leaving Orient, Halliday became player-manager of non-league Yeovil & Petters United. He top scored in both his full seasons there with 22 and 47 goals respectively. He also scored a further three goals in the FA Cup proper. In that run they defeated Ipswich Town and Gainsborough Trinity to reach the third round playing against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He had already reached agreement between Yeovil and Aberdeen that he would take over as Aberdeen manager immediately after the Manchester United tie.  Playing statistics, records and rankings Excluding Queen of the South figures as they were non-league until 1923/24, Dave Halliday scored 92 league goals in Scotland in 139 appearances and a further 13 in 21 Scottish Cup appearances. In England he scored 244 league goals in 310 appearances and a further 19 FA Cup goals in an unknown number of appearances (16 while with league clubs) for a total of 368 first class goals. It is worth noting that a large chunk of his career was spent playing under the old offside rule and that all his league goals bar the season and a half with Clapton Orient in the Third South were scored in the top flight in both Scotland and England. * In the IFFHS list of the most successful top division goalscorers of all time (updated in 2008 from their previous list published in 1996), Halliday was 54th in the world with 303 from 396 top flight games in Scotland and England (at least four players have since exceeded Halliday's top flight goal tally including Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). * Fastest player to 100 English Top Division Goals: 101 games * Only player to score at least 30 English top division goals in 4 consecutive seasons: 1925-1929 at Sunderland * 19th highest scorer in English football's top division: 211 goals at Sunderland, Arsenal and Manchester City * Second most prolific English football goals per game strike rate of the 27 players to score 200 or more English top division goals at that level: 0.82 goals per game behind Dixie Dean's 0.86 goals per game * In the list of footballers with the combined highest number of league goals in England and Scotland from all senior divisions, Halliday is 10th with 336 goals from 449 games. * Sunderland highest all time season by season league goal scoring positions, Halliday takes all 4 top slots: 1) 1928-29, 43 goals; 2) 1925-26, 38 goals; 3) 1926-27, 36 goals; 4) 1927-28, 35 goals * Sunderland most prolific goals per game striker: 165 goals from 175 = 0.943 goals per game * Sunderland all-time highest goal scorers: 3rd * Sunderland player with the highest number of scoring three goals in a game: 1st (12 three goal games). He also scored 4 goals in a game 3 times * His 211 English top division goals make him the highest scorer at that level never to receive a full international cap. He was consistently overlooked by the selectors for the Scottish national side, usually in favour of another player who started at Queen of the South, Hughie Gallacher. The only other player to score 200 English top division goals and never receive an international cap is Leicester's Arthur Chandler. * Dundee highest all time seasonal league goals record: 38 (1923–24) Dave Halliday goals at senior clubs:- {  !

He led the Dons to a 3–2 victory against Rangers in the 1945–46 Southern League Cup Final; this a national competition in all but name and predecessor to the Scottish League Cup launched the season after. Halliday then guided Aberdeen to 1946–47 Scottish Cup success, defeating the emerging Hibernian team who were on course to become Scottish league champions in three of the next five seasons. This was the first major trophy won by the club. He returned to the Scottish Cup Final again in 1953, losing a replay 1–0 to Rangers, then in 1954 was Scottish Cup runner-up again, this time losing 2–1 to Celtic. He led Aberdeen to their first-ever Scottish Football League title in 1954–55. Only Alex Ferguson has since taken Aberdeen to the Scottish League title.  Leicester City  After leaving Aberdeen in 1955 he spent three years at the helm of Leicester City, guiding them to the 1956–57 Second Division title. Although Halliday left in 1958, the 1957 promotion was the beginning of Leicester's longest run to date in the England's top division, 12 seasons.

He is the 1971 U.S. national champion and North American champion. He placed 6th at the 1968 Winter Olympics and 5th at the 1972 Winter Olympics. His best finish at the World Championships was 4th in 1972; he placed 5th in 1969, 1970, and 1971. In 1972, he won the gold medal at the World University Games. http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/figure-skating-john- misha-petkevich/1100066256?ean=9781568000701 Petkevich was coached by Arthur Bourke and Gustave Lussi. He was known as a particularly dynamic free skater for his time. His emphasis on freer musical expression and less rigid body lines set him apart from most other men's singles competitors of his era. He has also been credited with innovating fashion for male competitors by wearing a more athletic costume of a jumpsuit and turtleneck sweater rather than the more formal suit-and-tie outfit that was otherwise universal in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, many other skaters had emulated Petkevich's costume style. In 1970, while a student at Harvard University, Petkevich founded An Evening with Champions, a long-running annual ice show that raises money to benefit the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.http://www.aneveningwithchampions.org/ An Evening with Champions web site Petkevich was the recipient of an unusual trophy. At the 1947 World Figure Skating Championships, Ulrich Salchow was particularly impressed by Dick Button's skating, and gave him one of his own trophies. Following the 1972 Olympics, Button passed on Salchow's trophy to Petkevich. In 2010, Petkevich passed the trophy to Paul Wylie, keeping alive the meaning of the trophy which is meant to reward a skater for having had a material impact on the sport. Following his competitive career, Petkevich attended University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, earning a Ph.D. in cell biology in 1978. He subsequently studied music privately, was a Fellow in the Music Department at Harvard, and was composer-in-residence at Eliot House, Harvard. In 1983, he joined Hambrecht & Quist as a securities analyst following the biotechnology industry. From 1987 to 1989, he pursued healthcare investment banking. In 1989, he joined Robertson Stephens & Co. as Managing Director and served several roles including Head of Healthcare Banking and Head of Investment Banking. In 2008, he founded The Petkevich Group, a boutique advisory firm where he was Chairman and CEO from 1998 to 2005. In 2006, he co-founded along with Dennis McCoy, MD, BladeRock Capital, the General Partner of the V2M Life Sciences Fund. The Fund makes contrarian investments in undervalued public companies, which are developing medical breakthrough products that address large, unmet medical needs. In 2014 and 2015, BladeRock Capital was renamed V2M Capital and was reorganized with Petkevich as the sole Chief Investment Officer. Petkevich is on the Board of Trustees of the United States Figure Skating Foundation, serves as its Treasurer and is Chairman of the Investment Committee. Previously, he served on the Board of the San Francisco Opera, on the Advisory Board of the Gladstone Institute, and on the Foundation Board of UCSF. Petkevich is the author of Figure Skating: Championship Techniques (), one of the standard reference works on figure skating technique. He has also served as a figure skating analyst for NBC, CBS, and ESPN. Petkevich has also composed a Clarinet Quintet, a Piano Trio, A Sonata for Piano and a number of songs in different genre. Most have the compositions have been played in small concerts. Results {  - !

When the Second Punic War ended, the Carthaginians relinquished the control of its Hispanic territories to Rome. The Celtiberians shared a border with this new Roman province. They started to confront the Roman army acting in the areas around Celtiberia and this led to the First Celtiberian War. The Roman victory in this war and the peace treaties established by the Roman praetor Gracchus with several tribes led to 24 years of relative peace. In 154 BC, the Roman senate objected to the Belli town of Segeda building a circuit of walls, and declared war. Thus, the Second Celtiberian War (154–152 BC) started. At least three tribes of Celtiberians were involved in the war: the Titti, the Belli (towns of Segeda and Nertobriga) and the Arevaci (towns of Numantia, Axinum and Ocilis). After some initial Celtiberian victories, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus inflicted some defeats and made peace with the Celtiberians. The next consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, attacked the Vaccaei, a tribe living in the central Duero valley which was not at war with Rome. He did so without the authorisation of the senate, with the excuse that the Vaccaei had mistreated the Carpetani. The Second Celtiberian War overlapped with the Lusitanian War of (154–150 BC). The third major rebellion following the Celtiberian Wars was the Numantine War (143–133 BC), sometimes considered as the Third Celtiberian War. Prelude The Romans took over the territories of the Carthaginians in southern Hispania when they defeated them at the Battle of Ilipa in 206 BC during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). After the war, they established two Roman provinces: Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain) along most of the east coast, an area roughly corresponding to the modern autonomous communities of Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia, and Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain) in the south, roughly corresponding to modern Andalusia. There were numerous rebellions by many tribes of Hispania, including tribes both inside and outside Roman territory, in most years for 98 years, until the end of the First Celtiberian War in 179 BC. The Celtiberians, or Hispanic coalitions formed in part by Celtiberians, soon clashed with the new imperial power. In 197 BC, 20,000 Celtiberians attacked a Roman army near Iliturgis, and in 195 BC, 10,000 Celtiberians joined the Turduli against Rome. A consular army by Cato the Elder was sent to the Celtiberia, and, despite not being able to take Saguntia,Traditionally identified as Sigüenza, but other interpretations exist http://www.occidens.es/pdfs/publi/Perez_Rubio_Coaliciones_mundo_celtiberico.pdf prompted the Celtiberians to stop hostilities in 195 BC. Soon after Cato returned to Rome, in 193 BC, a coalition of Celtiberians, Vaccei and Vettones was defeated by Marco Fulvio Nobilior near Toletum. In the same area, in the 185 BC, a new Hispanic coalition (probably of Celtiberians, Vettones and Carpetani), defeated two praetorian armies, but were defeated in another clash near the Tagus river.Alberto Pérez Rubio, \\"Coaliciones en el mundo celtibérico\\", VII Simposio sobre los celtíberos (2014) http://www.occidens.es/pdfs/publi/Perez_Rubio_Coaliciones_mundo_celtiberico.pdf In 182 BC, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus would step up the pressure by acting closer to Celtiberia. Flaccus conquered the city of Urbicua.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.16 In response, the Celtiberians raised an army of 35,000 men.‘hardly ever before had they raised so large a force’. Livy, The History of Rome, 40.30 The First Celtiberian War (181–179 BC) The siege of Aebura (Carpetania) (181 BC) To confront the 35,000-strong Celtiberian army, Flaccus received reinforcements of 3,000 Roman and 6,000 allied infantry and 200 Roman and 300 allied cavalry, and raised as many auxiliary troops from the friendly tribes as he could. He went to Carpetania and defeated the Celtiberian army near Aebura.Talavera de la Reina, in western part of the modern province of Toledo; it was at the edge of the territory of the Vettones 23,000 Celtiberians died and 4,700 were captured, against losses of 200 Romans, 800 allies and 2,400 native auxiliaries, and the Romans seized the city.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.30,31,32 The details given by Livy suggest that the Celtiberians formed an organised coalition, using an army composed both by cavalry and infantry, and fighting in closed battle formations by using banners.Alberto Pérez Rubio, \\"Coaliciones en el mundo celtibérico\\", VII Simposio sobre los celtíberos (2014) http://www.occidens.es/pdfs/publi/Perez_Rubio_Coaliciones_mundo_celtiberico.pdf Flaccus campaigns in the Celtiberia (180-179 BC) Quintus Fulvius Flaccus then marched across Carpetania and went to Contrebia.Most probably Contrebia Carbica, a Celtiberian city whose remains are thought to be those found in Fosos de Bayona, Cuenca. p.216-217 F. Burillo, \\"Los celtíberos. Etnias y estados\\", 1998 A Celtiberian army was sent to protect the city, but due to the intense rains it arrived when the city had already surrendered. The Celtiberians were caught by surprise by the Roman army exiting the city. Most escaped, but 12,000 men died and 5,000 men, 400 horses and 62 banners were captured. The fugitives bumped into another body of Celtiberians on its way to Contrebia which, on being told about the defeat, dispersed. Quintus Fulvius marched through Celtiberian territory, ravaged the countryside and stormed many forts until the Celtiberians surrendered.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.33 Since his successor, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, was late, Flaccus started a third campaign against the Celtiberians who had not surrendered, ravaging the more distant parts of Celtiberia, where the Lusones lived.He confronted Celtiberian tribes that lived along the River Iberus, including the Lusones (a small Celtiberian tribe in the north of Celtiberia, in the high Tajuña River valley, northeast of Guadalajara). The city of Complega was mentioned. Appian, Roman History, The Foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 42 On his way back to Tarraco to hand the command of the army to Gracchus, Flaccus was ambushed at the Manlian Pass. Flaccus defeated the Celtiberians (killing 17,000 and capturing 3,700 men and 600 horses), but suffered important losses (4400 men).Livy, The History of Rome, 40.39.1-8; 40.1-13 Flaccus continued to Tarraco, and then to Rome with his some of veterans, while Gracchus went to Celtiberia.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.40.14-15 Gracchus campaigns in the Celtiberia (179 BC) Assisted by his colleague, Lucius Postumius Albinus,While Tiberius Gracchus headed into the furthest part of Celtiberia, Albinus was to march against the Vaccaei (who lived to the east of Celtiberia) and then join Gracchus in Celtiberia. Livy gives contradictory statements about the results of Albinus' campaign. He mentions a great battle against the Vaccaei, killing 35,000, but thought that ‘it would be nearer the truth to say that he arrived in his province too late in the summer to undertake a campaign’. Livy, The History of Rome, 41.3.1; 40.39.3; 40.50 Gracchus marched to Celtiberia. Gracchus first took the city of Munda,This must be an unknown town as the well-known town of Munda, near which Julius Caesar fought the last battle of his civil war, was in Baetica (Andalusia), in the south and then attacked the powerful town of Certima. The town asked for help to a Celtiberian military camp in the nearby city of Alce,It was probably the Alces which the Antonine itinerary placed between Augusta Emerita (Mérida) and Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza) who sent ten envoys to enquire the Romans about the reasons of the attack. After Gracchus ordered the entire army to march in review in front of them, the legates left and discouraged their people from sending aid to the besieged city. Munda surrendered, sent forty young nobles as hostages and an indemnity was imposed on them.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.44.4.5; 40.47 After Certima, Tiberius Gracchus defeated the Celtiberians guarding the military camp in Alce (Livy mentions 9,000 men and 320 men and 112 horses captured; 109 Romans fell). Gracchus then captured the city, and negotiated the defection of some important nobles, including what Livy thought was by far the most powerful man in Hispania, a Celtiberian chief named Thurru.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.48, 49. Ergavica, another Celtiberian city, was alarmed about the defeats of its neighbours and opened its gates to the Romans.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.39.3; 41.3.1 In addition, Gracchus defeated 20,000 Celtiberians who were besieging the city of Caravis (Magallon, in north-western Aragon), an ally of Rome, and conquered the city of Complega.Appian, Roman History, The Foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 43 Livy thought that some of the surrenders were in bad faith because whenever Gracchus left hostilities resumed and there was also a major battle near Mons Chaunus (probably Moncayo Massif) with many casualties on both sides. Three days later there was a bigger battle which cost the defeated Celtiberians 22,000 casualties and the capture of 300 men and 300 horses. This last defeat was so decisive that prompted an end to hostilities.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.39.3; 41.3.1 Aftermath Gracchus signed a series of treaties with the Celtiberians that ‘were longed for in subsequent wars’.Appian, Roman History, The Foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 43 Unlike previous praetors he spent time to negotiate and cultivate personal relations with tribal leaders. After the surrender of Complega, he allocated land to the poor and made carefully defined treaties with the surrounding tribes and the surrounding country, binding them to be friends of Rome.Appian, Roman History, The Foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 43 Gracchus imposed the vicensima, the requisition 5% of the grain harvest, a form of tax which was more efficient and less vulnerable to abuse than the usual Roman practice of tendering tax collection to private ‘tax farmers.’ Silva notes this is the first reference to a regulatory collection of revenue.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, p. 263 n. 75 His treaties stipulated that the allies were to provide the Romans with auxiliary troops. They also established that the natives could fortify existing cities, but not found new ones.Curchin, L., A., A Roman Spain, pp. 32-33 There is some evidence that he introduced civilian administrative measures, such the issuing of rights for mining to mint coins and the construction of roads.Richardson, J., R., Hispaniae, Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, pp. 112-123 In addition, Gracchus founded the colony (settlement) of Gracchurris (Alfaro, in La Rioja, northern Hispania) in the Upper Ebro Valley; and Iliturgi, a mining town and a frontier outpost in Hispania Ulterior.Knapp, R. C., Aspects of The Roman Experience in Iberia 206 BC-100 BC, p. 110, n. 18 Gracchus' administrative arrangements and treaties ensured peace in the conquered territory for the next quarter of a century.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, p. 58 Apart from a few minor episodes, Hispania remained quiet until the outbreak of the Lusitanian War (155–150 BC) and the Second Celtiberian War (154–151 BC). Second Celtiberian War (154–152 BC) Causes Appian wrote that this war broke out because Segeda (near Zaragoza), a powerful city of the Celtiberian tribe of the Belli, persuaded the people of some smaller towns to settle there and was building a circuit of walls seven kilometres long. It also forced the neighbouring Titti to join in. The Belli had agreed to the treaties Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus had made with tribes in Hispania at the end of the First Celtiberian War. Rome considered that Segeda was breaking the treaty. It forbade the building of the wall, demanded the tribute and the provision of a contingent for the Roman army in accordance with the stipulations of Gracchus' treaty. The Segedans replied that the treaty forbade the construction of new towns, but did not forbid the fortification existing ones. They also said that they had been subsequently released from the tribute and the military contingent by the Romans. This was true, but the senate argued that when it granted such exemptions it always specified that they were to continue only during its pleasure.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 44 The senate must have decided to withdraw the exemptions because it was worried about the development of Segeda into a powerful city in the land of the Celtiberians, who had a history of rebellions. Rome prepared for war. Victories of the Celtiberian coalition In 153 BC the praetor Quintus Fabius Nobilitor arrived in Hispania with a force of nearly 30,000 men. The people of Segeda, whose wall had not been completed, fled and sought refuge among the Arevaci. The Arevaci welcomed them and chose a Segedan, Carus, as their commander. He prepared 20,000 infantry and 500 cavalry for an ambush in a thick forest and attacked the Romans as they were passing through. It was a long battle, which he won; 6,000 Romans were killed. Carus was killed together with 6,000 of his men by the Roman cavalry which was guarding the Roman baggage while he was pursuing the fugitives from the battle in a disorderly manner. Nevertheless, the battle was a disaster for the Romans and, from then, on they would not engage in battle on the day of the festival of the god Vulcan because this defeat occurred on that day.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 45 The Arevaci assembled at the town of Numantia (7 km north of Soria) which had strong natural defences, and chose Ambo and Leuco as their leaders. Three days later Nobilitor encamped four kilometres from the town. He was joined by 300 cavalry and ten elephants sent by Masinissa, the king of Numidia, a Roman ally in Africa. Before the ensuing battle, Nobilitor placed the elephants at the rear so that they would not be seen and then divided the army into two. During the battle he brought them into view. This frightened the enemy, who had never seen these animals. They fled inside the town. Nobilitor attacked the city walls and there was a fierce battle. Then an elephant was hit by a large falling stone and made a loud noise which frightened the other elephants. They went on the rampage, trampling over the Romans, who took to disorderly flight. The Numantines made a sortie and killed 4,000 Romans and three elephants. Nobilitor then attacked the town of Axinium which stored the enemy supplies, but did not achieve anything. He lost many men and returned to his camp at night. He sent his cavalry commander to pursue an alliance with a neighbouring tribe and ask for cavalry assistance. He was given some horsemen, but an ambush was prepared against him when he was on his way back. In the resultant ambush the allied horsemen fled and the Roman commander and many of his troops were killed. These Roman disasters encouraged the town of Ocilis (Medinaceli, in the modern province of Soria) to defect to the Celtiberians. The Roman provisions were kept in this town. Nobilitor withdrew to his winter camp and suffered food shortages. Because of this, heavy snowstorms and frost many of his men died.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 46-7 In 152 BC Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul for the third time, took over the command, bringing 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to Hispania. An ambush against him was prepared, but he avoided it by moving cautiously and he encamped in front of Ocilis. He seized the town, granted it pardon, took hostages and imposed a fine of thirty talents. His moderation encouraged the people of Nertobriga (a town of the Belli, in the modern province of Zaragoza) to ask for peace. Marcellus asked for 100 cavalry and they agreed. However, in the meantime the Roman rear guard was attacked and a lot of booty was taken. When the promised cavalry arrived its leaders said that this had been done by some people who did not know about the agreement with the Romans. Marcellus chained the horsemen, sold their horses, plundered the countryside and began to besiege the town, which sent a herald to ask for peace again. Marcellus stated that he would not grant peace unless the Arevaci, Belli, and Titti asked for it together. The Nertobriges sent ambassadors to these tribes and asked Marcellus for leniency and for the renewal of the treaty made with Gracchus. This was opposed by some rural people who had been incited to war. Marcellus sent envoys from each party to Rome to carry on their dispute there and sent private letters to the senate letters urging peace. He wanted to bring the war to an end himself and gain glory this way.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 47-8 The Celtiberians send envoys to Rome and agree to stop hostilities Appian wrote that the envoys of the friendly faction were treated as guests in the city, whereas those of the hostile faction were lodged outside the city walls, as customary. Polybius specified that it was the Belli and Titti who had taken the side of Rome. Because of this their envoys were admitted into the city, while those of the Arevaci, as they were enemies, were ordered to encamp on the other side of the River Tiber. The Senate heard the friendly envoys first. They said that if the rebels were not punished properly they would soon take up arms again and make the whole of Hispania inclined to rebel. They asked either that the Roman army should remain in Hispania and that it should be commanded by a consul to check the malpractices of the Arevaci or, if the troops were to be withdrawn, that Rome should inflict an exemplary punishment on them. According to Polybius, when the envoys of the Arevaci were heard, they came across as not being willing to submit or to accept defeat and gave the impression that they thought that they had fought more brilliantly than the Romans. They said that they would pay a penalty, should it be imposed on them, but demanded that the Romans should revert to the terms of the treaty of Tiberius Gracchus. The officers of Marcus Claudius Marcellus were then heard. It seemed that they were inclined towards peace and the senate thought that the consul was more disposed towards the enemy than the allies.Polybius, The Histories, 35.2, 3.1-2 Appian wrote that the senate was not happy that these people had refused the terms put forward earlier by Nobilitor. However, when he described the campaign by Nobilitor he did not mention him making any terms with the Celtiberians.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars,49 The senate replied that Marcellus would communicate its decision to them. Polybius wrote that the private opinion of the senate was that what the allies said was true and to the advantage of Rome, that the Arevaci had a high opinion of themselves and that Marcellus was afraid of war. It secretly ordered the officers Marcellus had sent to continue to fight. It mistrusted Marcellus and it was minded to send one of the new consuls to replace him. It made preparations for the campaign as if the future of Hispania depended in this, assuming that if the enemy was defeated all the other tribes would submit to Rome and that if the Arevaci could avoid further war they and all others tribes would be encouraged to resist. Quintus Fulvius Nobilitor spread rumours of continuous battles and great Roman losses and about the valour of the Celtiberians, as well as claims that Marcellus was afraid of continuing the war. The young recruits panicked and found excuses to avoid recruitment which could not be verified. Competent officers were not willing to serve. Then, the young Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus spoke in the senate and asked to be allowed to be sent to Hispania as an officer or a junior commander and that he was ready to assume such role. He was willing to do so even though he had been given the safer task of going to Macedon where he had been invited to go to settle disputes there. All were surprised because of his youth and cautious disposition. He became popular and made those who had been avoiding military service feel ashamed. The young men enlisted and the officers volunteered.Polybius, The Histories, 35.3.4-9; 4 Appian wrote that the army to be sent to Hispania was chosen by lot instead of the customary levy. It was the first time this happened. This was because ‘many had complained that they had been treated unfairly by the consuls in the enrolment, while others had been chosen for easy service’.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 49 In 151 BC the new consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, was assigned Hispania. While he was on his way, Marcellus told the Celtiberians about the impending war and returned the hostages. He had a long conversation with the chief of the embassy which had gone to Rome. He sought to persuade the Celtiberians to put matters in his hands because he wanted to bring the war to an end before the arrival of Lucullus. After this 5,000 Arevaci took possession of the city of Nertobriga and Marcellus encamped near Numantia. While he was driving the inhabitants inside the wall, their leader asked for a meeting with Marcellus. He said that the Arevaci, Belli and Titti would put themselves in his hands. He demanded and received hostages and money and let them go free. Thus, Marcellus managed to bring the war to an end before the arrival of Lucullus.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 48-50 Lucullus' illegal war on the Vaccaei Appian wrote that Lucius Licinius Lucullus was greedy for fame and money and attacked the Vaccaei because he was ‘in straitened circumstances'. This was despite the fact that the senate had not declared war on them and this tribe had never attacked the Romans. He crossed the River Tagus and encamped near the town of Cauca (Coca) The inhabitants asked him what he had come for and what the reason for war was. He replied that they had mistreated the Carpetani and that he had come to their aid. The Caucaei attacked a party of Roman wood cutters and foragers, killed many of them and pursued the fugitives to their camp. In the ensuing battle, being more like a light infantry, they had the advantage at first. However, when they run out of darts they fled and 3,000 of them were killed while they were forcing their way through the gates. The town elders sought peace. Lucullus demanded hostages, 100 talents of silver and a contingent of cavalry for his army. When these were provided, he also demanded that the town be garrisoned by the Romans. This was agreed and Lucullus ordered 2,000 picked soldiers to seize the city. Then the rest of the Roman army, which had been ordered to kill all adult males, was let in. Only a few out of 20,000 managed to escape. Some of them went to other towns. They burnt what they could not take with them to deprive Lucullus of booty.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 51-2 Lucullus marched on the town of Itercatia (location uncertain), where more than 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry had taken refuge. He called for peace talks. The inhabitants reproached him for the slaughter of the Caucaei and asked him if he intended to do the same to them. Appian wrote: \\"he, like all guilty souls, being angry with his accusers instead of reproaching himself, laid waste their fields\\". He then begun a siege and repeatedly lined up his men for battle to provoke a fight. The enemy did not respond. One man often rode into the gaps between the Roman armies and challenged for single fight. Nobody accepted and he went back making insulting gestures. Then the young Scipio Aemilianus accepted and luckily defeated this big man even though he was small. This lifted the spirit of the Romans. However, the next night an enemy cavalry contingent which had gone out foraging before Lucullus had arrived run about shouting and those inside the city also shouted. This caused terror in the Roman camp. The soldiers were sick due to lack of sleep and dysentery caused by the local food they were not used to. Many died of the latter. When some of the siege works were completed the Romans knocked down a section of the city walls, but they were quickly overpowered. They fled and not knowing the area many fell into a reservoir and died. The enemy repaired the wall. As both sides suffered famine, Scipio Aemilianus proposed peace and promised that it would not be violated. The Itercalati trusted him and gave Lucullus 10,000 cloaks, some cattle and fifty hostages as part of the terms.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 53-4 Next Lucullus went to Pallantia (Pelencia). This town was hosting a large number of refugees and was renowned for its bravery. He was advised to avoid it, but he heard that it was a rich town. He encamped there and did not leave until constant harassment of the Roman foragers by the Pallantian cavalry prevented him from getting supplies. The Romans withdrew and were pursued by the enemy until they reached the River Durius (Douro). Then they went back home at night. Lucullus went to the territory of the Turdetani and went into winter camps This was the end of his illegal war against the Vaccaei. He was never called to account for it.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 54 Appian commented: \\"As for the gold and silver that Lucullus was after (and for the sake of which he had waged this war, thinking that all of Hispania abounded with gold and silver), he got nothing. Not only did they have none, but these particular [tribes] did not set any value on those metals.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 54 In his account of the Lusitanian War, Appian wrote that Lucullus and Servius Sulpicius Galba, a praetor who was in charge of the troops in Hispania Ulterior and was campaigning against a Lusitanian rebellion, conducted a joint pincer operation against Lusitania. According to Appian they gradually depopulated it. Appian described Galba as being even more Greedy than Lucullus. He killed many Lusitanians by treachery.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 59 Aftermath In 147 BC, four years after the end of the Second Celtiberian War, the Lusitanians, who had rebelled between 155 BC and 150 BC, rebelled again in the Viriathic War (147–139 BC). In 144 BC, the fourth year of this war, Viriathus, the Lusitanian leader, incited the Celtiberians to rebel. This led to the Numantine War (143–133 BC), which was the longest war of resistance against the Romans. Sources The First Celtiberian War is covered in Livy's detailed History of Rome. The books of Livy's work which cover the period of the Second Celtiberian War have been lost. Only a few fragments of Polybius' writings about Hispania are extant. We only have four fragments on the Second Celtiberian War and these only cover the story of Celtiberian envoys who went to Rome. For this war were rely on Appian's books on the wars in Hispania.

New York Fire Department hiring case In 2007, the United States Department of Justice, joined by the Vulcan Society, an organization of black firefighters, and three individual applicants, filed a lawsuit against New York City alleging that the city's written firefighter entrance exam excluded a disproportionate number of black and Hispanic applicants. At that time, just three percent of the department's 11,000 firefighters were black and 4.5 percent were Hispanic despite the fact that over half the population of New York City was black or Hispanic. On October 5, 2011, Garaufis ruled that a court-appointed monitor would be installed to oversee the New York City Fire Department's efforts to hire and retain more minorities. While the ruling did not impose racial quotas, it explained that a systemic effort by the Fire Department was required. On September 28, 2012, Garaufis approved a new entrance exam for firefighters after the city submitted data showing that the test did not discriminate. The first class of recruits after the ruling included some recruits that were older than had been typical of previous classes. Injuries in that class were higher and the dropout rate, usually 10 percent, was 24 percent for that class. On May 14, 2013, an appeals court disagreed with Garaufis's finding that the discrimination was intentional. The appeals court determined that the question of intentionality, which was relevant to the amount of damages the city might have to pay, should go to trial under a different judge. After the appeals court's ruling, the parties settled the remaining claims in the case, and the entire case was referred to Garaufis for oversight of the settlement. The number of minority firefighters in the department doubled to 1,230 between 2002 and 2013. On June 28, 2018, the Fire Department reported that forty-three percent of the nearly 2,300 top scorers on its most recent entrance exam were black or Hispanic. In October 2018, people of color comprised more than 40 percent of the class graduating from the training academy.  Bryant Neal Vinas terrorism case  On May 11, 2017, Garaufis sentenced Bryant Neal Vinas to time served for providing material support for terrorism, giving the highly cooperative informant three months more in prison before beginning a life on probation. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals In 2016, Martín Batalla Vidal, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), filed a federal lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York challenging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s decision to revoke his work permit in connection with the nationwide injunction issued by the Southern District of Texas. The Texas case sought to block the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and an expansion of DACA. On September 29, 2016, the advocacy organization Make the Road New York (MRNY) joined Batalla Vidal's lawsuit. On February 13, 2018, Garaufis issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining rescission of the DACA program. Garaufis found that Plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction. The government appealed Garaufis's decision to the Second Circuit, which heard oral argument on January 25, 2019.

He also led the team with 61 runs scored, while ranking 3rd in games (114) and doubles(17). Lewis finished the season with a .250 batting average, but as a result of leading the team in walks with 68, wound up with a .361 on-base percentage.

It was published and developed by Marvelous Interactive Inc., and released in Japan on March 17, 2005 and in North America on September 12, 2006. It is the first entry in the series without series creator Yasuhiro Wada heavily involved, though it borrows many assets from Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town and Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, such as the graphical style from the former and setting of the latter. Plot The player is a young man who lives with his friend Takakura on a farm in Forget- Me-Not-Valley, at roughly the same time as Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. The game begins with the Harvest Goddess, a deity of Harvest Moon, and the Witch Princess fighting. Neither can win, so they part ways. The Witch Princess, on meeting the Harvest Goddess next, attempts to cast a spell to silence her, but instead petrifies her. While trying to undo her spell, the Witch Princess inadvertently sends the Harvest Goddess to another world, so she sends all of the Harvest Sprites (small, elf-like creatures) to the same world to rescue her. The Witch Princess then tells the player to bring all of the Harvest Sprites back in order to rescue the Harvest Goddess. Living in the valley are a number of villagers, nine bachelorettes, and five rival bachelors. The characters and locations in Harvest Moon DS are the same as those in Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life with a few minor exceptions. Gameplay Players earn money primarily through their farm, by growing crops or raising livestock. Growing crops is slightly different from previous Harvest Moon games; rather than being restricted to his own farm land, the player may grow crops on unowned fields of various sizes and fertility all over the valley. Each crop must be planted during a certain season; for example, turnips must be planted in the spring. Players begin the game with only a dog and a cat on their farm. While the cat does little, the dog may be trained to fetch balls and chase away wild dogs from the farm. Cows, sheep, ducks, and chickens are available for purchase, and must be housed in different types of pens, which must be bought from Gotz, the town's woodcutter. Cows and sheep require an animal shed to live in before they may be purchased, and ducks and chickens require a bird shed. After the player ships 1000 items, Takakura will bring him a horse to keep. This horse does not need to be fed, and cannot get sick. However, it can be brushed to increase its affection towards the player. After earning enough money, the player may upgrade their house by calling Gotz, and buy a kitchen, appliances, or furniture items by using the Harvest Sprite Shopping Network. If players upgrade their home twice, buy certain items, and rescue 60 Harvest Sprites, they may choose to marry. If the wife's affection is kept high for a season after marriage, she will become pregnant and give birth two seasons later. The game skips forward by three years after the birth, resulting in changes in the villager's lives but no change to the player's farm. Extra content, as well as characters from Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, can be unlocked by inserting a copy of Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town or More Friends of Mineral Town into the slot 2 of an original DS or DS Lite. However, marrying any of the bachelorettes from Mineral Town results in the game ending immediately; placing you back at your last save after the wedding. There are a total of 101 Harvest Sprites to be rescued. They belong to different teams based on what skills they have (such as fishing or watering crops), and are divided into two sets. The first set of Harvest Sprite teams, after rescue, can be hired to help the player. The second set of teams cannot be hired, and fulfill specific purposes, such as running the casino or television stations. Rescuing the Harvest Sprites requires various farm related activities; activities related to a Harvest Sprite's skill will generally result in its rescue. Release Japanese versions of Harvest Moon DS can only connect to their Japanese counterparts, and while this feature is not available on PAL Harvest Moon DS cartridges, NTSC Harvest Moon DS cartridges can connect with PAL and NTSC Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town cartridges. Instead of offering poker and blackjack in the Harvest Sprite Casino, in PAL games all three sprites offer memory matching. Reception Nintendo Power gave Harvest Moon DS a score of 6.0/10.0, and GameZone gave Harvest Moon DS a 9.2/10. Harvest Moon DS Cute is the female version of Harvest Moon DS for the Nintendo DS. It was published and developed by Marvelous Interactive Inc., and first released in Japan on December 8, 2005. Harvest Moon DS Cute replaces the male protagonist from Harvest Moon DS with a female character; players may choose either Pony from Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life or Claire from Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town. Basic gameplay remains unaltered between the two versions. The plot of Harvest Moon DS Cute is different from that of Harvest Moon DS. In this version of the game, the player's mother sends a wish to the Harvest Goddess that you may be a successful farmer. The Harvest Goddess eventually determines the player has no work ethic, and tells the Harvest King what she thinks. The Harvest King angrily tells the Harvest Goddess she isn't trying hard enough, and she is slacking off in her old age. The Harvest Goddess then calls the Harvest King a \\"big baldy\\", and is turned into stone. The Harvest Sprites defend the Harvest Goddess, which angers the Harvest King even more, and he sends the Harvest Sprites and the Harvest Goddess to another world as punishment. He then writes a letter to the player telling her if she works hard, he will return the Harvest Sprites and the Harvest Goddess. The Japanese version introduced a system not present in the North American version known as the \\"Best Friend\\" system. This allowed the player to marry only the four \\"special\\" bachelorettes from Harvest Moon DS, as well as any of the bachelors.

He played over 200 games for Newcastle before and after the Second World War, scoring a total of 52 goals. NUFC all-time top goalscorers Pearson was renowned as a skilful and entertaining outside-left, although he won no major honours at St James' Park.

Pearson was at the match as a spectator, but agreed to turn out for England.http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/lo/extra/7022508.html He was capped twice by Scotland in 1947, which uniquely meant that he had played for both Scotland and England. In 1948, he was signed by Aberdeen for £4,000, and quickly became a crowd favourite, renowned particularly for his 'double shuffle', which baffled opposing players and spectators alike. Pearson retired at the age of 40, and took up a career as a sports writer, often covering Aberdeen for the Scottish Daily Mail. Managerial career In November 1959, Pearson was appointed manager of Aberdeen, in spite of his lack of coaching or managerial experience, and the six years he had spent outside the game, albeit as an observer. Unusually, his predecessor, Davie Shaw stayed on at the club in his former capacity as coach. Pearson's time in office coincided with the departure or retirement of a number of key players, and long-term injuries to others, alleviated only briefly by the emergence of Charlie Cooke, soon on his way to Chelsea. There were a sequence of Scottish Cup exits to lower league teams, and in spite of a Summer Cup final, ultimately lost to Hibs in 1964, Pearson's reign ended with his resignation on 13 February 1965.

Frith is an English born Australian citizen and ornithologist. She is now a self-employed private, independent, zoological researcher, consultant, natural history author, and publisher. Dawn obtained her PhD, in littoral zone marine biology on a study of the biology of animals living on the littoral sponges with special reference to Halichondria panicea (Pallas), at London University and lectured in zoology before meeting Clifford Brodie Frith on Aldabra Atoll, Indian Ocean where she was a visiting scientist studying insects and he a staff scientist studying birds. Their full-time partnership began in April 1973. They married at Bangkok Central Police Station, in October 1975. In December 1977, they moved to tropical north Queensland, Australia, to start decades of field studies of bowerbirds and birds-of-paradise and other rainforest-dwelling bird species in tropical eastern Australia and in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Together they have published some 150 substantial scientific papers in international peer- reviewed zoological journals. Their studies are largely self-funded by proceeds from their own publishing partnership. Dawn has written and illustrated many semi-scientific and popular articles in magazines worldwide, has acted as scientific and/or technical adviser and/or associate producer to various feature and television film makers. She has much experience of giving personal presentations at both popular and scientific levels, and also carries out ecological and avifaunal surveys for various environmental agencies in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Zoologist Dawn started her professional career as a zoology lecturer in England (1968–1973) before taking a year's absence from her position as a visiting scientist at the Royal Society of London Research Station Aldabra Atoll, Western Indian Ocean.

In 1974, she became a senior marine biologist/advisor at Phuket Marine Biological Centre, Phuket Island, Thailand, being employed by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DANIDA), Copenhagen, Denmark. Since 1977, Dawn, with Clifford B. Frith, has studied various aspects of tropical rainforest avifauna in Australia, New Guinea and elsewhere for over three decades. Her studies have resulted in many scientific publications (84 to date) on the behaviour, nesting biology, mating systems, and systematics of bowerbirds, birds-of-paradise, and other rainforest-dwelling bird species. Her systematic scientific studies have resulted in a major \\"definitive\\" ornithological text book - The Bowerbirds: Ptilonorhynchidae. She has performed part-time lecturing in Australia: at Monash University, Victoria and James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland. Awards In 1992, Dawn was awarded the Certificate of Honour by the Phuket Marine Biological Center \\"in recognition of support of the PMBC's endeavours in conducting research on marine science and conservation of marine environment and resources in Thailand\\".

Through a series of public appearances, hearings, press conferences and massive public demonstrations, Díaz led a citywide protest which drew national media attention. Díaz marched together with Rev. Al Sharpton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, actress Susan Sarandon, dozens of rabbis and other clergy, and was arrested for his peaceful protest. As a result, Díaz became known for his support of civil and human rights. The Rainbow Rebels In summer 2008, Díaz became a founding member of a progressive civic and political group known as the \\"Rainbow Rebels\\", who achieved sudden and widespread popularity throughout the Bronx County of New York. On August 22, 2008, the Rainbow Rebels made their first official announcement: Díaz joined with two of his Assembly colleagues Carl Heastie and Michael Benjamin, both Democratic African Americans, and with Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz of Riverdale and his powerful Benjamin Franklin Reform Democratic Club, to promote the candidacy of Elizabeth Taylor for a Civil Court judgeship. On September 9, 2008, Taylor won the Democratic primary for the judgeship, despite opposition from the Bronx County Leader, Jose Rivera, and the Bronx political machine known as \\"County\\". On September 28, 2008, at the Bronx County Committee meeting, the Rainbow Rebels won another significant victory by replacing the Bronx County Leader José Rivera with Assemblyman Carl Heastie. Bronx Borough President On February 18, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama appointed Bronx Borough president Adolfo Carrión Jr. to the position of Director of the White House Office on Urban Affairs. When Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared a special election to choose his successor, Díaz was considered the leading candidate for the position. The special election was held on April 21, 2009. Díaz defeated the Republican Party candidate Anthony Ribustello with an overwhelming 87% of the vote, to become the 13th borough president of the Bronx. On July 1, 2009, Díaz appointed Delores Fernandez to the reconstituted New York City Board of Education. Fernandez is anticipated to be the sole member of the Board who will have a perspective independent of the mayor, Michael Bloomberg. Díaz ended his first summer as borough president by recommending that the New York City Council reject Related Companies' proposal to turn the Kingsbridge Armory into a shopping mall. In an editorial in the New York Daily News, Díaz wrote that he is \\"fighting to make sure that this development includes 'living wage' jobs that offer health insurance\\". Related's proposal is still going through the city's review process. In 2017, Díaz won the Democratic primary for borough president with 86% of the vote. On the same day his father won the primary to return to the City Council from the Senate.  New York City mayoral campaign  In 2018, Diaz was the first candidate to file to run in the 2021 New York City mayoral election. Diaz dropped out In January 2020, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.  Personal life  Díaz lives in the southeast Bronx. He and his wife Hilda have two adult sons.

Their soundscapes combine electronic music processes with field recordings and range from light to dark ambient. History dreamSTATE was founded in 1995 by Toronto electronic musician Scott M2 (Scott McGregor Moore) who was soon joined by Jamie Todd (aka URM). Their first ambient installation, \\"waveforms\\" (1996), was mounted in the H5 holographic gallery in Toronto where it played continuously for 6 months. dreamSTATE's first CD release, \\"BETWEEN REALITIES\\" (1998), was a one-hour excerpt from that installation. They began performing their soundscapes live in 1997 and have continued to be active electronic music performers. In 2000 dreamSTATE began curating THE AMBiENT PiNG, a weekly live ambient performance event in Toronto providing a stage for developing artists in the genre and hosting notable touring performers such as Robert Rich, Sara Ayers, Alpha Wave Movement, Eric Wollo, Tom Heasley, James Johnson and Vir Unis. In 2004 they performed in the Huron Historic Gaol in Goderich, Ontario at the opening of the \\"Bread & Water\\" multi-media installation, which played for 3 months in the gaol. Their soundscapes from that installation (inspired by the book \\"Moon Sea Crossing\\" by poet Lynn Harrigan) were released as the CD \\"PASSAGE\\" in 2005. In 2006 dreamSTATE's concert CD \\"OM\\" was released, recorded live at the OM Festival 2000 in Tweed, Ontario.

Club career Bari João Paulo joined Italian club Bari in 1989, and formed a formidable striking partnership with Pietro Maiellaro and later with Romanian Florin Raducioiu. After scoring six goals in 33 Serie A matches in the 1989–90 season, he would score 12 times in the 1990–1991 season, the most memorable of which was a double against A.C. Milan on the penultimate round of the season, thus sealing the title for another club, Sampdoria, which won its first ever (and so far the only) Serie A title in that club's history. He started the following season brightly and was on his usually excellent form. But in their third match at home to Sampdoria, in torrential rain, his leg was broken by defender Marco Lanna in a tackle along the sidelines which ended his season. It took him an entire year to recover and he stayed on with Bari after its relegation to Serie B for two more seasons until 1994. International career João Paulo also played for the Brazilian national team, scoring twice (one goal apiece against Uruguay, and in the notorious match against Argentina) in the Copa América in 1991.

Social Science Quotations (description), pp. 198-99, also published in 1991 as The Macmillan Book of Social Science Quotations and as International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, v. 19. * \\"Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\\" (1935, p. 15) * \\"Economics is not about certain kinds of behaviour,\\" but \\"a certain aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity.\\" (pp. 16–17) * \\"Economics is entirely neutral between ends; ... in so far as any end is dependent on scarce means, it is germane to the preoccupations of the economist.\\" (p. 24) * \\"[W]ealth is not wealth because of its substantial properties. It is wealth because it is scarce.\\" (p. 47) * \\"The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility ..., whether true or false, can never be verified by observation or introspection.\\" ... [Nor does it] \\"justify the inference that transferences from rich to poor would increase total satisfaction... Interesting as a development of an ethical postulate, [such an effect] does not at all follow from the positive assumptions of pure theory.\\" (pp. 137, 141)Discussed further in Lionel Robbins, 1938, \\"Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility: A Comment,\\" Economic Journal, 48(192), pp. 635-641. * Economics as science is about \\"ascertainable facts\\" of the positive as distinct from normative (ethical) judgments on economic policy. (p. 148). The definition of economics above has been described as \\"central to the arguments presented\\" that followed in the EssayRoger E. Backhouse and Steven G.

Robbins argued that, at a certain stage in the development of the subject, an insufficiently restrictive and unifying definition multiplies activities of economists away from filling in explanatory gaps of the theory and solving problems posed by the subject (pp. 3–4). The Essay has been described as different from earlier writings on economic methodology in generating a range of tightly-argued, radical implications from a simple definition, for example in admitting an aspect of behaviour (rather than a list of behaviours) but not limiting the subject-matter of economics, provided that the influence of scarcity impinges on these (pp. 16–17). The broad behavioural definition is credited for its consistency with the expanding boundaries of economics decades later. In this Robbins both narrows the definition of economics, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of deduction, and opens up the subject-matter of economics.• Roger E. Backhouse and Steven G. Medema (2009). \\"Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition,\\" Economica, 76(302), Conclusions. [805–820. • George J. Stigler, 1984. \\"Economics—The Imperial Science?\\" Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 86(3), pp. 301-313.  Influence  Robbins's Essay is one of the most-cited works on the methodology and philosophy of economics for the period 1932-1960. Arguments therein have been widely accepted on the demarcation of economics as science from discussion of recommendations on economic policy.B. A. Corry (1987 [2008]). \\"Robbins, Lionel Charles,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 207 [pp. 206-08]. In that period, economists started referring to Robbins' definition of economics therein as generally accepted, along with continuing controversy that accompanied its blending into economics texts. With the application of the economic methods to social and other \\"non-economic\\" problems, acceptance of Robbins' expansive subject-matter definition in economics texts increased its prominence.

Upon his retirement from play, Eliuk coached one season with the Portland LumberJax and two with the Colorado Mammoth. Dallas played for 18 years, 15 seasons for the Philadelphia Wings before being traded to the LumberJax (per his request), where he played for three seasons. Eliuk won four championships with the Wings, two championship MVP awards, was named to the All-Pro team nine times, and retired as the league's all-time leader in saves. Because of his success, his longevity, and unparalleled acrobatic athleticism, he is considered a legend in indoor lacrosse, and widely regarded as the best goalie to ever to play the game. thumbnail Eliuk was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame November 2013. Eliuk and Jim Veltman were inducted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame in March, 2009. In January 2005, when the Wings were in Anaheim for a game against the Storm, several members of the team, including Eliuk, went to a taping of the game show The Price Is Right. Eliuk was chosen to participate, and won a world-map lithograph, some dinnerware, and an exercise machine. The episode aired on February 11, 2005. Eliuk married former Radio D.J. Daria O'Neill on December 31, 2007. Their first child Xander Eliuk was born in May 2009.

This disorder is distinguished from 1) eosinophilia, which is an elevation in this count above normal levels of 0.5 x 109/L (i.e. 500/μl) but below the hypereosinophilia cutoff level and 2) the hypereosinophilic syndrome, which is a sustained elevation in this count above 1.5 x 109/L (i.e. 1,500/μl) that is also associated with evidence of eosinophil-based tissue injury. Informally, blood eosinophil levels are often regarded as mildly elevated at counts of 500–1,500/μL, moderately elevated between 1,500–5,000/μL, and severely elevated when greater than 5,000/μL. Elevations in blood eosinophil counts can be transient, sustained, recurrent, or cyclical. Eosinophil counts in human blood normally range between 100–500 per/μL. Maintenance of these levels results from a balance between production of eosinophils by bone marrow eosinophil precursor cells termed CFU-Eos and the emigration of circulating eosinophils out of the blood through post-capillary venules into tissues. Eosinophils represent a small percentage of peripheral blood leucocytes (usually less than 8%), have a half-life in the circulation of only 8–18 hours, but persist in tissues for at least several weeks. Eosinophils are one form of terminally differentiated granulocytes; they function to neutralize invading microbes, primarily parasites and helminthes but also certain types of fungi and viruses. They also participate in transplant rejection, Graft- versus-host disease, and the killing of tumor cells. In conducting these functions, eosinophils produce and release on demand a range of toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. hypobromite, hypobromous acid, superoxide, and peroxide) and they also release on demand a preformed armamentarium of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor), and toxic proteins (e.g. metalloproteinases, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin). These agents serve to orchestrate robust immune and inflammatory responses that destroy invading microbes, foreign tissue, and malignant cells. When overproduced and over- activated, which occurs in certain cases of hypereosinophilia and to a lesser extent eosinophilia, eosinophils may misdirect their reactive oxygen species and armamentarium of preformed molecules toward normal tissues. This can result in serious damage to such organs as the lung, heart, kidneys, and brain.  Classification  Based on their causes, hypereosinophilias can be sorted into subtypes. However, cases of eosinophilia, which exhibit eosinophil counts between 500 and 1,500/μL, may fit the clinical criteria for, and thus be regarded as falling into, one of these hypereosinophilia categories: the cutoff of 1,500/μL between hypereosinophilia and eosinophilia is somewhat arbitrary. There are at least two different guidelines for classifying hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia into subtypes. The General Haematoloy and Haemato-oncology Task Forces for the British Committee for Standards in Haematology classifies these disorders into a) Primary, i.e. caused by abnormalities in the eosinophil cell line; b) Secondary, i.e. caused by non- eosinophil disorders; and c) Idiopathic, cause unknown. The World Health Organization classifies these disorders into a) Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 (i.e. high eosinophil blood counts caused by mutations in the eosinophil cell line of one of these three genes), 'b) Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and c) the Idiopathic hypereosinophiic syndrome. In the latter classication, secondary hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia is not viewed as a true disorder of eosinophils. Here these two classifications are merged and expanded to include the many forms of secondary, i.e. reactive hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia, disorders and also includes another subtype, organ-restricted hypereosinophilias, a disorder in which eosinophil-mediated tissue damage is restricted to one organ and is often but not always associated with increased blood eosinophil counts.  Primary hypereosinophilia  Primary hypereosinophilia is due to the development of a clone of eosinophils, i.e. a group of genetically identical eosinophils derived from a significantly mutated ancestor cell. The clone may prove to be benign, pre-malignant, or overtly malignant. The fundamental driver of these hypereosinophilic (or uncommonly eosinophilic) disorders is the mutation which increases the proliferation, survival, and further mutation of cells descendant from the originally mutated cell. There are several subtypes of primary hypereosinophilia.  Clonal hypereosinophilia  Clonal hypereosinophilia is hypereosinophilia caused by a pre-malignant or malignant clone of eosinophils that bear mutations in genes for PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 or, alternatively, a chromosome translocation that creates the PCM1-JAK2 fusion gene. These genes code for dysfunctional protein products capable of enhancing proliferation and/or survival of their parent cells which, in consequence, become an evolving and constantly growing clone of eosinophils. These mutations are recognized by the World Health Association as causing distinct entities differing from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Presence of these clones may be associated with tissue injury but in any case suggests specific therapy be directed at reducing the size and suppressing the growth of the eosinophil clone. More recently, mutations in other genes have been described as causing a similar type of clonal hypereosinophilia but have not yet been recognized as entities distinct from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hyperesoniphilic syndrome. These include gene mutations in JAK2, ABL1, and FLT2 and chromosomal translocations that create the ETV6-ACSL6 fusion gene.  Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (NOS)  Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (i.e. CEL, NOS), is a leukemia-inducing disorder in the eosinophil cell lineage that causes eosinophil blood counts greater than 1,500/μL. The most recent (2017) World health organization criteria specifically excludes from this disorder hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia associated with BCR-ABL1 fusion gene-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, primary myelofibrosis, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, clonal eosinophilias involving gene rearrangements of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, and chromosome translocations that form PCM1-JAK2, ETV6-JAK2, or BCR-JAK2 fusion genes. For this diagnosis, immature eosinophil (e.g. myeloblast) cell counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood must be less than 20% and the chromosomal alterations (inv(16)(p13.1q22)) and t(16;16)(p13;q22) as well as other features diagnostic of acute myelogenous leukemia must be absent. The latter diagnostic features include clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular genetic abnormalities diagnostic for other forms of leukemia or the presence of myeloblast counts greater than 55% in bone marrow or 2% in blood. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may transform into acute eosinophilic or other types of acute myelogenous leukemia.  Familial eosinophilia  Familial eosinophilia is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of sustained elevations in blood eosinophil levels that reach ranges diagnostic of eosinophilia or, far more commonly, hypereosinophilia. It is an autosomal dominant disorder in which genetic linkage gene mapping family studies localize the gene responsible for it to chromosome 5 at position q31-q33, between markers D5S642 and D5S816. This region contains a cytokine gene cluster which includes three genes whose protein products function in regulating the development and proliferation of eosinophils viz., interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and colony stimulating factor 2. However, no functional sequence genetic polylmophisms are found within the promoter, exons, or introns, of these genes or within the common gene enhancer for interleukin 3 or colony stimulating factor 2. This suggests that the primary defect in familial eosinophilia is not a mutation in one of these genes but rather in another gene within this chromosome area.http://omim.org/entry/131400 Clinical manifestations and tissue destruction related to the eosinophilia in this disorder are uncommon: familial eosinophilia typically has a benign phenotype compared to other congenital and acquired eosinophilic diseases.  Idiopathic hypereosinophilia  Idiopathic hypereosinophilia (also termed hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, i.e. HEUS) is a disorder characterized by an increase in eosinophil blood counts above 1,500/μL, as detected on at least 2 separate examinations. The disorder cannot be associated with eosinophil-based tissue damage or a primary or secondary cause of eosinophilia. That is, it is a diagnosis of exclusion and has no known cause. Over time, this disorder can resolve into a primary hypereosinphilia, typically clonal hyperesinophilia, chronic eosinphilic leukemia, or an eosinophilia associated with another hematological leukemia. The disorder may also become associated with tissue or organ damage and therefore be diagnosed as the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hyereosinophilia is treated by observation to detect development of the cited more serious disorders.  Idiopathic hypereosiophilic syndrome  The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disorder characterized by hypereosiophilia that is associated with eosinophil-based tissue or organ damage. While almost any organ or tissue may be damaged, the lung, skin, heart, blood vessels, sinuses, kidneys, and brain are the most commonly afflicted. The World Health Organization restrict this diagnosis to cases which have no well-defined cause. That is, all cases of secondary (i.e. reactive) eosinophilia (including lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia) and primary hypereosinophilia (including chronic eosinophilic leukemia (NOS), clonal eosinophilia, and hypereosinophilia associated with hematological malignancies) are excluded from this diagnosis.  Secondary hypereosinophilia  Secondary (or reactive) eosinophilias are non-clonal increases in blood eosinophil levels caused by an underlying disease. The pathogenesis of the hypereosinophilia in these diseases is thought to be the release of one or more cytokines (e.g. granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin 3, interleukin 5) that: a) cause bone marrow precursor cells, i.e. CFU-Eos, to proliferate and mature into eosinophils; b) promote release of bone marrow eosinophils into the circulation, c) stimulate circulating eosinophils to enter tissues and release tissue-injuring agents. These cytokines may be released by the diseased cells or the diseased cells may cause the release of these cytokines by non-diseased cells. Primary disorders associated with and known or presumed to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia are given below.  Infections  Helminths are common causes of hypereosiophilia and eosinophilia in areas endemic to these parasites. Helminths infections causing increased blood eosinophil counts include: 1) nematodes, (i.e. Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Hookworm infections), ascariasis, strongyloidiasis trichinosis, visceral larva migrans, Gnathostomiasis, cysticercosis, and echinococcosis; 2) filarioidea, i.e. tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, loiasis, and onchocerciasis; and 3) flukes, i.e. schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, and fasciolopsiasis. Other infections associated with increased eosinophil blood counts include: protozoan infections, i.e. Isospora belli and Dientamoeba fragilis) and sarcocystis); fungal infections (i.e. disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis [especially in cases with central nervous system involvement]), and coccidioides); and viral infections, i.e. Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and HIV.  Autoimmune diseases  Hypereosiophilia or eosinophilia may be associated with the following autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, Behçet's disease, IgG4-related disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, sarcoidosis, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis.  Allergic diseases  Eosinophilia and comparatively fewer cases of hypereosinophilia are associated with the following known diseases that are known or thought to have an allergic basis: allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic sinusitis, aspirin-induced asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and Kimura's disease. Certain types of food allergy disorders may also be associated with eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. Allergic eosinophilic esophagitis and the Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome are commonly associated with increased blood eosinophil levels.  Drugs  A wide range of drugs are known to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia accompanied by an array of allergic symptoms. Rarely, these reactions are severe causing, for example, the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. While virtually any drug should be considered as a possible cause of these signs and symptoms, the following drugs and drug classes are some of the most frequently reported causes: penicillins, cephalosporins, dapsone, sulfonamides, carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, valproic acid, nevirapine, efavirenz, and ibuprofen. These drugs may cause severely toxic reactions such as the DRESS syndrome. Other drugs and drug classes often reported to cause increased blood eosinophil levels accompanied by less severe (e.g. non-DRESS syndrome) symptoms include tetracyclins, doxycycline, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, valproate, desipramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, piroxicam, diclofenac, ACE inhibitors, abacavir, nevirapine, ranitidine, cyclosporin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The toxic oil syndrome is associated with hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia and systemic symptoms due to one or more contaminants in rapeseed oil and the Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, also associated with hypereosinophilia, appears due to trace contaminants in certain commercial batches of the amino acid, L-tryptophan.  Malignancies  Certain malignancies cause a secondary eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. These increases in blood eosinophils appear due to the release of stimulatory cytokines or invasion of the bone marrow and thereby irritation of resident eosinophils or their precursors. Malignancies associated with these effects include gastric, colorectal, lung, bladder, and thyroid cancers, as well as squamous cell cancers of the cervix, vagina, penis, skin, and nasopharyrnx. Some hematological malignancies are likewise associated with secondary rises in blood eosinophil counts; these include Hodgkin disease, certain T-cell lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, the myelodysplastic syndromes, many cases of systemic mastocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and certain cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma-associated or myelodysplastic–myeloproliferative syndrome-associated eosinophilias.  Primary immunodeficiency diseases  Primary immunodeficiency diseases are inborn errors in the immune system due to defective genes. Certain of these disorders are sometimes or often associated with hypereosinophilia. The list of such disorders includes ZAP70 deficiency (defective ZAP70 gene), CD3gamma chain deficiency (defective CD3G gene), MCHII deficiency (defective RFXANK gene), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (defective WAS gene), IPEX syndrome (defective IPEX gene), CD40 gene defect, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (defective Fas receptor gene). More than 30 other primary immunodeficiency diseases are sometimes associated with modest increases in eosinophil counts, i.e. eosinophilia. The hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is associated with hypereosionphilia or eosinophilia due to mutations in any one of the following genes: STAT3, DOCK8, PGM3, SPINK5, and TYK2 (see mutations in the hymperimmoglobulin E syndrome). Omenn syndrome is a severe combined immuodeficiency disease characterized by skin rash, slenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy due to a causative mutation in RAG1, RAG2, or, more rarely, one of several other genes.  Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia  Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is a disorder attributed to the expansion of a cytokine-producing, aberrant population of a particular T-cell phenotype. The disorder is clonal with regard to the production of abnormal T-cell lymphocytes not eosinophils which appear phenotypically normal. The phenotypically aberrant lymphocytes function abnormally by stimulating the proliferation and maturation of bone marrow eosinophil-precursor cells which in studied cases appears due to their excess production of interleukin 5, interleukin 3, or interleukin 13. The disorder is usually indolent but infrequently progresses to T-cell lymphoma or Sezary syndrome. Accumulation of partial deletions in the short arm of chromosome 6, the long arm of chromosome 10, or the acquirement of an extra chromosome (i.e. trisomy) 7) in T-cells or the proliferation of lymphocytes with the CD3 negative, CD41 positive immunophenotype may occur during the disorders progression to lymphoma. Reports on treatment of the disorder are rare. In on study of 16 lymphocyte- variant hypereosinophilia patients with the aberrant CD3 negative, CD41 positive immunophenotype, good responds to corticosteroid drugs were uniform but 16 ultimately required corticosteroid-sparing agents. Hydroxyurea and imatinib are less likely to have efficacy in this variant of hypereosinophilia than in many cases of clonal eosinophilia or chronic eosinophilic leukemia.  Gleich's syndrome  Gleich's syndrome, which may be a form of lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, involves hypereosinophilia, elevated blood levels of IgM antibodies, and clonal expansion of T cells. Similar to lymphocyte=variant hypereosinophilia, the increased levels of blood eosinophils in Gleich's syndrome is thought to be secondary to the secretion of eosinophil-stimulating cytokines by a T cell clone(s).  IgG4-related disease  IgG4-related disease or Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is a condition dacryoadenitis, sialadenitis, lymphadentitis, and pancreatitis (i.e. inflammation of the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, lymph nodes, and pancreas, respectively) plus retroperitoneal fibrosis. Less commonly, almost any other organ or tissue except joints and brain may be beleaguered by the inflammatory disorder. About 1/3 of cases exhibit eosinophilia or, rarely, hypereosinophilia. This increase in blood eosinophil count is often associated with abnormal T-lymphocyte clones (e.g. increased numbers of CD4 negative, CD7 positive T cells, CD3 negative, CD4 positive T cells, or CD3 positive, CD4 negative, CD8 negative T cells) and is thought to be secondary to these immunological disturbances. The disorder often exhibits are recurrent- relapsing course and is highly responsive to corticosteroids or rituximab as first-line therapy and interferon gamma as second-line therapy.  Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia  Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a disorder initially classified as a form of IgG4-related diseases but now considered a distinct entity. The disorder involves inflamed benign tumors of the vasculature in skin and, less commonly, other tissues. The tumors consist of histiocytoid endothelial cells prominently infiltrated by lymphocytes and eosinophils and is associated with hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia.  Cholesterol embolism  Transient, fluctuating hypereosinophilia occurs in 60%-80% of individuals suffering cholesterol embolisms. In this disorder, cholesterol crystals located in an atherosclerotic plaque of a large artery dislodge, travel downstream in the blood, and clog smaller arteries. This results in obstructive damage to multiple organs and tissues. Afflicted tissues exhibit acute inflammation involving eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The cause for this hypereosinophilic response is not known.  Adrenal insufficiency  A class of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal gland, glucocorticoids, inhibit eosinophil proliferation and survival. In adrenal insufficiency, low levels of these hormones allow increased eosinophil proliferation and survival. This leads to increases in blood eosinophil levels, typically eosinophilia and, less commonly, hypereosinophilia.  Organ-restricted hypereosinophilias  Hypereosinophilia may occur in the setting of damage to a single specific organ due to a massive infiltration by eosinophils. This disorder is sub-classified based on the organ involved and is not considered to be a form of primary hypereosinophilia, secondary hypereosinophilia, or the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome because: a) the eosinophils associated with the disorder have not been shown to be clonal in nature; b) a reason for the increase in blood eosinophils has not been determined; c) organ damage has not been shown to be due to eosinophils; and d) the disorder in each individual case typically is limited to the afflicted organ. Examples of organ-restricted hypereosinopilia include eosinophilic myocarditis, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic cystitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, eosinophilic cellulitis, eosinophilic vasculitis, and eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa. Other examples of organ-restricted hepereosinophilia include those involving the heart, kidney, liver, colon, pulmonary pleurae, peritoneum, fat tissue, myometrium, and synovia.

They are recognized as a distinct ethnic group in Armenia and are well integrated into the Armenian society, with freedom of religion and non-interference in their cultural traditions. History Early 20th century Many Yazidis came to the Russian Empire (now the territory of Armenia and Georgia) during the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape religious persecution, as they were oppressed by the Ottoman Turks and the Sunni Kurds who tried to convert them to Islam. The Yazidis were massacred alongside the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide, causing many to flee to Russian-held parts of Armenia. The first ever Yazidi school was opened in Armenia in 1920.  Soviet period  Yazidi intellectuals played a crucial role in fostering a secularized idea of Kurdish nationalism that would bridge across the religious divide which had historically separated Yazidi communities from their fellow Kurdish-speaking Muslims. These vanguards of Soviet Kurdish culture comprised Yazidis such as the linguist Arab Shamilov, the writer Hajiye Jndi and the poet Shikoye Hasan. Based on a Latin alphabet developed for the Kurmanji vernacular of Kurdish by the Yazidi linguist Arab Shamilov the Kurdish-speaking newspaper Ria Teze was published in Yerevan from the 1930s onwards. Nagorno-Karabakh War The Yezidi movement erupting in Armenia in 1988 appealed to the 3rd All-Armenian Yezidi Assembly convened on 30 September 1989 (the two previous Assemblies occurred at the dawn of the Armenian SSR's history, in 1921 and 1923) to challenge the Government for the official recognition of their identity. As a result, the Yezidis were presented as a separate minority in the USSR population census of 1989. According to this very census, the total count of Yezidis in Armenia was 52,700. Also need to note that in Karabakh war participated more than 500 yezidis by ethnicity, they have a detachment \\"Jangir Agha\\" headed by Aziz Tamoyan. Many Yezidis volunteered during the Karabakh conflict to fight on the Armenian side. Present situation  Demographics  According to the 2011 census, there are 35,272 Yazidis in Armenia. Ten years earlier, in the 2001 census, 40,620 Yazidis were registered in Armenia. Media have estimated the number of Yazidis in Armenia as between 30,000 and 50,000. Most of them are descendants of refugees to Armenia following the persecution during Ottoman rule, including during the Armenian Genocide, when many Armenians found refuge in Yazidi villages. A minority of Yazidis in Armenia (around 3,600) converted to Christianity, but they are not accepted by the other Yazidis as Yazidis.  Age structure  Ethnic Yazidis have a slightly younger population compared to ethnic Armenians. Almost 54 percent is under thirty years old, while 8 percent is aged sixty or more. {  width=\\"400px\\" !colspan=19  Population (urban, rural) by Ethnicity, Sex and Age as of 2011 census -  Ethnic group  Total  0 – 9  10 – 19  20 – 29  30 – 39  40 – 49  50 – 59  60+ -  Yazidis  35,308  5,984 6,236 6,795  5,193  4,645  3,624  2,831 -  Share per age group (%)  100.0  16.9  17.7  19.2  14.7  13.2  10.3  8.0 }  Political rights  Election Code of Armenia guarantees one seat in the National Assembly to Yazid minority.

Foreign evaluations of Yazid rights  US reports on the relations between Yazidis and the Armenian government have been mixed. According to a 2004 U.S. Department of State human rights report, Yazidis are subjected to some harassment in Armenia. Attendance school rates among children in the Yezidi ethnic minority continued to be lower than average, partially due to economic reasons, a lack of Yezidi teachers and books, and the early removal of teenage girls from schools for marriage. In 2006 the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) supported the government's effort to publish textbooks for ethnic minorities, and in 2007 new Yezidi language textbooks appeared in some Yezidi schools around the country. The textbooks are Aziz. and Hasan Shex Mamude. Also through Armenian government support the first Yezidi newspaper was published named Ezdikhana (ex. name: Denge Ezdia or Yezidi Voice). According to a 2007 U.S. Department of State human rights report, \\"As in previous years, Yezidi leaders did not complain that police and local authorities subjected their community to discrimination\\".

Background In an assessment, the assessor should have the full cooperation of the organization being assessed. The organization grants access to its facilities, provides network access, outlines detailed information about the network, etc. All parties understand that the goal is to study security and identify improvements to secure the systems. An assessment for security is potentially the most useful of all security tests. Purpose of security assessment The goal of a security assessment (also known as a security audit, security review, or network assessment), is to ensure that necessary security controls are integrated into the design and implementation of a project. A properly completed security assessment should provide documentation outlining any security gaps between a project design and approved corporate security policies. Management can address security gaps in three ways: Management can decide to cancel the project, allocate the necessary resources to correct the security gaps, or accept the risk based on an informed risk / reward analysis. Methodology The following methodology outline is put forward as the effective means in conducting security assessment. * Requirement Study and Situation Analysis * Security policy creation and update * Document Review *Risk Analysis * Vulnerability Scan *Data Analysis * Report & Briefing Sample report A security assessment report should include the following information: * Introduction/background information * Executive and Management summary * Assessment scope and objectives * Assumptions and limitations * Methods and assessment tools used * Current environment or system description with network diagrams, if any * Security requirements * Summary of findings and recommendations * The general control review result * The vulnerability test results * Risk assessment results including identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impact and likelihood assessment, and the risk results analysis * Recommended safeguards Criticisms and shortcomings IT security risk assessments like many risk assessments in IT, are not actually quantitative and do not represent risk in any actuarially-sound manner. Measuring risk quantitatively can have a significant impact on prioritizing risks and getting investment approval. Quantitative risk analysis has been applied to IT security in a major US government study in 2000. The Federal CIO Council commissioned a study of the $100 million IT security investment for the Department of Veterans Affairs with results shown quantitatively.

Shared governance UCI has separate student governments representing undergraduate and graduate students. The Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine (ASUCI) is the undergraduate student government. The Associated Graduate Students (AGS) represents graduate students. ASUCI has executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and is also a member of the United States Student Association. In 2014, after a referendum creating a self-governing territory, ASUCI withdrew from the University of California Student Association.http://www.newuniversity.org/2014/03/news/uci- leaves-ucsa/ Many student organizations are funded by ASUCI's Student Programming Funding Board. ASUCI also sponsors annual concerts and festivals, including \\"Shocktoberfest\\", \\"Wayzgoose\\", \\"Summerlands\\", and \\"Soulstice\\". Other committees, such as the Student Fee Advisory Committee, provide for shared governance in certain areas of university administration, Many of these, such as the Student Center Board of Advisors, the Bren Events Center Advisory Board, and the Anteater Recreation Center Advisory Board were created to oversee campus entities funded by student-initiated referenda fees. Student media New University The New University (New U) is the officialhttp://www.newuniversity.org/get-involved/ student newspaper at UC Irvine. Originally named the Spectrum, later Spectre, The Tongue, and The Anthill, it is published once a week during the regular academic year. The New University's editorial staff consists of UCI undergraduates. The next year's editor in chief is elected late in the winter quarter by a vote of the current year's staff; the editor in chief-elect then select new senior and associate editors. The newspaper is an official department of the university, housed under the university's Student Government & Student Media department,http://www.studentgov.uci.edu/about/ but receives funding through advertising and student fees. As an official university department, the paper receives many benefits not generally available to other student media, such as rent-free office space, free advertising space, and exclusive distribution boxes on the UCI campus. However, the newspaper's freedom of the press is legally guaranteed by California's Leonard Law, which was amended in 2006 to include public higher education institutions. Unlike many college newspapers, the New University has no faculty advisor and is not formally tied to any academic program. In practice, the newspaper operates with relative independence and autonomy from the university. KUCI KUCI is the official student-run radio station at UC Irvine. On-campus activities The Anteater Recreation Center (ARC) is a gym on campus established by a student fee initiative. Members may opt to participate in fee-based courses in martial arts, team sports, SCUBA diving, sailing, and more. Additionally, club sports are open for all ARC members to join, such as badminton, ice hockey, lacrosse, roller hockey, rugby, sailing, volleyball, etc. .Anteater Recreation Center The Student Center and Cross-Cultural Center are central locations for many student activities and resource centers. A recent student center expansion project will expand the existing facility to . Two new food courts, a large ballroom, a clock tower, and several conference centers and stores are among the additions.UCI's Student Center The UCI Student Center has undergone four phases over the past 30 years. Phase I was when the student center was first established in 1981. This included a bookstore, restaurant, music room, small game room, a few study areas, and two conference rooms. Phase II occurred when another study lounge, food unit and 300-seat multipurpose room was built a year later. In 1990, Phase III led to the student center being expanded with a larger bookstore, more study and lounge space, a new game room, an expanded food area, Crystal Cove Auditorium, and more meeting rooms. The Cross-Cultural Center was also opened during this time with meeting rooms, Student Umbrella Organization offices, and study and lounge space. From 2007-2009, the Student Center underwent Phase IV of its latest reconstruction developments with now triple the amount of space for conference and meeting areas along with a multipurpose room and large ballroom. Study space areas have also increased making it available for both individuals and small study groups. There are also two new dining areas with seating areas indoors and outdoors along with a permanent performance area in the student center terrace. The Cross Cultural Center also had new developments as it is now double in size providing a large multipurpose room and additional conference and office space. Traditions Annual traditions include \\"SPOP\\", an orientation program for new students and their parents; Welcome Week; an ostensibly medieval-themed festival titled \\"Wayzgoose\\"; \\"Soulstice\\", an annual student-run talent competition; and \\"Care- a-Thon\\", a charity dance marathon. Student activism Events featuring controversial guest speakers (such as John Yoo and Viet Dinh, co-authors of the USA Patriot Act who appeared for separate lecture events) have been known to attract large crowds of demonstrators. Some major recent and ongoing activism efforts include support for demands to increase wages and benefits for campus labor unions, support for Tagalog and Filipino Studies (TAPS), awareness for the situation in Israel-Palestine by Students for Justice in Palestine and Anteaters for Israel, awareness for the crisis in Darfur, protests against the conflict in Iraq, ASUCI-sponsored political debates, and lectures sponsored by the Muslim Student Union. Controversies Flag controversy In March 2015, the legislative branch of ASUCI voted in favor of a resolution that would have banned all flags from a shared inner workroom in the undergraduate student government's offices. The text of the resolution stated in part that \\"The American flag has been flown in instances of colonialism and imperialism\\" and that \\"freedom of speech, in a space that aims to be as inclusive as possible, can be interpreted as hate speech\\". After the student government's president expressed his opposition to the resolution in a public social media post, the resolution became controversial, with criticism and support from students and non-students. The student representatives who voted in favor of the ban experienced intense harassment and received numerous death threats. The university administration called the ban \\"misguided\\", stating “The views of a handful of students passing a resolution do not represent the opinions of the nearly 30,000 students on this campus, and have no influence on the policies and practices of the university”, and the executive branch of the student council vetoed the ban. During the controversy, California State Senator Janet Nguyen said that the state constitution could be amended to prohibit the banning of the American flag at taxpayer-funded campuses. Numerous professors and students from universities across the state signed a letter of support for the students who passed the resolution, written in response to increasing hostility, death threats, and racial slurs. UC Irvine Chancellor Howard Gillman initially called the vote \\"outrageous and indefensible\\", and stated that the campus would install additional flagpoles. After criticism from students, faculty and others, however, Gillman published a conciliatory op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, urging a stop to the harassment of students and stating that criticism of the United States flag \\"is a feature of university life and a measure of a free society.\\"  Film screening protest  On May 18, 2016, Anteaters for Israel and Students Supporting Israel hosted a screening of the film Beneath the Helmet at UC Irvine (UCI) with Israeli soldiers who were to be holding a panel discussion. Up to 50 members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and other campus groups wanted to participate in the panel discussion. They were refused by the organizers so they staged a protest outside instead. Following the protest, the protestors were accused of improper conduct. The day after, Howard Gillman, chancellor at UCI, issued a statement strongly condemning the protestors that he claimed had \\"crossed the line of civility\\" and he claimed that they had disrupted the screening and blocked exit paths and that the attendees had called the police. Over the next few days, claims spread in media such that the protestors had banged at the door and the windows of the room where the screening took place, had shouted obscenities, had blocked students from entering the room and had tried to push open the door to get inside the room. One student, Eliana Kopley, described how the protestors would not let her enter the room when attempting to leave. She found herself separated from the other Jewish students, physically blocked from joining them, and chased by the protesters as she sought to escape. When Kopley eventually managed to leave the building, three protesters followed after her until she fled to safety. During the incident Kopley was forced to hide in a kitchen while a UCI staff member protected her. Pro-Israel groups such as the Orange County Hillel chapter, the Zionist Organization of America and the Brandeis Center got involved in the case which caused the school's Office of Student Conduct to launch an investigation. The investigation resulted in a 58-page report which cleared the protestors of most of the allegations. The report did not find evidence of any student being chased nor of anyone banging on the door or the windows. Julie Hartle, a student representative from the National Lawyers Guild, who was present at the protest dismissed the accusations as lies. However, the investigation found that SJP, the group that organized and led the protest, violated student conduct policies regarding disruption because the protest was too loud. The sanctions imposed on the group were a warning and an assignment to host an educational program. Muslim Student Union controversy UCI attracted controversy in February 2010 when students disrupted a lecture by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren. While the MSU had issued a statement condemning the university for inviting a man who \\"took part in a culture that has no qualms with terrorizing the innocent, killing civilians, demolishing their homes and illegally occupying their land\\", they denied responsibility for the protests and said the students acted on their own. According to the New University, 11 students were charged with section 403 of the UCIPD penal code – disrupting a public event on the University's property, for their actions. Nine were enrolled at UCI and three were from UCR. During the event, Chancellor Drake and political science department chair Mark Petracca \\"chided the protesting crowd and called the disruptions embarrassing\\". At one point, Chairman Petracca yelled \\"Shame on you\\" to the heckling crowd. In a statement issued the next day, Drake called the students' behavior \\"intolerable\\", saying that \\"Freedom of speech is among the most fundamental, and among the most cherished of the bedrock values our nation is built upon.\\" Dean Chemerinsky also condemned the disruptions. He stated, \\"Imagine if they had brought their own speaker and that person had been shouted down. There would be no free speech. There is no right to a 'heckler's veto.'\\" In response, the university suspended the group for the 2010–2011 school year and assigned it a probationary period for the following year. In addition, the members were responsible for completing a collective 50 community service hours before the group's reinstatement. The Muslim Student Union appealed the suspension. The punishment was later modified to one academic quarter, one hundred hours of community service and two years probation. On November 30, 2007, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education issued a report finding insufficient evidence in support of allegations that Jewish students at UCI were harassed and subjected to a hostile environment based on their religious beliefs. The federal agency investigated a total of 13 alleged incidents of harassment that occurred between the fall of 2000 and December 2006, and determined that 5 were \\"isolated acts\\" that could not be addressed because they were reported more than 180 days after they occurred. Further, the agency considered these acts, which included a rock thrown at a Jewish student, the destruction of a Holocaust memorial display, and various threatening or harassing statements made to individual Jewish students, substantially different in nature as to be unrelated to the 8 other recurring acts it investigated, which included graffiti depicting swastikas on campus, events during an annual Zionist Awareness Week (in which several Jewish students had, however, partook), exclusion of Jewish students during an anti-hate rally, and the wearing of graduation stoles signifying support for Hamas or Palestinian human rights. The agency ultimately found that none of the incidents leading to the allegations qualified as \\"sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in from the services, activities or privileges\\" provided by UCI, and that university officials had acted appropriately in response to each incident. In December 2007, UCI Administration was cleared of anti-semitism complaints by the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. Following a speech by Drake at the national Hillel meeting in Washington, D.C. in March 2008, Anteaters for Israel, along with three other Jewish organizations, issued a press release defending Drake and claiming that anti-Semitic activity was \\"exaggerated\\". In May 2009, UC Irvine hosted a two-week event titled \\"Israel: The Politics of Genocide\\", hosted by the school's Muslim Student Union. Scheduled speakers included Cynthia McKinney and George Galloway. Opponents of the event described it as \\"anti-Semitic\\" (despite its considerable support from Jewish students and stated criticism solely of Israeli policy) and called for Chancellor Drake to condemn both the event and the sponsoring organization. He declined to do so. One outdoor demonstration at this event included a display with an image of Jewish Holocaust victim Anne Frank wearing a keffiyah, in an apparent attempt to draw an analogy between her sufferings and the plight of the Palestinian territories. The pro-Israel campus advocacy group StandWithUs described this image as offensive. In October 2009, students from UCI met with Hamas official Aziz Duwaik on a university-sponsored trip to the West Bank under a program called the Olive Tree Initiative (OTI), a neutral, apolitical education group that studies the Arab-Israeli conflict. The meeting was questioned in 2011, and the initial response from UCI was that the meeting was justified, as the education group was studying the different narratives that contribute to the situation in the Middle East.Overly, Jeff. \\"Group: UC Irvine students met with Hamas leader.\\" The Orange County Register.

She grew up in Brooklyn, New York where her father was an ironworker. Early life Rice was born September 16, 1972 into a Kanien'kehaka (Mohawk) family on the Kahnawake reserve in Quebec, and she is proud of her First Nations heritage. Through her father she is a member of the Rice family of Kahnawake, having descended from Edmund Rice, an early immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony. Two Rice boys were taken captive as children in 1704 from Massachusetts, and taken to Kahnawake, Quebec where they were adopted by Mohawk families and became assimilated. Alex is descended from Edmund Rice's great grandson, Silas, who took the name of Tookanowras, but he was also baptized as Catholic and known as Jacques Thanhohorens. Born on the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve in Quebec, Canada, Rice spent the majority of her childhood with her family in Brooklyn, New York. Her father was among a community of Mohawk ironworkers, who settled in what is now Boerum Hill. The men worked on skyscrapers and bridges, and the women made community. The Mohawk called their neighborhood \\"Little Caughnawaga\\", after their homeland. There Rice attended local schools and trained to become a professional dancer at local dance studios; she developed a passion for acting when she landed a part in an educational video produced at her grammar school. She attended Our Lady of Perpetual Help High School in Brooklyn. In 1990, after her father died and she graduated from high school, Alex and her mother Melody Rice moved back to Kanawake. She attended Dawson College and Concordia University in Montreal, where she earned a degree in library science. Career Rice first traveled to California in 1996 to attend a modeling convention and landed her first entertainment job working behind the scenes at the Judge Judy show. Her first feature film was the independent The Doe Boy (2001), which garnered several international film festival awards. She is perhaps best known for her recurring role as Janet Pete in the films Skinwalkers (2002), Dreamkeeper (2003), Coyote Waits (2003), and A Thief of Time (2004), based on the Tony Hillerman novels by the same names. She has appeared in other films including Lewis and Clark: Great Journey West, On the Corner, A Thousand Roads, the IMAX release of Sacagawea, Johnny Tootall and The New World. She has also acted in various television series, including Spin City, CSI, Strong Medicine and The Sopranos.

The vast majority of the Aksai Chin region which is disputed between China and India is administered as part of Hotan Prefecture. The seat of Hotan Prefecture is Hotan and its largest county by population is Karakax County. The vast majority of the residents of the prefecture are Muslim Uyghurs and live around oases situated between the desolate Taklamakan Desert and Kunlun Mountains. The region was the center of the ancient Iranian Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan. Later, the region was part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, followed by the Qara Khitai, Chagatai Khanate, Moghulistan and the Dzungar Khanate, which was conquered by the Qing dynasty of China. Hotan became part of Xinjiang under Qing rule. In the 1930s, the Khotan Emirate declared independence from China. The PLA entered Hotan in 1949. The prefecture is known for its jade, silk and carpets. Etymology The prefecture is named for its seat, Hotan (Khotan, Hetian, Hotien). The area of Hotan is historically known as Gaustana, Godana or Godaniya, a Sanskrit name meaning \\"Land of the cows\\".https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-asian- studies/article/philippines-public-policy-and-national-economic-development- by-frank-golay-ithaca-cornell-university-press-1961-xviii-455-map-tables- index-bibliographic- essay/7851EE3274E488CDE43901E06D281B54https://eurasiantimes.com/how-sanskrit- language-is-associated-with-the-tibetan-and-khotan-region/ In Chinese, the same name is written as Yu-t'ien, pronounced as Gu-dana. It is referred to as Gosthana by local Tibetans, which also means the same in Sanskrit. History The Hotan Prefecture region played a major part in the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877). Tunganistan was an independent administered region in the southern part of Xinjiang from 1934 to 1937. The territory included the oases of the southern Tarim Basin; the centre of the region was Khotan. On December 22, 1949, PLA forces reached Hotan. In 1950, the area was redesignated as Hotan District (). In 1959, the Chinese character name of Hotan was changed from to the homophonous . In 1962, events of the Sino-Indian War occurred in parts of Aksai Chin administered as part of Hotan Prefecture. In 1971, Hotan was changed from a district () to a prefecture (). Between June 1991 and March 1992, there were six attacks with firearms on Han Chinese residents in Hotan Prefecture. (Sourced to the Xinjiang Public Security Gazette (), pages 84) According to a reporter for the Wen Wei Po in Ürümqi, between January and August 2005, authorities had disbanded six \\"illegal underground\\" religious schools in Hotan Prefecture and confiscated more than one hundred unauthorized religious books and periodicals as well as 972 audio and video tapes. In 2016, Kunyu was established within the boundaries of Hotan Prefecture. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, 171 Uyghur workers from Hotan Prefrcture were sent to Changsha, Hunan. Geography The vast majority of the residents live around oases situated between the desolate Taklamakan Desert and Kunlun Mountains. To the north, the prefecture borders Aksu Prefecture, to the east Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, to the west Kashgar Prefecture, and to the south, Tibet and the areas disputed between China, India and Pakistan. Aksai Chin includes the southernmost point administered as part of Xinjiang. Most of the prefecture has a cold desert climate.

The first is whether the various territories within the People's Republic of China (PRC) that are claimed as political Tibet should separate and become a new sovereign state. Many of the points in the debate rest on a second debate, about whether Tibet was independent or subordinate to China in certain parts of its recent history.

The government of the Republic of China, which ruled mainland China from 1912 until 1949 and now controls Taiwan, had a cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in charge of the administration of Tibet and Mongolia regions from 1912. The commission retained its cabinet level status after 1949, but no longer executes that function. On 10May 1943, Chiang Kai-shek asserted that \\"Tibet is part of Chinese territory... No foreign nation is allowed to interfere in our domestic affairs\\". He again declared in 1946 that the Tibetans were Chinese nationals.The last of the Tibetans By Ian Buruma The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was disbanded in 2017. In the late 19th century, China adopted the Western model of nation-state diplomacy. As the government of Tibet, China concluded several treaties (1876, 1886, 1890, 1893) with British India touching on the status, boundaries and access to Tibet. Chinese government sources consider this a sign of sovereignty rather than suzerainty. However, by the 20th century British India found the treaties to be ineffective due to China's weakened control over the Tibetan local government. The British invaded Tibet in 1904 and forced the signing of a separate treaty, directly with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. In 1906, an Anglo-Chinese Convention was signed at Peking between Great Britain and China. It incorporated the 1904 Lhasa Convention (with modification), which was attached as Annex. A treaty between Britain and Russia (1907) followed. Article II of this treaty stated that \\"In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government.\\" China sent troops into Tibet in 1908. The result of the policy of both Great Britain and Russia has been the virtual annexation of Tibet by China. China controlled Tibet up to 1912. Thereafter, Tibet entered the period described commonly as de facto independence, though it was only recognized by independent Mongolia as enjoying de jure independence. In the 2000s the position of the Republic of China with regard to Tibet appeared to become more nuanced as was stated in the following opening speech to the International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet on 8September 2007 through the pro-Taiwan independence then ROC President Chen Shui-bian who stated that his offices no longer treated exiled Tibetans as Chinese mainlanders.'President Chen Shui-bian's Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the 2007 International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet' Sep 8, 2007 Legal arguments based on historical status The position of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled mainland China since 1949, as well as the official position of the Republic of China (ROC), which ruled mainland China before 1949 and currently controls Taiwan,For the PRC's position, see State Council's whitepaper Tibet - Its Ownership and Human Rights Situation , 1992 and Beijing Review's 100 Question about Tibet , 1989; for ROC's position, see Government Information Office's online publication is that Tibet has been an indivisible part of China de jure since the Yuan dynasty of Mongol-ruled China in the 13th century,Grunfeld, A.

The PRC contends that, according to international law and the Succession of states theory,For a definition of the \\"Succession of states theory in international law\\", see West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2, The Gale Group, Inc., 2008 : \\"Succession occurs when one state ceases to exist or loses control over part of its territory, and another state comes into existence or assumes control over the territory lost by the first state. A central concern in this instance is whether the international obligations of the former state are taken over by the succeeding state. Changes in the form of government of one state, such as the replacement of a monarchy by a democratic form of government, do not modify or terminate the obligations incurred by the previous government. When the state ceases to exist, however, the treaties it concluded generally are terminated and those of the successor state apply to the territory. These include political treaties like alliances, which depend on the existence of the state that concluded them. But certain obligations, such as agreements concerning boundaries or other matters of local significance, carry over to the successor state. More difficult to determine is the continuing legality of treaties granting concessions or contract rights. Scholarly opinion has diverged on this aspect of succession, and state practice has likewise divided. Consequently each case must be studied on its merits to determine whether the rights and duties under the contract or concession are such that the successor state is bound by the obligations of the previous state.\\" all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet, with the PRC having succeeded the ROC as the legitimate government of all China.Rene Kamm, The Sino-Tibetan Dialogue: Talk Shop or Path to Resolution? , Marc Blecher, advisor, Oberlin College, East Asian Studies Honors, 2012 April 26, p. 7: \\"The PRC contends that, according to international law and the succession of states theory, all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet.\\"Scott David Parker, Department of Political Science, Sierra College Truckee, California, All (Geo-)Politics are Local: the Consequences of the People's Republic of China's Military Doctrine of Local War for the East Asia Region , Paper submitted for presentation at the Canadian Political Science Association annual meeting, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, June 12–15, 2012 : \\"In the view of its leadership, the PRC replaced the ROC as the legitimate government of all China under the succession of states theory of international law. That the majority of the world's states agree reinforces this assertion and serves to isolate the Taipei regime\\". De facto independence The ROC government had no effective control over Tibet from 1912 to 1951; however, in the opinion of the Chinese government, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed de facto independence when the Chinese nation was torn by warlordism, Japanese invasion, and civil war.Grunfeld, 1996, p256 Goldstein explains what is meant by de facto independence in the following statement: While at times the Tibetans were fiercely independent- minded at other times Tibet indicated its willingness to accept subordinate status as part of China provided that Tibetan internal systems were left untouched and China relinquished control over a number of important ethnic Tibetan groups in Kham and Amdo.Goldstein, Melvyn C., A History of Modern Tibet: 1913-1951, 1989, pp 239-241, 248, 271Grunfeld, A. Tom, The Making of Modern Tibet, M.E. Sharpe, 1996, p245, regarding Kham and Amdo: \\"The historical reality is that the Dalai Lamas have not ruled these outer areas since the mid-eighteenth century, and during the Simla Conference of 1913, the 13th Dalai Lama was even willing to sign away rights to them\\" The PRC insists that during this period the ROC government continued to maintain sovereignty over Tibet. The Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China (1912) stipulated that Tibet was a province of the Republic of China. Provisions concerning Tibet in the Constitution of the Republic of China promulgated later all stress the inseparability of Tibet from Chinese territory, and the Central Government of China exercise of sovereignty in Tibet.Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, issued March, 1912; Constitution of the Republic of China, issued May, 1914; Provisional Constitution in the Political Tutelage Period of the Republic of China, issued June 1931\\"Did Tibet Become an Independent Country after the Revolution of 1911?\\" , China Internet Information Center In 1927, the Commission in Charge of Mongolian and Tibetan AffairsThe History of Tibet By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p.427,571 of the Chinese Government contained members of great influence in the Mongolian and Tibetan areas, such as the 13th Dalai Lama, the 9th Panchen Lama and other Tibetan government representatives. In 1934, on his condolence mission for the demise of the Dalai Lama, the Chinese General Huang Musong posted notices in Chinese and Tibetan throughout Lhasa that alluded to Tibet as an integral part of China while expressing the utmost reverence for the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist religion.A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State by Melvyn C. Goldstein, 1989, p227 The 9th Panchen Lama traditionally ruled over one-third of Tibet. On 1February 1925, the Panchen Lama attended the preparatory session of the \\"National Reconstruction Meeting\\" (Shanhou huiyi) intended to identify ways and means of unifying the Chinese nation, and gave a speech about achieving the unification of five nationalities, including Tibetans, Mongolians and Han Chinese. In 1933, he called upon the Mongols to embrace national unity and to obey the Chinese Government to resist Japanese invasion. In February 1935, the Chinese government appointed Panchen Lama \\"Special Cultural Commissioner for the Western Regions\\" and assigned him 500 Chinese troops.A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State by Melvyn C. Goldstein, 1989, p.263 He spent much of his time teaching and preaching Buddhist doctrines - including the principles of unity and pacification for the border regions - extensively in inland China, outside of Tibet, from 1924 until 1December 1937, when he died on his way back to Tibet under the protection of Chinese troops.McKay (ed), p419-431; Panchen Lama's speech about unification of five nationalities, p422; Panchen Lama preached resistance against Japanese, p425; Panchen Lama preached about principles of unity and peace for the border regions, p.429; under the protection Chinese troops, p.431 During the Sino-Tibetan War, the warlords Ma Bufang and Liu Wenhui jointly attacked and defeated invading Tibetan forces.Richardson, Hugh E.

The Kuomintang government sought to portray itself as necessary to validate the choice of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama. When the current (14th) Dalai Lama was installed in Lhasa, it was with an armed escort of Chinese troops and an attending Chinese ministerThe History of Tibet By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p571; \\"the coronation of the Dalai Lama\\"; the British representative Basil Gould there was not afforded the privilege to attend the installation ceremony; Note 2 on p.572Wu Chung hsin walking towards a sedan chair \\"Information\\" of the photo: Richardson discusses Wu's mission to Lhasa in Tibet and Its History(2nd Ed.)Boston & London: Shambala (1984), \\"Wu also claimed that he personally conducted the enthronement and that, in gratitude, the Dalai Lama prostrated himself in the direction of Peking.\\" (p. 154) The Muslim Kuomintang General Bai Chongxi said that the Tibetans suffered under British repression, and he called upon the Republic of China to assist them in expelling the British. According to Yu Shiyu, during China's resistance war against Japanese invasion, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang, Governor of Qinghai (1937–1949), to repair the Yushu airport in Qinghai Province to deter Tibetan independence. In May 1943, Chiang warned that Tibet must accept and follow the instructions and orders of the Central Government, that they must agree and help to build the Chinese-India [war- supply] road, and that they must maintain direct communications with the Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) in Lhasa and not through the newly established \\"Foreign Office\\" of Tibet. He sternly warned that he would \\"send an air force to bomb Tibet immediately\\" should Tibet be found to be collaborating with Japan. Official Communications between Lhasa and Chiang Kai-shek's government was through MTAC, not the \\"Foreign Office\\", until July 1949 just before the Communists' final victory in the civil war. The presence of MTAC in Lhasa was viewed by both Nationalist and Communist governments as an assertion of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet.The Dragon in the Land of Snows by Tsering Shakya,pp.7,11 Throughout the Kuomintang years, no country gave Tibet diplomatic recognition.For the British and U.S. positions on Tibet, see Goldstein, 1989, p 399, p386, UK Foreign Office Whitepaper: Tibet and the Question of Chinese Suzerainty (10 April 1943), Foreign Office Records: FO371/35755 and aide-mémoire sent by the US Department of States to the British Embassy in Washington, D.C.

The Tibetan government also issued passports to subsequent British Everest expedition in 1924 and 1936. The 1938–39 German expedition to Tibet also received Tibetan passports. The passport of Tsepon ShakabpaIn 2003, an old Tibetan passport was rediscovered in Nepal. Issued by the Kashag to Tibet's finance minister Tsepon Shakabpa for foreign travel, the passport was a single piece of pink paper, complete with photograph. It has a message in hand- written Tibetan and typed English, similar to the message by the nominal issuing officers of today's passports, stating that \\"\\"the bearer of this letter – Tsepon Shakabpa, Chief of the Finance Department of the Government of Tibet, is hereby sent to China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries to explore and review trade possibilities between these countries and Tibet. We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him.\\" The text and the photograph is sealed by a square stamp belonging to the Kashag, and is dated \\"26th day of the 8th month of Fire-Pig year (Tibetan)\\" (14 October 1947 in the gregorian calendar). The passport has received visas and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visa do reflect an official status, with mentions such as \\"Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, For government official\\". However, acceptance of a passport does not indicate recognition of independence, as for example the Republic of China passport is accepted by almost all the countries of the world, even though few of them recognize the ROC as a nation.  Tibet Government in exile (post 1959)  In 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and established a government in exile at Dharamsala in northern India. This group claims sovereignty over various ethnically or historically Tibetan areas now governed by China. Aside from the Tibet Autonomous Region, an area that was administered directly by the Dalai Lama's government until 1951, the group also claims Amdo (Qinghai) and eastern Kham (western Sichuan).Goldstein, Melvyn C., The Snow Lion and the Dragon, University of California Press, 1997, p71 About 45 percent of ethnic Tibetans under Chinese rule live in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the 2000 census. Prior to 1949, much of Amdo and eastern Kham were governed by local rulers and even warlords. The view of the current Dalai Lama in 1989 was as follows: The International Commission of Jurists concluded that from 1913 to 1950 Tibet demonstrated the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law. In the opinion of the commission, the government of Tibet conducted its own domestic and foreign affairs free from any outside authority, and countries with whom Tibet had foreign relations are shown by official documents to have treated Tibet in practice as an independent State.Legal Inquiry Committee, Tibet and Chinese People's Republic, Geneva: International Commission of Jurists, 1960, pp. 5,6Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law , (Westview, 1987) The United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions urging respect for the rights of Tibetans in 1959, 1961,United Nations General Assembly - Resolution 1723 (XVI) and alternative: and 1965.United Nations General Assembly - Resolution 2079 (XX) The 1961 resolution calls for that \\"principle of self-determination of peoples and nations\\" applies to the Tibetan people. The Tibetan Government in Exile views current PRC rule in Tibet, including neighboring provinces outside Tibet Autonomous Region, as colonial and illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in gross violation of both Tibet's historical status as an independent country and the right of Tibetan people to self- determination. It also points to PRC's autocratic policies, divide-and-rule policies, and what it contends are assimilationist policies, and regard those as an example of ongoing imperialism aimed at destroying Tibet's distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China. That said, the Dalai Lama stated in 2008 that he wishes only for Tibetan autonomy, and not separation from China, under certain conditions, like freedom of speech and expression, genuine self-rule, and control over ethnic makeup and migration in all areas claimed as historical Tibet. Third- party views Tibet within the Qing dynasty in 1820 During the rule of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907), Tibet and China were frequently at war, with parts of Tibet temporarily captured by the Chinese to become part of their territory.World History: The Human Odyssey, West Educational Publishing. . Author: Jackson J. Spiegvogel Around 650, the Chinese captured Lhasa. In 763, Tibet very briefly took the Chinese capital of Chang'an during the Tang civil war. Most scholars outside of China say that during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Tibet was independent without even nominal Ming suzerainty. In contrast, since the mid-18th century it is agreed that China had control over Tibet reaching its maximum in the end of the 18th century.Gernet, J., Foster, J.R. & Hartman C., A History of Chinese Civilization, Cambridge University Press, 1982, p481 reads in part: \\"From 1751 onwards Chinese control over Tibet became permanent and remained so more or less ever after, in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the twentieth century.\\" Luciano Petech, a scholar of Himalayan history, indicated that Tibet was a Qing protectorate.Petech L.,China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet, 1972, p260 The patron and priest relationship held between the Qing court and the Tibetan lamas has been subjected to varying interpretation. The 13th Dalai Lama, for example, knelt, but did not kowtow, before the Empress Dowager Cixi and the young Emperor while he delivered his petition in Beijing. Chinese sources emphasize the submission of kneeling; Tibetan sources emphasize the lack of the kowtow. Titles and commands given to Tibetans by the Chinese, likewise, are variously interpreted. The Qing authorities gave the 13th Dalai Lama the title of \\"Loyally Submissive Vice-Regent\\", and ordered to follow Qing's commands and communicate with the Emperor only through the Manchu Amban in Lhasa; but opinions vary as to whether these titles and commands reflected actual political power, or symbolic gestures ignored by Tibetans.The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959 edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.9 Some authors claim that kneeling before the Emperor followed the 17th-century precedent in the case of the 5th Dalai Lama.Grunfeld, A. Tom, The Making of Modern Tibet, p. 42, reads in part \\"Both (Tibetan and Chinese) accounts agree that the Dalai Lama was exempt from the traditional kowtow symbolizing total subservience; he was, however, required to kneel before the emperor.\\" Other historians indicate that the emperor treated the Dalai Lama as an equalLaird, Thomas. (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, pp. 170-174. Grove Press, New York. . Kneeling was a compromise allowed by the Qing court for foreign representatives, Western and Tibetan alike, as both parties refused to perform the kowtow. Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein writes that Britain and Russia formally acknowledged Chinese authority over Tibet in treaties of 1906 and 1907; and that the 1904 British invasion of Tibet stirred China into becoming more directly involved in Tibetan affairs and working to integrate Tibet with \\"the rest of China.\\"Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question by Melvyn C. Goldstein The status of Tibet after the 1911 Xinhai Revolution ended the Qing dynasty is also a matter of debate. After the revolution, the Chinese Republic of five races, including Tibetans, was proclaimed. Western powers recognized the Chinese Republic, however the 13th Dalai Lama proclaimed Tibet's independence. Some authors indicate that personal allegiance of the Dalai Lama to the Manchu Emperor came to an end and no new type of allegiance of Tibet to China was established,Alexandrowicz- Alexander C.H. The Legal Position of Tibet. - The American Journal of International Law, vol. 48, No. 2, 1954, pp. 265-274. or that Tibet had relationships with the empire and not with the new nation-state of China.Dulaney, A.G., Cusack, D.M., and Van Walt van Praag, M., 1998. The Case Concerning Tibet. Tibet's Sovereignty and Tibetan People's Right to Self- Determination. New Delhi, p.1-2, 29-30, 38. Barnett observes that there is no document before 1950 in which Tibet explicitly recognizes Chinese sovereignty, and considers Tibet's subordination to China during the periods when China had most authority comparable to that of a colony. Tibetologist Elliot Sperling noted that the Tibetan term for China, Rgya-nag, did not mean anything more than a country bordering Tibet from the east, and did not include Tibet.Sperling, E. The Tibet-China Conflict: History and Polemics. - Policy Studies 7, 2004, p. 34.

Stating that The Seventeen-Point Agreement was intended to facilitate the military occupation of Tibet.

For all countries in the world, Tibet is Chinese territory.\\"West is 'waging a new Cold War against China' Chinadaily.com quotes German newspaper. Retrieved on April 17, 2008 The only historical exception was the similarly unrecognized Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, which declared independence from China together with Tibet just after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Bogd and Tibet signed a treaty of mutual recognition, although the 13th Dalai Lama denied ever giving authorization and the Tibetan government never ratified it.Bell, Charles, Tibet Past and Present, 1924, pp 150f, 228f, 304f. During the early 1990s governmental bodies, including the European Union and United States Congress, and other international organisations declared that Tibetans lacked the enjoyment of self-determination to which they are entitled and that it is an occupied territory.Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, Pub.

By 2008, it was the only state still to hold this view.Staff, Britain's suzerain remedy , The Economist, 6 November 2008 David Miliband, the British Foreign Secretary, described the old position as an anachronism originating in the geopolitics of the early 20th century.Lunn, Jon.

Genocide allegations  Groups such as the Madrid-based Committee to Support Tibet claim the death toll in Tibet since the 1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet to be 1,200,000 and have filed official charges of genocide against prominent Chinese leaders and officials. This figure has been disputed by Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations,Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, and Society in a Disputed Region by Barry Sautman and June Teufel Dreyer, New York: M.E.Sharpe (2006),p12 but rather, concludes a no less devastating death toll of half a million people as a direct result of Chinese policies. TIBET, TIBET, A PERSONAL HISTORY OF A LOST LAND Nov 17, 2008 Category: Book Reviews According to an ICJ (International Commission of Jurists) report released in 1960, there was no \\"sufficient proof of the destruction of Tibetans as a race, nation or ethnic group as such by methods that can be regarded as genocide in international law\\" found in Tibet.ICJ Report on Tibet and China (excerpt) (1960), p.346  Other rights  (See Serfdom in Tibet controversy, Social classes of Tibet and Human rights in Tibet.) The PRC argues that the Tibetan authority under successive Dalai Lamas was also itself a human rights violator. The old society of Tibet was a serfdom and, according to reports of an early English explorer, had remnants of \\"a very mild form of slavery\\" prior to the 13th Dalai Lama's reforms of 1913.For existence of serfdom and slaves, see Grunfeld, 1996, pp12-17 and Bell, Charles, 1927, pp78-79; for other forms of human rights violation, see Bessac, Frank, \\"This Was the Perilous Trek to Tragedy\\", Life, 13 Nov 1950, pp130-136, 198, 141; Ford, Robert W., \\"Wind Between The Worlds\\", New York, 1957, p37; MacDonald, David, \\"The Land of the Lamas\\", London, 1929, pp196-197 Tibetologist Robert Barnett wrote about clerical resistance to the introduction of anything Anti-Buddhist that might disturb the prevailing power structure. Clergy obstructed modernization attempts by the 13th Dalai Lama.Robert Barnett in Steve Lehman, The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive, Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.12 , Old Tibet had a long history of persecuting non-Buddhist Christians. In the years 1630 and 1742, Tibetan Christian communities were suppressed by the lamas of the Gelugpa Sect, whose chief lama was the Dalai Lama. Jesuit priests were made prisoners in 1630 or attacked before they reached Tsaparang. Between 1850 and 1880, eleven fathers of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were murdered in Tibet, or killed or injured during their journeys to other missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881 Father Brieux was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. Qing officials later discovered that the murder cases were in fact covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and their patrons—the native chieftains. In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet by Hsiao-ting Lin The History of Tibet By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned Three UN resolutions of 1959, 1961, and 1965 condemned human rights violation in Tibet. These resolutions were passed at a time when the PRC was not permitted to become a member and of course was not allowed to present its singular version of events in the region (however, the Republic of China on Taiwan, which the PRC also tries to claim sovereignty over, was a member of the UN at the time, and it equally claimed sovereignty over Tibet and opposed Tibetan self-determination). Professor and sinologist A. Tom Grunfeld called the resolutions impractical and justified the PRC in ignoring them.Grunfeld, 1996, p180 Grunfeld questioned Human Rights Watch reports on human rights abuses in Tibet, saying they distorted the big picture. According to Barnett, since Western powers and especially the United States used the Tibet issue in the 1950s and 1960s for cold war political purposes, the PRC is now able to get support from developing countries in defeating the last nine attempts at the United Nations to criticize China. Barnett writes that the position of the Chinese in Tibet would be more accurately characterized as a colonial occupation, and that such an approach might cause developing nations to be more supportive of the Tibetan cause. The Chinese government ignores the issue of its alleged violations of Tibetan human rights, and prefers to argue that the invasion was about territorial integrity and unity of the State.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/12/content_6612118.htm Retrieved on 12 April 2008 Furthermore, Tibetan activists inside Tibet have until recently focused on independence, not human rights. Leaders of the Tibetan Youth Congress which claims a strength of over 30,000 members http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/11/content_6608921.htm 'Tibetan Youth Congress' is pure terrorist organization Retrieved on 13 April 2008 are alleged by China to advocate violence. In 1998, Barnett wrote that India's military includes 10,000 Tibetans, a fact that has been causing China some unease. He further wrote that \\"at least seven bombs exploded in Tibet between 1995 and 1997, one of them laid by a monk, and a significant number of individual Tibetans are known to be actively seeking the taking up of arms; hundreds of Chinese soldiers and police have been beaten during demonstrations in Tibet, and at least one killed in cold blood, probably several more.\\" Chinadaily.com reported on the discovery of weapons subsequent to the protests by Buddhists monks on March 14, 2008: \\"Police in Lhasa seized more than 100 guns, tens of thousands of bullets, several thousand kilograms of explosives and tens of thousands of detonators, acting on reports from lamas and ordinary people.\\" On 23 March 2008, there was a bombing incident in the Qambo prefecture.  Self-determination  While the earliest ROC constitutional documents already claim Tibet as part of China, Chinese political leaders also acknowledged the principle of self-determination. For example, at a party conference in 1924, Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen issued a statement calling for the right of self-determination of all Chinese ethnic groups: \\"The Kuomintang can state with solemnity that it recognizes the right of self- determination of all national minorities in China and it will organize a free and united Chinese republic.\\"Quoted from National and Minority Policies, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science: Report of China 277, 1951, pp148-149 In 1931, the CCP issued a constitution for the short-lived Chinese Soviet Republic which states that Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, \\"may either join the Union of Chinese Soviets or secede from it.\\"Brandt, C., Schwartz, B. and Fairbank, John K. (ed.), A Documentary History of Chinese Communism, 1960, pp223-224 It is notable that China was in a state of civil war at the time and that the \\"Chinese Soviets\\" only represents a faction. Saying that Tibet may secede from the \\"Chinese Soviets\\" does not mean that it can secede from China. The quote above is merely a statement of Tibetans' freedom to choose their political orientation. The possibility of complete secession was denied by Communist leader Mao Zedong in 1938: \\"They must have the right to self-determination and at the same time they should continue to unite with the Chinese people to form one nation\\". This policy was codified in PRC's first constitution which, in Article 3, reaffirmed China as a \\"single multi-national state,\\" while the \\"national autonomous areas are inalienable parts\\". The Chinese government insists that the United Nations documents, which codifies the principle of self- determination, provides that the principle shall not be abused in disrupting territorial integrity: \\"Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations....\\"United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  Legitimacy  The PRC also points to what it claims are the autocratic, oppressive and theocratic policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, its toleration of existence of serfdom and slaves, its so-called \\"renunciation\\" of (Arunachal Pradesh) and its association with India and other foreign countries, and as such claims the Government of Tibet in Exile has no legitimacy to govern Tibet and no credibility or justification in criticizing PRC's policies. China claims that the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet in 1951 was not without the support of the Tibetan people, including the 10th Panchen Lama. Ian Buruma writes: Instances have been documented when the PRC government gained support from a significant portion of the Tibetan population, including monastic leaders,Goldstein, Melvyn C., \\"A history of modern Tibet\\", pp683-687 monks,Ford, R. W., \\"Wind between the Worlds\\", p178, saying: ' There was no sacking of monasteries at this time. On the contrary, the Chinese took great care not to cause offense through ignorance. They soon had the monks thanking the gods for their deliverance. ' nobilityGrunfeld, A.T., \\"The Making of Modern Tibet\\", p115, saying: ' By most accounts there were some Tibetans who were pleased to see the Han in Tibet. Peter Aufschneiter told British diplomats in Kathmandu that ordinary Tibetans liked the Han because they were honest and they distributed land. Among the younger generation of the nobility it was seen as an opportunity to make some positive changes. 'Grunfeld, A.T., \\"The Making of Modern Tibet\\", M. E. Sharpe, 1996, p127, saying ' When the communists first arrived in Lhasa, only a few of the aristocracy joined them enthusiastically. In Kham, however, the upper classes welcomed them as potential liberators from the strongly disliked Lhasan officials. ' and ordinary Tibetans prior to the crackdown in the 1959 uprising. The PRC government and many Tibetan leaders characterize PLA's operation as a peaceful liberation of Tibetans from a \\"feudal serfdom system.\\" ().\\" .\\" Full Text of Speech By Chinese President Hu Jintao at Tibet's Peaceful Liberation Anniversary Rally When Tibet complained to the United Nations through El Salvador about Chinese invasion in November 1950—after Chinese forces entered Chamdo (or Qamdo) when Tibet failed to respond by the deadline to China's demand for negotiation--Tell you a true Tibet -- Peaceful Liberation of Tibet members debated about it but refused to admit the \\"Tibet Question\\" into the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly. Key stakeholder India told the General Assembly that \\"the Peking Government had declared that it had not abandoned its intention to settle the difficulties by peaceful means\\", and that \\"the Indian Government was certain that the Tibet Question could still be settled by peaceful means\\". The Russian delegate said that \\"China's sovereignty over Tibet had been recognized for a long time by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the U.S.S.R.\\" The United Nations postponed this matter on the grounds that Tibet was officially an \\"autonomous nationality region belonging to territorial China\\", and because the outlook of peaceful settlement seemed good.A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State by Melvyn C. Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p676-9,699,729-735Melvyn C. Goldstein, The Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet, and the Dalai Lama Berkeley:University of California Press, (1999), p41; cited by Yuliya Babayeva in the article The Khampa Uprising: Tibetan Resistance Against the Chinese Invasion pdf p15. Subsequently, The Agreement Between the Central Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Method for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, also known as Seventeen-Point Agreement, was signed between delegates of China and Tibet on 23 May 1951. The Dalai Lama, despite the massive Chinese military presence, had ample time and opportunity to repudiate and denounce the Seventeen-Point Agreement. He was encouraged and instigated to do so with promise of public but not military support by the US, which by now had become hostile to Communist-ruled China.A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State by Melvyn Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p761-769,784-812 On May 29, the 10th Panchen Erdeni (i.e. 10th Panchen Lama) and the Panchen Kampus Assembly made a formal statement, expressing their heartfelt support for the agreement. The statement indicated their resolution to guarantee the correct implementation of the agreement and to realize solidarity between the different ethnic groups of China and ethnic solidarity among the Tibetans; and on May 30, the 10th Panchen Erdeni telegrammed the 14th Dalai Lama, expressing his hope for unity and his vow to support the 14th Dalai Lama and the government of Tibet with the implementation of the agreement under the guidance of the Central Government and Chairman Mao.Signing of the Agreement on Methods for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet Retrieved on 25 April 2008. The Agreement was finally accepted by Tibet's National Assembly, which then advised the Dalai Lama to accept it. Finally, on 24 October 1951, the Dalai Lama dispatched a telegram to Mao Zedong: On 28 October 1951, the Panchen Rinpoche [i.e. Panchen Lama] made a similar public statement accepting the agreement. He urged the \\"people of Shigatse to give active support\\" to carrying out the agreement.The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959 edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.604 Tsering Shakya writes about the general acceptance of the Tibetans toward the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and its legal significance: On March 28, 1959, premier Zhou Enlai signed the order of the PRC State Council on the uprising in Tibet, accusing the Tibetan government of disrupting the Agreement. (see, for review). The creation of the TAR finally buried the Agreement that was discarded back in 1959.Shakya, Ts. 1999. The Dragon in the Land of Snows. A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947. London: Pimlico, p. 306 On April 18, 1959, the Dalai Lama published a statement in Tezpur, India, that gave his reasons for escaping to India. He pointed out that the 17 Point Agreement was signed under compulsion, and that later \\"the Chinese side permanently violated it\\". According to Michael Van Walt Van Praag, \\"treaties and similar agreements concluded under the use or threat of force are invalid under international law ab initio\\".Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law. Westview, 1987, p. 98 According to this interpretation, this Agreement would not be considered legal by those who consider Tibet to have been an independent state before its signing, but would be considered legal by those who acknowledge China's sovereignty over Tibet prior to the treaty.Kapstein, Matthew T. 2006. The Tibetans. London: Blackwell, pp. 280-290International Commission of Jurists, The Question of Tibet and the Rule of Law. Feb. 2009 Other accounts, such as those of Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein, argue that under international law the threat of military action does not invalidate a treaty. According to Goldstein, the legitimacy of the treaty hinges on the signatories having full authority to finalise such an agreement; whether they did is up for debate.Goldstein, Melvyn C., A History of Modern Tibet (Vol 2): A Calm before the Storm: 1951–1959, 2007, pp. 106–107  See also  * Tibet * Tibetan independence movement * Patron and priest relationship * South Tibet * Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme * Protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950 * Tibet flag case * Seventeen Point Agreement  References   Sources  * Ahmad, Zahiruddin.

The last head teacher was Helen Gray. The school closed on 1 July 2016. History Menzieshill High School was constructed with a cost under £1 million and opened in 1971. The school was one of Dundee's first comprehensive schools, accepting pupils from all backgrounds and regardless of their academic abilities. Menzieshill High School was one of the first schools in Dundee to offer home economics for boys and woodwork for girls. Closure Demonstration outside Dundee City Chambers In November 2014, Dundee City Council proposed to close Menzieshill High School and move the pupils to Harris Academy in 2016, when the new Harris building on Perth Road was built. The public consultation closed on 27 February 2015 and a final decision on whether to close the school was made on 22 June 2015 where 18 councillors voted in favour of the closure with 14 councillors against. Menzieshill Reverend Bob Mallinson said he would keep the fight going on and take it to parliament, but the government did not approve nor debate on the issue, confirming that the school would close as scheduled. A senior SNP councillor has said pupils would enjoy \\"better facilities\\" at Harris Academy. There was an ongoing Save Menzieshill High campaign which aimed to persuade the council to save the school. A public meeting was organised at Menzieshill Parish Church with the support of the Dundee branch of the Scottish Socialist Party and non-partisan local activists. Dozens of parents and pupils went on to demonstrate outside Dundee City Chambers while the council was setting its budget on 12 February. Pupils The school catered for six hundred pupils aged between eleven-and-a-half to eighteen in First to Sixth Year, and admitted pupils from the Gowrie Park, Menzieshill, Charleston, Lochee and Dryburgh catchment areas of Dundee, as well as the villages of Longforgan and Inchture. This area consists of a mixture of privately owned and council housing. The feeder primary schools were: *Gowriehill Primary School *Hillside Primary School *Camperdown Primary School (formerly lochee primary and Charleston Primary school *Longforgan Primary School *Inchture Primary School *St. Clement's RC Primary School (optional) Houses Pupils at the school were organised into four houses: Aberfeldy, Fortingall, Weem and Culdares which are all named after Scottish villages associated with Clan Menzies. Badge and colours The school badge consisted of a red, equilateral triangle supported by two grey trapezoids. The triangle represented the school; it was equilateral to show the school's commitment to equality of opportunity (as one of Dundee's first comprehensive schools, it did not select its pupils based on academic ability). The trapezoids represented the buildings immediately surrounding the school in Menzieshill, many of which were grey and trapezoidal, whilst the green represented the abundant grassland that characterized the area. The badge, therefore, showed that the school was at the heart of the community and was supported by it. Together, these elements formed a stylized \\"M\\" for Menzieshill. Originally, the school colours were those of the school badge – bottle green, grey, and red – with the addition of black. The bottle-green blazers were highly distinctive but were later replaced by more traditional black ones. In the 1970s, the school uniform stipulated that other items had to be in \\"the school colours\\", which allowed pupils of both sexes to dress entirely (shirt, jumper, and trousers) in bottle-green or bright red if they so wished. Later, the uniform was changed to stipulate black or grey for trousers, although there was some leeway for \\"self-coloured\\" shirts and jumpers.

It was a contentious issue and was narrowly rejected at the time by the electorate, but the legislature later approved similar legislation in 2003. Supporters Support for concealed carry laws in Missouri grew gradually throughout the 1990s. In 1991, a group to promote such laws called \\"the conference\\" was formed and that nickname was used until the Missouri Legislative Issues Council (MOLIC) was formed in 1995 for official recognition. Support for these laws increased in part as a response to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and other national gun control efforts. After author/columnist John Ross made his attempts to convince Missouri legislators, other supporters also emerged. The NRA formed Missourians Against Crime (MAC) in 1998 as their spokesman into Missouri. This created an issue with the MOLIC membership. Negative campaigns seldom succeed in Missouri. The MOLIC organization was transformed into Missourians for Personal Safety(MPS) for the 1998 Proposition B campaign with Steve McGhee as the President. These combined efforts brought notoriety to Greg Jeffery, attorney/author Kevin Jamison, and Tim Oliver, to the forefront of their local/regional news media. As the Missouri Sport Shooting Association (MSSA), joined (unofficially) in support, they all proceeded with their regional campaigning attempts. Eventually, more and more individuals heard of these volunteers/members and took up the task to support the proposition with smaller meetings and neighborhood 'grass roots' action groups. Police Officers generally supported the measure: \\"In a recent poll, more than eighty-five percent of our 1352 members favored Right-to-Carry.\\", Letter to St. Louis Police Chief Ron Henderson, from Sgt. John J. Johnson, President St. Louis Police Officers Association, 1/23/99.\\" The Gateway Civil Liberties Alliance (GCLA) arose after the failure to pass the proposition in 1999; forming itself from MOLIC, MPS, and with WMSA giving support, to become the leadership and legislative clearing house for the 2003 success in passing a shall-issue law. Frequent trips to Jefferson City by Greg Jeffery (GCLA cofounder) earned him the nickname 'braintrust' to a newly created law that was adopted by Missouri in 2003. Opponents Handgun Control, Inc., saw this as their test case before the elections in 2000 to exercise their political influence1983 The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV), an educational outreach organization dedicated to reducing gun violence, is founded as a sister organization to HCI.

Political notables included the Clinton/Gore Administration\\"Clinton's Administration is easily the most reckless in interfering with the integrity of Federal investigative agencies since that of Richard Nixon.\\" -- NY Times editorial, \\"White House Ethics Meltdown\\", 3/4/94 with Attorney General Janet Reno playing a secondary role to Hillary Clinton's activism, Governor Mel Carnahan and his daughter Robin Carnahan, the 1994 appointed Secretary of State, Rebecca Cook,There was debate to which office held more influence between Secretary of State and/or the State Auditor. Most political watchers agreed that the Secretary of State had the authority to change the ballot language used (without review) in 1999. and State Auditor, Claire McCaskill. Robin Carnahan chaired the Safe Schools and Workplaces Committee (SSWC) and orchestrated television ads against the proposition. Also, on the weekend prior to voting day, that organization coordinated the taped phone message from Hillary Clinton to automatically dial 75,000 homes statewide with the message, \\"just too dangerous for Missouri families.\\" Ballot language The General Assembly approved the following ballot language: > Shall state or local law enforcement agencies be authorized to issue permits > to law-abiding citizens at least twenty-one years of age to carry concealed > firearms outside their home for personal protection after having passed a > state and federal criminal background check and having completed a firearms > safety training course approved by the Missouri Department of Public Safety? After a lawsuit filed by the opponents of the measure, the language was changed. The final text read: > \\"Shall sheriffs, or in the case of St. Louis County, the chief of police, be > required to issue permits to carry concealed firearms to citizens who apply > if various statutory requirements are satisfied?\\" Because of the discretion > given to local law enforcement to verify the accuracy of applications, the > costs are uncertain. Application fees are estimated to cover most costs for > the first three years. Subsequently, local governments, as a whole, may > incur costs from $500,000 to $1,000,000 annually, not covered by fees. Missouri Sport Shooting Association President Kevin Jamison described it as, \\"The opposition conducted a poll of the ballot language which determined that 60% of the state would vote in favor of License to Carry. Outraged that the people might \\"speak wrong\\", the Governor's lawyer filed a suit with the Missouri Supreme Court to change the ballot language. The defendants in the suit were Attorney General Jay Nixon and State Auditor Claire McCaskill.\\"THE MISSOURI MIRACLE by K. L. Jamison  Campaign controversies  The use of official government resources by opponents of the measure was controversial. > Missouri's two US Attorneys are using the Justice Department's name and > facilities to lobby against the state's concealed weapons ballot issue. > Using official department letterhead, the attorneys, Edward Dowd and Stephen > Hill, urged sheriffs and police chiefs across the state to rally resistance > against Proposition B, which is on the ballot this April.

Bush is elected President, the NRA will be working out of the White House. (source: HCI) Results Proposition B gained 634,361 votes in favor (48.3%) and 678,256 votes against (51.7%), thus being defeated by a margin of 3.3%. The majority of voters in rural Missouri voted in favor of Proposition B. However, urban voters, particularly in St. Louis and Kansas City, tipped the balance against Proposition B. 74.1% of the voters in the city of St. Louis, 69.5% in St. Louis County, and 71.6% in Kansas City opposed Proposition B. In 2003, the Missouri General Assembly passed new laws to enable shall-issue permits.

Designed by the Corps of Engineers, it began service on August 22, 1968. Its primary purpose is flood control but it also provides power, navigation improvement downstream and irrigation. The damming of the river created Foster Reservoir, which is a popular fishing and water sports area. The reservoir stores . The powerhouse has two generators with a capacity totaling 20 MW. The dam regulates water flow from the main facility, Green Peter Dam. Risk to fish The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory tested the likely effects of the dam on fish populations using the sensor fish. They concluded that all fish travelling over the spillway fish weir would probably experience a minimum of one significantly stressful event. This is due to the absence of a cushioning effect due to the shallow flow depth and badly formed discharge jet. In fact, most fish would likely experience many events while tumbling down the spillway. Because of the larger size of actual fish, the study concluded that live fish would experience even greater events than the sensor fish. Most injuries sustained by smolt (juvenile salmon) after they had passed through the weir were caused by the weir jet's shallow depth as well as the angle of the jet as it struck the spillway chute. Over 22% of the sensor fish were damaged or lost in the turbine tests. The devices showed signs of \\"grinding or squeezing\\". It is assumed that this happened while being compressed when travelling between the blades of the turbine. Although turbine pressures were similar to Kaplan turbines at the Snake River dams and Columbia River dams, significant events were recorded by the sensor fish occurred at a rate 2-3 times more frequently at the Foster Dam. Rates of injury and mortality for live fish were correspondingly higher. When comparing the two passage routes, data show that fish travelling over the weir experienced greater event magnitudes than fish travelling through the turbine. This is because of the eventual impact the fish experienced at the spillway chute. The study suggests that possible spillway weir design changes and increasing the depth of flow would improve fish safety.http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22236.pdf  See also  Aerial view of the dam * List of dams in Oregon  References  External links * Category:Dams in Oregon Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Linn County, Oregon Category:Sweet Home, Oregon Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Dams completed in 1968 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Foster Dam"},{"id":"6878910","text":"Picture of M. V. Sivan Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan () (23 May 1844 – 27 January 1893) was a composer of Carnatic music. He was a great exponent of extemporaneous singing. He also composed a ragamalika (garland of ragas - a song that utilises more than one raga) with all the 72 melakartha ragas. Vaidyanatha Iyer was born in the village of Viyacheri in the Thanjavur districts of Tamil Nadu. His father Duraisami Iyer was also a musician and he trained Vaidyanatha Iyer as well as his other sons in Carnatic music. Vaidyanatha Iyer continued his training with some of the well known musicians of his time including Anai Ayya brothers. Later he continued his training under Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar, one of Tyagaraja’s disciples. He was famous for his elaboration of ragas (raga alapana). Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan and his elder brother, Ramaswami Sivan, were the earliest performing duo in the history of Carnatic music as known in the last two centuries.

Yeates has published several legal books, including Louisiana Oil and Gas Legislation (1994: 2nd ed. 1998), and Selected Commentary on Oil and Gas Law (2000 and 1999). His many articles include Louisiana and Texas Oil & Gas Law: An Overview of the Differences (1992), Strategies Outlined for Doing Business in Russia (1992), The Accounting Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (1994), and Indemnification and Anti-Indemnity Statutes as They Relate to Mineral Rights and Contracts (1986). Yeates's first novel, Bay of One Hundred Fires (), published in 2004, is an alternate history based geo-political thriller that speculates what Saddam Hussein might have done with the deadly weapons many people believed he had. In the novel, the nuclear-powered USS California is overhauled and upgraded, and plays a key role in fighting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein who has, at least in the book, created a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Some of Yeates's inspiration for Bay came from his service in the U.S. Navy, where he served and developed expertise in 3-D radar aboard the California in 1974. When the California was delivered to the U.S. Navy, Yeates was at the helm when the ship departed the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for its maiden voyage at sea. Yeates also helmed the California in 1998 when it sailed to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to be scrapped.

History The following is to clarify the purpose of our existence as a church: 1\\\\. WHY ITS EXISTENCE? The Bible Missionary Church came into existence through those holiness people who desired to continue in the old-fashioned lines of faith, fellowship, and personal holiness from which present-day holiness churches have so largely departed. 2\\\\. We abhor and warn against modernism and formality. 3\\\\. Our church is definitely Arminian,and does not tolerate Calvinism among our preachers or in our churches. 4\\\\. We believe that the same truth and the same kind of singing and praying by the same kind of Christians will bring the same kind of results that the early holiness people experienced. 5\\\\. We are concerned about reaching this lost generation for Christ, gathering the scattered sheep of the House of Israel, and keeping them ready for the Rapture. 6\\\\. We are old-fashioned people. If you are one,join us,or if you want to be one, come with us, and we will try to help you become one. 7\\\\. The world is our parish. We believe God has called us,and that we have a God-given right to preach in every place. We make no apology for entering any field. Beliefs The Bible Missionary Church holds a monotheistic, Trinitarian theology in the Wesleyan tradition. The BMC teaches that believers are cleansed from inbred sin and rebellion to God by a second definite experience referred to as entire sanctification, as taught by the historic Methodist Church and the Church of the Nazarene. In conjunction with entire sanctification, the BMC teaches that believers are to live godly lives, manifesting this by compliance to an outward standard of holiness. Many of these standards are codified in the rules contained in the church manual. They believe that complete obedience to God is a joy and delight.For an introduction to this doctrine, https://www.classicholinesssermons.com/ is invaluable. In 1999, the Bible Missionary Church adopted a resolution against same-sex marriage, forbidding its ministers to perform the wedding ceremonies of same-sex couples.General Conference Journal, 1999 Unlike many other conservative churches, however, the Bible Missionary Church allows women to fill leadership positions on church boards, although it is not widely practiced. Observance of Christian Sabbath, Sunday, is also expected by abstaining from unnecessary work or commerce and setting the day aside for worship and service to humanity.King, Lucille: Remember the Sabbath http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/1901-2000/HDM1972.pdf The Bible Missionary Church holds a strong premillennialism view of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, but its adherents hold a variety of views on the timing of the Rapture of the Church.Manual of the Bible Missionary Church The Bible Missionary Church believes in aggressive evangelismThe Missionary Revivalist, November 2007, page 3 and in addition to its worldwide missionary efforts is currently expanding in North America with several new churches in the United States and Canada. Church government The Bible Missionary Church government is patterned on the Church of the Nazarene. Its form of government is republican in nature giving equal representation to local churches, lay members, and elders. The church holds a general conference every four years at which major policy issues for the denomination as a whole are addressed. The most recent general conference took place in 2019. The general conference elects general officers, including two general moderators, and a general board. The current General Moderators are Rev. Roger Moyer and Rev. John Kinnaman. The general conference also governs additions and deletions to the manual (termed \\"memorials\\"). General conference business follows Parliamentary Procedure and Robert's Rules of Order. In addition, the American church is composed of the following self-governing districts:Bible Missionary Church Manual Arkansas District (Arkansas), California-Arizona-Nevada District, Intermountain District (Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Alaska, West Kansas), Iowa-Illinois District, Louisiana-South Texas District, Great Lakes District (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario) Midwest District (Missouri, East Kansas) Northeast District (New England, Pennsylvania, and Eastern seaboard), Northwest District (Idaho, Montana, East Oregon), North Pacific District (Washington, West Oregon), Southeast District (Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida), Southwest District (Oklahoma, Texas), Although most foreign churches come under the jurisdiction of the foreign missions committee (appointed by the general board), the churches in Mexico, Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines are self-governing, organized districts of the Bible Missionary Church, while the churches in Canada are included with American districts. Educational institutions The Bible Missionary Church's schools include Bible Missionary Institute, a 4-year Bible college in Rock Island, Illinois. Bible Missionary Institute offers four-year degrees in Theology, Missions, Religious Education, Music, and General Studies, as well as associate degrees. The Bible Missionary Church also operates a Spanish Bible college in Houston, Texas as well as Beulah Mountain Christian Academy in Whitley City, Kentucky, a K-12 boarding school for at-risk children.

All 42 on board were presumed killed in the incident. Details of accident The flight originated in Miami at 10:22 PM the previous evening, landed at Tampa at 11:00 PM, and departed for New Orleans at 11:22 PM. The last radio contact with the flight was at 12:44 AM, when the flight contacted company radio in New Orleans. Radar operators at a military station at Houma, Louisiana, picked up the flight at 12:46 AM. Capt. Frank E. Todd of Miami, the pilot, radioed his last message at 12:44 a.m. He reported a \\"smooth flight\\" and unlimited visibility, but said he could see a solid overcast of fog ahead. He was cleared by the New Orleans Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC - ZNO) located in the terminal building at New Orleans Lakefront Airport to descend to and maintain 5,000 feet and to report leaving 8,000 feet. This air traffic control instruction/clearance was issued through National Airlines' radio station/office at Pensacola, Florida, a normal procedure before making the approach to Moisant International Airport (KMSY) in New Orleans. At that time the control tower at Moisant reported a ceiling of 1,200 feet with three-fourths of a mile visibility, light fog and rain. It continued on a track of 296 degrees magnetic for a few minutes, then turned right to a heading of approximately 010 degrees and disappeared from the scope at 12:51 AM. At 1:16 AM, company radio attempted to contact Flight 967 to no avail; attempts by FAA en route facilities, New Orleans Approach Control, and air traffic control were unable to raise the flight. Search and rescue aircraft spotted scattered debris and a number of bodies in the vicinity of the last radar return, about 35 miles east of Pilottown, Louisiana; the remains of 10 individuals were eventually located. The main section of the wreckage has never been found despite the efforts of Navy and Coast Guard divers. According to the Nov. 17, 1959, edition of the New York Times, I. W. Dymond, vice president of operations for the airline, said the weather \\"was anticipated, but it was not a factor\\" in the crash. He added that New Orleans had instrument meteorological conditions, and indicated that the crew had planned to use this method on the approach until the plane was below the low ceiling. Lieut. James L. Sigman, executive officer of the Coast Guard station at New Orleans, said the plane might have exploded when it struck the water. The bodies were stripped of clothing and revealed severe burns, he said. He added that the passengers apparently had no warning to don lifebelts, as only one life preserver was found among the debris. However, the Clearfield, Pennsylvania, Progress speculated in its Nov. 17, 1959, edition that the aircraft may have been brought down by a bomb: \\"Was there an explosion aboard the National Airlines DC-7B liner that crashed in the Gulf of Mexico Monday with 42 persons aboard? If there was, did it come before or after the crash? Members of the party hunting in the shark-infested waters for bodies believe there was an explosion. But they don't agree on when it occurred. Lt. James L. Sigman, executive officer of the Coast Guard air detachment at New Orleans, said the wreckage was spread over a comparatively small area of two to three miles. This indicated to him that the explosion took place after the plane hit the water. But two Air Force fliers who spent four hours over the scene said because the wreckage was so scattered it seemed to them the plane exploded in the air.\\" One passenger, William Taylor, had boarded the flight using a ticket issued to Robert Vernon Spears, a convicted criminal working at the time as a naturopath. A hypothesis arose that Spears, who had befriended Taylor in prison, tricked Taylor into boarding the flight with a piece of luggage containing a bomb. When the aircraft was destroyed, authorities would assume that Spears had himself been a victim and his wife would be able to collect on his life insurance. However, Taylor purchased life insurance in his own name at the airport before departure; when his ex-wife applied to collect, the substitution was discovered. Spears disappeared after the accident but was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona with Taylor's car in January, 1960. He was charged with unlawful possession of an automobile but due to lack of evidence was never charged in the alleged bombing of Flight 967. Spears died in Baylor Medical Center, Dallas on May 2, 1969 of coronary thrombosis.Robert Spears, 1959 bomb suspect, dies in Dallas There was no evidence of any connection between Spears and the accident. The Civil Aeronautics Board (predecessor of the NTSB) did not find a probable cause for the accident due to the lack of evidence.

The institute is characterized by a zeal for the work of preaching and the sacrament of confession, according to the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola and the moral theology of St. Alphonsus Liguori. It is also marked by love for Mary and fidelity to the magisterium. Lanteri first founded the Oblates of Mary Most Holy in 1816, as a diocesan right congregation. Subsequently, after a five-year hiatus, some of the original members re- established themselves as \\"The Oblates of the Virgin Mary\\" ('), and received papal approval from Pope Leo XII on 1 September 1826, about four years before Lanteri's death. Since the initial foundation, the Oblates have worked throughout Italy and its islands, and in France, Austria, Myanmar (Burma), Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, the United States of America, Mexico, Canada, the Philippines, and Nigeria. History Pio Bruno Lanteri OMV Bruno Lanteri was a diocesan priest in Turin, Italy, where he met Jesuit Father Nikolaus von Diessbach. Under Diessbach guidance, Lanteri made the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. Father von Diessbach founded the Amicizie Cristiane (Christian Friendships) and the Amicizie Sacerdotale (Priestly Friendships), groups of lay people and priests committed to a serious spiritual life, and to making an impact on the culture by circulating Catholic books. Father Lanteri worked with these groups for no less than thirty years.\\"History\\", Oblates of the Virgin Mary In 1814, three priests approached Father Lanteri for guidance in forming a fraternity dedicated to preaching retreats and reviving the Church in the wake of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era. Lanteri first founded the Oblates of Mary Most Holy in 1816, as a diocesan right congregation. Despite some initial setbacks, the Oblates of the Virgin Mary were approved by Pope Leo XII on September 1, 1826,Paulin, Jeremy. \\"The Oblates of the Virgin Mary: For Our Lord and Our Lady\\", Catholic World Report, February 23, 2014 with the papal brief, ', almost four years before Lanteri's death. Fr. Lanteri died four years later August 5, 1830. The Oblates of the Virgin Mary quickly expanded throughout Italy and into France and Austria. As of 2014, the Oblates had 200 members working in nine countries. Charism The charism of the institute draws from its founder's childhood experience of a strongly religious household and love for the Virgin Mary, which especially grew from the time of his mother's death, when he was four years old. At the age of seventeen, Lanteri was drawn to what he called \\"silence and seclusion,\\" which prompted him to enter the Carthusians. Though he left after eight days, due to frail health, his desire for this lifestyle remained and also shaped the institute. Ministry One of the main activities of the Oblates of the Virgin Mary is conducting retreats. They also provide parish missions throughout the Northeastern United States. A mission is typically three to five days in length, and includes preaching on the major themes of the Gospel, confessions, and guidance in the life of prayer.  St. Ignatius Province  The Oblates of the Virgin Mary began their first foundation in the United States in 1976. As of 2010, the congregation has expanded into Massachusetts, Colorado, Illinois, California, and Florida, plus a new seminary and retreat center in the Philippines.

In 1648, the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807, the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813, the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Sandbostel, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823. In 1932, during the Great Depression the Lutheran Church of the State of Hanover opened a camp for workless singles, employed in public works (roadworks, amelioration) near Sandbostel. In 1939, the Sandbostel camp, meanwhile taken over by the Nazi trade union Reichsarbeitsdienst, was converted into the Prisoner-of-war camp Stalag X-B and a camp of internment for civilian enemy aliens.

Personal life He was born in Kampung Gunung Mesah, Gopeng, Perak; coincidentally on the same month and year as the October Revolution in the Russian Empire. He is the eldest brother of 7 brothers and 1 sister. He received his early education at the Gunung Panjang Malay School and the Kampung Gunung Mesah Madrasah, which were both in Gopeng. He graduated at standard 5 in a Malay school. However, due to poverty Rashid dropped out of school in 1929. After leaving school, Rashid travelled and sought employment, ending up in Cameron Highlands, Pahang. While working odd jobs there, he befriended a Christian missionary who taught him to speak basic English. He furthered his proficiency in the language via correspondence courses. Later, Rashid returned to Gopeng and worked at a French-owned power station. While employed at the power station, he studied basic electrics and eventually obtained a first-class electrical chargeman certificate. He started a family with Hamidah binti Abdul Rashid, a village girl in 1938. They have 4 children, 3 sons and a daughter. The second marriage was in 1959, a comrade and a party cadet named Selamah binti Abdullah. They were gifted another daughter. Involvement in politics Rashid was also active in the trade unions, which led him to join the CPM as the party's first Malay member. In his memoir, Memoir Rashid Maidin: Daripada perjuangan bersenjata kepada perdamaian (The Memoirs of Rashid Maidin: From Armed Struggle to Peace), Rashid justified his decision to join the CPM due to the party's strong anti-imperialist stance. CPM was among the first anti-colonial movements in Malaya. Since young Rashid was inspired by the story of Maharajalela's war against the British in Perak. In 1939. he started to get involved in the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and in 1941, he officially became a member of MCP. He was the first Malay joining MCP. In 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded and occupied Malaya. The MCP, of which Rashid by now was the party's top Malay leader, organised armed resistance via the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). At the end of the Anti-Japanese war, he met Abdullah CD. After the return of British rule, the CPM continued its armed insurrection, this time against the British colonial government, via its new militant wing, the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA). Rashid was entrusted by CPM leader Chin Peng to lead the MRLA's Malay-dominated 10th Regiment. In 1947, he was one of the representatives from CPM to attend a council communist party meeting in London. This meeting was participated by communist parties in the colonial country to discuss about the strategy to fight against colonialism for the right of independence. CPM's armed insurrection led the British to declare a state of emergency, which lasted between 1948 and 1960. in July 1948, he was caught by the British in Sungai Manik, Perak. He was put in jail for 3 and a half years. In the early 1952, he managed to free himself. After that in late 1952, Rashid met Abdullah CD in Pahang. Then in 1953, together with 10th Regiment, he retreated to the borders of Malaysia-Thailand. He was wounded on his leg during the battle against the British. In 1955, the CPM attempted to negotiate peace with the colonial government. Rashid was a member of the CPM delegation at the talks, which were held at the town of Baling, Kedah. After the collapse of the Baling Talks, the CPM continued its insurrection. In between 1961-1972, he was assigned to lead the Special Unit of National Libriation Army in the borders of Kedah-Thailand. He returned and lead Rejimen the tenth till peace in 1972. However, due to government anti-insurrection measures, CPM's guerilla struggle gradually waned and eventually ended after a peace treaty was signed with the Malaysian government in Haadyai, Thailand in 1989. Rashid was again a CPM delegate to the peace treaty. In January 2006, 500 former members of the Malayan Communist party were granted Thai citizenship.500 Ex-CPM Members To Get Thai Citizenship In the past, Rashid had failed to acquire Malaysian citizenship, like many other ex-communists living in Southern Thailand.PSM SALUTES REVOLUTIONARY RASHID MAIDIN! However, a stipulation in the treaty signed disallowed former senior CPM leaders from returning to Malaysia; hence, Rashid settled to a quiet, post-guerilla life in Southern Thailand. He died on 1 September 2006 in Si Sakhon, Narathiwat, and was buried after Friday prayers on the same day.

Acilius Glabrio and enacted in 191.L. Franchini, 'Osservazioni in merito alla lex Acilia de intercalando', in 'Annali LUMSA, 2002, 323-340. Its content is unclear, but it dealt with intercalation in the Roman calendar. Context The state of the Roman calendar during this period is uncertain. Roman legend traced the Republican calendar of 355 days to Numa, the city's second king, and also credited him with the establishment of some kind of intercalation to keep it aligned with the solar year. Some authors even credited him with use of the 19-year Metonic cycle. There is evidence, however, that the Romans long continued their early and unattested lunar calendar even after the establishment of the republic. Varro cites instances of intercalation at least as early as the 5th century . Alternatively, intercalation is sometimes said to have begun with the decemviri, who may have adopted either Etruscan or Greek practices.. Fulvius claims the Acilian Law was the first to authorize any intercalation. Contents The details of the law are uncertain, but it seems to have placed the decision whether or not to intercalate a month into the year with the college of pontiffs..

Andreas (1965). Experimental psychology. p.186 It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically. In these cases they are known as run charts.Neil J. Salkind (2006). Statistics for People who (think They) Hate Statistics: The Excel Edition. page 106.

Retrieved 7 July 2008.  Example  In the experimental sciences, data collected from experiments are often visualized by a graph. For example, if one were to collect data on the speed of a body at certain points in time, one could visualize the data by a data table such as the following: Graph of Speed Vs Time {  ! Elapsed Time (s) ! Speed (m s−1) -  0  0 -  1  3 -  2  7 -  3  12 -  4  20 -  5  30 -  6  45.6 } The table representation of data is a great way of displaying exact values, but can be a poor way to understand the underlying patterns that those values represent. Because of these qualities, the table display is often erroneously conflated with the data itself; whereas it is just another visualization of the data. Understanding the process described by the data in the table is aided by producing a graph or line chart of Speed versus Time. Such a visualisation appears in the figure to the right. Mathematically, if we denote time by the variable t, and speed by v, then the function plotted in the graph would be denoted v(t) indicating that v (the dependent variable) is a function of t.

It is simple to construct a \\"best-fit\\" layer consisting of a set of line segments connecting adjacent data points; however, such a \\"best-fit\\" is usually not an ideal representation of the trend of the underlying scatter data for the following reasons: # It is highly improbable that the discontinuities in the slope of the best-fit would correspond exactly with the positions of the measurement values. # It is highly unlikely that the experimental error in the data is negligible, yet the curve falls exactly through each of the data points. In either case, the best- fit layer can reveal trends in the data. Further, measurements such as the gradient or the area under the curve can be made visually, leading to more conclusions or results from the data table. A true best-fit layer should depict a continuous mathematical function whose parameters are determined by using a suitable error-minimization scheme, which appropriately weights the error in the data values. Such curve fitting functionality is often found in graphing software or spreadsheets. Best-fit curves may vary from simple linear equations to more complex quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and periodic curves.

He was born in Northampton, Massachusetts and educated at the College of New Jersey. He preached at Christ Church Parish in Charleston, South Carolina and then moved to Savannah. There, he was ordained by Rev. John J. Zubly and William Tennent. He served in Rev. Zubly's place in Savannah while he was attending the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. He then replaced the Rev. John Osgood at Midway Congregational Church. Midway and the surrounding St. John's Parish was hotbed of republican sentiment during the outbreak of the American Revolution. In 1778, General Augustine Prevost, military commander of British East Florida--headquartered in St. Augustine--dispersed his society, and burned the meeting house and many dwelling houses, etc. When Savannah was taken, Allen was also taken prisoner, and sent on board the prison ships. He was very active both in exhortation and in actual service in the field. He was drowned in an attempt to escape.

It includes processes common to all management like planning, organizing, staffing, directing and controlling. It is common for registered nurses to seek additional education to earn a Master of Science in Nursing or Doctor of Nursing Practice to prepare for leadership roles within nursing. Management positions increasingly require candidates to hold an advanced degree in nursing. Roles Head of the nursing staff The chief nurse, in other words the person in charge of nursing in a hospital and the head of the nursing staff, is called nursing officer in UK English, and head nurse or director of nursing in US English, and matron or nursing superintendent in Indian English. The chief nurse is a registered nurse who supervises the care of all the patients at a health care facility. The chief nurse is the senior nursing management position in an organization and often holds executive titles like chief nursing officer (CNO), chief nurse executive, or vice- president of nursing. They typically report to the CEO or COO. The chief nurse serves as \\"the head of the general staff of the hospital\\" and is obeyed by his/her subordinate nurses. Traditionally, chief nurses were called matrons and wore a dark-blue dress that was usually darker than that of her subordinates, who were also known as sisters, in addition to a white-starched hat. As such, matrons usually \\"provide strong leadership and act as a link between Board-level nurses and clinical practice.\\" In military hospitals of the United States, matrons were \\"charged with the responsibility of making twice daily rounds to supervise the [common] nurses' duty performance.\\" The American Organization of Nurse Executives is a professional association for directors of nursing. Service directors Many large healthcare organizations also have service directors. These directors have oversight of a particular service within the facility or system (surgical services, women's services, emergency services, critical care services, etc.). Often these directors are over managers of those service lines. Nurse manager The nurse manager is the nurse with management responsibilities of a nursing unit. They typically report to a service director. They have primary responsibilities for staffing, budgeting, and day-to-day operations of the unit, bed site teaching, complaint investigations & conducting educational programs at unit base. Charge nurse The charge nurse is the nurse, usually assigned for a shift, who is responsible for the immediate functioning of the unit. The charge nurse is responsible for making sure nursing care is delivered safely and that all the patients on the unit are receiving adequate care. He or she is typically the frontline management in most nursing units. Some charge nurses are permanent members of the nursing management team and are called shift supervisors. The term for a female charge nurse was traditionally a nursing sister (or just sister), and this term is still commonly used in some countries (such as the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries).

Widespread on the eastern seaboard, the silver perch is commonly caught by inshore anglers in search of larger species. This fish rarely attains . Silver perch are an underutilized resource as they are excellent table fare and a welcome addition to any Southern fall fish fry.  Description  The American silver perch has a moderately large, obliquely rising terminal mouth. The lower jaw projects further than the upper jaw. The chin does not bear a barbel but has three pairs of mental pores (the arrangement of the barbels and under- chin pores provides a means to distinguish between different members of the family Sciaenidae). The preopercle, the bony plate just in front of the operculum, bears a few spines set at an angle. The dorsal fin has ten to eleven spines and nineteen to twenty-three soft rays. The anal fin has two spines, the second of which is sharp and more than two thirds the length of the first soft ray, and eight to ten soft rays. This fish has a two-chambered swim bladder which is connected to the inner ear. It has good hearing, on a par with the goldfish (Carassius auratus) which is renowned for its auditory ability. Its general color is silvery, greenish, or bluish on the dorsal surface and silvery or yellowish on the underside. The fins are yellowish or greyish. Silver perch are similar in appearance to the sand seatrout, Cynoscion arenarius. Seatrout usually have 1 or 2 prominent canine teeth at the tip of upper jaw and do not have chin pores. Distribution and habitat Silver perch are native to the east coast of the United States. Its range extends from New York to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico. They are found inshore in seagrass beds, tidal creeks and rivers, and marshes. Behavior Spawning takes place in shallow, saline portions of bays and other inshore areas, peaking between May and September. Silver perch mature by second or third year (by 6 inches). Adults eat crustaceans and small fishes. They may live to 6 years. This species is not currently eligible for a state record.

It has a very small population and four businesses. The community is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1900 and 1917, whites committed a total of seven lynchings of blacks, half of the total 14 in Lowndes County from 1877 to 1950.\\"Supplement: Lynchings by County/ Louisiana: Ouachita \\", 2nd edition , from Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror, 2015, Equal Justice Institute, Montgomery, Alabama In 1900 they killed all four members of the Jim Cross family. Location Letohatchee is located just south of Montgomery in Lowndes County. In the 21st century, much of Letohatchee is uninhabited, with large pastures and uncut woods. Its area is estimated at 18 miles across. This was an area of extensive cotton cultivation into the early decades of the 20th century, and Lowndes County was majority black. Whites' efforts to maintain white supremacy raised tensions in the black-majority county. The Democrat-dominated legislature disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution in 1901. Whites also resorted to racial terrorism in the form of lynchings. In 1900 a mob killed a black man accused of killing a white man. When local black resident Jim Cross objected, he was killed, too, at his house; whites then shot and killed his wife, son and daughter. In 1917 William Powell and his brother (recorded as Samuel or Jesse) were both lynched for alleged insolence to a white farmer on the road.\\"EJI Dedicates Marker to Commemorate Lynchings in Letohatchee, Alabama\\" , Equal Justice Initiative, 1 August 2016 No whites were prosecuted in these cases.

After the death of King Constantine, his eldest son George was proclaimed King George II. After the national defeat and the definitive Treaty of Lausanne however, Greece was sorely divided. On 18 October 1923 the decree for calling elections to the Fourth National Assembly of the Greeks was published. The date of the elections was set for 2 December, and on 19 October, military law and censorship were abolished. Two days later, there was what came to be called a \\"counter-revolutionary\\" uprising against the government.

Following the elections, the King was forced to leave the country, with Admiral Pavlos Koundouriotis appointed as a regent. The new parliament convened on 2 January 1924. The office of Prime Minister was held for a short time by G. Kafandaris before Alexandros Papanastasiou was appointed to the post on 24 March. His programmatic statement of legislative proposals was perhaps the most radical document which had up to that time ever been read out in the Hellenic Parliament. Its basic aim was to proclaim a republic. On the next day (25 March), Parliament voted to proclaim a republic, and this was endorsed in a referendum held on 13 April. Following the referendum, Pavlos Koundouriotis was elected president by Parliament.

Three Circuit Courts balked, on the grounds that the Constitution insulated them from such non-judicial duties and preserved their decisions from correction by the political branches. They communicated their objections in remonstrances to the President, who shared them with Congress. In the following Term of the Supreme Court, United States Attorney General Edmund Randolph petitioned for a writ of mandamus commanding the Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania to proceed in accordance with the Act. His original petition was made ex officio, but when the Supreme Court expressed doubts about proceeding in such fashion, he changed his position, averring that he was bringing the petition on behalf of William Hayburn, a pension applicant. At that point, the Supreme Court took the matter under advisement and bound the case over until its next term.Goebel Jr., Julius, 1 History of the Supreme Court of the United States: Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801. MacMillan Publishing Co., 1971. pp. 560–566. While Hayburn's petition was thus pending, Congress intervened with the Act of February 28, 1793, relieving the Circuit Courts of the duty of processing such pension applications. Decision The only decision by the Supreme Court in this case was to continue it. None was ever handed down on the constitutional questions it presented. In his report of the hearing and continuance, Dallas appended a long footnote in which he quoted from the remonstrances. At the time of this case, each Justice of the Supreme Court served also on a Circuit Court. Thus, while the Supreme Court of the United States never ruled on the constitutionality of the Invalid Pensions Act of 1792, five of its six members, Jay, Cushing, Wilson, Blair and Iredell, declared it unconstitutional as members of the United States Circuit Courts for the Districts of New York, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The decision, however, may have been due to the lack of the authority of the appellant, the Attorney General of the United States, Edmund Randolph, to bring the appeal to the Supreme Court. Attorney General Randolph initiated the case at the Supreme Court neither on behalf of the United States or Mr. Hayburn. The Court declined to rule on a lower court decision, possibly because only the Attorney General wanted it to do so.See Marcus & Teir, \\"Hayburn's Case: A Misinterpretation of Precedent,\\" 1988 Wis.

It is an erect shrub with aromatic branches covered with short hairs and glands, egg-shaped to more or less round leaves and purple to mauve or pinkish flowers on the ends of branchlets. Description Prostanthera rotundifolia is an erect, compact to spreading shrub that typically grows to high and wide with aromatic branches that are covered with short hairs and sessile glands. The leaves are egg-shaped to more or less round, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils near the ends of branchlets with bracteoles but that fall off as the flower develops. The sepals are long forming a tube long with two lobes, the upper lobe long. The petals are purple to pinkish and long forming a cup- shaped tube. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Prostanthera rotundifolia was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his treatise Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet rotundifolia means \\"rounded leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Round-leaved mintbush is widespread and locally common in woodland, forest and rainforest margins, often in rocky places in the eastern half of New South Wales and the southern half of Victoria. It also occurs in northern and eastern Tasmania but where it is less common and is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. Use in horticulture In cultivation the species and the cultivar ‘Rosea’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It uses the Emmaus zip code of 18049. History Early jasper mines The area near Vera Cruz was originally inhabited by the Lenape. Historically, Vera Cruz was the location of one of the earliest jasper mines on the continent. The jasper mines date to 8000 BC. At the height of the Delaware Indians jasper mining activities, more than 100 small jasper pits were operated in the area of Vera Cruz, primarily in what is now Jasper Park. The quarries were eventually abandoned in the 1680s. The purpose of these Jasper mines was to support tool production for the Lenape in the area, including arrowheads and other small tools needed for hunting and battle. The Jasper from Jasper Park has been found as far away as New England, supporting claims that the area played a key role in supporting Jasper production and trade. The Jasper Park jasper pits are part of a key 35-mile long stretch of 9 pits in the area, which stretch from the Delaware River to Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. These pits are evidence of some of the oldest-known mining operations in the New World. Today, the Jasper Pits in Jasper Park are a local attraction, which support small hiking and biking trails, which allow visitors to find examples of jasper in the pits. Removal of jasper from Jasper park is a crime. The naming of Vera Cruz Prior to 1851, Vera Cruz was an unnamed village at a prominent crossroad, located in what was then Milford Township, Pennsylvania. While a group of regular loungers were sitting at what was previously Alexander Weaver's store, their eyes turned to a newspaper with the title of \\"Revolt in Vera Cruz (Mexico): 12 Killed, 20 Injured,\\" which led to their conversation turning to the topic of Mexico. After a sound of angry voices outside, the loungers rushed outside to see the commotion and saw two citizens engaging in a fight. Alexander Weaver jokingly remarked, \\"Now we have a name for our village. Why not call it Vera Cruz?\\" Ever since that incident, the name Vera Cruz has remained. Public education Vera Cruz is part of the East Penn School District. Students in grades nine through 12 attend Emmaus High School. Students in grades six through eight attend either Eyer Middle School or Lower Macungie Middle School.

As an advocate of the First Amendment, Abrams' career has put him in a class of prominent legal scholars who have shaped American understanding of fundamental rights found in the United States Constitution. That work is documented here. In his 2005 book Speaking Freely, he outlines his knowledge of and perspective on the cases below. In this memoir, Abrams states this collection of cases showcases the work people have put into free speech in the United States. In his review of the book, Lee Levine wrote \\"that the modern history of the freedom of the press in this country is intimately associated with the career and work of Floyd Abrams.\\" His career matured in the late 1960s, right after the Supreme Court decided New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). He has worked on the Pentagon Papers case and Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), to Landmark Communications v. Virginia (1978) and Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co. (1979), to Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart (1976). He has defended numerous clients, including the Brooklyn Museum of Art from Rudolph Giuliani over the Sensation exhibition, NBC from Wayne Newton, and Al Franken from a trademark lawsuit from Fox News Channel over the use of the phrase \\"Fair and Balanced\\" in the title of his book. Lee Levine. Speaking Freely: Trials of the First Amendment , via FirstAmendmentCenter.org New York Times Co. v. United States Landmark Communications v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978) In his memoir Speaking Freely, Abrams states this was the first case he argued by himself before the Supreme Court. He states that he devoted most of their preparation for the case with three overlapping issues, \\"ones that have consumed my attention in every later Supreme Court argument as well.\\" First was jurisprudential: What rule of law would they urge the Court to adopt? What would be its effect as stare decisis and its impact on the First Amendment? The Second Question was tactical: Justices are known for taking up the 30 minutes of allotted argument time with question-and-answer sessions; Abrams felt he needed to figure out his core message. What did he want to get across in as little time as possible? The Third Question was what the court might ask that would be exceptionally difficult to respond to, and what should those responses be? Background and procedural history Abrams represented Landmark Communications, which owned the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot. Landmark would be the first case Abrams argued before the Supreme Court by himself. The Pilot had reported on October 4, 1975, that Judge H. Warrington Sharp, who sat on the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, was under investigation by a judicial fitness panel. It was deciding whether or not to begin disciplinary proceedings against Sharp. Under Virginia statute, each complaint against a judge was to be reviewed in secret; it would be announced only if deemed serious enough to require a public hearing. All states had confidentiality requirements to avoid use of the disciplinary inquiry as retribution against a judge; however, only Virginia and Hawaii provided for criminal penalties for disclosure. There was a quick trial and conviction of the publisher of a misdemeanor and $500 fine. Landmark appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which affirmed the conviction by 6–1. The court concluded that the \\"requirement of confidentiality in Commission proceedings\\" served three purposes: 1. protection of the judges' reputation; 2. protection of public confidence in the judicial system; and 3. protection of complainants and witnesses from possible recriminations. Arguments Abrams wrote that his primary argument was straightforward: The newspaper published a true account, had not obtained the information illegally, and the alleged offense was simply reporting a complaint about how a public official performed his civic role. In his brief, Abrams argued that the case raised \\"anew a question which penetrates to the core of our concept of self-government: whether the press may be punished for printing the truth about a public official with his public duties. Assistant Attorney General James Kulp defended the Virginia Supreme Court opinion with the above-mentioned three reasons for the statute. Justice Byron White questioned Kulp about whether the case was really about not criticizing public officials, a Constitutional right, and asked whether he would defend a statute calling for confidentiality for protection of the judge. \\"No, sir\\", responded Kulp. \\"I think the cases from this Court have been clear in that respect, that, in other words, a judge, as any public official, may certainly be criticized, the administration of justice may be criticized, and we don't have any argument about that.\\" White said if that was so, then his arguments about protection the judiciary and the system held no weight. Kulp agreed. Virginia's time before the Court dealt with the scope of the statute. Chief Justice Warren Burger asked Kulp whether if a lawyer held at a press conference handed a copy of a complaint he filed with the commission to the press, that it would violate the statute; but if he made the statement public but did not file the charges, then First Amendment protection would be granted? Kulp reluctantly agreed. Abrams declined his rebuttal time, confident in Landmark's victory. *\\"During one exchange, Justice William H. Rehnquist asked a question for which Mr. Abrams said he was \\"totally unprepared\\", but Justice Potter Stewart came to his rescue. Of all the justices, Mr. Abrams found Justice Byron R. White the most unnerving. White \\"invariably asked questions that were both pointed and powerful\\", he recalls, and Mr. Abrams never once \\"had the sense that anything I said pleased him.\\" He confides that during oral argument he often felt like a mouse with \\"a tormenting cat.\\" Nonetheless, he won a unanimous victory.\\" Geoffrey Stone, Supreme Court Tales From the Pleading Side of the Bench, The New York Times, April 16, 2006, via Law.Chicago.edu. *\\"It had been quite an introduction for me to arguing for a complete thirty minutes in the Supreme Court: fifty-four judicial questions and comments. Years later, when I saw Albert Brooks play a television journalist in Broadcast News who perspired so much when on the air that his shirt looked like he had just returned from a swim, I wondered if I had presented the same appearance after my Landmark argument.\\" Holdings and Influence The Court held unanimously in favor of Landmark. Chief Justice Burger wrote the opinion for himself and the other five members (Justices Brennan and Stevens recused themselves). The Court did not adopt Abrams's categorical approach (all truth reporting in reference to public duties was insulated from criminal sanctions by the First Amendment). However, the Court rejected the argument that these interests were sufficient grounds for criminal sanctions on nonparticipants in proceedings. Virginia Coalition for Open Government, Landmark Communications Inc. v. Commonwealth , via Opengoveva.org. In its conclusion, the Court wrote: \\"the [clear and present danger] test requires a court to make its own inquiry into the imminence and magnitude of the danger said to flow from the particular utterance and then to balance the character of the evil as well as its likelihood against the need for free and unfettered expression.\\" *\\"Perhaps most satisfying to me, the Court not only questioned the relevance of the clear-and-present danger test to Landmark's claims...but noted, in language frequently quoted by the Supreme court thereafter, that it was insufficient for the Virginia Supreme Court simply to defer to the legislative judgment that there was some sort of clear and present danger.\\" Floyd Abrams. Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart Five years to the day after New York Times Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court struck down a series of publication restraints that limited the right of the press to publish information about criminal defendants in current cases, such as a confession. Abrams wrote about the topic in his senior thesis at Cornell University. From his opening argument before the Supreme Court: > For what we would ask of you is nothing less than a renunciation of power, > the conclusion by this Court that the Judiciary should not and indeed may > not tell the press in advance what news it may print, save only in that rare > national security situation, in that rare national security case adverted to > by this Court in Near v. Minnesota, and in the Pentagon Papers case. Only three members of the Court (Brennan, Stewart, and Marshall) wanted what Abrams wanted: a bright-line rule banning prior restraint in all cases that involved claims that publication would interfere with the right to a fair trial for the defendant. White and Stevens indicated that they might go that far in the future and joined Chief Justice Burger's opinion, that left open that possibility. Wayne Newton v. NBC Background The FBI was investigating Connecticut mobster Frank Piccolo, a caporegime in the Gambino mafia family, who ran loan-sharking and gambling rackets. Piccolo reported weekly in person to Carlo Gambino himself in New York City. The FBI obtained a warrant to monitor and record Piccolo's conversations for sixty days from May 13 to July 12, 1980. Among those conversations were several with Guido Penosi, a drug dealer who worked with both the Gambino and Lucchese families. Conversations between the two referenced Wayne Newton. By 1965, Newton had become a nationally-recognized entertainer. In the early 1970s he reportedly made sums that exceeded $300,000 a week for his shows. People Magazine' called him \\"the most successful performer in Vegas history\\" and Newsweek said he was \\"the undisputed king of Las Vegas.\\" Newton knew Guido Penosi since the 1960s when he performed at the Copacabana Club in New York. Penosi warned people at the club to \\"stay away from the kid\\" because he's \\"mine.\\" Newton and Penosi became close friends, with Newton flying his band to Los Angeles to perform for Penosi's son, without pay. As a felon, the law required Penosi to register with the Las Vegas police if he visited Las Vegas; however, Newton called the police as a favor so Penosi did not need to register. Newton turned to Penosi for help in 1980. Newton pulled his money out of a Las Vegas tabloid named Backstage, and co-investors demanded Newton pay them money they felt he owed them. A fight broke out between Newton and the two men, and they contacted an organized crime figure to harass Newton and Newton's daughter. The Las Vegas police were unable to stop the threats, so Newton turned to his friend Penosi. Penosi had Newton call his cousin, Piccolo. At a Genovese family \\"sitdown\\" in the Bronx, it was agreed the threats would stop. They did. Around the same time Newton's business advisor and friend, Mark Moreno, also began receiving threats. Newton sent Moreno to Penosi, who sent him to Piccolo. He was told a sitdown was needed. Moreno himself said he thought that meant he would be \\"the center of discussion in a room filled with a lot of mob people.\\" It was agreed Penosi would personally pay $3,500 to end the threats, which they did. Piccolo then wanted to earn money off the Newton and Moreno favors. He pressured Moreno to buy life insurance for Lola Falana, a Las Vegas entertainer managed by Moreno. Moreno told Newton about the insurance scheme and how he was pressured as a \\"quid pro quo, as a favor\\" for the help Piccolo had given him and Newton. The Case NBC broadcast a report in October 1980 entitled \\"Wayne Newton and the Law\\" about Newton's purchase of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino, asserting that Penosi and Piccolo had financed the deal in exchange for a hidden share in the hotel. On April 10, 1981, Newton filed a libel claim against NBC. Said Abrams, \\"Discovery in the case—pretrial depositions, motions, and the like—was brutal.\\" Newton hired lawyer Morton Galane. According to Abrams, as opposing counsel Galane made \\"each aspect of the proceedings a trial of its own. I have never taken part in a case in which I disliked opposing counsel more or thought he had misbehaved more often.\\" There was no amicable relationship between counsel in this case. Galane reportedly screamed at even the most inconsequential of witnesses, and he charged Abrams with \\"signaling\\" Ross, one of the principal defendants. Ira Silverman abruptly stalked out of the court in the middle of testimony because of Galane's tactics. When Penosi arrived for his deposition, he was open-shirted, with gold chains and dressed \\"like someone involved in organized crime\\", wrote Abrams. Abrams lost in what was then the largest jury verdict against the press in American history. Newton received $7.9 million for loss of past income and $1,146,750 for loss of future income; $5 million for damages to his reputation; and $225,000 for pain and anguish. The jury also found the journalists Ross and Silverman \\"harbored ill will or hatred toward [Newton] and intended to injure him\\" and therefore awarded an extra $5 million in punitive damages. The total was $19,271,750 from the jury, with prejudgment interest of $3,485,523, for a total of $22,757,273.80 entered as judgment by the jury. \\"Judge Crocker was stunned by the amount\\", wrote Abrams. Crocker later reduced the award to $5.2 million. Abrams argued an appeal in front of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on April 13, 1990, which overturned the award in August 1990. The court found \\"almost no evidence of actual malice [in NBC's reporting on Newton], much less clear and convincing proof.\\" The Heroin Trail In the Heroin Trail case, Abrams represented New York Newsday. The Long Island paper had researched and printed a series of thirty-two articles entitled The Heroin Trail. It was an ambitious project: the publisher and senior editors wanted to follow Heroin trafficking from \\"the poppy fields of Turkey to the veins of Long Island kids.\\" The series won Newsday a Pulitzer Prize Gold Medal for public service. In an exhaustive account published February and March 1973, over three hundred people in Turkey, the United States and Europe were described as heroin traffickers. One man in particular—Mahmut Karaduman, a nightclub owner in Istanbul—was described as specializing in smuggling via a route through the Black Sea, dividing his time between villas in Switzerland and Lebanon. Of all the people listed, only one person ever filed a lawsuit: Karaduman. The case languished in the New York courts for years. New York vigorously enforces a law that libel actions must be filed within a year of publication of the story leading to the suit. Karaduman filed too late; he had only learned of the articles in the spring of 1974. In 1980 it was resurrected by the New York State Court of Appeals. The court held that since the New American Library had republished the article in a book that fell within the 1 year bright-line rule of when the original action was brought, the claim could proceed. But it moved \\"glacially\\" until the trial finally began in June and July 1986. The trial lasted through twenty-four days of testimony, with eleven days translated from Turkish. Newsday had not yet called a single witness when two jurors caused a mistrial when they told Justice Kenneth Shorter they could not continue to serve. \\"It was the stuff of Dickens: A colossal amount of time and money had been wasted with no result other than an order to begin all over again\\", wrote Abrams. The aborted trial's transcript helped Abrams learn opposing counsel's strategy, and to master his own. Newsday had taken pains to ensure their journalists were accurate. Every name on their list of traffickers had been verified with top narcotics agents, including high-ranking Turkish officials. They had notes on everything and all of the reporters came across as competent at trial. According to Abrams, Newsday had two major problems: 1) the journalists were dependent on their sources (nobody had seen a drug deal take place), which amounts to hearsay; and 2) the journalist's credibility was cast in doubt by some contradictory witness testimony. In the 1986 trial, Karaduman questioned whether the journalists had told the truth. He produced several important Turkish witnesses who would not corroborate their statements to the reporters; indeed, some denied ever meeting them. If this testimony were repeated, it would throw the credibility of the three American journalists into question who the jury believed would be central to winning the case. Helen Whitney v. Victor Lasky Helen Whitney was a prize-winning American Broadcasting Company producer and writer who in 1982 devoted half of a one-hour program (American Inquisition) to the impact McCarthyism had on Fairmont, a small West Virginia town. She focused on Luella Mundel, who chaired the art department at Fairmont State College. The narrator said in 1951 Mundel \\"was not a political activist, but had tastes, convictions about art, about religion, unfamiliar to these streets. And at a local American Legion seminar about subversives, she angrily stood to challenge what was being preached there. Her contract was dropped by the college. A state education official accused her of being a poor security risk. She then sued for slander, but in the trial that followed in Fairmont's courtroom, it was Luella Mundel and her right to speak freely, to be different, that wound up being tried.\\" \\"In presenting the case of Luella Mundel, an art teacher at Fairmont College in Fairmont, West Virginia. ABC gave the impression that Victor Lasky had been one of the accusers who had caused her to lose her job. Laskv [sic] was lured into giving ABC News an interview on the pretext that it wanted to talk to him about fighting communism in the 1950s and about the Americanism lectures that he gave for the American Legion. It also wanted to talk about the little people who were caught up in the controversy, such as Luella Mundel, who had been the subject of an article published in Harper's magazine.\\" Accuracy in the Media, June 1983.Accuracy in the Media, ABC News Run Amok, July 8, 1983. According to Accuracy in the Media, Lasky only had a \\"brief encounter\\" when he was one of several speakers at the seminar. Mundel criticized the speakers, of which Lasky was one. Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences v. City of New York In 1999, the Brooklyn Museum of Art (also known as Institute of Arts and Sciences) planned to host the Charles Saatchi exhibition Sensation, which featured controversial art works by the Young British Artists. The museum was an independent organization which leased property from New York City, and received $7.2m a year in operational fundinghttps://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/30/nyregion/brooklyn-museum-accused-of- trying-to-spur-art-value.html from the city, as well as other grants. Mayor Rudy Giuliani objected to the exhibition on grounds of decency and taste, and withdrew the public funding from the museum and moved to break the lease on the ground that the museum wasn't following its mandate. Abrams argued on First Amendment principles that, having funded the museum, it must continue to do so without interfering in its freedom of speech in selecting what to exhibit.http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Aesthetics_Fall_2009/Levine_Sensation_Brooklyn_Museum_Controversy.pdfhttp://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/200flspub6595.pdf Judge Nina Gershon ruled in favor of the museum,Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences v.

Campaign Finance Reform Many liberals were upset at Abrams when he and Kenneth Starr successfully challenged the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance- reform as a violation of the First Amendment.Barbara Ferry, Famed attorney calls for shield laws, The New Mexican, May 15, 2005, via FreeNewMexican.com The Washington Post issued the following criticism: : \\"Unfortunately, Abrams is far more fair-minded where the argument against a free-speech claim is weak than he is where it's compelling. In the one case that he describes in depth in which the policy interest opposite the free-speech claim was strong enough to prevail – the campaign-finance case – Abrams does not do justice to the other side's arguments.... nowhere does he simply and candidly lay out the case for the other side: the explosive growth of \\"soft money\\" throughout the last two decades, the ads it funded and the way it eviscerated Congress's early 1970s campaign-finance law. Nor does he describe the voluminous record that his courtroom foes amassed in support of the statute. Indeed, based on his description, the naive reader would have a good deal of trouble understanding exactly what McCain-Feingold required, let alone how any court could have imagined upholding it.\\" The Washington Post's Book World. Washington Post's Book World review, quoted on Amazon.com Financial Crisis In September 2009, Floyd Abrams lost a case where he defended Standard & Poor's from allegations of fraud in their ratings of sub-prime mortgages. The argument used was that regardless of the financial basis for their ratings, the ratings qualified as \\"free speech\\" under the First Amendment. U.S. Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that the first amendment did not allow the companies to freely commit fraud because their ratings provided to private investors were not \\"matters of public concern.\\" References Main reference: Abrams ","title":"List of cases argued by Floyd Abrams"},{"id":"6879397","text":"Munchies is an American animated music television series that was previously aired on Fuse.

Along with Sega's Fantasy Zone, released a year later, TwinBee is credited as an early archetype of the \\"cute 'em up\\" type in its genre. It was the first game to run on Konami's Bubble System hardware. TwinBee was ported to the Family Computer and MSX in 1986 and has been included in numerous compilations released in later years. The original arcade game was released outside Japan for the first time in the Nintendo DS compilation Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits. A mobile phone version was released for i-mode Japan phones in 2003 with edited graphics. Various TwinBee sequels were released for the arcade and home console markets following the original game, some which spawned audio drama and anime adaptations in Japan. Gameplay TwinBee can be played by up to 2-players simultaneously. The player takes control of a cartoon-like anthropomorphic spacecraft, with Player 1 taking control of TwinBee, the titular ship, while Player 2 controls WinBee. The game control consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons: one for shooting enemies in the air and the other for dropping bombs to ground enemies (similarly to Xevious). The player's primary power-ups are bells that can be uncovered by shooting at the floating clouds where they're hidden. If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined together. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies. As with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms. If the player's ship loses both arms, it will lose the ability to throw bombs and the player must wait for an ambulance to arrive. The player must navigate their ship to the ambulance to repair their arms. However, if the player's ship loses both arms for the second time, no ambulance will arrive. If two players are playing at the same time, they can align their ships vertically or horizontally together to perform more powerful attacks. Home versions TwinBee originally appeared as an arcade game. It was later ported to MSX and the Family Computer. The Famicom version was re-released only in Japan under the Famicom Mini label for the Game Boy Advance. This game was officially released for the first time outside Japan as part of the Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the Nintendo DS in March 2007, under the name RainbowBell in North America, although the TwinBee name was restored for the European release. TwinBee was released in Japan on August 10, 2011 and in other regions on September 22, 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS as a part of the 3D Classics series. This release was featured amongst other games from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES to be released for the 3DS on a tech demo called Classic Games at E3 2010.WebCite query resultE3 2010: Classic NES in 3D! - Nintendo 3DS Feature at IGN The arcade version of TwinBee was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on December 1, 2010. Also, the MSX version was re-released for Windows' EGG Project on August 19, 2014 and for the PlayStation 4, published by Hamster Corporation in Japan.

They are descended from the Randolphs of Morton Morrell, Warwickshire, England. The first Randolph to come to America was Henry Randolph in 1643. His nephew, William Randolph, later came to Virginia as an orphan in 1669. He made his home at Turkey Island along the James River. Because of their numerous progeny, William Randolph and his wife, Mary Isham Randolph, have been referred to as \\"the Adam and Eve of Virginia.\\" The Randolph family was the wealthiest and most powerful family in 18th-century Virginia. History Colonial Virginia Map showing Bermuda Hundred and other early settlements along the James River Henry Randolph I, born in 1623 in Little Houghton, Northamptonshire, England, immigrated to the colony of Virginia in 1642, protege of Sir William Berkeley. He acquired title to land on the north side of Swift Creek in Bermuda Hundred in 1655 and he built Swift Creek Mill, considered one of the first grist mills in the United States, about 1663. The mill was located alongside Randolph's plantation. Henry married Judith, the daughter of speaker of the House of Burgesses Henry Soane, with whom they had a son, Captain Henry Randolph. Henry Randolph I was the uncle of William Randolph of Turkey Island in Colonial Virginia, whom Henry sponsored to emigrate to Colonial Virginia following a visit to England and Ireland in 1669 or 1670. He was also the half brother of Thomas Randolph, the poet of England. Henry died in Henrico County, Virginia in 1673. William Randolph, nephew of Henry Randolph I, resided in Colonial Virginia by 1672. William was a transatlantic merchant and ran a tobacco plantation. He represented Henrico County, Virginia at the Virginia House of Burgesses and later was Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses. He was a founding trustee of the College of William and Mary. Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe and William Randolph II, sons of William Randolph, were Virginia Burgesses for Henrico County in 1720 and 1722. Sir John Randolph, son of William Randolph, was a Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and later Deputy Attorney General for Charles City, Prince George, and Henrico Counties. Revolutionary War era Peyton Randolph (1721–1775), 1st and 3rd President of the Continental Congress. Peyton Randolph, son of Sir John Randolph, was a speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses, chairman of the Virginia Conventions, and the first President of the Continental Congress. Beverley Randolph, grandson of William Randolph, was a Virginia Delegate for Henrico County from 1777 to 1780 and the 8th Governor of Virginia, the first after the US Constitution was ratified. Edmund Randolph, grandson of Sir John Randolph, was an aid-de-camp to George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. He was afterward seventh Governor of Virginia, the second Secretary of State, and the first United States Attorney General. Thomas Jefferson, great-grandson of William Randolph, was a Virginia Burgess for Albemarle County and the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. At the beginning of the American Revolution he was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Virginia, also serving as a wartime Governor of Virginia. Just after the war ended, from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat to Paris and became the United States Minister to France. He was the first United States Secretary of State (1790–1793) serving under President George Washington. He was the 2nd Vice President, under John Adams, and 3rd President of the United States, during which he oversaw the Louisiana Purchase, leading the United States to double in size during his presidency. In later years he founded the University of Virginia. John Marshall (1755–1835), 4th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. John Marshall, great-grandson of Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe, was the 4th Chief Justice of the United States. His court opinions helped lay the basis for United States constitutional law and made the Supreme Court of the United States a coequal branch of government along with the legislative and executive branches. Previously, he had been a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia and served as a US Representative. He was Secretary of State under President John Adams from 1800 to 1801. \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee, 2x great-grandson of William Randolph was an early American patriot who served as the ninth Governor of Virginia and as the Virginia Representative to the United States Congress. During the American Revolution, Lee served as a cavalry officer in the Continental Army.In the military parlance of the time, the term \\"Light-horse\\" had a hyphen between the two words \\"light\\" and \\"horse\\". See the title page of \\"The Discipline of the Light-Horse\\" by Captain Robert Hinde of the Royal Regiment of Foresters (Light-Dragoons) published in London in 1778. Antebellum era Thomas Mann Randolph Jr., 2x great-grandson of William Randolph, was a member of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, a Representative in the U.S. Congress, and as the 21st Governor of Virginia, from 1819 to 1822. Civil War era Robert E. Lee, 3x great grandson of William Randolph, was an American career military officer best known for having commanded the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War. In postbellum years he was president of Washington College (later Washington and Lee University). George W. Randolph, 3x great grandson of William Randolph, was a general officer in the American Civil War and a Confederate States Secretary of War. He was most well known for his strengthening the Confederacy's western and southern defenses, but came into conflict with Confederate President Jefferson Davis over this.Goldberg, David E. \\"George Wythe Randolph (1818–1867).\\", Encyclopedia Virginia, Ed. Brendan Wolfe. 6 Apr. 2011. Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, accessed 6 April 2011 Junius Daniel, 4x great grandson of William Randolph, was a planter and career military officer, serving in the United States Army, then in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, as a brigadier general. His troops were instrumental in the Confederates' success at the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. He was killed in action at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Modern era Armistead C. Gordon, 5x great grandson of William Randolph was a Virginia lawyer and a prolific writer of prose and poetry. Robert Williams Daniel, 2x great grandson of Edmund Randolph was a bank executive who served in the Virginia Senate from 1936 to 1940. He is best known for having survived the sinking of the ocean liner RMS Titanic in 1912. His account of the disaster was published in multiple newspapers. Robert Williams Daniel, Jr., 3x great grandson of Edmund Randolph was a Virginia farmer, businessman, teacher, and politician who served five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. While in Congress, Daniel was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and various subcommittees. He later served as deputy assistant to Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, from 1984 to 1986, and director of intelligence for the Department of Energy from 1990 to 1993. He was a recipient of the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal. Plantations The family's wealth was based on four large plantations on the James River, acquired by William Randolph: Turkey Island (which he began assembling after his arrival around 1668), Curles (purchased from the colonial government), Tuckahoe and Dungeness (the result of two large land grants around 1700). Turkey Island was given its name by the first explorers of the James River, who noted that it contained a large population of wild turkeys. The term can refer to the surrounding area as well as the island. William Randolph's residence overlooked Turkey Island, and he is buried near the site of the house.Sankey, Margaret D. \\"Randolph, William (1650–1711), colonist in America\\" Curles Neck Plantation is west of Turkey Island. It was owned by Nathaniel Bacon, who rebelled against the governor in 1676. The property was forfeited to the colonial government and William Randolph purchased it. Tuckahoe is the American English name of an edible plant, borrowed from an Algonquian Native American language. It is also the name of several streams and places in eastern Virginia, including Tuckahoe Plantation, established by William Randolph's son, Thomas. \\"Tuckahoe\\" later became a pejorative nickname for eastern Virginians, used mainly by western Virginians. Dungeness is the headland of a shingle beach in Kent, England, which must be rounded to approach the Thames Estuary. The founder of Dungeness Plantation, Isham Randolph, spent several years of his adult life as a ship's captain, and therefore was familiar with the feature. The name may have been chosen to evoke the drama of a turning point in a long voyage. The similar headland at the western tip of Cornwall, Land's End, has inspired the names of several enterprises, including two plantations. Bremo was the name for a tract between Turkey Island and Curles plantations The name comes from a Germanic word meaning \\"edge\\", in this case the edge of a river. The root also occurs in the English word \\"brim\\". The extant Bremo Plantation was established in the early 19th century in Fluvanna County, far to the west. These plantations are shown on the 1751 Fry-Jefferson map. Historic homes Historic homes associated with the family include Tuckahoe in Goochland and Henrico counties, the Peyton Randolph House in Williamsburg, the Wilton House Museum and the John Marshall House in Richmond, Monticello near Charlottesville, Stratford Hall in Westmoreland, Brandon Plantation in Prince George and Burgh Westra in Gloucester, Virginia . Freed slaves Randolphs who freed slaves and fought Virginia's growing dependence on the \\"peculiar institution\\" in the early Republic are less known, but include Ryland Randolph of Turkey Island and Ann Cary Randolph Morris, who later married founding father (and anti-slavery advocate) Gouverneur Morris of New Yorkhttp://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/slc/ID/1374/o/blank Jacob Randolph of Isle of Wight County, Virginia, freed 13 slaves in 1783. John Randolph of Roanoke freed nearly 400 slaves in his will, probated in 1833 and upheld more than a decade later.F.N. Watkins, \\"The Randolph Emancipated Slaves,\\" DeBow's Review, XXIV, 285–290 Richard Randolph (? - 1859) of Greene County, Ohio, in his will probated in 1859, left his entire estate valued at $80,000 to be used to free slaves of the Randolph family and to be expended for their use and benefit. By 1895, $6,646.27 of Richard Randolph's estate remained unclaimed. In response, the Ohio General Assembly passed an act in 1898 that directed the entire $6,646.27 to be transferred to the endowment of Wilberforce University. Other connections Members of the Randolph family also intermarried with other prominent Virginia families, including the Blands, Byrds, Carters, Beverleys, Fitzhughs, and Harrisons. Pocahontas was indirectly an ancestress to members of the Randolph family through marriages of Robert Bolling's two granddaughters, Lucille and Jane Bolling. Some evidence suggests that famous American frontiersman, politician and hero Davy Crockett was of Randolph descent. Actor Lee Marvin and actress and producer Kimberley Kates are also Randolph descendants, in her case through her paternal grandmother. World War I fighter ace Hamilton Coolidge was a direct descendant of the marriage of a Randolph to the daughter of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. In 1926, Jessie Harlan Lincoln, the granddaughter of Abraham Lincoln married her third husband, Robert John Randolph of this Randolph family. Her later two marriages did not produce any more children. Today, many Randolph descendants continue the family's political tradition in the United States.

Biography He was born in Częstochowa, Poland in 1881, the eldest son of Sigmund and Dora Pasternack. He had two younger brothers, Samuel and David. His father and grandfather had been bandmasters in Poland and he began the study of the violin at age four, under his father's tutelage. At age ten he entered the Warsaw Conservatory of Music, where he initially studied piano and composition. He also took up the study of a new instrument each month, so that by the time he left the Conservatory he could play every instrument in the orchestra except the harp.New York Times obituary April 30, 1940 At age 15 he came to the United States with his two brothers and father. Initially he worked in a hotel restaurant as a busboy. One day when the violin player for the hotel band did not come to work, he informed the bandleader that he was capable of filling in. He ran home and got his violin and returned to play. The regular violinist was not allowed to return. He was able to convince the bandleader to permit his brothers to try out, and so they began their musical careers in America. Shortly thereafter, he toured the country as a concert pianist. In 1902, he was hired as viola player with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York and then became first viola player, continuing until 1909. His ability came to the attention of the famed Arturo Toscanini, who had become principal conductor at the Met in 1908, and Pasternack was made assistant conductor in 1909, a position he filled for one year. In 1911 he returned to Europe as conductor of the Bremen Opera, but the Metropolitan asked for his release and he returned to the Met as a conductor for 1911-13. During the period 1913-26, he was conductor of the Century Opera Company in New York, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra,New York Times obituary April 30, 1940 and the Philadelphia Philharmonic Society. While at the Philadelphia Philharmonic, he introduced Marian Anderson as the first African- American singer to perform there. In 1916 he became music director of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) alongside Rosario Bourdon, where likewise he (Pasternack) introduced Marian Anderson; and the Stanley Company of America, owned by Warner Brothers. In his role at Victor and with several orchestras he made recordings and conducted programs for many famous singers and instrumentalists of the day, including Enrico Caruso, Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz. From 1928 until his death in 1940 he conducted orchestras for NBC Radio, including a program with Nelson Eddy and The Carnation Contented Hour. He composed songs and music for motion pictures and radio, and wrote the lyrics for \\"Taps\\". He was married in 1904 to Helen Feirman, and had two daughters, Florence and Cecile.

It is the fifth game in the TwinBee series and the second released for the arcades following the original TwinBee (the previous sequels were released directly to home consoles). Detana!! TwinBee marked the debut of Japanese animator Shujiro Hamakawa (credited under the pen name Shuzilow.HA) as the series' primary character designer for subsequent installments. Detana!! TwinBee was awarded \\"Best Shooting Game of 1991\\" by the Japanese arcade game magazine Gamest. A direct follow-up, Pop'n TwinBee, was released for the Super NES in 1993. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Aside from the improved graphics and sounds compared to previous TwinBee installments, the gameplay in Detana follows the same conventions established in the arcade version of the original. As usual, the game can be played by up to two players, with player 1 piloting TwinBee, while player 2 pilots WinBee. Controls consist of an eight- way joystick for moving the ship and two buttons. In the Japanese version, one button is used to fire the gun at airborne enemies while the other is used to drop bombs to the ground. In the international arcade release (Bell & Whistles), both buttons are used to do shoot and drop bombs at the same time. This time, holding down the shooting button will cause a power-meter at the bottom of the screen to fill up, allowing the player to fire a \\"Big Shot\\" attack when releasing the button. The power-ups consist of bells which can be uncovered by shooting the floating clouds, as well as items uncovered by destroying land enemies. Like in the original TwinBee, the player can shoot the floating bells to change their colors. In addition to the five different colors in the original TwinBee (yellow, white, blue, green, and red), there are two new additional bells as well: a purple bell that provides a \\"tail shield\\" that activates multiple barriers around the player's ship and black bell which decreases the player's speed. The mini-bell and the lucky star from the original TwinBee return as well. GwinBee, a ship similar to TwinBee and WinBee, also appears in the game, allowing the player to combine its ship with GwinBee to fire wider fire beams. Two players can also align their ships side by side to achieve the same effect or align their ships vertically for a powerful five-way spread. If both players align their ships with GwinBee between them, he will spring out and destroy all on-screen enemies. The game consists of seven stages; once completed, the player can replay it for a harder second round. The game will be entirely over if the final stage is cleared again; but after running out of lives, the player can continue and receive a \\"free\\" power-up. Plot Detana!! Twinbee arcade PCB Set several years after the events of the original TwinBee, TwinBee and WinBee are relaxing at their island when they receive an SOS signal from the distant planet of Meru. The signal contains a message sent by Princess Melora, who pleads for the salvation of her planet from the invading forces of the evil alien Iva. TwinBee and his friends decide to set off to outer space to defeat the forces of Iva and save Planet Meru. Detana!! marks the first appearance of TwinBee's and WinBee's respective pilots, Light and Pastel, who became prominent characters in many subsequent TwinBee video games and related media, although they were originally unnamed in this game (the characters were given their names in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise).  Release  In Japan, Detana!! TwinBee was ported to the X68000 computer in 1991 and to the PC Engine in 1992, as well as for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in the compilation Detana TwinBee Yahoo! Deluxe Pack and for the PlayStation Portable in TwinBee Portable. The PC Engine port of the game was released for the Wii Virtual Console in North America and Europe in 2009 as a \\"Hanabi Festival\\" release. The game was released for the PlayStation Network in Japan on June 16, 2010. On November 24, 2010, the game was released on Xbox 360; it was included on the \\"Game Pack 012\\" of Game Room gaming service. The game was released for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch eShop on January 16, 2020 as part for the Arcade Archives.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Detana!! TwinBee on their March 15, 1991 issue as being the third most- successful table arcade unit of the year. References  External links  * Detana!! TwinBee at GameFAQs * Detana!!

According to Cicero, it was an old law introduced by the tribunes that forbade the dedication of a temple, and for religious purposes, or of an altar without permission of the Popular Assembly. By the late 3rd century BC, the legal procedure for dedicating a temple apparently required introduction in the Roman Senate, reference of the petition to the College of Pontiffs, and then proposal to the Popular Assembly for final approval. By the mid-2nd century, the Lex Papiria probably was used as precedent to decide what approval was necessary to dedicate a statue. What is unclear is whether the Lex Papiria governed dedications generally or only by imperatores and other magistrates of at least praetorian rank. It is also unclear whether the Lex expressly forbade dedications by magistrates of lower rank such as the tribunes and the aediles. Much of what we know about the law is due to its importance in Cicero's action for deconsecration in 57 BC before the College of Pontiffs. Cicero's opponent Clodius had dedicated Cicero's house in Rome as a shrine to Libertas, and Cicero sought relief on the grounds that Clodius' dedication had violated the Lex Papiria. Clodius' defense apparently was that the Lex Clodia de exsilio Ciceronis contained a sufficient authorization for the dedication.

He was known as Mr Natural Rubber. He was also involved in the development of the nation's palm oil industry. Sekhar was of ethnic Indian origin. Personal history Sekhar was born on 17 November 1929 at the Ulu Bulu Estate (now Malayan Glass). His place of birth is located near the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia's (RRIM) 3,400 acre experimental station at Sungai Buloh, which he developed during his tenure into one of the most comprehensively equipped research centres. He started as a chemist at RRIM in 1949 and led research, particularly in physiochemical changes in natural rubber. He turned the institute into a research centre able to conduct in-depth research into the manufacture of rubber application from tubes, tyres and gloves to earthquake disaster prevention devices. Contributions Rubber Sekhar served the natural rubber industry for about 50 years in various capacities. He was the Asian Director of the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia in 1966 and, subsequently, become the first Asian Controller of Rubber Research and chairman of the Malaysian Rubber Research and Development Board. Under his leadership, the RRIM, Tun Abdul Razak Rubber Research Centre (TARRC) in Hertford, Britain, and the Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB) rose to great heights and gained international recognition for excellence in research, modernisation of the rubber industry and the vigorous promotion and expansion of rubber usage. He was actively involved in the formation of the Malaysian Agriculture Research and Development Institute and evolved the Malaysian Rubber Development Corporation from a desk in his division to what it finally became. His efforts in setting up central processing units throughout the country and spearheading small holder support and development systems lead to their achieving impressive levels of performance and viability, while contributing substantively to the nation's economy. Sekhar also oversaw the development of stimulants to paint on rubber trees to double and in many cases triple latex yields. He was directly involved in the invention and subsequent development of the Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR) process whose final product allowed for grading to buyers' specifications to a very high level of consistency. This was one of its most significant developments as an industrial raw material. On the international front, Dr. Sekhar, in his capacity as chairman of the International Rubber Research and Development Board, was instrumental in converting the organisation into a dynamic institution. The membership increased threefold under his leadership. The IRRDB successfully implemented the expedition into Brazil for collection of new germplasm. The organisation also established an international R&D; program, three parts of which were financed through UNIDO Member institutes. Dr. Sekhar travelled widely and attended numerous conferences in all parts of the world. His able and effective advocacy of the strength and stability of natural rubber carved a \\"niche\\" for him in the international elastomer industry. With numerous patents to his name some of his more recent innovations were in the areas of rubber recycling (Delink), low protein latex and rubberised textiles. Palm Oil He was also instrumental in setting up the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia and was its founder and Chairman. Sekhar established Porim as one of the premier centres for oils and fats research in the world. Plantation Workers Sekhar was a tireless champion for the rights of Malaysian plantation workers and their progeny, mostly ethnic Indians, and made it an important part of his life's work to make sure that they received a monthly wage and due recognition from the government for their contributions to the economy of the nation. Awards and recognitions As one of Asia's most effective scientists, Sekhar received the 1973 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service and many other awards, local and international, for his efforts. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) and Government of Malaysia, in recognition of his excellent service to the nation, bestowed upon him the title of 'Tan Sri'. A Biography has been released of Tan Sri Sekhar by The Academy of Sciences Malaysia. Honours of Malaysia * : Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (J.S.M.)

The game was also released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the PAL region. It is the sixth game in the TwinBee series and a direct follow-up to the arcade game Detana!! TwinBee (Bells & Whistles). The European version was published by Konami's Palcom Software division and was the first of three TwinBee games localized for the European market, followed by a Game Boy version of Pop'n TwinBee (which was actually an earlier game titled TwinBee Da!! in Japan) and the side-scrolling platform game Pop'n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures. It was released in North America 27 years after its Super Famicom launch through a February 2020 update to the Nintendo Switch Online Super NES library. Plot The game's opening sequence shows TwinBee and WinBee patrolling the skies of Donburi Island when they suddenly receive a distress signal from a young girl named Madoka. Madoka reveals that she is the granddaughter of Dr. Mardock, who was once a benevolent scientist until a bump in the head turned him insane. Dr. Mardock now seeks to conquer the world with an army of Acorn Men and only TwinBee and WinBee can stop him. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to Detana!! TwinBee, the second coin-op game in the series, but with a few notable additions and changes. Like in previous TwinBee, up to two players can play simultaneously, Player 1 controls TwinBee (the blue aircraft), while Player 2 controls WinBee (the pink aircraft) When the player begins the game, they'll be asked to enter their name and choose between three types of companion ships (whether their companions will follow their ship, engulf them, or surround them). The player's objective is to maneuver their spacecraft through a series of seven stages and defeat every enemy who gets in the way, facing a boss at the end of each stage. Unlike previous games, instead of extra lives, the player has a life meter that determines how much damage the player's ship can take before losing. When the player loses, they will be given a chance to restart at the stage where they left off, but only limited chances are given to continue. Like in previous TwinBee games, the player shoots at airborne enemies with their gun and drops bombs to the land. The player can also attack airborne enemies with their ship's punches as well at close range. The player can shoot tiny-sized replicas of their ship that will fly and attack all on-screen enemies. The player can only perform this attack based on the number of stocks they have. During a 2-player, one player can give the other player a bit of their life energy to replenish it or even use the other player's ship as a projectile against the enemy. As usual, the main power-up items are bells that can change colors by shooting them in the air, giving the player a different upgrade when one is retrieved depending on the bell's color. On the game's option settings, the player can adjust the game's difficulty, controls, and sound, as well as switch between \\"normal\\" and \\"couple\\" mode. During couple mode, the enemy attacks will aim primarily at Player 1 if two players are playing together. This feature is intended to allow less experienced players enjoy the game if they're playing with a more experience partner.  Reception  The game was reviewed by Weekly Famitsu, and was given a score of 30 out of 40.

In the 1942 general election, he ran on a platform opposing the militarist government under Hideki Tojo, which had by this time taken away most powers from the Diet. The Tojo cabinet had attempted to block antiwar candidates from running through a registration system, notwithstanding which Abe won a Diet seat, which he used for an attempt to oust Tojo and end World War II.

It is the third and final game in the TwinBee series released for the arcades. During the same year as its arcade release, the game was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in a two-in-one compilation with its predecessor, Detana!! TwinBee, titled Detana! TwinBee Yahho!. It was later included in the PlayStation Portable compilation TwinBee Portable, released in 2007. Like most games in the TwinBee series, it was released exclusively in Japan, although an unproduced international version was planned under the title of Magical TwinBee. There would not be another shoot'em up game until the release of Line GoGo! TwinBee for iPhone OS and Android on 2013 in Japan. Gameplay TwinBee Yahho! differs from Detana!! TwinBee in that the player can adjust their playing style before starting the game to suit their preference. The player begins by choosing between three difficulty settings: Practice, Normal, and Special. Practice course is the game's easiest setting and lasts only three stages, whereas the Special course is the hardest setting and is recommended to expert players. The player will then select between four different . The regular Charge Shot from Detana! TwinBee is selectable, along with a Charge Punch, a Charge Split (which will cause the player's ship to shoot duplicates of itself), and a Charge Explosion that fires at eight directions at the same time. The player will then choose between two control styles: one which fires the gun with one button and drops bombs with the second, while the other style shoots and drops bomb at the same time with a single button (either button can be used). Like in previous TwinBee games, there are two kinds of power-ups: bell power-ups obtained from the sky and land power-ups that can be retrieved from destroy ground enemies. The bells can be changed to up to six colors this time (yellow, blue, white, green, red, and pink), each with a unique attribute. GwinBee returns as well as a power-up item, along with the \\"twin attacks\\" that can be performed with GwinBee or another player. Plot Faraway from Donburi Island (where TwinBee and his friends live) lies a fantastic island known as the Land of Wonders. Its ruler, Queen Melody, has been imprisoned by Archduke Nonsense, who seeks to use the Queen's Harp of Happiness to conquer the world. Flute, a fairy who serves Queen Melody, escapes during the coup d'etat and goes to Donburi island requesting the help of TwinBee and WinBee. TwinBee Yahho! features fully voiced cut-scenes during the game performed by the cast of the TwinBee Paradise radio drama. Story elements from TwinBee Paradise, including names of TwinBee's and WinBee's respective pilots (Light and Pastel), were used for the first time in the games in this installment.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed TwinBee Yahho! on their June 1, 1995 issue as being the sixth most-successful arcade game of the year.

The series title is consistently displayed on the covers as Storm and Illyana: Magik, but the official title as listed in the indicia is the reverse: Magik: Illyana and Storm. It was written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by John Buscema, Ron Frenz, Sal Buscema, and Tom Palmer. Publication Because of the popularity of the Uncanny X-Men during the 1980s under Chris Claremont, a number of mutant related properties were created, most notably The New Mutants from which this series spun off. Continuity The main plot takes place in mere seconds of canonical Marvel time, but covers seven years of Illyana's life in Limbo. The events occur between panels of The Uncanny X-Men #160 (August '82), with a very brief cameo in The New Mutants #14 (April '84). In X-Men #160 Illyana is kidnapped by Belasco at age 6 and returns in the same issue at age 13. Plot Magik tells the story of Illyana Rasputin from a six-year-old child to a thirteen-year-old mutant/sorceress. The narrative is framed by Illyana reflecting on these events on her fourteenth birthday. Belasco, demon lord of Limbo, wants to use Illyana to help the Elder Gods destroy Earth. To do this he has to place five bloodstones in a pentagram locket he has given to Illyana. When he first captures her at age six, he takes part of her soul and remakes it in his image, creating a bloodstone which he places in the locket. An elderly sorceress version of Storm (a former apprentice of Belasco) and an elderly, part beast version of Kitty Pryde (codenamed Cat) rescue Illyana. Storm transports them to her garden sanctuary in Limbo. Unable to remove Belasco's corruption from Illyana, Storm decides to help her combat it by taking her on as an apprentice. She spends a year showing Illyana how to separate her astral body from her physical form, while showing her a massive oak that grew from an acorn she created. Disapproving of Illyana being trained in sorcery, Cat kidnaps her. Cat takes Illyana to a replica of the Savage Land in Limbo, where she trains her physically and teaches her to sword fight. They then storm Belasco's tower. It is protected by a corrupted version of Nightcrawler, whom Cat kills. Cat then attempts to use her phasing power to take her and Illyana to Earth, but Belasco intercepts them. Belasco turns Cat into a feline demon and gives Illyana a knife. Illyana cuts herself, and the blood forms the second bloodstone in the locket. Illyana spends three years learning magic from Belasco, while secretly reading every book in his library, plotting his downfall. Alone in her room, she attempts to imitate the creation powers Storm showed her by forming an acorn from a part of herself, only to find the acorn is black and rotten. Hearing Belasco's voice outside her room, she panics, and her mutant power to create teleportational light discs manifests itself. Illyana uses a disc to enter Belasco's library, hoping to steal his grimoire, but Storm intervenes, accidentally sending her into another disc. She finds herself in the past, witnessing Storm \\"killing\\" Belasco, who claims to be immune to death while in Limbo; it is this act which binds Storm to Belasco. She teleports back to the present to find Storm battling Belasco. Cat fatally wounds Storm, then attacks Illyana. She kills Cat in self-defense. Belasco orders her to sacrifice Storm's soul to the Elder Gods. Instead, she kills Storm to save her soul and teleports to Storm's garden, where she buries her. Enraged by her defiance, Belasco captures Illyana, extracts another bloodstone from her essence, and casts her out into a wintery wilderness as punishment. Illyana finds Storm's massive oak and spends years trying to use it to help create a living acorn from her essence, only to produce still more rotten acorns. When the oak finally crumbles to dust from her efforts, Illyana realizes that she was only trying to create life as a means to an end: destroying Belasco. She tries instead to manifest her desire directly, using the last of her power to create a \\"Soulsword\\". The enchantment that held her in Storm's garden is banished in the process and she takes a stepping disc to confront Belasco. While fighting Belasco she realizes she is replaying the same scene by which Storm was corrupted, so she spares his life and he escapes. She then uses a light circle to return to Earth, rejoining the X-Men seconds after she had left them.

It is a spin-off of the TwinBee shoot-'em-up series featuring a storyline based on the TwinBee Paradise audio drama serial. It was released exclusively in Japan. Gameplay The game is a 3D RPG, and not a shooting game like the other Twinbee titles. The player controls a new protagonist who is summoned to Donburi Island to serve as a temporary pilot for TwinBee following the mysterious disappearance of TwinBee's regular pilot Light. Although the TwinBee series had previous installments that were not shoot-'em-ups, such as Pop'n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures and TwinBee: Taisen Puzzle-Dama, TwinBee RPG featured an entirely different illustrator and developing team. Konami developed TwinBee RPG primarily to cater fans of the TwinBee Paradise radio and anime series who were not good at playing shoot-'em-ups. Although Konami hoped to use the popularity of the radio and anime voice cast to promote the game, the game's sales were not enough to cover its production values and TwinBee RPG became the final game in the TwinBee series (excluding later ports and mobile applications). While TwinBee RPG is primarily a role- playing video game, it features a dating sim-system similar to Konami's Tokimeki Memorial series in which the protagonist tries to gain the favor of various girls. The endings vary depending on who is the girl most impressed by the protagonist. The experience points obtained from defeating enemies are acquired at a fixed rate (160 points from small fry enemies and 600 from bosses), which are then raised or lowered depending on the level differences between allied and enemy characters (there the weakest members of the player's party are given more experience points from defeating the same group of enemies). Moreover, the party member who delivers the finishing blow to an enemy gets extra experience points. Regardless of the current level, each party member must acquire around 5,000 experience points in order to level-up (although TwinBee is not restricted by this limit at the start of the story). In addition to combat, the player can also gain experience by doing assorted favors to townspeople in villages. Money (called \\"en\\" in this game) dropped by enemy tend to be very few, instead the player acquired profit by selling fruits and items left behind by defeated enemies. The fruits that can be found includes (from least valuable to most valuable) satsumas, apples, grapes, cherries, and peaches. Although the game features full voiceovers, the protagonist's name is never mentioned in any of the dialogue. Plot The unnamed protagonist is the player's alter-ego whose name can be decided at the start of the game. He is summoned by Queen Melora from the real world in order to save the TwinBee world. His distinguishing characters includes an outfit consists of a cap, knee-long trousers, and a vest, and an androgynous face with shoulder-long hair. His personality can be changed by the player from serious to rebellious or even perverted depending on the player's actions. Although the protagonist was designed so that his age and gender would be ambiguous according to interviews with the developers, the game's supporting cast such as Madoka and Vieren refer to the protagonist by male pronouns.  Development and release  The game is based on the radio drama Twinbee Paradise. It was released on April 2, 1998 and was re-released for the Konami the Best on December 1999. It was later reased again for the PSOne Book on November 2003. Mariko Kouda performed the ending theme song of the game. Junko Kawano was a planner for the game, and he had previously been a character designer for Suikoden.  Reception  Famitsu upon release gave it a score of 24 out of 40. Three reviewers in Dengeki PlayStation gave it scores of 55, 50, 65, and 85 for a total of 255/400. Gamers' Republic gave it a B-. Joypad gave it a 5/10.

In 1905, the institute became a School of the University of London. History Until the 1970s the Institute maintained laboratories and conducted research on infectious disease and vaccines. It was funded by manufacturing and selling vaccines. In the 1970s the institute ran into financial difficulties. From 1971–72 Professor David Gwynne Evans was the director. The institute had continual annual deficits. Evans was unable to avoid closure of the Chelsea Laboratory and there was the need for major expenditure to modernise the Elstree, Hertfordshire, production facilities. Professor Albert Neuberger became involved as chair of the governing body in 1973-74, at which point he became aware of the difficult financial problems. The endowment funds were insufficient to cover their requirements and it failed to get Government support. Neuberger came to the conclusion that within five to six years it would be bankrupt and he persuaded colleagues to dissolve the Institute. He persuaded Westminster Council to change the use of buildings. The Chelsea laboratories were closed in 1975 and Elstree in 1978. The assets were sold, the most valuable being the Chelsea site. This raised enough money to annually endow a number of Senior Research Fellowships, which is the Institute's legacy. From that point it became a science funding body, and it now awards the Lister Institute Research Prize Fellowships to researchers working on biomedical problems in the United Kingdom. The Institute's assets in 2010 amounted to about £33m. Achievements Staff took considerable risks in early research: investigating plague in India in the early 20th century the method of transmission was established when a female worker put her hand into a flea cage and saw how high the fleas jumped. Joseph Arthur Arkwright FRS (great grandson of Richard Arkwright) joined the institute in 1906 and studied typhus, amongst other things, by allowing himself to be bitten by infected lice. He survived, two others did not. Other major achievements include:  Prior to the First World War  These included the physiology of diving; the lethal effect of ultraviolet light on bacteria; fat metabolism; the role of vitamins in nutrition (the term 'vitamine' was coined by Casimir Funk when working at the institute). In 1903, Sir Charles James Martin, became the first director of the institute. He made outstanding contributions to the study of plague and its transmission and he created a new post of resident statistician for Major Greenwood, the first of its kind in Britain. Greenwood conducted statistical investigations of tuberculosis, infant mortality and hospital fatality rates. Major also interpreted data from the institute's epidemiological study of bubonic plague in India.Lise Wilkinson: Greenwood, Major (1880–1949), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography(subscription based), Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 27 Oct 2013  First World War  Tetanus antiserum production at Elstree was increased. Improved large-scale methods for antisera were introduced by Annie Homer. The bacteria causing gas gangrene of infected wounds were identified.  Inter-war years  The discovery of co-enzymes by Sir Arthur Harden FRS and his colleagues was recognised by the co-award to him of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1929. The institute played a major part in defining the role of vitamins in post-war nutritional deficiency diseases that were widespread in Europe and elsewhere. Emmy Klieneberger-Nobel pioneered the study of mycoplasma and in 1935 discovered and cultured unusual strains of bacteria that lacked a cell wall, naming them L-form bacteria after the institute where she worked. The first director, Sir Charles Martin, appointed in 1903, retired in 1930.  Second World War  The war made heavy demands on the Lister for production of antisera and vaccines. There was also need for expertise in nutrition. In 1943, Sir Alan Nigel Drury FRS became Director serving until 1952. During the war, departments had been widely dispersed. He began a successful reintegration and incorporated some Medical Research Council (MRC) units. As a result, it became a national centre for research on blood transfusion and the provision of blood products for clinical use.R A. Kekwick: \\"Drury, Sir Alan Nigel (1889–1980)\\", rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Accessed 4 Oct 2014  Post war to 1970s  The institute took some time to settle after wartime upheaval. In 1952 Ashley Miles was appointed as director. The institute remained an important manufacturer of vaccines and antitoxins. It produced the 'triple vaccine' for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (commonly called whooping cough) and vaccines for cholera, typhoid, rabies vaccines and smallpox. It also produced antisera for diphtheria, tetanus, gas gangrene, rabies and scorpion venom. There were also further important research activities:  Biochemistry  * the role of enzymes in the metabolism of plant and animal carbohydrates was elucidated * the first synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by Alexander Todd PRS in 1949 * the structure of co-enzyme A was defined by James Baddiley, together with other workers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital * Discovered that immunological specificity of bacteria is conferred by certain oligosaccharides on their surfaces * Determined the chemical nature of the human A, B, H and Lewis blood group antigens, their biosynthesis and genetic control  Blood and blood products  * Invented the ether method for fractionating blood plasma to obtain fibrinogen, thrombin, albumin, immunoglobulins and others for clinical use * Large-scale production of dried human plasma * First clinically effective Factor VIII concentrate prepared for the treatment of haemophilia by Ralph Kekwick * First anti-D immunoglobulin for treating rhesus negative mothers * Development of radio immunoassay to screen blood for hepatitis B * Blood group genetics  Microbiology and immunology  * Established life cycles of trypanosomes (Muriel Robertson FRS). * Devised a method for identifying the blood meals of insect vectors * Discovered that sequential mutations in surface antigens hinder development of protective immunity * First isolations of chlamydias affecting the eye and genital tract * Discovery of the 'Vi' antigen of Salmonella typhi * Motility of flagellated salmonella strains used to study phage transduction * First description of the bacterial sex pilus and exploitation for studying bacterial plasmids, including antibiotic resistance  Vaccines and antitoxins  * Medical Research Council field trials of pertussis vaccines * Development of the freeze-dried heat-stable vaccine used in the smallpox eradication programme  Nutrition  * Demonstration of roles of sunlight and cod liver oil in treating and preventing rickets due to vitamin D deficiency (Dame Harriette Chick). Locations  Elstree  The old Elstree site is located off the north- west side of Dagger Lane, off Tylers Way, Bushey, between the Hillfield Park and Aldenham reservoirs in Aldenham Country Park. It was until recently shown on Ordnance Survey maps as the Lister Institute, though more recently the Master Atlas of Greater London (2007) shows it as 'laboratories'. Many of the original buildings still exist including one of the old lodges (Queensbury) and the old stable block. The site now houses the Bio Products Laboratory, formed in 1954, which is the UK national plasma fractionator.  Chelsea  The British Institute of Preventive Medicine was established in 1891. In 1903, it was renamed The Lister Institute in honour of the great surgeon and medical pioneer, Joseph Lister. This building, along with another adjacent building, forms The Lister Hospital, a private hospital which opened in 1985. The Grade II Listed building is located on Chelsea Bridge Road at its junction with Grosvenor Road and Chelsea Bridge on the north bank of the River Thames which it overlooks.

Its effectiveness against pain is in the same range as morphine, and it also has some NMDA-antagonist properties imparted, in part, by its metabolite norketobemidone. This may make it useful for some types of pain that do not respond well to other opioids. It is marketed in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden and is used for severe pain. History Ketobemidone was first synthesized in 1942 by Eisleb and colleagues, at the laboratory of I.G. Farbenindustrie at Hoechst during the Second World War. The first study of it in humans was published in 1946, and it was introduced in clinical medicine shortly after. It was not in clinical use in the United States when the Controlled Substances Act 1970 was promulgated and was assigned to Schedule I with an ACSCN of 9628. As of 2013, no annual manufacturing quota was assigned by the DEA. Pfizer manufactures ketobemidone under the tradenames Ketogan and Ketorax. It is available as tablets, suppositories, and injection fluid. A sustained release formulation exists, sold as Ketodur, in some countries containing 10 or 25 mg ketobemidone. Pharmacology Experiments on former addicts indicated it was quite addictive and in high doses, compared to other opioids, may have increased abuse potential in former and current opioid addicts. While some effort was first suggested for drafting of a resolution urging governments to stop manufacture and use of ketobemidone. This result was not in agreement with clinical observations, and another study in 1958 did not find it more addictive than morphine. That study noticed that while for morphine the dose for euphoria is the same as that for analgesia, for ketobemidone the analgesic dose was well below the euphoric dose. Thus, even compared to morphine, ketobemidone may be much more effective without causing significant euphoria and this having a lower risk of addiction under the supervision or a qualified clinican. Ketobemidone is mostly used in the Scandinavian countries, with Denmark topping the statistics. Analgesia after 5-10 mg orally or 5-7.5 mg intravenously lasts 3–5 hours. Ketobemidone is also available in preparations with a spasmolytic, which can improve the analgesia. Metabolism Ketobemidone is mainly metabolized by conjugation of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and by N-demethylation. Only about 13-24% is excreted unchanged after intravenous administration. Chemistry Ketobemidone is 1-methyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propionylpiperidine. It is usually available as the hydrochloride, which is a white powder. It is synthesized by alkylating (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine, followed by reaction with ethylmagnesium bromide, and finally O-demethylation with hydrobromic acid. Because of a strong vesicant nature of bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine there are many other routes developed for obtaining ketobemidone. A route depicted below lays through first alkylating the same (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with 2-chloro-N,N-dimethylethylamine or 2-chloro-N-benzyl-N-methylethylamine. Next, those amines are alkylated once again using a mixed 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, thus completing the piperidine ring and obtaining a quaternary ammonium salt, which can be dequaternized using thiophenol salt (for N,N-dimethylammonium) or catalytic hydrogenation (for both compounds) to a common 4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-cyano-1-methyl- pyperidine. The later yields ketobemidone after Grignard reaction with ethylmagnesium bromide and ether cleavage. :700px  See also  * Dextropropoxyphene * Pethidine * Methadone * Tramadol * Phenadoxone * Dextromoramide * Picenadol  References  Category:Synthetic opioids Category:Piperidines Category:Phenols Category:Ketones Category:Mu-opioid agonists Category:Euphoriants Category:NMDA receptor antagonists Category:Analgesics ","title":"Ketobemidone"},{"id":"6879626","text":"John Straley is a poet and author of detective fiction. He currently resides in Sitka, Alaska. Biography John Straley was born in Redwood City, California. He grew up in the Seattle area and attended high school in New York City. Straley trained, with encouragement from his parents, to be a horseshoer. He attended Grinnell College before transferring to the University of Washington for a degree in writing. After college and a stint in Eastern Washington, he followed his wife to Sitka, Alaska in 1977. After moving through a number of jobs he became a private investigator. In 1985, he became a staff investigator for the Alaska Public Defender's office in Sitka, a position he held until 2015. As an investigator, he continued to write. After being turned down by publishers numerous times, in 1991 he received a tip from friend and anthropologist Richard Nelson that New York City-based Soho Press was interested in detective fiction novels. Upon submitting his manuscript for The Woman Who Married a Bear, Soho Press expressed interest in his work. After a successful run of mysteries that has garnered critical acclaim, he is now looking outside of his trademark Cecil Younger series for future books. During his presidency, Bill Clinton visited a bookstore and bought The Woman Who Married a Bear. In 2006, he was named writer laureate for the State of Alaska; he served in that position until 2008.Alaska State Writer Laureate list In 2008, Alaska Northwest Books published Straley's The Big Both Ways, a historical fiction work based in the Pacific Northwest. Since then his work has been primarily in creating poetry. In 2014, SOHO Press published Straley's latest book, Cold Storage, Alaska.

Early life He was the fifth son of Radu cel Mare. His baptismal name was Dumitru and he married Chiajna, the daughter of Petru Rareș, whose name was in fact Ana. He was probably called the Shepherd because he bought sheep for the Istanbul markets before ascending the throne. Career The Ottoman Empire (Wallachia's suzerain) named him ruler in January 1545 in place of his stepbrother Radu Paisie and he entered Bucharest on 17 March 1545, ascending the throne on that day. Through his first decree of privilege, of 25 March 1545, he maintained in their functions and even promoted four high officials of his predecessor. A chronicle relates that two weeks after his installation, he ordered that a number of boyars be killed, including Coadă the vornic (internal affairs minister), Radul the comis, Stroe the spătar (second-in- command of the military), and Vintilă, also a comis. The chronicle also mentions that they were tortured so that they would reveal where the money and jewels were hidden, so that these could be poured into the treasury. Following this massacre, some of the wealthiest boyars and the relatives of those killed went into exile in Transylvania and Hungary, where they came together and tried twice to depose him from the throne. First challenge The first attempt came at the Battle of Periș, on August 24, 1546, when the host of boyars in exile was attacked by surprise and decimated by Mircea the Shepherd. At the beginning of 1548 a new exodus of the boyars remaining in Wallachia took place, headed by Stoica the stolnic, Vintilă the vornic, Radu the great logofăt and Pârvu the postelnic. In these conditions the boyars in exile regrouped and a second confrontation took place that year. Led by a young pretender and accompanied by 1,000 Székely mercenaries, they entered Wallachia hoping to be backed by a popular revolt. However, the expected revolt never materialized; the chronicle of the Brașov resident Ostermayer seems to indicate that the peasants backed Mircea. It appears that the battle took place near the village of Miloste ( in present the village of Milostea) in Vâlcea County, with Mircea the Shepherd emerging victorious and the boyars who were not killed escaping with great difficulty. Second Challenge While the Habsburgs who occupied Transylvania in 1551 wanted a ruler devoted to their cause in Wallachia, the new governor of Transylvania, Imperial general Johann Baptist Castaldo, backed Radu Ilie, who, also surrounded by boyars in exile, crossed the border into Wallachia in November 1552. While Radu Ilie had about 15,000 men, Mircea the Shepherd had around eight or nine thousand. Two days before the battle, fearful of being betrayed, Mircea had 47 boyars put to death at his table. The decisive battle took place at Mănești on November 16, 1552. Radu Ilie was victorious, while Mircea took refuge with his family in Giurgiu. Loss and reinstatement On May 11, 1553, Mircea the Shepherd, backed in person by the prince of Moldavia, Alexandru Lăpușneanu, retook his throne. His second period of rule was short, as the very same Alexandru Lăpușneanu, suspecting him of bad faith, sent his high vornic, Nădăbaico, to remove Mircea from the throne. Then, he obtained from the Ottoman Porte the right to rule for Pătrașcu, while Mircea had to leave for Istanbul. After Pătrașcu died in January 1558, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent once again granted Mircea the Shepherd the right to rule. His appointment provoked an exodus of boyars across the Southern Carpathians and out of Wallachia. Mircea promised these men that if they returned and paid homage to him, he would forgive them. He received them at the princely court in Bucharest, in the presence of Ottoman dignitaries. Nevertheless, after the Ottomans had left, Mircea killed the boyars, Stănilă the vornic being the most important of these. That same day, 3 February 1558, was the first time that representatives of the Orthodox clergy also perished. Death Mircea the Shepherd died in 1559, being buried in the church at Curtea Veche in Bucharest, which he had rebuilt. After his death, his energetic wife, Doamna Chiajna, helped their son Petru to obtain the throne.

He died after falling from a balcony during a police pursuit, with only one album to his name. Life and music career Ephraim Lewis was born on 27 November 1967. He was an English soul/neo-soul and R&B; singer and songwriter whose career was cut short after releasing only one album. Lewis was the youngest of eight children (five brothers and two sisters) in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. He came from a family of talent, his father, Jabez, encouraged the siblings to pursue music as a family vocal group, the Tremetones, but that dream ended with the death of Lewis’s mother in 1984. Ephraim, keen to pursue his dreams, eventually left home at age 16. He was discovered by the owners of Axis Studio in Sheffield, who dubbed him the “British Michael Jackson”. The song \\"captured\\" was dedicated to his long time girlfriend. Lewis signed with Elektra Records in 1992, and his debut album, Skin was released that year. The album sold fewer than 200,000 copies, and its two singles, \\"Drowning in Your Eyes\\" and \\"It Can’t Be Forever\\", only fared respectably on the U.S. charts. The record company sent Lewis to Los Angeles, California, to work with prolific songwriter and producer Glen Ballard.  Death  On 18 March 1994, Los Angeles Police allegedly responded to reports of a \\"naked black man acting crazy” at 1710 Fuller Avenue, the apartment where Lewis was living. The Police reported Lewis tried to escape the Officers and began climbing the outside balconies. When he reached the top floor there was an altercation. While on the top balcony, the police had used a taser on Lewis three times. Police claimed this had \\"no apparent effect\\", although according to reports it was applied directly to Lewis's skin. Lewis fell from the balcony and landed on the courtyard below, suffering extensive head injuries. After being kept alive on a ventilator for several hours, the decision was made to end life-sustaining measures, acting on the advice of the hospital. Lewis died at the hospital that night. The coroner assigned by the LA police department ruled the death as a suicide. It took a month for his body to be returned to the UK. The following month, hundreds of people gathered at the Darlington Street Methodist Church in Wolverhampton for his funeral. His manager, David Harper, covered most of the funeral expenses and the cost of returning Lewis’s body to England, but did not attend the service. Lewis was laid to rest on 21 April 1994. Naomi Hobbs, Lewis's cousin, who is a barrister, said: Kevin Bacon, whose Axis Studio discovered Lewis, said: Naomi Hobbs challenged the Police department's account of events. To date an investigation is yet to be carried out.

Canarypox virus (CNPV) is an Avipoxvirus and etiologic agent of canarypox, a disease of wild and captive birds that can cause significant losses. Canarypox can enter human cells, but it cannot survive and multiply in human cells. There is a live viral vaccine available which may have beneficial properties against human cancer when used as a mammalian expression vector. (ATCvet code: ). Furthermore, the POXIMUNE® C vaccine does offer direct protection against CNPV in susceptible birds. Generally CNPV is considered a disease of songbirds, such as canaries, magpies and nightingales, and is associated with higher mortality rates when compared to other avian pox viruses. In some instances, mortality approaches 100%. Avian pox viruses also cause significant economic losses in domestic poultry and remain a problem in the conservation of endemic bird species inhabiting islands. The general symptoms of CNPV are similar to those of other species of avian pox viruses and are characterised by pustules and diphtheria or pneumonia-like symptoms. Classification Canarypox virus (CNPV) is a member of the Poxviridae family. Canarypox viruses, as with other bird pox viruses, are in the genera of Avipoxvirus. Nine other species are also in the genus Avipoxvirus. These include: Fowlpox virus, Juncopox virus, Mynahpox virus, Psittacinepox virus, Sparrowpox virus, Starlingpox virus, Pigeonpox virus, Turkeypox virus and Quailpox virus. It has thus far been reported that around 232 bird species (from 23 disparate orders) are affected by avian pox virus. Structure and replication CNPV is an enveloped virus. They can be enveloped by double (external enveloped virion- EEV) or single (intracellular mature virion – IMV) membranes. These membranes are acquired from the host cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cell membrane. CNPV and other poxviruses are characterised by having exceptionally large physical dimensions, approximately 330 nm×280 nm×200 nm. The genome of CNPV is linear and is composed of dsDNA. The genome size is approximately 365kbp, and in total, 328 genes have been found. The shape of all poxviruses resembles something of a 'rounded brick' and remains determined by the specific envelope around the virus. The process which further characterises the poxvirus family is that replication occurs in the cytoplasm and utilises a specific virus-made structure for replication, the 'virosome'. Furthermore, gene expression is divided into three phases: early, intermediate and late. At each stage specific genes and promoters are expressed. The structure and replication of CNPV also characterise other members of the Poxviridae family. The vaccinia virus is commonly used as a prototype and can be consulted for further information. Transmission The most common form of spread of CNPV is by vectors such as mosquitoes and mites. These transmit the virus from infected birds to non-infected birds. Direct routes of transmission have also been observed, especially in closed environments such as aviaries or farms, where the contact rate of birds is high. When the virus is transmitted directly, this would usually occur through aerosols, consumption of infected bird tissue or by general contact with the diseased bird. Healthy birds are at increased risk of acquiring the disease through existing wounds or scabs when in close contact with diseased birds. The typical incubation period for the virus is between 5–10 days. Symptoms CNPV symptoms often show two main forms. That is either dry (cutaneous) and/or wet (diphtheritic) symptoms (both forms can occur at the same time). The dry form is the most frequently observed. At the beginning of the disease, small white/yellow blisters form on the uncovered parts of the skin. As the disease progresses blisters get progressively larger and form nodules where the virus can multiply. When the nodules coalesce and burst, scabs are formed leaving rough, dry and pigmented areas on the skin where the nodules were. Electron micrograph of an epidermal cell showing Poxvirus infection This form of the disease is usually mild and does not cause death. The chances of mortality increase when the dry form occurs together with the wet (diphtheritic) form. The wet form symptoms include an enlarged thymus and obstructed lungs, sinuses and trachea with white areas of necrotic tissue. This results in restricted air intake and the potential for suffocation. It has also been observed that some birds may also experience thickened eyelids, air-sacks and enlarged spleens. Observations under the microscope have shown that the lesions are characterised by epithelial proliferation and hypertrophy in the viral infected areas. Characteristics of avian pox include the formation of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies ('Bollinger bodies') which are composed of mononuclear inflammatory cells and have been detected in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, middle ear and air sac. Similar inclusion bodies which are associated with inflammation have also been seen in the epidermis, feather follicles, sinuses and oral mucosa lining. Apart from the symptoms mentioned above, more general signs of infection include weight loss, loss of feathers and scaly skin on the head, neck and back. Secondary bacterial infections are common with both forms of the disease, having the potential to cause pneumonia or other bacterial infections at the sites of blistering. Treatment Currently there is no treatment available. Diseased birds should however be admitted to a veterinary practice where suitable care will be provided. Care would normally consist of removing skin from the lesions and washing the infected area(s) with Lugol's iodine solution. Furthermore, swabbing of the mouth and throat areas to remove necrotic tissues is common. By keeping diseased birds in warmer temperatures and ensuring daily eye rinsing with 1-2% saline solution has also been shown to promote recovery. In some cases, the infected birds are prescribed antibiotics. This will not target the virus but its use is designed to prevent secondary bacterial and fungal infections which are often found in skin lesions. Medical Veterinary Medicine A live attenuated CNPV vaccine has been developed and is the best preventive measure against canarypox for captive grown canary birds and other passerine birds. The brand name 'Poximune® C' by Ceva is a freeze-dried vaccine, administered by the 'wing web' method to healthy, susceptible passerine birds who have reached at least four weeks of age. Booster vaccination is recommended every 6–12 months if the risk of disease remains high. Pox lesion formation around the vaccination area is indicative that the vaccine has been effective. The vaccine should not be administered during egg production or in the 4 weeks prior to this. Human Medicine CNPV has been used recently as a mammalian expression vector in the vaccine industry. Although veterinary CNPV vaccines exist, recent attention has focussed on its use in human medicine with several human vaccines using this expression system undergoing clinical trials. The vaccines typically use the CNPV ALVAC strain, which is highly attenuated. The use of this strain has been involved in the expression of several key pathogen and tumour associated antigens. These include (but are not limited to) those found in rabies virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, leukaemia virus, HIV and cancers; such as melanoma and colorectal cancers. The expression system using CNPV is advantageous because it undergoes what is known as ‘abortive infection’ but at the same time displays the necessary antigens to the hosts immune system. More information can be found in this review Avipoxviruses: Infection Biology and their use as Vaccine Vectors. Threats Canarypox virus remains a constant threat to wild birds. Those most vulnerable are passerine birds, endemic on islands such as Hawaii and the Galapagos. Here they have experienced dramatic losses in bird numbers. Many more have become classified as endangered species due to CNPV. The disease is mainly spread by mosquitoes and mites in these regions, which were introduced during European colonisation. Canarypox, together with avian malaria, are the most devastating diseases for birds on the island of Hawaii and surrounding regions.

The museum is a non-profit 501c(3) organization. It is located at 2040 N Santa Fe Ave. in Vista. It is run by several paid employees, along with volunteer help. The museum is open almost every day of the year and has two bi-annual shows, on the 3rd and 4th weekends of June and October. The museum also has other public and private events throughout the year. Exhibits at the museum include:  Technology museum  Gas Engine Row has many large stationary gas engines from the early 1900s. On the row is an operational Fairbanks-Morse mine hoist winding engine, a pumphouse powered by a Fairbanks- Morse engine, a horsepower 1922 Fairbanks-Morse type YV engine connected to a large alternator, an enormous 1914 Chicago-Pneumatic hot-bulb air compressor, an Western engine, a Western engine, a Western engine and many other stationary engines. Almost all of the engines on Gas Engine Row can be seen running during the shows. Steam Engine Row showcases many different types and sizes of stationary steam engines; from a monstrous Allis Chalmers Corliss engine with a flywheel, to a small J. Lefel & Sons portable engine. They are all powered by steam from two large boilers, nicknamed Pat and Rich, after two long-time museum volunteers who maintain and operate them.  Steam engines  There are six operational steam traction engines on the grounds, with a 1913 Buffalo-Pitts steamroller and a 1909 20 horsepower Case undergoing restoration. The operational steam tractors are an 1895 Russell & Co. 15-30 steam tractor, a 1902 Advance 16-30 steam tractor, a 1912 J.I. Case steam tractor, a 1920 Minneapolis steam tractor, and a 1916 15-30 Russell & Co. Most, if not all, of these tractors can be seen steaming around the grounds during the show days.  Tractors  The museum is also home to a large number of old tractors. Two D8 Caterpillars, a D9, a few large 1930s Caterpillars, some Best crawlers and many other examples of tracked tractors can be seen at the museum. The typical tractors such as Farmall, John Deere, Oliver, and Allis-Chalmers can be seen out at the museum, but there are more than a few rarer examples too. There is a 1924 Buffalo-Springfield road roller, a gigantic 1918 30-60 Aultman-Taylor gas tractor, a 1911 Fairbanks- Morse 15-25 kerosene tractor, a 1915 International Harvester Mogul 8-16, several Rumely Oil-Pulls, and many more.  Blacksmithing  There is an operational blacksmith shop with an operating line shaft setup powered by a 15-horsepower 1917 Mogul gasoline engine. During the show days, there are multiple forges lit, and multiple blacksmiths can be found working pieces of iron into many different things.  Model Railroad  Also located on museum grounds is the Short Track Model Railroad Club, featuring an NTrak model railroad with trains traveling through more than 40 modules, including a drive-in movie theater, a fairgrounds, farms, towns, and a coal mine and other scenes. The Short Track, N-Scale, Model Railroad club is an educational organization that seeks to further the appreciation of railroad history in the United States. Many members are also National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) members and a few have earned the title of \\"Master Modeler.\\" Their Donner Pass, N-scale, model railroad exhibit shows the Southern Pacific crossing of the Sierra Mountains between Colfax, CA and West Reno, NV. There is also a small layout that can be operated by children (The Young & Victorious RR).  Textile museum  The Museum Weavers are housed in a barn, featuring more than 50 working looms for weaving. Members of this club meet weekly to learn and practice weaving, rug-making and rope-making.  One-room school  The School of Times Past is a model One-room schoolhouse which hosts field-trips from local elementary schools, offering a program to teach children about the workings of an early-1900s farmstead.  Mill museum  The working gristmill grinds wheat and corn into flour, which is available for sale during the twice-yearly shows. During the summer months, the museum grows sorghum cane, which is made into molasses for the fall show.  Sawmill  The Sawmill is run by a D-3000 Cat diesel engine, Hawthorne Machinery in San Diego provided the cylinder liners. The Sawmill was re-assembled and improved following a donation from the Pederson Brothers who had operated it in the Big Bear area years ago. This is likely the only Sawmill that can be seen operating in San Diego County.

In this application, the bullwheel that is attached to the prime mover is called the drive bullwheel, and the other is the return bullwheel. One of the bullwheels is usually attached to a cable tensioning system, which is usually either hydraulic or fixed counterweights. A double-grooved bullwheel may be used by some ropeways, whereby two cables travelling at the same speed, or the same cable twice, loop around the bullwheel. The bullwheel began use in farm implements with the reaper. The term described the traveling wheel, traction wheel, drive wheel, or harvester wheel. The bullwheel powered all the moving parts of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder. The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or tractor pulled the implement forward. Cyrus McCormick used the bullwheel to power his 1834 reaper and until the early 1920s when small internal combustion engine gasoline engines like the Cushman MotorBreaking the Land: The Transformation of Cotton, Tobacco, and Rice Cultures Since 1880 began to be favored.

Princemarch is a central princedom on the continent and is the traditional seat of the High Prince. Roelstra's Line has ruled this princedom since the ancient times of the diarmadh'im, or sorcerers', rule. After the diarmadh'im fell from power, they went into hiding in the Veresch Mountains, which cover nearly half of Princemarch. Geography The geography of Princemarch varies from ice-capped mountains and thick forests to rich soil in green valleys that can grow nearly anything. The south boasts the cropland and valleys, producing fruits, grains and vegetables as well as meats, cheese and nuts. To the east are the Vere Hills, which borders the desert, then to the north are the Great Veresch Mountains. The mountains rise quickly over the lowlands, the tallest peak covered in snow even through the summer. Lower peaks sprouted conifers, which rose to heights of ten or twenty men with needles the length of an arm. Twinning throughout the mountains, streams flow into lakes of pure water. In the valley meadows flowers of every color grow, sheltered by thick forests. Scattered throughout the forests and above the snowline were jutting granite stones and boulders as well as caves. Dragons fly over the southern portion of the princedom and even rest near some of the lakes, such as in Dragon's Rest Valley. Culture The people of Princemarch are typically dark haired with pale skin. The eyes vary in coloring, but many seem to be vividly colored. The mountain folk are often perceived as ignorant or naive, while the more \\"civilized\\" people tend to live in the lowlands as farmers - even though if they are glorified ones. Hawking is a sport for the elite of Princemarch, which became widespread in 719 as the birds were sold at the Rialla. This new way of hunting soon became very popular and the sale of pedigree hawks soon flourished as a trade. Rock climbing is also a popular sport in this mountainous land. The test of manhood and prowess in Princemarch involves climbing a steep cliff overlooking the Faolain River near Castle Crag and then propelling down the cliff as if in flight. Large iron rings have been driven into the rock to secure the climbers in place. Each climber has a rope tied around his or her waist, connecting to another person and to the rings. As the lead climber reaches a new ring he/she ties the rope to the higher ring. To climb a person finds hand and foot holds carved into the rock. There are various ledges jutting out of the rock, which are often used for short breaks. Young Prince Pol climbed this perilous trek, but was attacked by Merida before he made it to the top. Pol swore to complete the task, but the people of Princemarch had already embraced him as their own and declared that he had proved his worth. Diarmadh'im The diarmadh'im are sorcerers, who used to rule the Continent. After the war with the Sunrunners, they fled into the Veresche Mountains. For generations diarmadh'im have lived in hiding throughout the mountains of Princemarch and Firon. Places * Elktrap Manor: Manor held by Garic and his sole heir, Ruala. During Roelstra's rule, Lord Garic had hid and hoarded his wealth, waiting out the High Prince's rule. By the time his granddaughters were able to wed they each had doweries befitting a princess. The Manor acquired its wealth through trade. It had a herd of sheep that produced wool, they hunted the plentiful elk for their meat and their black hooves, from which many items, ranging from goblets to ornate boxes, were carved. Elktrap was also the home of diarmadh'im. Lord Garic told Ruala stories of the old ways, and they had ancient scrolls and mirrors. In 728 Riyan and Sorin stopped at this manor on their quest to discover dragon slayers. It was here that Riyan met his match in Ruala. Through their marriage he became the Lord of Elktrap Manor. *Feruche: Ianthe's home. It was a tower keep on the border of the desert and Princemarch. Feruche was used as a prison for both Rohan and Sioned; it held nightmares for each of them. Rohan refused to set foot inside the keep ever again, even after the tower had been destroyed by Sioned's Sunrunner fire. In 719, Feruche was given to Sorin of Radzyn Keep. *Rezeld Manor: Morlen, Lord of Rezeld, was one of the few athr'im of Princemarch to chafe at Rohan and Pol's rule. When the two princes toured Princemarch in 719, Lord Morlen attempted to conceal his wealth, while at the same time flaunting it between the princes' noses. He had his daughter wear carved wood instead of jewels so that Pol would think the family could not afford a suitable dowery. Rohan knew what the carved necklace actually symbolized, however: numbers of sheep, cattle, goats, and other produce, including a quarry. Other signs of hidden wealth included thin tapestries on rods, which meant their purpose was not to keep out the cold, fresh plaster holing the rods in place, and candle holders that held whittled torches. After Rohan caught Morlen in this form of treason, he had Morlen's quarry supply the stone for Dragon's Rest. Lord Morlen was resentful, both of being found out and for the loss of his stone. In 728, his resentment found an outlet in the war the diarmadh'im and Chiana planned to wage on Dragon's Rest. Rezeld Manor reverted to Princemarch for Lord Morlen's second treasonous act. *River Ussh: A keep that supported Pol after his rock climbing fiasco. Pol's first squire, Edrel, was from River Ussh. *Veresch Mountains: Home to many diarmadhi and the birthplace of Lallante, Roelstra's wife. These mountains are the only place on the continent where dranath grows. The seeds and resin from tree cones taste like honey and are eaten and traded as food. The mountains themselves rise to the sky, scraping clouds. The tallest is snow cover year round. Deer with white antlers, many birds, and fish all make their home here. Flowers adorn valley meadows caught between mountain peaks. Castle Crag Castle Crag was the royal seat of Princemarch and of the High Prince Roelstra. The castle is on the side of a gorge, overlooking the Faolain River and rising in many turrets and spires. The main body of the keep is said to have originally been carved out by dragons. The castle itself had been built by the ancient sorcerers, who used to rule the continent. Castle Crag was created to be imposing. It has twisting corridors, towers cutting into the sky, and views of the roaring river far below as it carves a cleft between two jagged mountain cliffs. The diarmadh'im also built secret passageways and exits throughout the already maze-like keep. These tunnels were marked by star symbols etched in the stone. The keep also has a lovely rose garden, which had served as the common haunt of Roelstra's many daughters while they had been 'imprisoned' here, and a vast archive, containing not only official documents of athr'im and princes, but also the personal records of five high princes and a regent of Princemarch. The oratory of Castle Crag is said to be one of the most beautiful structures on the continent. The entry doors are panelled wood set beneath a stone arch. Carved into the wood are scenes of water in the sea with silver whitecaps, a gentle breeze of air across a golden wheat field, Earth in the silver, snow-covered Veresch Mountains, and a sunburst of golden fire. The oratory itself is made entirely of Fironese crystal, set in a half circle on the side of a cliff. The ornaments and plates are all made of gold, which shines in the sun. The chairs, cushions, and carpets are all white, which reflects the colored light streaming through the glass. At night shadows rule, blurred only by the pale light of the moons. After 704, Castle Crag became the seat of Princemarch's regent, and then one of the princedom's primary keeps as Dragon's Rest became Pol's seat of power. Dragon's Rest Dragon's Rest was the name given to the valley and palace home built by Prince Rohan for his son, Pol. The palace was built in a valley near the desert, which was to the east of Dragon's Pass. Rohan had wanted \\"a new palace that embraces both the Desert and Princemarch\\" (Star Scroll 573). Once Pol was knighted, Dragon's Rest became the new seat of power in Princemarch. It also became the site of the Rialla after Lyell and Kiele of Waes were executed in 719. The valley is ten measures long and about five across. It is flat, green, and has trees with ripe fruit, roses and wild grapevines. Pine trees rise from the jagged stones, which cradle the valley; a river runs through the eastern side, surrounded by red and blue wildflowers. Where the valley narrows into the cleft of the mountains, a lake lies surrounded by lush grasses. Dragons fly above the valley and rest near the lake on their migration from the Catha Hills to the Veresch, giving the valley and palace its name: Dragon's Rest. The palace consists of a symmetrical layout of towers and halls. The Guard Tower is round and five stories high, made from silver-gray stone, while grayish blue Kierstian tiles adorn the roof. It is matched by another tower for the masters of various trades – horse, hawk, vine, harvest, etc. – between which lies the Princes Hall. The Princes Hall is a creation of Fironese crystal windows, round in the front and flat in the back, facing the water gardens. Two more buildings curve around the fountains, mirroring each other. One is the Prince's private residence, the other the servants quarters, guest chambers, and reception chambers.

Definition Post-bop is jazz from the mid-1960s onward that assimilates hard bop, modal jazz, avant-garde and free jazz without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above. Post-bop can refer to a variety of Jazz music that is post-bebop chronologically but in the common understanding post-bop music reflects these influences: the more open approach to the jazz ensemble crystallized by the second Miles Davis quintet, and the modal intensity of that group as well as of the classic John Coltrane Quartet. According to musicologist Jeremy Yudkin, post-bop does not follow \\"the conventions of bop or the apparently formless freedom of the new jazz\\". He wrote in his definition of the subgenre: History Miles Davis' second quintet was active during 1964 to 1968 and featured pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Tony Williams. They recorded six studio albums that, according to All About Jazz's C. Michael Bailey, introduced post-bop: E.S.P. (1965), Miles Smiles (1967), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1968), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968).  Legacy  Due to the abstractness and the free form of post bop music it influenced fusion music in the 1970s. It transformed jazz music to another level that incorporates much more creative freedom and playing. The form free, harmonically free, and abstract post bop had influenced artists to move away from the diatonic approaches and opened up the creative aspects of Jazz music. According to the book Miles Davis, Miles Smiles, and the Invention of Post Bop', “Miles Davis is really the one who started Post Bop and continued on the legacy of his own creation towards fusion and hard bop.\\" See also *:Category:Post-bop jazz musicians References External links *Indie Jazz article on Post-Bop *Rhapsody.com *http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/subgenre/post-bop *http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/post-bop-ma0000005010 *http://www.allaboutjazz.com/post-bop-records-of-the-modern-era-by-aaj- staff.php Category:Jazz genres ","title":"Post-bop"},{"id":"6880074","text":"Tales of Conan is a 1955 collection of four fantasy short stories by American writers Robert E.

Between 1962 and 1969, the duo released several singles and charted thirteen times on the U.S. country charts, reaching No. 1 in 1962 with their first single, \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\". Biography Carl Robert Butler was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on June 2, 1927. He grew up influenced by Roy Acuff and the old time music around his home. He began singing at local dances at the age of 12 and, after service in World War II, sang with several bluegrass bands and then as a solo act on numerous radio shows, including the \\"Mid Day Merry Go Round\\" on WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee. During this period he met Pearl Dee Jones, a Nashville native born September 20, 1927, whom he married in 1952. In 1961, Carl Butler recorded \\"Honky Tonkitis\\", which made it to number 25 on the country charts. The following year, the Butlers were invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, and the exposure provided by the show helped them push \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\" to number one. Their first single as a duo spent almost three months at the top of the country music charts and they remained one of country music's most popular duos for the next two decades. Later chart records included \\"I Wouldn't Change You If I Could\\", \\"Too Late To Try Again\\", \\"Loving Arms\\" and \\"I'm Hanging Up The Phone\\". Carl Butler was also a songwriter, penning classics including \\"If Teardrops Were Pennies\\", a No. 8 hit for Carl Smith in 1951 and a top 10 single for Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton in 1973, and \\"Crying My Heart Out Over You\\" which became Ricky Skaggs' first number one hit in 1981. The Butlers were also among the earliest supporters of Dolly Parton, with whom they had worked in Knoxville in the 1950s, and they helped to get her established in Nashville in the early 1960s. (Parton, in turn, paid tribute to the Butlers when she included \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\" on Treasures, a 1996 album of covers of some of her favorite songs.) The Butlers continued to record throughout the 1970s but essentially retired to their ranch, \\"Crossover Acres\\", near Franklin, Tennessee, in the early 1980s.

The film had initially been intended to be an American-Romanian superproduction, with Columbia Pictures proposing actors such as Charlton Heston, Orson Welles, Laurence Harvey, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, or Kirk Douglas. But at Nicolae Ceauşescu's intent, the production was approved only with Romanian actors. The story is historically less authentic, but is full of grand battle scenes, political plots, betrayals and family drama. To reenact the battles that Mihai Viteazul fought against the Turks, some 5,000 soldiers of the Romanian army were brought to the set. Some reports put this number around 10,000 soldiers. The film has two parts and was shot in several locations, such as Istanbul, Prague and Călugăreni, but also the Danube, the Black Sea, Alba Iulia, Carpathian Mountains, Bucharest, Sibiu, Sinaia, and Miraslau. The budget at the time was around 14 million lei, which in 2010 was estimated to be worth to be around 500,000 dollars, a relatively high sum for its period. Release The film was released in Romania in 1970 and ran in the cinemas for several years. Worldwide, it was distributed by Columbia Pictures, under the name The Last Crusade.

He is the author of The Decline and Fall of Public Service Broadcasting and the Production of Political Television. He is currently a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Education Tracey earned a bachelor's of arts in politics from the University of Exeter in 1971, followed by a PhD in mass communications in 1974 from the University of Leicester. From 1981–88, he was the director of the Broadcasting Research Unit in London. He has been a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder since 1988. JonBenét Ramsey case Tracey is the producer of three documentaries about the death of JonBenét Ramsey. He has been a strong advocate for the innocence of JonBenét's parents and critical of the media frenzy that implicated the parents. On July 9, 2008, twelve years after the murder, DNA evidence corroborated that it was not the parents, but an unidentified man, who was responsible.

According to Tracey, police were trying to find this suspect, but they were stymied \\"because he had gone 'underground'\\". However, based on details in the documentary, a viewer determined this \\"suspect\\" was John Steven Gigax. Gigax was an acquaintance of Michael Helgoth, who was briefly considered a suspect, but Gigax had not gone into hiding, and Tom Bennett of the Boulder District Attorney's office stated that Gigax was never a suspect. Tracey later identified John Mark Karr to law enforcement as a person who should be investigated in the Ramsey case. Karr's confession to the crime earned widespread attention, but DNA tests later ruled him out as a suspect. Tracey and Karr corresponded extensively; Tracey contacted Boulder law enforcement and worked with them as an informant, which ultimately lead to their decision to charge Karr with the murder. Radio host Peter Boyles called Tracey an \\"opportunist\\" who \\"has perpetuated the JonBenét mystery for his own benefit\\", while Paul Voakes, dean of the University of Colorado at Boulder journalism school, \\"defended Tracey as an altruistic investigator\\". Other works Tracey was once a columnist for the Rocky Mountain News.

Billingham was born in Warminster, Wiltshire, the son of a dairy farmer. He completed his BSc in zoology at Oriel College, Oxford. His studies were interrupted by World War II, he completed war time service in the Royal Navy serving on an anti-submarine escort. He returned to Oxford in 1946 and became Peter Medawar's research student. During his PhD he worked on skin grafts in guinea pigs, demonstrating that when black skin was grafted onto white skin, the white skin became black. They proposed that the change was due to the dissemination of a self replicating agent from normal melanocytes into non- melanin-producing cells; but this hypothesis was wrong and they later showed that pigment spread was due to cell migration. In 1947 Medawar accepted the chair of zoology at the University of Birmingham. He continued to work on transplantation with Medawar, and in 1951 they both accepted positions at the University College London. Together they demonstrated immune tolerance as proposed by Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Burnet and Medawar received the Nobel Prize for this work in 1960. They also worked on graft-versus-host disease. In 1951 Billingham married and had 3 children with his wife Jean Billingham. Billingham emigrated to the United States in 1957, and took a position at the Wistar Institute. In 1965 he became chair of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. The same year, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He moved to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 1971. He died in Boston aged 81, following a long illness with Parkinson's disease.

The company's licenses include those from Dodge, Ford, Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Porsche, as well as proprietary designs. In 2014, Nikko was acquired by global toy company, Toy State. In 2017, Toy State created a new arm of the Nikko brand, Nikko Air. In 2019 Nikko Toys Ltd. became the new home of the Nikko RC brand.  History  In 1958, Nikko R/C was founded by Takeshi Hattori in Japan. Nikko launched their radio-controlled vehicle line in 1966 and started producing their full manufacturing line in 1973. In 1977, Nikko expanded operations overseas, opening manufacturing plants in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and New Zealand. The Nikko R/C line contained an expansive number of vehicles that ranged from buggies, speed cars and off-road vehicles to boats, special action vehicles, and air flight. An early Nikko design was the F10 series frame buggy, a two-wheel-drive dune buggy and sold both by Nikko and RadioShack. There were many versions of the Nikko F10. It also served as the basis for the Traxxas Cat. Refined with hobby-grade electronics including an electronic speed control and a revised front end with a wider track, the Cat became Traxxas' - and the industry's - first ready-to-run hobby-grade model. In 2014, global toy company, Toy State, secured the worldwide rights to Nikko by acquiring the consolidated operations of its Japan and Hong Kong offices. Toy State also acquired Nikko Entertainment BV, the European arm of Nikko. Since Toy State's acquisition, it has added many R/C items to the Nikko line- up, such as VaporizR, Velocitrax, and Barracuda X. In 2017, Toy State created a new arm of the Nikko brand, Nikko Air. The company manufactures racing drones in partnership with the Drone Racing League (DRL). In Fall 2017, Toy State released the first Nikko Air products; Nikko Air Race Vision 220 FPV Pro, Nikko Air Elite 115 and the Nikko Air Elite 115 Race Set. In January 2019 Nikko Toys Ltd. became the new home of the Nikko RC brand after Toy State International stopped trading in September 2018. Nikko Toys Ltd. design and manufacture toys for the famous Road Rippers and Machine Maker brands as well as the Nikko RC brand. Nikko America The US distribution arm for Nikko toys and models and, as of 2006, is that country's sole distributor for Erector Sets, the longest-running brand in the US toy business. Ownership of Erector remains with British manufacturer Meccano. A subdivision of Nikko is Nikko TEC, which can be described as a special vehicles division. Currently the only TEC division product being sold is the ProClass series of cars. The series consists of F1 cars, upgradeable 1/14 scale cars, and 1/10 cars that are almost hobby quality. Older TEC division vehicles included: *Thor-type trucks: Large 1/10 4wd trucks powered by 7.2v batteries and twin 380 motors, with working headlights. Most had Toyota Hilux-based bodies. *Porsche 959 racers: 1/10 2wd road racer/rally car with working lights, two sets of tires, 7.2v power and 540 motor on a chassis that appears to be an early version of the ProClass cars. Most common is the version in black with licensed racing decals, the gold chrome version without decals is extremely rare. *Hilux/Unimog Winch: A wide series of 1/10-1/16 vehicles with working winches, detailed bodies, and 4WD, various features on different models such as working headlights, 2wd/4wd switch, two gears, horn, and even some of the above functions operated by the transmitter. *Alienator/Aero Thunderbolt: 2wd buggies based on the earlier F10 series buggies, 7.2v/540 and solidly built. The Predator was a related model but was modernized with poorer quality parts and several other disappointing changes. *F10 series Frame Buggies: Mentioned above, arguably the most used design ever in R/C. 7.2v/540, digital proportional. *Super Sprint/Dandy Dash: Highly advanced racing buggies with oil shocks, belt drive 4wd, dual differentials, and lexan bodies. The Super Sprint was the competition model with alloy shock bodies, front and rear anti- roll bars, an adjustable Torque Splitter, and other features. The Super Sprint also featured a mod motor called the UP240SE. Lastly was the Brat, a 2 part kit to upgrade the Dandy Dash and Super Sprint. The Dandy Dash and Super Sprint only needed kit 1 for conversion to a Brat, kits 1 & 2 combined to make the Brat \\"Works\\" Kit full race buggy.

Mechanics  The robot is puppeteered by a single operator in plain clothes. The transmitter is hidden inside a shoulder strapped gym bag, while the microphone is held at the mouth of the puppeteer, concealed in the hand. The robot contains a voice processor which changes the operator's voice to a high-pitched, nasal register. Since the operator is so close to the robot, Push can interact directly with guests. The robot is propelled with the transmission, wheels and tires of a custom based, Disney-themed, nasty- inspired robot. It was staffed by a local robotic entertainment company named Real Simple Ideas under contract with Disney. Disney has extended the technique and technology to Audio-Animatronic characters such as the Muppet Mobile Lab, Lucky the Dinosaur, and Wall-E.  Similar robots  Pipa encourages visitors to recycle.

He wrote books, prepared and appeared on broadcasts, and lectured around the world to governments, businesses, and organizations. Theobald questioned and criticized conventional confidence in economic growth, in technology, and in the culture of materialism - all of which he considered to be damaging to the environment while failing to provide opportunity and income for many of the world's people.\\"Robert Theobald, 70, Futurist Dies,\\" obituary, November 30, 1999, Seattle Times, Seattle, Washington.

The screenplay is written by David Elfick, Bob Ellis, Philippe Mora, and Phillip Noyce. The original music score is composed by William Motzing. This film was shot on location in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Incorporating much actual newsreel footage, the film is shot in both black and white and colour. Plot summary The plot of the movie is about newsreel cameramen and production staff who will do anything to get footage. Set between the years 1948 and 1956, when television was introduced to Australia, the film tracks the destinies of two brothers, their adventures and misadventures placed in the context of sweeping social and political changes in their native Australia as well as natural disasters. Len Maguire is constitutionally resistant to change, while his younger brother Frank Maguire welcomes any alterations in his own life and in the world around him. Events covered in the film include Robert Menzies' return as Prime Minister of Australia, the 1951 referendum to ban the Communist Party, Post-war immigration to Australia, the combatting of the rabbit plague, the Redex Reliability Trial, the 1955 Hunter Valley floods and the 1956 introduction of television in Australia.

Elfick, along with Mike Molloy and Philippe Mora had been discussing making a film about newsreel cameramen of the 1940s and 1950s who worked for such companies as Movietone and Cinesound Productions. Elfick hired Bob Ellis to write the screenplay because he had admired The Legend of King O'Malley. Ellis says he wrote the first draft with Howard Rubie, who was a former cameraman for Cinesound and thought he was going to direct it. Anne Brooksbank later contributed to the script.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p207-211 Noyce was then hired as director and worked with Ellis. Ellis fell out with Noyce and demanded his name be taken off the credits. Ellis: > There was some nonsense about how long it was; we'd set it out, one short > scene per page and it finally came out about 300 pages or so but, in fact, > it was maybe two and a quarter hours long, which wasn't too bad then or now > for something that covered 10 years. But a legend started about how huge it > was. When I saw it, I was appalled. I could only see what was missing and > abruptly took my name off it. Then when it won all the prizes, I sort of > shamefacedly put my name back on it. It was a quite painful experience and I > think a very good film, but not as good a film as might have been made.

That was removed.Interview with Bob Ellis, 13 August 1996 > accessed 14 October 2012 Funding was provided by the Australian Film Commission and the New South Wales Film Corporation.Ian Stocks, \\"Newsfront\\", Cinema Papers, April 1997 p20-25, 46 Release The film was shown at Cannes in 1978 and proved popular. The New South Wales Film Corporation insisted seven minutes of the movie be cut out for overseas release. Newsfront was ultimately released on DVD in 2016. The DVD release of Newsfront brings one of Australia's historically lauded films to a worldwide audience. The film's production history is explored in a DVD commentary featuring members of the film's cast and crew. DVD extras include \\"The Last Newsreel\\", Australian Newsreel No. 2032 directed by Karen Borger in 1990. Other extensive DVD-ROM study materials include an in-depth production history, an archive of reviews, and a detailed account of Newsfront's DVD restoration. Box office Newsfront grossed $1,576,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $6,713,760 in 2009 dollars. David Elfick estimated the film recovered its costs two years after opening in Australia.

The school is a member of the NCAA's Division I and the Big East Conference. The university's football team plays at Rentschler Field, and the men's and women's basketball teams play on-campus at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and off- campus at the XL Center.  History   Nickname  The university's teams are nicknamed \\"Huskies\\", a name adopted following a student poll in The Connecticut Campus in 1934 after the school's name changed from Connecticut Agricultural College to Connecticut State College in 1933; before then, the teams were referred to as the Aggies. Although there is a homophonic relationship between \\"UConn\\" and the Yukon, where Huskies are native, the \\"Huskies\\" nickname predates the school's 1939 name change to the University of Connecticut; the first recorded use of \\"UConn\\" (as \\"U-Conn\\", both separately and with \\"Huskies\\") was later in 1939. The university and its athletics officially rebranded to UConn in the spring of 2013. UConn's women's teams are not known as the \\"Lady Huskies\\", but simply as \\"UConn Huskies\\", the same as the men's teams.  Conference history  UConn's teams participate in the NCAA's Division I and in the Big East Conference for all sports except football and men's and women's ice hockey. UConn's football team participates in the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Huskies have been a member of The American from its founding in 1979 as the original Big East Conference until 2020. The club alpine skiing team competes in the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association because of a stricter limit on NCAA skiing programs. In 2020, UConn joined the \\"new\\" Big East, reuniting it with many of the schools against which it played for over three decades in the original Big East. The football team will compete as an FBS independent team.

O. Christian Field. In 2010, the UConn baseball team set a program record for wins in a season with 48. This eclipsed the previous mark of 39. The team played as the No. 2 seed alongside No. 1 Florida State (ACC), No. 3 Oregon (Pac-10), and No. 4 Central Connecticut State (NEC). The Huskies placed third in the regional with a 1–2 and played in front of 5,684 fans in their Friday opener against Oregon. The team finished the season ranked 22nd in the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association poll, 23rd in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll and 28th in the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper poll. In the summer of 2010, Huskies George Springer and Matt Barnes were named to the Collegiate USA National Team. Also, four players were named to their respective collegiate summer league All-Star teams- John Sulzicki of the Butler BlueSox (Prospect League), Greg Nappo of the Haymarket Senators (Valley Baseball League), Billy Ferriter of the North Fork Ospreys (Hamptons Collegiate Baseball), and Michael Zaccardo of the Riverhead Tomcats (Hamptons Collegiate Baseball). In 2011, UConn baseball was ranked 1st in the Big East Conference preseason poll. George Springer and Matt Barnes were named preseason Big East Player and Pitcher of the Year, respectively. The team advanced to the first Super Regional in program history, spoiling a potential Super Regional derby by defeating ACC powerhouse Clemson at Doug Kingsmore Stadium in winning the Clemson regional. In the Super Regional, the chances of a Palmetto Double Sweep were ended by eventual champion South Carolina. In 2013, UConn baseball became the first 8 seed to win the Big East Tournament. UConn knocked off the 1 seed Louisville 3–2 in ten innings in the opening game, came back from a 7–0 deficit to beat South Florida 8–7, beat Rutgers 2–1 in the semifinals, and beat Notre Dame 8–1 for the championship.  Men's basketball  UConn men's basketball was once a regional power, winning 18 Yankee Conference championships between 1947 and 1975, including 12 by Hugh Greer. In 1979, UConn was one of the seven founding schools of the American Athletic Conference (then known as the Big East Conference), which was originally created to focus on basketball, and the last remaining school that signed the charter to remain following the 2013 split. In the early days of the Big East, UConn struggled behind national powers Georgetown and Syracuse. Prior to the 1986–87 season UConn hired Jim Calhoun to be the program's new head coach, but the Huskies difficulties continued and they finished the season with a record of 9–19, their fifth straight losing season. But in 1988, the team showed significant improvement and gained a berth in the NIT. UConn went on a run in the tournament and defeated Ohio State, 72–67, at Madison Square Garden to win the NIT, the school's first national basketball title. Exterior view of Gampel Pavilion The 1990 \\"Dream Season\\" would bring UConn basketball to the national stage. Led by Chris Smith, Nadav Henefeld and Tate George, UConn went from unranked in the preseason to winning the Big East regular season and tournament championships, both for the first time. 1990 also marked the opening of Gampel Pavilion, the program's new on-campus home. In the NCAA Tournament the Huskies garnered a No. 1 seed in the East Region, but trailed Clemson, 70–69, with 1 second remaining in the Sweet 16. Scott Burrell's full-court pass found Tate George on the far baseline. George spun, fired, and hit a buzzer-beater that is known in Connecticut simply as \\"The Shot\\". They would be eliminated on a buzzer-beater 2 days later by Duke, losing in overtime, 79–78. UConn rose as a national program throughout the 1990s, winning five more Big East Regular Season and three more Big East Tournament Championships, but the Final Four still eluded Calhoun and the program until the 1999 NCAA Tournament. The Huskies were the top seed in the West region and a win over Gonzaga in the regional finals sent UConn to Tropicana Field in Tampa Bay for the Final Four. They defeated Ohio State, 64–58, in the semi-final to face off against Duke in the final. Despite having been ranked No. 1 for half of the year, the Huskies entered the national championship game as 9-point underdogs. The game was tight throughout, and when the final buzzer sounded, UConn had defeated Duke, 77–74. The 1999 national championship would not be the last. In 2004, the Huskies returned to the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas. Once again, they faced Duke, this time in the National Semifinal, and used a late run to beat the Blue Devils, 79–78. Two nights later, led by Ben Gordon and Emeka Okafor, UConn beat Georgia Tech, 82–73, to win the championship. In 2006, UConn became the third school ever to have four players drafted in Round One of the NBA Draft, and the first school ever to have five players selected in the two-round draft. In the first round, Rudy Gay, Hilton Armstrong, Marcus Williams and Josh Boone were selected. In the second round, Denham Brown was selected. Rashad Anderson also entered the NBA draft and has played for several European, Middle Eastern and NBA-D League teams since then. In the 2009 NCAA Tournament, UConn was awarded the No. 1 seed in the West. Led by AJ Price, Hasheem Thabeet and Jeff Adrien, the Huskies reached the Final Four by defeating No. 16 seed Chattanooga in the 1st round, No. 9 seed Texas A&M; in the 2nd round, No. 5 seed Purdue in the Sweet 16 and No. 3 seed Missouri in the Elite Eight. This marked the third time in the program's history to reach the Final Four. In the two other occurrences, UConn also came out of the West region and won the national championship on both occasions. Connecticut returned to the NCAA tournament in 2011 after an off year. Under the leadership of Kemba Walker Uconn won five consecutive games in five nights to earn the Big East Tournament championship in New York City. They headed to the NCAA as a No. 3 seed, and completed one of the most improbable runs to the Championship game defeating Butler to earn their third National championship in a 53–41 defensive affair in Houston, Texas. In 2014 led by American Athletic Conference Player of the Year Shabazz Napier, UConn become the first #7 seed to win the NCAA Championship, getting past No. 1 seed Florida, No. 2 seed Villanova, No. 3 seed Iowa State, and No. 4 seed Michigan State, before defeating the Kentucky Wildcats, 60–54, in the championship game in Arlington, Texas.  Women's basketball  2010 NCAA National Champions Connecticut Huskies at the White House Strong alumni, student, and fan support for UConn's men's basketball teams helped the Huskies' women's basketball program attract Geno Auriemma as head coach. Under the tutelage of Auriemma, UConn has become one of the few schools that consistently competes for the national title in women's basketball. The Huskies were also part of one of the fiercest rivalries in all of women's college sports. In the rivalry between UConn and the University of Tennessee, there was no love lost between Auriemma and deceased Tennessee coach Pat Summitt. The two schools have faced each other seven times in the NCAA Tournament, and four times in the NCAA Championship Game. UConn leads 5–2 in those games including a 4–0 record in the finals. UConn leads the all-time series 13–8. Summitt ended the regular season series in the summer of 2007. It is unknown why the series was ended, but media outlets reported that Tennessee reported to the NCAA that UConn committed minor recruiting infractions with the recruitment of Maya Moore which included a tour of ESPN while Moore was a junior in high school. Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti, Svetlana Abrosimova, Shea Ralph, Nykesha Sales, Kelly Schumacher, Swin Cash, Kara Wolters, Tamika Williams, Diana Taurasi, Asjha Jones, Sue Bird, Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Jessica Moore, Ashley Battle, Ketia Swanier, Charde Houston, Tina Charles, Kalana Greene, Renee Montgomery, Maya Moore, Bria Hartley, Stefanie Dolson, Napheesa Collier, and Katie Lou Samuelson are among the women's professional basketball players or WNBA draftees who attended UConn. Sue Bird, on offense In 2002, UConn became the only school ever to have four women drafted among the top 10 of the first round of the 2002 WNBA Draft, with National Player of the Year Sue Bird drafted 1st, Swin Cash drafted 2nd, Asjha Jones drafted 4th, and Tamika Williams Raymond drafted 6th. The 5th starter on the UConn 2002 NCAA championship team was future No. 1 WNBA draft choice and future two-time National Player of the Year Diana Taurasi. A total of 11 UConn alumnae play in the WNBA in the 2010 season. In 2004, UConn became the second school ever, and the first in Division I, to win the men's NCAA National Championship and the women's basketball title in the same season and did it again in 2014. It was also the first school to ever have both teams ranked number 1 in the nation at the same time (during the 1994–95 season), and has also spent the most weeks by far with both teams holding the number one spot, with Duke being the only other team ever to achieve the feat, for a short period during the 2003–04 season. In 2008, freshman Maya Moore made history by being named Big East Player of the Year, the first time a freshman was so honored in either men's or women's basketball. She was named Big East Player of the Year again in 2009. UConn women entered the 2008–09 season ranked No. 1 in all national polls. They finished the season ranked as No. 1 as well, winning the national championship, finishing the season with a perfect 39–0 record, while winning every game by 10 points or more. At the end of the year, Maya Moore swept the National Player of the Year honors, receiving the Wooden, Wade and Naismith Awards, and she, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles were named to various All- America teams. Coach Geno Auriemma received his record sixth recognition as the National Coach of the Year. UConn women entered the 2009–10 season ranked No. 1 in all the national polls, and remained ranked No. 1 every week for the entire season. They finished the season as the first back-to-back undefeated National Champions, beating No. 2 Stanford at the San Antonio Alamodome. UConn also set the national consecutive victory record at 78 when it won its seventh National Championship at the Alamodome.UConn vs. perfect teams of the past, ESPN.com UConn women entered the 2010–11 season ranked No. 1 in all the national polls. On December 19, 2010, the UConn Huskies beat No. 10 ranked Ohio State at Madison Square Garden's annual Maggie Dixon Classic to tie the NCAA consecutive win streak to 88 games, and on December 21, 2010 they beat No. 20 ranked Florida State at the XL Center in Hartford to set a new NCAA consecutive win record at 89 games, the streak ended at 90 on December 30, 2010 with a 71–59 loss at Stanford. UConn is not only a pipeline to both the NBA and the WNBA, but to coaching ranks throughout the sport of basketball. UConn alumnae in the coaching ranks include head coaches Jennifer Rizzotti at the University of Hartford, Jamelle Elliott at the University of Cincinnati, Tonya Cardoza at Temple University, and Carla Berube at Princeton University and assistant coaches Shea Ralph at UConn, Stacy Hansmeyer at the University of Oklahoma, Morgan Valley at the University of Washington and Willnett Crockett at Temple. Mel Thomas is the Director of Basketball Operations at Florida Gulf Coast University. Tamika Williams is head coach of India's national women's team, and a former assistant coach at Ohio State University and the University of Kansas. Six American female basketball players have attained the Triple Crown \\"plus one\\" — an NCAA national title, a WNBA title, a World Cup gold medal, and an Olympic gold medal. Of those six, four are UConn alumnae: Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Kara Wolters and Diana Taurasi.  Football  UConn football started in 1896. The program's progression lead to an undefeated season in 1924. Four players who attended UConn that year went on to play in the NFL, with one winning a world title with the Providence Steam Rollers in 1928. Two played for the Hartford Blues alongside the Four Horsemen, former members of 1924 national champions, the University of Notre Dame. UConn football reached Division I-A status in 2000, was included in official Division I-A statistics for the first time in 2002, and became a full Big East member in 2004. UConn has been recognized as having the fastest progression out of I-AA in NCAA history, as it was invited into a BCS conference only two years after becoming a full I-A member, was bowl-eligible in its first season in I-A, and was invited to a bowl game in its first season as a conference member. The Huskies defeated the University of Toledo in the 2004 Motor City Bowl by a score of 39–10, with quarterback Dan Orlovsky being named Most Valuable Player. In 2003, the team was also honored for being one of only 7 schools in the U.S. to graduate 80% or better of its members; it was the only public school on the list. In 2007, the Huskies had their best year as they went 9–3, finished 7–0 at home and earned a berth in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl, where they were defeated by Wake Forest, 24–10. In 2008, the Huskies finished 7–5 and defeated Buffalo in the 2009 International Bowl in Toronto. During the 2009–2010 football season, cornerback Jasper Howard was stabbed to death on campus after celebrating the win early that day against the Louisville Cardinals. UConn honored Jasper for the remainder of 2009 and 2010, which would have been his Senior year. The Huskies would defeat SEC opponent South Carolina in the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl.

As part of the move from Atlantic Hockey to Hockey East, the university added 18 scholarships for the men's ice hockey team and additional scholarships to existing women's sports programs to meet Title IX gender equity requirements. The university was also investigating options to build a new, larger ice arena on-campus as its then-current venue, the Freitas Ice Forum, has a seating capacity of only 2,000 and was too small for the jump up to Hockey East. Since then, UConn has used the XL Center, a former NHL venue in downtown Hartford, as its primary men's home. While the arena has a hockey capacity of 15,635, UConn has capped ticket sales at 8,089. Select home games have also been played at the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport. The Freitas Ice Forum now hosts games only for the women's hockey team.

The 2000 team was known for its stellar depth on the bench including the likes of Garrett Grinsfelder, Michael Rueda, and Ryan Brown, who exuded the team's \\"never say die\\" attitude. The men's team won back to back Big East championships in (2004 and 2005). As of 2011 UConn led the nation in total attendance in eight of the preceding 12 seasons. No program can match it for having drawn better on-campus support for more than 30 years. In the early 1980s, before the NCAA kept soccer attendance records and before Morrone Stadium was downsized, the Huskies drew huge crowds. Total attendance in 1983 was 64,535—a record that held until 2010. Major League Soccer players Maurizio Rocha, Chris Gbandi, Damani Ralph, Bobby Rhine, Julius James, Shavar Thomas, O'Brian White, Kwame Watson-Siriboe, Toni Ståhl, Cyle Larin, and Chukwudi Chijindu each attended UConn.

He started his professional club career in Italy with Varese in 1966, helping the club to achieve promotion to Serie A in his first season with the side; after a promising debut campaign in the Italian top-flight the following season, he joined Juventus in 1968, where he enjoyed a highly successful and prolific eight–year stint, winning three Serie A titles. He then spent two seasons with Internazionale, where he won the Coppa Italia in 1978, before moving to Ascoli, where he remained for three seasons. He finally retired in 1982, after a single season with Swiss club Lugano. At international level, Anastasi represented Italy on 25 occasions between 1968 and 1975, scoring eight goals. He made his senior international debut at UEFA Euro 1968 on home soil, and is widely known for later scoring in the final victory over Yugoslavia, which gave Italy their first ever European Championship title. He later also took part at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. After retiring, he worked as a pundit. He died on 17 January 2020, from ALS. Club career Anastasi was born in Catania, Sicily. During his career (1964–1982) he played for Massiminiana, Varese, Juventus, Internazionale and Ascoli. In Serie A, he played 338 matches and scored 105 goals (For Juventus, he played 205 games and scored 78 goals). Although he never won the Serie A Top Goalscorer award, he was the third highest goalscorer in the League on three occasions, during the 1968–69, 1969–70 and 1973–74 seasons. He made his professional Debut with Missiminiana di Catania in Serie D, showing promising goalscoring prowess during the 1965–66 season, in which he scored 18 goals. He was subsequently purchased by Varese in Serie B, the team with which he gained promotion to Serie A, scoring 6 goals in 37 matches, and making his Serie A debut on 24 September 1967, against Fiorentina, at the age of nineteen. During his first season in Serie A, he scored an impressive 11 goals, 3 of which were scored in Varese's shocking 5–0 win over Juventus on 4 February 1968, a performance which enabled him to be called up to the Italian national side. no. 9) in 1975, as captain of Juventus, with Ternana captain Fernando Benatti. Due to his precocious performances, he was purchased by Juventus in 1968 for a world record of 650 million Lire at the time, and with the Turin club, he won three Serie A titles, also helping the club to the final of the last edition of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, in 1971, a tournament in which he was top scorer, with 10 goals. Juventus were defeated by Leeds in the final, however. In 1974, Anastasi was named the club's captain. He currently holds the record for the most goals in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by a Juventus player (12), as well as the all-time record for goals in the Coppa Italia by a Juventus player (30). Alongside Roberto Baggio, he is the joint tenth highest goal-scorer for Juventus in Serie A, with 78 goals, the joint fourth all-time Juventus goalscorer in European competitions, and the joint fifth all-time Juventus goalscorer in International competitions, with 22 goals. He is also the seventh-highest all-time goalscorer for the club in all competitions. With Juventus, he was also the top-scorer of the 1974–75 edition of the Coppa Italia, in which Juventus reached the second round, finishing second in their group, and missing the final by a single point. Anastasi also reached the final of the 1972–73 European Cup with Juventus, where they were defeated 1–0 by Ajax. In total, he scored 130 goals for Juventus, in 303 appearances. In 1976, Anastasi began to find less space within the first team Juventus squad, partially due to his disagreements with manager Carlo Parola, and he transferred to Inter in exchange for Roberto Boninsegna. With Inter, Anastasi won the 1977–78 Coppa Italia, making a substitute appearance in the final against Napoli, although his Inter performances were not as consistent or prolific as those with Juventus. As a result, he was sold to Ascoli in 1978, and he remained at the club for three more Serie A seasons, scoring 9 goals. In December 1979, he scored his 100th goal in Serie A in a 3–2 win over his former club, Juventus. He spent his final year playing for FC Lugano in the Swiss League, during the 1981–82 season, before retiring. International career Marić and scores the definitive goal in Italy's 3–1 friendly victory against Yugolavia, in Turin, on 20 September 1972. With the Italy national football team, he was a member of the squad that won the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship on home soil, a tournament during which he made his international debut during the first leg of the final against Yugoslavia at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on 8 June, which ended in a 1–1 draw. In the final replay against the same opponent two days later, he also scored his first international goal, the second goal in Italy's 2–0 victory, with a right- footed volley from just outside the area. He was initially set to take part in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico with Italy, but he was unable to participate due to injury. In his place, and that of midfielder Giovanni Lodetti, two strikers were called up by manager Ferruccio Valcareggi: Roberto Boninsegna and Pierino Prati, as Italy went on to reach the final. Anastasi also participated at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, scoring one goal in the team's 3–1 victory against Haiti in the first round, although Italy failed to advance from their group. In total, he played 25 international matches for Italy between 1968 and 1975, scoring 8 goals. Style of play Anastasi is regarded as one of the best Italian strikers of his generation, as he was a fast, physical, hard-working, reliable, and agile forward, with good reactions. He was also a prolific, intelligent, instinctive, and opportunistic goalscorer, who was capable of making attacking runs to lose his markers and advance into more effective goalscoring positions, courtesy of his pace, power, movement off the ball, and positional sense inside the penalty area. A diminutive player with a sturdy build, Anastasi usually played as a striker in the centre-forward position, like his idol, John Charles; however, he had a rather modern and unorthodox interpretation of this role, and did not function as a traditional number nine, who mainly operated inside the box. Indeed, in this role, although he was capable of playing with his back to goal, using his strength to hold up the ball and lay it off for teammates, he was also known for his mobility and link-up play, as well as his ability to make quick exchanges with his teammates, and create chances or provide assists for other players, which saw him essentially act as more of an attacking midfielder at times. He also stood out for his dedication, bravery, fighting spirit, and generous team-play, as well as his unpredictable movement and high defensive work-rate off the ball, including his tendency to drift out wide, press opponents, or even track back into midfield in order to help win back possession. As such, he has been described as what as is known in Italian football jargon as a centravanti di manovra (\\"manouvering centre-forward,\\" i.e. a centre-forward who participates in the build-up of attacking plays), a role which has retroactively been likened to a precursor of the \\"false 9\\" role in modern football. Despite not having the best first touch, or being the most naturally creative, tactical, or skilful player, he was a talented player and a fast sprinter, who possessed excellent acceleration and anticipation, as well as good dribbling skills with either foot, which led the Italian journalist Cesare Lanza to compare him to Luigi Meroni; as such, he also played on the right wing on occasion, due to his flair, solid technique, and crossing ability, and he even had a tendency to drift onto the left flank when he was deployed as an out-and-out striker in order to create chances for his teammates. Nicknamed \\"il Pelé bianco\\" (\\"the white Pelé,\\" in Italian) by the Juventus fans, Anastasi was extremely popular with his club's fanbase, and was known in particular for his acrobatic ability in the air, as well as for having a penchant for scoring spectacular goals with strikes of extreme technical difficulty, including from volleys and bicycle kicks. He was also an excellent finisher with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed, and was capable of scoring with powerful shots while on the run. In addition to his playing ability, as a Sicilian who had success Juventus, Anastasi – as well as several of his other southern–Italian club teammates – also became a social symbol for many other southern Italian immigrants in a time of great social divide between the northern and the southern regions of the country; in particular, he became an icon for factory-workers who had moved from the South of Italy to Turin in order to find work with Fiat. His other nicknames were \\"Petruzzo\\" and \\"Petru 'u turcu\\" (\\"Peter the Turk,\\" in the Sicilian dialect), due to the dark, olive-colour of his complexion whenever he was tanned. Off the pitch, however, he did at times draw criticism in the media for his lack of discipline. After retirement After retiring from professional football, Anastasi worked briefly as a youth coach, and later served as a football pundit for the Italian television network 7 Gold and SKY. Personal life Anastasi was married to Anna; together, they had two sons: Silvano and Gianluca. He met his wife during his time with Varese, when he first began his professional career. After his retirement, he returned to the town, where he remained until his death. Death Anastasi died in Varese on 17 January 2020, at the age of 71, after a long battle with ALS, which had afflicted him since 2018. During the last three years of his life, medical examinations also found that he had an intestinal tumour, which was successfully removed through an operation.

So far, three modes have been conceptualized. Mode 1 production of knowledge is knowledge production motivated by scientific knowledge alone (basic research) which is not primarily concerned by the applicability of its findings. Mode 1 is founded on a conceptualization of science as separated into discrete disciplines (e.g., a biologist does not bother about chemistry). Mode 2 was coined in 1994 in juxtaposition to Mode 1 by Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow. In Mode 2, multidisciplinary teams are brought together for short periods of time to work on specific problems in the real world for knowledge production (applied research) in the knowledge society. Mode 2 can be explained by the way research funds are distributed among scientists and how scientists focus on obtaining these funds in terms of five basic features: knowledge produced in the context of application; transdisciplinarity; heterogeneity and organizational diversity; social accountability and reflexivity; and quality control. Subsequently, Carayannis and Campbell described a Mode 3 knowledge in 2006.  Development of the concept  Gibbons and colleagues argued that a new form of knowledge production began emerging in the mid-20th century that was context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. It involved multidisciplinary teams that worked together for short periods of time on specific problems in the real world. Gibbons and his colleagues labelled this \\"Mode 2\\" knowledge production. He and his colleagues distinguished this from traditional research, labelled 'Mode 1', which is academic, investigator-initiated and discipline-based knowledge production. In support, Limoges wrote, \\"We now speak of 'context-driven' research, meaning 'research carried out in a context of application, arising from the very work of problem solving and not governed by the paradigms of traditional disciplines of knowledge.\\" John Ziman drew a similar distinction between academic science and post-academic science, and in 2001 Helga Nowotny, Peter Scott and Michael Gibbons extended their analysis to the implications of Mode 2 knowledge production for society.  Conceptual differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge  In terms of the aim of research, Mode 1 is characterized by theory building and testing within a discipline towards the aim of universal knowledge, while Mode 2 is characterized by knowledge produced for application. In the type of knowledge acquired, Mode 1 knowledge is universal law, primarily cognitive, while Mode 2 knowledge is particular and situational, and in Mode 1 in data is context free but in Mode 2 contextually embedded. In Mode 1, the knowledge is validated by logic and measurement, together with consistency of prediction and control, while in Mode 2 knowledge is validated by experiential, collaborative, and transdisciplinary processes. In Mode 1, the researcher's role is to be a detached, neutral observer, while in Mode 2 the researcher is a socially accountable, immersed and reflexive actor or change agent. Mode 3 Carayannis and Campbell describe a Mode 3 knowledge, which emphasizes the coexistence and co-development of diverse knowledge and innovation modes, at the individual (micro or local), structural and organizational (meso or institutional), and systemic (macro or global) levels. It describes mutual interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge via concepts such as, at the micro level, creative milieus and entrepreneurs and employees, at the meso level, knowledge clusters, innovation networks, entrepreneurial universities, and academic firms, and at the macro level, the quadruple and quintuple innovation helix framework, the \\"democracy of knowledge\\" (knowledge within a democratic system), and \\"democratic capitalism\\" (capitalism within a democratic system). Reception While the theory of knowledge production modes and especially the notion of Mode 2 knowledge production have attracted considerable interest, the theory has not been universally accepted in the terms put forth by Gibbons and colleagues. Scholars in science policy studies have pointed to three types of problems with the concept of Mode 2: its empirical validity, its conceptual strength, and its political value. Concerning the empirical validity of the Mode 2 claims, Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff argue that: Thus, Mode 1 is essentially a theoretical construct, not a description of actual scientific research, as the boundaries between different disciplines and \\"basic\\" and \\"applied research\\" have always been blurred. In the same article, Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff use the notion of the triple helix of the nation state (government), academia (university) and industry to explain innovation, the development of new technology and knowledge transfer. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff argue, \\"The Triple Helix overlay provides a model at the level of social structure for the explanation of Mode 2 as an historically emerging structure for the production of scientific knowledge, and its relation to Mode 1.\\" Steve Fuller similarly criticized the \\"modists\\" view of the history of science because they wrongly give the impression that Mode 1 dates back to seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution whereas Mode 2 is traced to the end of either World War II or the Cold War, whereas in fact the two modes were institutionalized only within a generation of each other (the third and the fourth quarters of the nineteenth century, respectively). Fuller claims that the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Germany, jointly funded by the state, the industry and the universities, predated today's \\"triple helix\\" institutions by an entire century. Regarding the conceptual strength of Mode 2, it has been argued that the coherence of its five features is questionable, as there might be a lot of multi-disciplinary, application oriented research that does not show organizational diversity or novel types of quality control. Moreover, Mode 2 lends itself to a normative reading, and authors have criticized the way Gibbons and his co-authors seem to blend descriptive and normative elements. According to Godin, the Mode 2 approach is more a political ideology than a descriptive theory. Similarly, Shinn complains: \\"Instead of theory or data, the New Production of Knowledge—both book and concept—seems tinged with political commitment\\". Applications to academic research One of the fields which has implemented mode-based knowledge production research most enthusiastically is that of management and organization studies. MacLean, MacIntosh and Grant offer a review of Mode 2 management research, while MacIntosh, Bonnet, and Eikeland review the ways in which Mode 2-influenced management research has an impact on the lives of those working in organizations; Mode 2's implications have also been considered in terms of business processes The role of the different knowledge production modes has been considered in diverse fields, for example evidence-based policy making, fisheries, entrepreneurship and innovation, medical research, science diplomacy, sustainability science, and working life research.

The first field is blue and shows a crowned Madonna, holding a sceptre and the baby Jesus, standing on a silver crescent moon. This entire image is enveloped by a golden aureola. The second field shows a black Silesian eagle, on a gold background, wings outstretched. Across its chest we see a silver crescent moon, and a cross on it. The third field is red, on it a black head of a bull facing forward. The fourth field is blue, on it a raven sits on a golden branch with three knots. The crow is facing inward. Historical description of the symbols on this coat of arms: 1st quadrant: The Madonna is the patroness of the oldest church of Glogow, which goes back even to the time of the Piasts. The image of the Madonna appears on city stamps from Glogow even as early as 1326. 2nd: The black crownless eagle is the coat of arms of the Silesian Piasts. The eagle was a universal symbol and very popular, since its meaning encapsulated strength, courage, wisdom and fairness. 3rd: The black head of bull. This motif was often seen on coins struck in the Glogow mint. The head of the bull was from the coat of arms of the royal elders of the noble Glogow family of Hans von Loos, who was also the overseer of the city mint. 4th: The black raven. The image of the crow appear on the city's seal on 17 March 1490. A crow sitting on a silver branch is the coat of arms of the Korwins, who ruled the Duchy of Glogów. In the 15th century, they donated their crest to the city.

He is a founder of The Sex Party, a sex-positive movement political party of which he was party leader from 2005 until 2012. Sex-positive activism In 2002, Ince opened The Art of Loving, a sex shop in Vancouver, Canada. It sells art, instructional books and videos and pleasure products. It also produces almost one hundred sexual seminars a year, some led by Ince. He produced an erotic event at The Art of Loving that garnered international media attention in 2003. In 2005 Ince and many other erotic arts activists founded The Sex Party, the world’s first officially registered sex-positive political party. Ince was party leader from 2005 until 2012. He and others ran as candidates in two provincial general elections in 2005 and 2009. In 2010 Ince and Marke Brunke founded VancouverMensGroups.org, a website, to facilitate the formation of groups of men who are interested in connecting at a deeper level than usually occurs at social events. Legal career Ince began practicing law in the early 1980s focusing on environmental issues but gradually moved to the human rights field, specializing in sexual issues. He represented performers and individual citizens fighting sexual censorship laws. One of his cases, Luscher v. Canada,Luscher v. Deputy Minister, Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise, [1985] 1 F.C. 85; was successful in striking down as unconstitutional a federal law that had prohibited sexual material from entering Canada for over one hundred years. He represented the Canadian polyamory community in the 2011 constitutional reference case concerning Canada’s polygamy laws. Books Ince's first two books concerned the then emerging field of environmental law. Both Environmental Law and Land Use Law were first published by the West Coast Environmental Law Association and then by the legal publisher Butterworths. Ince’s third title, Sea Kayaking Canada’s West Coast was co-authored with Hedi Kottner. It was in print for 20 years and was the first paddling guide to the sport of ocean kayaking. Ince wrote The BC Guide to Buying Rural and Recreational Property in 1993. It is the only detailed guide to the process of acquiring property outside cities in British Columbia. Ince worked on and off for almost twenty years researching his 2003 publication The Politics of Lust, (Prometheus Books) which argues that irrational sexual fear is pervasive in our culture, that it is largely unrecognized, and that it affects our political orientation. His book, Joyshift: the journey to primal happiness was published in September 2015. It argues that the ingredients for happiness were genetically set in the hunter- gatherer era, and describes a daily practice to make use of these \\"primal nutrients of happiness\\" in modern-day life.

In some cases of vegetable and food storage, it was associated with pathogenicity (soft rot, slime and unpleasant odor). L. mesenteroides is approximately 0.5-0.7 µm in diameter and has a length of 0.7-1.2 µm, producing small grayish colonies that are typically less than 1.0 mm in diameter. It is facultatively anaerobic, Gram- positive, non-motile, non-sporogenous, and spherical. It often forms lenticular coccoid cells in pairs and chains, however, it can occasionally forms short rods with rounded ends in long chains, as its shape can differ depending on what media the species is grown on. L. mesenteroides grows best at 30°C, but can survive in temperatures ranging from 10°C to 30°C. Its optimum pH is 5.5, but can still show growth in pH of 4.5-7.0.  Microbiological characteristics  L. mesenteroides is an obligate heterolactic fermentative lactic acid bacterium (LAB) that is mostly used in industrial dairy fermentation, playing various roles, such as production of dextran, gas, and flavor compounds. It is approximately 0.5-0.7 µm by 0.7-1.2 µm, and produces small grayish colonies that are usually less than 1.0 mm in diameter. L. mesenteroides is a facultative anaerobe and will undergo heterolactic fermentation under microaerophilic conditions. Taking this into consideration, it is important to note that L. mesenteroides utilizes sugar glucose as its primary source of metabolism, also well as other sugars such as sucrose and fructose. Then, it creates ethanol, lactate, and CO2 as products of fermentation. When grown in sucrose solution, it converts the sugar to dextrans having mostly alpha 1,6 linkages, but 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4 linkages are also present.  Environment  L. mesenteroides is typically found on the skin of a large variety of fleshy fruits and vegetables, and can be cultured using MRS agar, tomato juice agar, MRS broth, and skim milk. These common medias are not ideal for growth and specialized medias are needed to grow to a high cell density. This microbe is commonly used for souring vegetables like cucumbers and cabbage, producing fermented foods such as kim chi, sauerkraut, and pickles. The bacteria is included in dairy starter cultures since they are able to produce metabolites needed for dairy production. These metabolites include diacetyl and CO₂ from citric acid. Diacetyl is important for dairy because it is the main source of aroma and flavor in many different dairy products, like buttermilk, butter, and different cheeses. The production of CO₂ is important for the eye formation in many cheeses such as Havarti. Specialized media is commonly used for industrial growth because components in standard medias like MRS contain meat extract and peptone that is not Kosher or halal which is needed for many dairy and vegetable products. L. mesenteroides does best in temperatures ranging between 10°C to 30°C, but has an optimum temperature of 30°C. Additionally, it can survive in a pH range of 4.5-7.0, with an optimum of 5.5-6.5. L. mesenteroides also has a doubling time of 0.6 h−1 under aerobic conditions.  Genetics  The genome of L. mesenteroides has been successfully mapped, having an average genome size of 1.90138 Mbp and 1762 protein genes, with a G+C content of 37.8%. L. mesenteroides is from the phylum Firmicutes, and is a member of the lactic bacteria family. This is important as it has the ability to produce lactic acid which lowers the pH of the surrounding environment and, in turn, inhibits other competing food spoilage organism's growth as they cannot tolerate the acidic environment.  Health risks  Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides has been found to show pathogenic characteristics in rare cases. The first case of this infecting a human was in 1985. A more recent outbreak in a hospital in 2004 had 48 cases where it was found that penicillin and gentamicin could be used as antimicrobial treatment. Samples of the bacteria were isolated in both the patient's blood and urine.  Taxonomy  L. mesenteroides is divided into several subspecies. : L. m. subsp. cremoris (Knudsen and Sørensen 1929) Garvie 1983 : L. m. subsp. dextranicum (Beijerinck 1912) Garvie 1983 : L. m. subsp. mesenteroides (Tsenkovskii 1878) Garvie 1983 : L. m. subsp. suionicum Gu et al. 2012  Subspecies characteristics   Subsp. Mesenteroides:  This strain can grow in NaCl up to 3.0% and some strains up to 6.5% and optimum temperature of 20 and 30℃. It is also been found that when growth occurs in milk with supplemental yeast extract and glucose, enough acid is produced to curdle milk. Some, but not all strains can ferment citrate. Different strains of Subsp. Mesenteroides tested also differ by their need for riboflavin, pyridoxal and folic acid, these need to be tested to determine a starting point for the media. Tween 80, uracil and combinations of uracil, adenine, and xanthine are not required for growth. Subsp. Mesenteroides also require glutamic acid and valine.  Subsp. Cremoris:  This strain grows best between 18 and 25℃.This strain can ferment citrate into acetoin and diacetyl. Most strains of this subspecies cannot ferment sucrose. Of the three subspecies, this ferments the least kinds of carbohydrates. All strains can ferment glucose and lactose; galactose and maltose is strain specific. This strain requires more nutrients, riboflavin, pyridoxal, folic acid, uracil and a combination of uracil, adenine, and xanthine are required.  Subsp. Dextranicum:  This strain is similar to Subsp.

Its original teachers included Ellen Dorfman, Brian Taylor, and David Clyne who all came from Deer Park Senior Public school in a program called Spectrum. It was the first alternative school for grade 7 and 8 students. The school was proposed in 1978 but was strongly opposed by the Toronto Area 6 superintendent. Due to intense parental lobbying of the TDSB the school was later created. Its original ethos was inspired by schools such as the Summerhill school and was taught in a democratic fashion. The program focused on highly motivated students who wished to work independently. Original goals of the school included: -Small group instruction -Individualized goal-setting and evaluation -Guest speakers, field trips and community projects -Art, music and art exhibits -Mock Parliament and simulations -Literary and arts magazine -Community Fund raising Originally sharing the building with Eglinton PS the school moved to Davisville Public School at 43 Millwood Rd, Toronto in 2011, and as such the school is directed by the same principal. Its current alternative status arises largely from the small and intimate class sizes, which are represented by about 30 students per the two grades. Although Spectrum Alternative is a public school within the TDSB, prospective students must undergo an application process to be admitted. Spectrum Four teachers deliver the curriculum, while encouraging close relationships among students, and between students and teachers. Subjects are delivered in large blocks of time. Independent studies, special projects and hands-on-learning form much of the curriculum. Over the recent years the school has adopted an art-focus.

It is located at the site of modern-day Devnya, Bulgaria. The ancient city has been partially excavated and is renowned for its museum collection of ancient mosaic floors from villas in the city. History Gothic Invasions 250-251 Roman Emperor Trajan renamed the ancient city of Parthenopolis after the Second Dacian War, which ended in 106. The city was renamed after Trajan's sister, Ulpia Marciana.Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVII, 4, 12 An important strategic centre, the city was part of Roman Thrace until 187-193, and then belonged to Moesia inferior. Marcianopolis's prosperity under the Severan Dynasty was ended by a Gothic raid in 248-249 and subsequent barbarian invasions from the north. The Romans repulsed another Gothic attack to this town in 267 (or 268), during the reign of Gallienus.Historia Augusta, Claudius, 9; Zosimus, I, 42 Under Emperor Diocletian Marcianopolis became the centre of the province Moesia Secunda of the Diocese of Thrace, and was rebuilt thoroughly in the late 3rd and early 4th century.

Diebold, Inc., 337 F. Supp. 2d 1195 (N.D. Cal. 2004), was a lawsuit involving an archive of Diebold's (now Premier Election Solutions) internal company e-mails and Diebold's contested copyright claims over them. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Stanford Cyberlaw Clinic provided pro bono legal support for the non-profit ISP and the Swarthmore College students, respectively. United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled that the plaintiffs' publishing of the e-mails was clearly a fair use essentially \\"because there was no commercial harm and no diminishment of value of the works\\" in their republication. Additionally Diebold was found to have misrepresented its copyright controls over the work, putting them in violation of section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and leaving them liable for court costs and damages. This was the first time 512(f) had been enforced in court, and set a precedent.  Background  Sometime in the spring of 2003 an unknown hacker broke into Diebold computers and obtained a large portion of their email archives, which was posted to various web sites. In an effort to quash the dissemination of information about security flaws in its voting machines, Diebold had sent dozens of DMCA takedown notices to various ISPs, all of which complied, except for OPG. Diebold sent takedown notices not only to sites actually storing the information, but also to those that merely linked to it. More specifically, Diebold sent DMCA notices to Swarthmore College, the ISP where the two students Nelson Pavlosky and Luke Smith had posted the 15,000 emails on their Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons web page.Mother Jones - The Paperless Chase, By Sabrina Rubin Erdely, Mother Jones, May/June 2004 Issue Diebold also sent notices to the Online Policy Group, the ISP for an IndyMedia site linking to Pavlosky & Smith's web page, and also to Hurricane Electric, OPG's upstream provider. After Swarthmore complied and removed the material, Pavlosky, Smith and the OPG sued Diebold, \\"asserting the company's accusation of infringement \\"was based on knowing material misrepresentation,\\" an actionable claim under a provision of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. 512(f)) and, furthermore, \\"interfered with [the] contractual relations\\" between the students and their Internet service providers\\". Although Diebold withdrew their DMCA letters after a media backlash, the plaintiffs decided to pursue Diebold in court; before the trial, EFF's legal director Cindy Cohn said that \\"We think it's important that the court make it clear that if you misuse the powers the DMCA has granted copyright holders, there are going to be serious consequences.\\"Voting machine showdown. A leading maker of computer election equipment defends itself in court against charges that it overreached itself in trying to stifle critics. By Farhad Manjoo, Salon, Feb 10, 2004 The OPG was a free, donation-based web host run by Roger Klorese, David Weekly, and Will Doherty; it was hosting the website for SF Bay Area Indymedia (Indybay) when a story linking to the Diebold e-mail archive was posted to Indybay. The link wasn't a direct link to the e-mail archive: upon reaching the linked page, the reader had to click another link to download the memos themselves. Diebold sent legal threats to OPG, asserting that the memos were copyrighted and that Indybay was committing tertiary infringement by linking to a link to the Diebold memos. When Indymedia and OPG refused to act, Diebold sent legal threats to OPG's upstream ISP, Hurricane Electric (HE), effectively accusing HE of quaternary copyright infringement.  Verdict  Judge Fogel noted that Diebold's filing contained contradictory elements, and on the matter of fair use determined that:Safe Harbors and Chilling Effects, Wendy Seltzer's website, Retrieved 25 Oct 2012. He then concluded that \\"Diebold violated section 512(f)\\" of the DMCA:Software & Internet Law: Safe Harbors and Chilling Effects Consequently, Diebold was ordered to pay $125,000 in damages. The failure to consider fair use before sending a DMCA notice was also found to compromise its good faith nature in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. (2008). OPG v. Diebold is also used as a textbook illustration of four-factor analysis (of fair use) alongside Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. and MGM v. Grokster.

It established a unified government in political (governorship), military (captaincy general), fiscal (intendancy) and judicial (audiencia) affairs. Its creation was part of the Bourbon Reforms and laid the groundwork for the future nation of Venezuela, in particular by orienting the province of Maracaibo towards the province of Caracas. History Antecedents The Bourbon dynasty had already taken steps towards reorganizing their overseas possessions and Venezuela, in particular. When the New Granadan Viceroyalty was reestablished in 1739, the governor-captain general of Caracas was given military jurisdiction over the provinces of Maracaibo, Cumaná, Guayana, Trinidad and Margarita. The 18th century also marked a period of marked economic growth for Venezuela. Cocoa plantations were established along the littoral valleys, which resulted in large importations of slaves. The growth of the cocoa-exporting economy was fomented by the Real Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas, which was granted a full monopoly over exports and imports in 1728. The Company's second largest export was tobacco. It also promoted the exploration and settlement of Venezuela's frontiers, most famously under the Expedition of the Limits, 1750-1761 headed by José de Iturriaga y Aguirre, which resulted in new settlements in Guayana Province. This growth was not experienced evenly, and the monopoly hurt small farmers, who continued to sell most of their product in the contraband trade. Resentment of the Company exploded in open revolt in 1749 headed by Canarian immigrant Juan Francisco de León. Establishment The Captaincy General, which was essentially a new viceroyalty in all but name, was actually created slowly over time by centralizing fiscal, administrative, military and ecclesiastical rule in Caracas. The first step was the creation of the Intendancy of Caracas, by Minister of the Indies, José de Gálvez in 1776. The new intendancy (superintendencia de ejército y real hacienda) covered the provinces of Venezuela (Caracas), Cumaná (sometimes New Andalusia), Guayana, Maracaibo, Trinidad and Margarita. Up to this point Maracaibo, Guayana and Trinidad's governance had been directly supervised by the Bogotá Audiencia; the other three provinces by the one in Santo Domingo. The following year a joint governorship-captaincy general with powers over military and administrative matters was established for the same provinces. Regional governors and military commanders were subordinated to the governor-captain general of Caracas. To maintain uniformity in judicial matters, in 1777 the provinces of Maracaibo, Margarita, Cumaná, Guayana and Trinidad were transferred to the Santo Domingo Audiencia, which had taken appeals from the Province of Caracas since 1742. Judicial matters were finally centralized in 1786 with the creation of the Audiencia of Caracas, which had jurisdiction over these same provinces and the new Barinas Province, which had been established in the intervening years from the frontier regions of Maracaibo Province. The Audiencia was composed of a regent judge, three judges and a crown attorney. The governor-captain general served as its president. It was to carry out justice and to watch over the action of royal officials in the area of its jurisdiction and only communicated directly with the Council of the Indies in Spain. A consulado was established in 1793 to oversee the new captaincy general's trade. In religious matters all of the provinces were also placed under the direction of the new archdiocese of Caracas in 1803. Two new dioceses, Mérida and Guayana were created, as well. Previously areas of the new diocese of Mérida had been part of the archdiocese of Bogotá, and Guayana had been part of the diocese of Puerto Rico. Control of the Province of Trinidad was lost to the British in 1797.

Independence The independence movement for Venezuela began with the establishment of the Caracas Junta in 1810. After the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence in 1811, the provinces of Caracas, Cumaná, Barinas, Margarita, and the newly separated ones of Barcelona, Trujillo, and Mérida established a Republic of Venezuela, which claimed the area of the Captaincy General. The provinces of Maracaibo and Guayana, along with the city of Coro, rejected the republic, and after a year of war against the royalists, this First Republic collapsed. The provinces that had created the Venezuelan Republic were reconquered by Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde, who usurped power from the appointed Captain General Fernando Miyares. Because of this the Cortes of Cádiz erected the Province of Maracaibo into a separate Captaincy General with Miyares at its head, but did ratify Monteverde as Captain General of the smaller Venezuela. During this period, the Province of Maracaibo elected a representative to the Cortes, José Domingo Rus, who served from March 3, 1812, to May 10, 1814, and continued to represent the province before the crown after Ferdinand VII abolished the Cortes.Rieu-Millan, Marie Laure.

Ortega González, Rutilio. \\"Rus, José Domingo\\" in Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela, Vol. 3. Caracas: Fundación Polar, 1999. With Ferdinand VII's return, Venezuela was reunited in one captaincy general. In 1812 a new Audiencia appointed by the Cortes was able to return in Caracas. Under the leadership of Dominican-born Regent José Francisco Heredia (father of Cuban poet, José María Heredia y Heredia), the Audiencia put up fierce resistance to Monteverde's attempts to rule the Captaincy General under martial law. After an interruption due to the restoration of the Republic and attempts by Pablo Morillo to suspend the Audiencia, both the Audiencia and the Captaincy General continued to function until 1821. Independence for Venezuela was consolidated in 1821 as part of Gran Colombia. The Congress of Cucuta looked to the territorial area of former Viceroyalty of New Granada (during the period of 1739-1777) as the basis for its territorial claims, and created a state composed of regional departments. Venezuela became the Department of Venezuela through this territorial reorganization. The rising animosity between Venezuelans and New Granadians, due to irreconcilable differences in opinion as to how the new republic ought to be governed, led to the inevitable collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830. After 1830, the provinces within the old Captaincy General of Venezuela, constituted the territory of the new independent republic of Venezuela.

He reflects back to when he was 8 years old and lived in Troy. En route to deliver a pot of cooked meat to his foster father Polydextus, he is confronted by Milentius. Milentius demands the food from Helios and when he refuses, Milentius trips him. The pot of meat shatters and the food is soiled. Helios threatens that his alleged father, King Priam will find out. Milentius threatens to hurt him unless he denies King Priam as his father. Helios retracts his statement just as Prince Paris approaches. Paris mentions how he heard the rumors of Priam having too much wine and meeting a pretty slave girl in a dark corridor and thus leading to the birth of Helios. Paris tells Milentius he did no wrong, and says the story sounds absurd due to the age of Priam at the time of conception. Helios returns home and shares the salvaged food with Polydextus. Polydextus then tells Helios how important his heritage is, and he has done great wrong by denying it when pushed by a bully. He then whips Helios to both punish him and teach him to deal with pain. Chapter 2: One day Helios climbed a secret stair to the roof of the palace. He decided to offer a sacrifice to the sun, whom his birth mother worshipped. While lying naked on the roof he is surprised by Cassandra, who was the youngest daughter of Priam and several years older than Helios. She says she overheard Paris telling the story of what happened between Helios and Milentius to Priam, and she did not think that Priam cared to hear it too much. After examining Helios she asks him to look into her eyes where he sees a blinding glow. She then insists that the power of the sun will enter him in time. After leaving the roof Helios is attacked by Milentius and another boy. Helios successfully fends them off, swinging a dead branch that fell off the sacred bay tree. He yells that he is in fact a son of Priam. Prince Hector stops Helios from fighting them off, and then shows him to Priam. Priam asked Helios to return home while he considered the matter. Cassandra followed after Helios, giving him the dead branch he swung earlier telling him it is an honor of Apollo to receive a sacred weapon. At home he sacrificed the branch with Polydextus as an offering of thanks to the Gods. Shortly after, Hector arrived to inform Helios and his foster parents that Priam is not displeased. He has not officially acknowledged Helios as his son, but would like him to work at the palace as stable boy. Chapter 3: After becoming stable boy, Polydextus and Troilus train Helios in chariot fighting and javeling. Polydextus, Troilus, and Sardon would also discuss battle strategies. Helios would ride a horse on an occasion which were not meant to be ridden due to their small stature, and would be whipped by Polydextus as punishment. Nine summers of training later Helios \\"gained three fingers in height\\", and his weight \\"balanced that of a sack of wheat\\". This was an improvement, but not by much. One morning Hector allowed Helios to accompany him to meet Paris, who was returning from his mission across the sea. Hector & Helios are introduced to Helen of Sparta, who accompanied Paris back to Troy along with her dowry meant for Menelaus. Paris insults Helios, causing him to leap at him in anger. Paris begins to whip Helios, but Polydextus draws a blade and prepares to fight. A woman screams for Hector, who stops the fight and explains to Paris that Priam has not acknowledged or denied Helios' bloodline. Paris accepts the explanation, but Helios says he knows they will never be friends. They all travel to Troy together. Chapter 4: Soon after the group returned form the beach, Priam called an immediate meeting of the council. Hector & Andromache's bedroom balcony overlooks the throne room. With Hector's permission and guidance, Helios crawled onto the balcony to watch the council meeting from above. Priam enters the throne room and he informs the room that he called the meeting to hear Paris' report from his trip across the Aegean. Paris first lectures the room on his travel, then displays found treasures from his exploits, and then introduces Helen. Antimachus approves of Paris' doings, and cries of approval were heard from the council. Later on Helios learned there was rumors of Antimachus being paid to back this argument. Prince Aeneas is granted permission to speak by Priam, who proposed that allowing Helen to stay may ignite war with Agamemnon, the High King of the Achaeans. Paris insists that it is impossible to have the Achaeans band together, and if that does happen Troy will protect him. Antenor then pushed his way into the open and says allowing Helen to stay would be a violation of customs, disrespectful, and would bring the anger of the Gods. With great respect Helen asks for permission to speak, and tells the story of Gaia, and how she is a woman and has the power to \\"put away a male\\". She says she \\"does things and does not know why\\", and then asks Priam for \\"help\\" understanding the decision she has made to accompany Paris. Priam then announces that it is his will that Helen be welcomed to Troy as the lawful mate of Paris. Suddenly Cassandra cries out from the women's balcony a prediction of Paris bringing death to Troy. Priam ordered her gagged and sent to her room immediately. Helios began to think of her as \\"his Cassandra\\" even though they only met once over a year ago. He crawled back into the bedroom and waited for Hector to return. Hector informed Helios that she was whipped by Priam for interrupting council, and after fled to the roof alone. After hearing this, Helios sneaks to the storeroom and fills a jar with salve. He takes off his tunic in order to tie the jar around his neck so that he would be free to climb up a palace wall with both hands. At the top he was greeted by Cassandra, who questions his nudity. She undresses so that Helios could put the salve on her back, bruised from the whipping. She cried and hugged Helios because of his thoughtfulness, but then suddenly recoils. Even though Helios is only 9, she says she wanted to be sure that he does not mate with her. Apollo does not want anyone else to have her. If a man does mate with her he will be punished and Cassandra will lose her gift of prophecy. She then tells Helios that she does not know what she will say whenever she makes a prediction. She mentions one prediction told to Laomedon long ago; \\"Stone on stone will ever fall, at the dread Earth-Shaker's call.\\" She tells Helios she feels that a spell is coming on and she will perform an oracle for Helios. She smells the salve to become in a \\"dreamy\\" state, and she speaks in a trance to Helios. A couple of lines of the oracle caused many thoughts to race in Helios' mind: \\"First, you ancient in the Earth, Judge for Troy what he is worth.\\" Unaware of what she had just said, she asked Helios if he would remember the words exactly, but not to tell her what it was. She suggests to Helios that it would be a good idea for him to leave the roof, and he climbs down carefully. Chapter 5: The next day Sisycles summons Helios to be taught writing by order of Priam. The next morning he is formally introduced to Cassandra, as it is supposed to be their first meeting. After the first lesson, Cassandra offers to teach Helios additional writing on her own time. She tells Helios that it was her that requested Helios be taught how to write. From that point on every second morning Helios had writing lessons from Sisycles, then Cassandra would give him additional writing lessons or other studies. Late that winter, Troy received news that the Achaen rulers are preparing to make war on Troy. Another serious announcement is made, a change to The Festival of the Scapegoat. This was a carnival marking the end of winter where a goat is sacrificed to eliminate all the sins of the city. This year, a man would be chosen. Names of men suspected of evil would be given to Priam. Sisycles would write the approved names on clay tablets. All the tablets would be left on until it rained, then 2 priests and Priam would choose the name that stands out most clearly. The person named would be sacrificed as the Scapegoat. The first day of sunshine came, and is Helios' 10th birthday. Helios and Cassandra celebrate by having snacks and wine, which in turn made them sleepy. They both undress and lay down on the roof naked to enjoy a sun bath. They are discovered on the roof by Queen Hecuba with a few guards. He is taken to Priam and questioned. We learn that Cassandra is only 15 years old. Hecuba demands that Helios be punished, but Priam is not sure if any wrong was done. They agree to enter Helios' name in the Festival of the Scapegoat. Helios' writing lessons stop, and Troy waits for rain. The day of the ceremony, Helios' name was the most legible and his tablet is chosen. Hector interrupts the ceremony and demands that his life be taken, but Priam denies him. Helios takes a close look at the tablet and points out that someone has switched the tablet, as this one was fired in a kiln, not dried out in the sun. Sisycles confirms that he did not create this tablet, and it must have been switched. Priam cannot decide the next course of action. Cassandra orders Helios to say the oracle of his fate. Helios says \\"First, you ancient in the Earth, Judge for Troy what he is worth.\\" Priam says that the ancient in the Earth is a calling from Gaia, and Helios unwillingly appeals to her. Priam declares that they must seek an answer from her in order to find out Helios' fate. Chapter 6: Formal arrangements were made to receive an oracle from the Gaia priestess. After nearly 2 weeks pass, the priestess approves. A party is formed to set out for the oracle. They stopped overnight at Lyrnessus and are welcomed by its ruler and his son Aeneas. They continue to the When they arrive Laocoön introduced the party to a handmaiden of the priestess, who inspected the gifts of Priam. The handmaiden only allowed Priam, Hector, Helios, Cassandra, and Helen to see the priestess. The priestess gave readings and chanted \\"Those who wish to chase a boy, will not succeed in saving Troy.\\" The party was dismissed, and returned to Troy. Another Scapegoat was chosen. Chapter 7: Soon after the return from the shrine Helios and Cassandra were allowed to resume their writing lessons with Sisycles as well as their private talks. One day in early summer the Achaean fleet arrives on the shores of Troy. Battle erupts by sea and on land. Helios follows Troilus and Polydextus, only to witness them killed by Achilles. Helios attempts to defeat Achilles by throwing rocks at him, but he is stopped by Odysseus. Diomedes steps forward leading a captive, Milentius. Milentius is then killed by Diomedes. The three Achaeans discuss what to do with Helios, and Achilles dons him a kitchen pot as a helmet and a ladle as a sword. He then orders his son Neoptolemus to fight Helios to the death. Chapter 8: Neoptolemus wounds Helios in the fight with a slash to his ribs. Helios uses the ladle to scoop up embers from a nearby fire and throw them into Neoptolemus' helmet. Helios grabbed a bucket of water and threw in the boy's face. Achilles hates himself for \\"blinding his son\\", but Odysseus calls for Machaon to look at Neoptolemus' eyes. He says that the cold water may have saved Neoptolemus from blindness. Machaon leads Helios and the Achaeans to Achilles' tent set up on the beach. There he chants over Neoptolemus, and says it will be days before they know if Neoptolemus' sight would return. In that time, someone must drip medicine over Neoptolemus' eyes. Helios volunteers to stay and apply the medicine. Achilles reluctantly accepts, and leaves the tent under guard and arranges for another tent to be raised. Machaon stitches Helios' wound and leaves. When they are alone, Neoptolemus compliments Helios' fighting and then goes to sleep. About the author In the fall of 1924 Powell began studying Virgil's Aeneid in Latin class at the Episcopal Academy, on Philadelphia's Main Line, and became fascinated by the characters and story of the Trojan War. Forty-four years later he climbed around the site of ancient Troy as part of his research for the book.

The study involves looking at a particular part of the nervous system from a molecular and cellular level and connecting it to a physiological and anatomical point of view. The field also explores the communications and interactions within and between each specialized section of the nervous system. Morphology is distinct from morphogenesis. Morphology is the study of the shape and structure of biological organisms, while morphogenesis is the study of the biological development of the shape and structure of organisms. Therefore, neuromorphology focuses on the specifics of the structure of the nervous system and not the process by which the structure was developed. Neuromorphology and morphogenesis, while two different entities, are nonetheless closely linked.  History  Progress in defining the morphology of nerve cells has been slow in its development. It took nearly a century after the acceptance of the cell as the basic unit of life before researchers could agree upon the shape of a neuron. It was originally thought to be an independent globular corpuscle suspended along nerve fibers that looped and coiled. It was not until the first successful microdissection of a whole nerve cell by Otto Deiters in 1865 that the separate dendrites and axon could be distinguished. At the end of the 19th century, new techniques, such as Golgi's method, were developed that enabled researchers to view the whole neuron. This Golgi investigation then promoted new research in neuronal spacing by Ramon y Cajal in 1911. Further morphology research continued to develop, including dendritic morphology. In 1983 Thoroya Abdel-Maguid and David Bowsher expanded upon the golgi method and combined it with an impregnation technique which allowed them to visualize the dendrites of neurons and classify them based on their dendritic patterns. Since then, myriad techniques have been developed and applied to the field of neuromorphology. Influence on neuron function Research has supported a relationship between the morphological and functional properties of neurons. For instance, the accordance between the morphology and the functional classes of cat retinal ganglion cells has been studied to show the relationship between neuron shape and function. Orientation sensitivity and dendritic branching patterns are a few other common characteristics of neurons that researchers have noted as having an effect on neuron function. Ian A. Meinertzhagen et al. have recently established a connection between the genetic factors that underlie a specific neuronal structure and how these two factors then pertain to the neuron's function by examining the optic nerves in Drosophila melanogaster. They assert the structure of the neuron is able to determine its function by dictating synapse formation. The geometry of neurons often depends on the cell type and the history of received stimuli that is processed through the synapses. The shape of a neuron often directs the neuron's function by establishing its synaptic partnerships. However, there is also a growing evidence for volume transmission, a process that involves electrochemical interactions from the whole cell membrane. The axonal tree morphology is instrumental in activity modulation and information coding. Development The development of the morphological features of neurons is governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The neuromorphology of nervous tissue is dependent upon genes and other factors, such as electric fields, ionic waves, and gravity. Developing cells additionally impose geometrical and physical constraints upon each other. These interactions affect the neural shape and synaptogenesis. Morphological measures and imaging applications are important for further understanding the developmental process.  Subfields  General morphology neocortical pyramidal cell that has been stained using Golgi's method. The cell is named after its characteristic triangular-shaped soma. Since there is a broad range of functions performed by different types of neurons in diverse parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in the size, shape, and electrochemical properties of neurons. Neurons can be found in different shapes and sizes and can be classified based upon their morphology. The Italian scientist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into type I and type II cells. Golgi I neurons have long axons that can move signals over long distances, such as in Purkinje cells, whereas Golgi II neurons generally have shorter axons, such as granule cells, or are anoxonic. Neurons can be morphologically characterized as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar. Unipolar and pseudounipolar cells have only one process extending from the cell body. Bipolar cells have a two processes extending from the cell body and multipolar cells have three or more processes extending towards and away from the cell body.  Theoretical neuromorphology  Theoretical neuromorphology is a branch of neuromorphology focused on the mathematical description of the shape, structure and connectivity of the nervous system. Gravitational neuromorphology Gravitational neuromorphology studies the effects of altered gravity on the architecture of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. This subfield aims to expand the current understanding of the adaptive capabilities of nervous systems, and specifically examines how environmental effects can alter nervous system structure and function. In this case environmental manipulations generally include exposing neurons to either hypergravity or microgravity. It is a subset of gravitational biology.  Research methods and techniques  A variety of techniques have been used to study neuromorphology, including confocal microscopy, design-based stereology, neuron tracing and neuron reconstruction. Current innovations and future research include virtual microscopy, automated stereology, cortical mapping, map guided automated neuron tracing, microwave techniques, and network analysis. Of the currently used techniques for studying neuromorphology, design-based stereology and confocal microscopy are the two most preferred methods. A complete database of neuronal morphology called the NeuroMorpho Database also exists.  Design- based stereology  Design-based stereology is one of the most prominent methods for mathematically extrapolating a 3-D form from a given 2-D form. It is currently the leading technique in biomedical research for analyzing 3-D structures. Design-based stereology is a newer stereology technique that examines morphology that has been predefined and designed. This technique contrasts with the older method, model-based stereology, which utilized previously determined models as a guide. The more current design-based stereology allows researchers to probe the morphology of neurons without having to make assumptions about their size, shape, orientation or distribution. Design-based stereology also gives researchers more freedom and flexibility as model-based stereology is only effective if the models are truly representative of the object being studied, while design-based stereology is not constrained in this way.  Confocal microscopy  Diagram of how confocal microscopy works. Confocal microscopy is the microscopic procedure of choice for examining neuron structures as it produces sharp images with improved resolution and decreased signal-to-noise ratio. The specific way this microscopy works allows one to look at one confocal plane at a time, which is optimal when viewing neuronal structures. Other more conventional forms of microscopy simply do not allow one to visualize all neuronal structures, especially those that are subcellular. Recently, some researchers have actually been combining design-based stereology and confocal microscopy to further their investigations into the specific neuronal cellular structures. Cortical mapping Cortical mapping is defined as the process of characterizing specific regions in the brain based on either anatomical or functional features. Current brain atlases are not definitive or homogenous enough to portray specific structural details. Recent advances in functional brain imaging and statistical analysis may however prove to be sufficient in the future. A recent development in this field called the Gray Level Index (GLI) method allows for more objective identification of cortical regions via algorithms. The GLI is a standardized method that allows researchers to determine neuron density. It is specifically defined as the ratio of area covered by Nissl-stained elements to area covered by unstained elements. More sophisticated cortical mapping techniques are still in the process of being developed and this field will most likely see an exponential growth in mapping methods in the near future.  Clinical applications  Neuromorphology has been used as a new method of exploring the underlying cause of many neurological disorders, and has been included in the clinical study of various neurodegenerative diseases, mental disorders, learning disabilities, and dysfunctions due to brain damage. Researchers have been using neuromorphological techniques to not only study the damage but also ways to regenerate the damage nerve through ways like axon growth stimulation. Neuromophology has been used to study optical nerve damage, specifically looking at lesions and atrophies. Researchers have also examined and identified the neuromorphology of the human penis to better understand the role the sympathetic nervous system plays in achieving an erection.  Current and future research  Computational neuromorphology Computational neuromorophology examines neurons and their substructures by cutting them into slices and studying these different subsections. It also describes the neuromorphological space as a 3-D space. This allows researchers to understand the size of specific neuronal components. Additionally, the 3-D imaging helps researchers comprehend how the neuron transmits information within itself.  Virtual microscopy  Virtual microscopy would allow researchers to obtain images with a decreased amount of imaging sessions, thus preserving the integrity of the tissue and decrease the possibility the fluorescent dyes fading during imaging. This method would additionally give researchers abilities to visualize currently unobtainable data, such as rare cell types and the spatial allocation of cells in a specific brain region. Virtual microscopy would essentially allow for the digitization of all images obtained, therefore preventing deterioration of the data. This digitization could also potentially permit researchers to create a database to share and store their data.

After acquiring a Myki card the passenger needs to add value onto the card, in a process called \\"topping up\\". The value stored on the card is called \\"Myki money\\". Top up is available at the same places as card purchase, or \\"auto top up\\" can be set up to recharge the card from a linked credit card or bank account automatically when the Myki money balance falls to a set threshold. To use Myki when travelling, a passenger holds the card against a Myki reader (called \\"touching on\\" or \\"touching off\\"). Passengers touch on at the start of a trip and (except for a tram trip within Zone 1) touch off at the end of the trip, at which point the appropriate fare is assessed and deducted from the stored Myki money value on the card. If the fare for a trip is greater than the stored Myki money balance remaining, the card will show a negative Myki money balance, in which case it cannot be touched on again until it has been topped up. Passengers do not need to touch on or off for tram trips entirely within in the \\"free tram zone\\", which covers essentially the Melbourne CBD.  Mobile Myki  Mobile Myki is a virtual Myki card on a Android phone using Google Pay. Stored value and fares calculation works in the same way as a normal Myki, and the phone is held against a Myki reader to touch on or off.  Services available  A Myki card can be used for travel on: * Melbourne metropolitan train, tram and bus services including SmartBus, but not Skybus services * V/Line trains travelling within the V/Line commuter belt (between Melbourne and Seymour, Traralgon, Wendouree, Waurn Ponds, and Epsom/Eaglehawk stations) * Regional buses in major towns within the commuter belt (eg, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley).  Card types There are Myki cards for full fare, concession, child and Victorian seniors passengers. Prior to January 2015, Myki cards were issued with a green front, with various designs on the back of the card. Since then issued Myki card have had a uniform predominantly black design meaning it is no longer possible to visually distinguish between full fare and concession cards. A \\"Myki Explorer\\" pack is available, intended for use by interstate and overseas visitors (or an option for users from outside metropolitan Melbourne). Full fare packs cost $16 and child, concession and seniors packs cost $8. The pack includes a Myki card pre-loaded with $10 (full fare) or $5 (concession), which is enough for one day's worth of travel in Zones 1 and 2; the pack also includes vouchers for discounts at major tourist attractions, instructions on how to use Myki, and a protective Myki wallet. Users can reclaim any unused balance on their Myki when they no longer need it, but not the $6 or $3 purchase price. The pack is sold from locations such as Tullamarine Airport, hotel concierge desks, backpacker and bed & breakfast accommodation facilities, tourist information centres, Station Pier, Melbourne, Southern Cross station and other outlets.  Card registration  A Myki card can be \\"registered\\" with Public Transport Victoria, which protects the card holder against loss of the card and enables passengers to view their travel history online. It also enables \\"auto top up\\" to be set up, enables the card holder to view the card expiry date online and enables PTV to contact the registered card holder of an imminent card expiry date.  Fare calculation and default fares  Geelong Blackburn station made by Vix Technology Myki is a multi-modal fare and ticketing system based on zones. Metropolitan Melbourne is divided into two zones (Zones 1 and 2). Outside of metropolitan Melbourne there are a further ten zones (Zones 3–13). There are areas of overlap between some zones (notably Zones 1 and 2), where locations exist within both zones. The Myki system calculates the cheapest fare for a passenger based on the time and zone(s) travelled in on a given day. Fares are assessed on the basis of a two-hour fare or a daily fare. Longer periods, of 7 days or 28–365 days, can be pre-loaded into the card as a Myki pass giving unlimited travel within a nominated zone or zones for the relevant period. If a 365-day pass is purchased, the days above 325 are free of charge. Myki fares are based on the time and zone fares used under the previous Metcard system (with zones expanded to cover the V/Line commuter belt), with the exception of the single trip \\"City Saver\\" fare which was not made available under the Myki system. If a Myki card is not touched off at the completion of a journey the system will charge a default fare, which is usually equal to the most expensive journey that could have been undertaken by a passenger, based on the location of touch on. Passengers need not touch off when alighting a tram unless their travel is only in Zone 2. Prior to the introduction of Myki, a separate fares and ticketing system existed for all V/Line (country) services, based on paper tickets. This system still operates on V/Line services that run outside of the commuter belt area.  Card expiry  A Myki card has a limited validity period, but the expiry date is not printed on the card. A physical card expires four years after the date on which it is purchased. Mobile Myki expires after two years. If the card is registered, the holder can see online the date on which the card expires. PTV also contacts the registered card holder shortly before the expiry date to remind them of the card's imminent expiry. Holders of anonymous cards must use a card vending machine or Myki Check machine to find out when their card will expire. An Myki card that has expired or is expiring in the next 60 days can be replaced for free at staffed metropolitan railway stations, Myki-enabled V/Line stations or a PTV Hub, with any balance from the expired/expiring card being transferred to the new card instantly. Alternatively, users can post their expired/expiring Myki card to PTV and wait up to 10 working days for a new card to be posted to them. If the expired/expiring card was registered, the replacement card will be automatically registered. Auto top-up will not be transferred to the new Myki and, if desired, needs to be set up again. To obtain a replacement for a personalised Myki card, users must mail their card to PTV.  History  Myki Bus – Driver's Console Myki Bus – Fare Payment Device Myki replaced the Metcard ticketing system in metropolitan Melbourne, and various ticketing systems used by buses in some major regional cities. Work on the new public transport ticketing system for Victoria commenced in late 2002. In June 2003, the Transport Ticketing Authority (TTA) was established to procure and manage the new system. On 12 July 2005, the Kamco consortium was awarded the $494 million contract to develop the system, with the completion date being 2007. The consortium was made up of Keane Inc, Ascom, ERG, and Giesecke & Devrient Australasia. A pilot program was due to begin in early 2007, but was delayed by approximately a year. In February 2008, Public Transport Minister, Lynne Kosky, announced that the full roll-out of the system would not begin until the end of the year. By March the same year, the minister said that the system would not be operational until 2010. In April 2008, the TTA announced that it had stopped making service payments to the Kamco consortium after April 2007, because the project had not been delivered on schedule. The first field trial of the new Myki system was held on the Geelong bus network in late 2007, which identified problems. In August 2008 testing began on the Melbourne suburban train and tram networks. On 12 December 2008, Myki went on sale to the general public on four bus routes in Geelong,Channel 7 News (12 December 2008 – reporter Andrew Lunn) and on 2 March 2009 all bus routes in the Geelong and Bellarine Peninsula area were completely switched to Myki. In April 2009, all bus services in Ballarat, Bendigo and Seymour were converted to Myki. In May 2009, all bus services in the Latrobe Valley towns of Moe, Morwell, Traralgon and Warragul were operating with Myki equipment, making it the last regional bus system to be converted. Melbourne roll-out The Melbourne roll-out began in July 2007 with the installation of Myki readers. Myki became valid for travel on all metropolitan train services, but not trams and buses, from 29 December 2009, though system of purchasing cards was still cumbersome. On 25 July 2010, Myki coverage was extended to Melbourne metropolitan bus and tram services. During 2012 the government progressively shut down the Metcard system: * from the start of 2012, yearly Metcards became unavailable * from 26 March 2012, monthly and weekly Metcards became unavailable * from 30 June 2012, \\"value\\" Metcards, such as 10x2 hour, 10xEarly Bird, 5xDaily, 5xWeekend Daily, 5xSeniors Daily, 10xCity Saver, Sunday Saver and Off-Peak Daily became unavailable. Only single-use 2-hour, Daily, City Saver and Seniors Daily Metcards continued to be available. All Metcard ticket vending machines on railway stations were removed or switched off. The only Metcard vending machines still in operation were on trams. The limited remaining range of Metcards could only be purchased from staff at Premium stations, from bus drivers, or from a PTV Hub. The sale of Metcards at Premium (staffed) Metro railway stations was progressively phased out, and ceased entirely during October. The removal of Metcard validators from railway stations started on 12 November 2012. Also from November, passengers with unused Metcards were able to transfer the value onto a Myki card as Myki money at premium Metro railway stations. On 29 December 2012, Metcard was switched off, and Myki became the only form of ticket valid on Melbourne public transport. On the same day, all Metcard equipment remaining on the system became inoperative. It was intended that the Skybus Melbourne Airport shuttle bus service (with its own, premium fares) would also accept Myki once the system was fully operational, but this did not happen. In May 2014, the first Myki electronic gates with a touch screen became operational. Regional implementation Myki came into use on regional \\"commuter\\" (short-haul) rail services in July 2013, in a staged process: between Melbourne and Seymour on 24 June, on the Traralgon line on 8 July, the Bendigo line on 17 July, the Ballarat line on 24 July, and the Geelong-Marshall line on 29 July. Paper family tickets are available to families travelling within the Myki zone with children below 17 years of age. On 10 November 2013, Myki was introduced on Wallan and Kilmore town buses. On 25 February 2014, paper tickets for passengers on V/Line commuter services were abolished, and passengers were required to use Myki. Paper tickets remain for travel outside the Myki zone, such as to Warrnambool, Bairnsdale, Swan Hill, Shepparton or Albury. Passengers with Myki Pass who want to travel beyond the Myki area can purchase paper \\"extension tickets\\" to cover the rest of their journey.  Issues and criticisms  The Myki ticketing system has been criticised on a number of grounds: * Necessity: Critics, such as the Public Transport Users Association, questioned why a new ticketing system was needed when Melbourne already had an adequate one. The Metcard validating equipment already had built-in support for a contactless ticket (the yellow circles on the front of the former Metcard validators, as well as on Ticket Vending Machines. * Its total cost of $1.5 billion. * The project took far longer than originally planned to deliver. It began in May 2005 with a scheduled delivery date of March 2007. Delivery eventually took until 2013. * No short-term ticket: The decision not to proceed with the planned introduction of short-term tickets in Melbourne, and to abolish them on regional town bus services, meant that Myki is now one of the world's only ticketing systems on which visitors and occasional users cannot buy a short- term ticket. A total of 50 million short-term tickets, costing $15 million, were pulped. * The lack of Myki ticket machines on trams, an option which was available under Metcard. As a result, tram passengers must have bought and topped up a myki before they board the vehicle. Options to do this through the retail network are limited, particularly in the outer suburbs and after hours where Myki retailers (except 7-Eleven) have closed while trams can still be running for up to eight hours following the store's closure. * Privacy: In 2010 the Opposition expressed concern over the data collection and sharing used by Myki, claiming that the Government was breaching its own Information Privacy Act.  Problems  * On 29 December 2009, the reputation of Lynne Kosky, the Public Transport Minister at the time, was put into question when Kosky was unable to recall the phone number for commuters to buy a ticket, and a computer error resulted in over 1,600 people receiving new Myki cards with their name incorrectly spelled or printed as 'anonymous'. * Due to Myki's protracted introduction, the government had to continually extend payments for the existing Metcard system alongside Myki. This was done to ensure commuters had a chance to switch over to Myki before Metcard was removed from the transport network. * Newsagents initially refused to sell Myki cards because lower commissions were being offered by the government in comparison to Metcard. * Controversies over the tendering process. A staff member of the Transport Ticketing Authority (TTA) left a USB flash drive in a room with representatives of one of the bidders. The TTA claims that this was an accident and that there was no confidential information on the flash drive. Also, the company hired by the TTA early in the process to give it technical advice was part of the winning consortium. * Increased dwell times: Tests commissioned by the Government in 2007 suggested longer stationary times for trams compared to the Metcard system as a result of passengers needing to touch on and off when boarding and disembarking. As a result, when Myki was made available on trams in 2009 the requirement to touch off was removed. * Potential for a higher fare to be charged if a user forgets to touch off: The cost of a trip after which the user has not touched off (deliberately or accidentally) may be higher than the fare the passenger would have paid if they had touched off. * Disability Access: Disability groups claimed that several elements of the Myki program would be problematic for users with a disability (particularly those who are in wheelchairs, have cognitive limitations or who lack dexterity) due to the placement of several pieces of equipment. On low-floor trams, Myki readers have been installed at various heights to cater for this. The Government introduced a free Access Travel Pass for users who are unable to use Myki ticketing equipment as a result of a permanent disability. * Rules covering faulty cards: The Transport Ticketing Authority originally stated that passengers who had a faulty Myki card would need to buy a replacement Myki card if they wanted to travel and seek reimbursement later. This replicated the rule for faulty Metcards. Users are now able to go to a staffed railway station to have a faulty Myki replaced on the spot. * Auto top-up failure problem: Originally, when the auto top-up feature of Myki failed due to insufficient funds, the card was blocked and had to be posted to Myki to be reactivated. Now the auto top-up request is removed from the card, and the original top up amount is reversed from the Myki. * Ticket vending machines receipt issuing: Topping up a Myki using EFTPOS or credit card displays a screen asking the user if they would like a receipt to be printed. If \\"no\\" is selected, an EFT transaction record was printed anyway, which contained the credit card user's full name, expiry date and 9 of 16 credit card digits. This was subsequently changed to show only the last four digits of the credit card with the card holder's name no longer printed, and eventually to prevent the printing of receipts when \\"no\\" had been selected. * Vandalism: Particularly in the early days of myki, there were widespread reports of damage to Myki equipment, with up to 60% of machines being targeted by vandals. Display screens on fare payment devices and card vending machines could be smashed by heavy objects, rendering the displays unusable, or by marker pen, paint or scratching obscuring information. In mid-2013 it was reported that Myki machines at some railway stations had been broken into using portable power tools, in order to raid their cash boxes. While Myki readers will often still work despite surface vandalism, passengers might not be able to read the information displayed on the reader's screen. * On 11 June 2015 a Melbourne commuter found their card showed a negative balance of .

His career began in the 1760s before first-class statistics began to be recorded and his known first-class career spans the 1772 to 1783 seasons. He has often been confused with his namesake who played for Surrey at the same time. Although Wood is credited with 12 first-class appearances by CricketArchive, there are only 10 which can definitely be attributed to him.

Retrieved on 16 January 2011. According to John Nyren, Wood of Kent was a \\"change bowler who was tall, stout, bony and a very good general player\\".Nyren (ed. Mote), p.70. According to H T Waghorn, he suffered a serious knee injury in 1773 and there were fears of amputation being necessary.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, p.119. However, he was playing again in 1774 so things cannot have been as bad as they first seemed. The first time a John Wood is mentioned in the sources is when one plays for Caterham against Hambledon in 1769. This was probably the Surrey-based player. In the same season, a player called Wood played for the Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham in the minor match that featured John Minshull's century. Given Dorset's strong Kent connection, this was probably John Wood of Kent.

It was founded in 1991 by Rudolf K. Thauer and is one of 80 institutes in the Max Planck Society (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft). Its sister institute is the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, which was founded a year later in 1992 in Bremen. The Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg Research There are currently around 19 research groups at the institute. The research at MPI- Marburg broadly focuses on understanding the functioning of microorganisms at the molecular, cellular and community levels. In particular, the focus is the mechanisms of cellular and community adaptation of bacteria in response to changes in the environment. Organization The Institute consists of five departments with their respective research groups and heads: Biogeochemistry The Biogeochemistry Department, headed by Ralf Conrad, is focused on the microbial metabolism and biogeochemical matter cycling in soil. Soil microbial metabolism plays an important role in the global cycling of matter and — through the formation of atmospheric trace gases such as methane and nitrous oxide — also influences the climate on Earth. The department examines the role of soil microorganisms in carbon and nitrogen cycling, particularly in chemically well-defined processes such as the production and consumption of methane, the oxidation of ammonia, or denitrification. There are four research leaders in charge of six research groups and two project groups: Research Groups Ralf Conrad * Methanogenic degradation * Microbial metabolism of trace gases Andreas Brune * Microbial ecology of the termite gut * Microbial symbioses Werner Liesack * Molecular biology and ecology of methanotrophs * Environmental genomics and transcriptomics Project Group Peter Frenzel * Methane oxidation * Biogeochemistry and microbial ecology of wetlands Ecophysiology The Ecophysiology Department, headed by Lotte Søgaard-Andersen, focuses on understanding how intracellular signalling networks are wired to allow bacteria to adapt and differentiate in response to changes in the environment or in response to self-generated signals. Specifically, the department has two aims. Firstly, they aim to understand how bacteria process information to generate appropriate output responses (e.g. changes in gene expression, changes in motility behavior). Secondly, they aim to understand how molecular machines involved in motility and secretion function and how their activity is regulated. Ecophysiology currently has three research groups led by the following in parenthesis: * Bacterial secretion systems (Andreas Diepold) * The intracellular organization and differentiation of bacteria (Simon Ringgaard) * Bacterial development & differentiation (Lotte Søgaard-Andersen) Organismic Interactions The Organismic Interactions Department, headed by Regine Kahmann, is focused on the biology of phytopathogenic fungi and in particular the mechanisms that underlie morphological differentiation and communication of these fungi with their plant hosts. Furthermore, the department is focused on the mechanisms that enable fungi to colonize plants successfully and on the processes accounting for variations in host preference and fungal lifestyles. There are three research groups: * Molecular phytopathology (Regine Kahmann) * Establishment of compatibility in biotrophic interactions (Gunther Döhlemann) * Functional genomics and molecular biology of symbiotic fungi (Alga Zuccaro) Systems and Synthetic Microbiology The Department of Systems and Synthetic Microbiology, headed by Victor Sourjik, aims to elucidate general principles of evolutionary optimization of cellular networks and implement these principles in the design of novel networks in microorganisms. Having a single research group, microbial networks is also led by Sourjik.  Synthetic Biochemistry and Metabolism  The Department of Synthetic Biochemistry and Metabolism is headed by Tobias J. Erb. Emeritus Group The Emeritus Group at MPI-Marburg is headed by renowned biochemist and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize recipient, Rudolf K. Thauer, who was also the founding director of the institute when it was established in 1991. The scientific focus of the group is on the biochemistry of methanogenic archaea, methanotrophic archaea and saccharolytic clostridia. The following specific topics are being addressed: * Hydrogen activation * Methane formation and anaerobic methane oxidation * Ferredoxin reduction Collaborations SYNMIKRO MPI-Marburg is scheduled to expand with a new Department for Synthetic Microbiology (SYNMIKRO), in collaboration with the Max Planck Society and the University of Marburg. The new department will serve as a research centre for SYNMIKRO with about 100 scientific positions expected to be made available. A grant of about 21 million Euro has been allocated for the period of 2010-12 alone.http://www.uni- marburg.de/synmikro/synmikro?set_language=en IMPRS-Mic The Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology operates the International Max Planck Research School for Environmental, Cellular and Molecular Microbiology program, in collaboration with the Philipps University of Marburg. The degrees are conferred by the University, as is the case for all other IMPRS programs in the MPG. Apart from the University, the MPI has close collaborations with research centres in the city and overseas. More specific information on their collaborations can be found on their cooperations page.

Although falsely attributed to Euripides, the phrase has classical Greek antecedents. The word \\"Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad\\" first appears in exactly this form in the Rev William Anderson Scott's book Daniel, a Model for Young Men and it is later appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \\"The Masque of Pandora\\". Classical origins An early version of the phrase Whom the gods would destroy... appears in verses 620–623 of Sophocles’ play Antigone: \\"τὸ κακὸν δοκεῖν ποτ᾽ ἐσθλὸν τῷδ᾽ ἔμμεν' ὅτῳ φρένας θεὸς ἄγει πρὸς ἄταν\\" to mean that \\"evil appears as good in the minds of those whom god leads to destruction\\". A form closer to the modern version is found in Procopius, Vandal Wars, I.19.25, \\"ὅς [θεός], ἡνίκα τι ἀνθρώπῳ συμβῆναι βουλεύηται φλαῦρον, τῷ λογισμὸν ἁψάμενος πρῶτον\\": \\"who [God], whenever He purposes that some adversity shall befall a man, touches first his reason\\". 17th and 18th century use In the 17th century the phrase was used in the neo-Latin form \\"Quem Iuppiter vult perdere, dementat prius\\" (Whom Jupiter would ruin, he first makes mad); in a Christianized Greek version, \\"Iuppiter\\" was replaced by \\"Lord\\" as in \\"μωραίνει Κύριος ον βούλεται απολέσαι\\". Benjamin Franklin quotes this phrase in his essay, \\"On Civil War,\\" delivered to the Printer of the London Public Advertiser, August 25, 1768. A prior Latin version is \\"Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat\\" (Life of Samuel Johnson, 1791) but this involves God, not 'the gods'. Modern usage \\"Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad\\" is quoted as a \\"heathen proverb\\" in Daniel, a Model for Young Men (1854) by Rev William Anderson Scott (1813–85).https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BoJCAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA248#v Brigham Young quoted the phrase in a discourse delivered on March 16, 1856, attributing it as an \\"ancient proverb\\".

It is the final book (fully) narrated by Jake and is the final book to fully be narrated by only one character. Plot summary After the destruction of the Yeerk pool, Jake, Tobias, and Marco hide while witnessing the Yeerks destroying the last remnants of their hometown and watch as the Pool Ship lands amidst the destruction. After briefly considering destroying the Pool Ship, the Animorphs hide, deciding that capturing the vessel would be a better strategy. Hoping to gain military assistance for the attack, Jake visits Major General Sam Doubleday. Although Doubleday is initially distrustful of Jake, he eventually listens and agrees to Jake's plan after a Controller-major on the general's staff tries to kill Jake. After a Yeerk attack on the general's base, Doubleday evacuates his troops and confines them and himself for three days to eliminate any remaining Controllers amongst his soldiers. Unfortunately, the confinement of Doubleday and his troops means a three-day delay before the Animorphs can launch their attack on the Pool Ship. Sensing that the Yeerks could get the new Yeerk pool that is under construction operational within that time period, the Animorphs decide to take out the Taxxons digging the pool. In the ensuing battle, Jake finds himself underground and in the company of several Taxxons, led by none other than Arbron, a former companion of Elfangor's who became a Taxxon-nothlit several years earlier. Arbron makes Jake an offer: in exchange for allowing his followers to become nothlits and make a home for themselves on Earth, the 1709 non-Controller Taxxons on the surface and on board the Pool Ship will defect and join the Animorphs in their fight against the Yeerks. Jake returns to the Hork-Bajir valley and tells the others of Arbron's offer. The brief period of excitement that reigns through the camp is spoiled, however, when Ax, prompted by Cassie (who, as it turns out, has been privy to his prior communication with his people in the previous book by morphing into a flea and riding on his back whenever he snuck off to contact them), tells the others that the Andalites have decided that the war for Earth is lost and are planning on destroying humanity in order to stop the Yeerk menace once and for all. Jake, Rachel, Tobias, and Marco are all furious and feel betrayed by Ax for not telling them about this, and they realize that the Andalites have gone from their allies to their enemies. Ax insists that the only way to stop this is to capture the Pool Ship and use its communications technology to contact the Andalite people directly, whom he does not expect to support his government's sterilization plan. The Animorphs return to Arbron and his Taxxon followers and secure their support. Jake promises the Taxxons a safe haven on Earth and the opportunity to morph anacondas. Immediately afterwards, Tom arrives and offers to assist the Animorphs in capturing the Pool ship, in exchange for the Blade Ship, a hundred of his own morph-capable followers, and safe passage out of the Solar System. Sensing a trap, Jake accepts Tom's offer while simultaneously setting his own plan into motion. Jake dispatches Marco to locate Erek King and bring him to the Hork-Bajir valley, while Cassie and Ax are sent to capture Chapman. Jake manipulates Erek's pacifist programming by threatening to kill Chapman if Erek does not actively participate in the assault on the Pool Ship. Erek grudgingly agrees to help. With the attack set to begin, Jake meets up with Tom and the original Animorphs, including a severely beaten Cassie, and proceeds to board the Pool Ship. Once on board, Tom, as expected, betrays Jake by having a Taxxon eat Cassie and the other Animorphs, whom he believes to be hiding on Cassie in morph. Unknown to Tom, \\"Cassie\\" is actually a holographic projection by Erek, and the Taxxon is Tobias in morph, escorted by free Hork- Bajir led by Toby Hamee. After devouring the hologram, Tobias and Erek, with the other Animorphs in tow, are led off the bridge by Toby so they can begin trying to gain control of the Pool Ship's computer systems. Visser One gives Tom command of the Blade Ship so he can wipe out the Taxxon resistance. Unbeknownst to the Yeerks and the Animorphs (save for Jake), Rachel is hiding as a flea on Tom's head, with orders to kill him and prevent the Blade Ship from escaping with the morphing cube, an assignment that Rachel is not expected to survive. The Auxiliary Animorphs and General Doubleday's forces begin their attack on the Pool Ship. Visser One lifts the ship off the ground and uses its massive weapons array to kill the Auxiliary Animorphs and several of Doubleday's troops. Jake, who is still on the bridge, is forced to watch the massacre until Ax and Erek are able to gain control of the helm and force the Pool Ship out of firing range. This act makes Visser One realize that the Animorphs have infiltrated the Pool Ship's engineering section and orders his troops to kill everyone in the room. Jake meets up with the others, who escaped the engine room before Visser One's forces could carry out their orders, and tells them of Rachel's part in his plan. The Animorphs continue with their assault and make their way to the Pool Ship's on-board Yeerk pool. Hoping to distract Visser One and Tom long enough to save Rachel's life, Jake orders Ax to flush the pool, killing 17,372 unhosted Yeerks. The Animorphs continue to the bridge, where they find a defeated and battle-weary Visser One. Jake asks the visser to fire on the Blade Ship with the hope that the shots will disable it, but the Dracon beams miss and Erek drains the remaining power from the weapons. Tom hails the Pool Ship to gloat about his victory, and sees Jake in tiger morph. Enraged at the realization that the Animorphs survived his trap, Tom orders the Blade Ship's weapons to be targeted at the Pool Ship's bridge. Jake orders Rachel to attack.

In her Inaugural Address, Howard focused on the diversity of the college as a strength. Within one month of assuming her leadership position at the college, Howard shared three short-term goals for strengthening it in an address to faculty.Interim president urges 'new strength', Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 2 February 1996, Brady, K., Retrieved 6 February 2014. Those three goals included \\"increasing recruitment and retention of students; developing strategies to address the 1996-97 budget; [and] dealing with the 'institutional climate' that has emerged.\\" On the 125th anniversary of the college in 1996, Howard oversaw many events that celebrated the quasquicentennial event.Community event to launch Buffalo State's 125th anniversary celebration, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 5 September 1996, Brady, K., Retrieved 6 February 2014.

Celebrations included a cake in the shape of Rockwell Hall, a champagne toast, a big band, a chorale ensemble and additional wind ensembles, fireworks, tours of campus arts centers, exhibits, and a play area for kids. Challenges During her tenure as interim president, Howard's main goal is \\"dealing directly with allegations of racial and sexual discrimination\\" at the college. Howard stated in February 1996 that the college had held 60 programs on racial and cultural diversity, and gender during the previous fall. The Institute for the Healing of Racism began a two- month forum in the Spring 1996 semester at the college; and closed hearings on sexual harassment and gender bias were being held within the College Senate's Committee on the Status of Women. Howard stated her belief of the College being \\"a real role model for the community.\\" In the period from 1996 to 1998, there were a number of deans and administrators who had been on leave through an arrangement with the previous college president, F.C. Richardson, and SUNY, and/or who had resigned to take other posts or due to retirement.Dean becomes next in line to leave Buffalo State College, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 5 July 1996, Brady, K., Retrieved 5 February 2014.Interim president enters murky waters at Buff State, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 14 December 1995, Watson, R., Retrieved 5 February 2014.Provost resigns from Buffalo State College, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 18 June 1996, Brady, K., Retrieved 5 February 2014.Quatroche stepping down at Buffalo State, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 20 August 1998, Brady, K., Retrieved 5 February 2014. In 1996, as a result of those on leave or because of the resignations, there was only one permanent academic post that had remained filled at the college. At that time, there were five top leaders at the College who were either on leave or who had resigned to take other posts. Howard was in the process of considering applicants in order to fill open and/or interim positions during that time. One dean who left to take another position stated that it was a time in the college's history in which important leadership choices were to be made that would take the institution into the next century. Advanced telecommunications network In 1997, through Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello's office and under the direction of Buffalo State College's Center for Applied Research in Interactive Technologies, CityNet, an advanced telecommunications network that links 14 educational and community sites in Buffalo was launched.Fiber-optic network links 14 educational, community sites, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 25 November 1997, Brady, K., Retrieved 6 February 2014. For more than two years, Masiello and his team worked with NYNEX and Bell Atlantic to lay the foundation for the network, which is funded by Bell Atlantic for $1.9 million. International distance learning partnership In 1998, Howard made a personal effort to expand the Nurturing Initiative and Achievements (NIA) in Students Mentor Program at the college by offering a distance learning program at San José, Costa Rica.Special feature: The honor roll: SUNY's Buffalo State College, The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, Vol. 8, No. 12, 17 July 1998, Deitz, R., Retrieved 3 February 2014.Buffalo State president opens video link to Costa Rica, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 1 April 1998, Brady, K., Retrieved 4 February 2014.

The House had been used as servant's quarters after it was first built. The Junior League of Buffalo and Chase Pitkin contributed to the remodeling of the Carriage House, with the Junior League identifying it as its 1997 Decorator Show House. The Carriage House was built in 1912; and now serves as a guest house for visitors of the college, providing much lower rates for accommodation than hotels at which visitors would otherwise stay. Howard participated in talks with the Buffalo Psychiatric Center, the Buffalo Mayor's Office, and others regarding usage expansion for the psychiatric center.Archives: Architecture: A towering masterpiece: H.H.

One of the interests of the college was to use lands for expansion, and to build a new Burchfield Penney Art Center, a desire that was eventually achieved. Campus bookstore controversy During the Fall semester of 1998, controversy surrounding the campus bookstore contract was made public.Bookstore is flash point at Buffalo State, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 19 August 1998, Brady, K., Retrieved 5 February 2014. Traditionally, Follett College Stores - the largest college bookstore company in the country - held the bookstore contract at the college. Concern by college administration that many college textbooks were being sold beyond the list price prompted the submission of a new bookstore contract with Barnes & Noble by Howard to the state comptroller, Carl McCall. Barnes & Noble is the largest book retailer in the United States. As a result, - and due to the college already maintaining a contract with Follett - the executive board of the college's Faculty Student Association (FSA) voted to withhold $25,000 in discretionary funds during that semester, funds that are traditionally issued to the college president for discretionary purposes. This move by the FSA was unprecedented; however the aim of involvement by FSA was to obtain a judicious decision about the matter from the state comptroller. The bookstore contract for 1998 also included that a new building to house it would be constructed. Howard ended up contracting with Barnes & Noble amid appeals to the state comptroller by two of three bidders for the bookstore contract.Campus bookstore change could raise student prices, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 1 August 1998, Paluch, M., Retrieved 5 February 2014. In a 1998 article by FSA President Michael Paluch that appeared in The Buffalo News, Paluch stated that, as a result of the change, \\"Textbook prices will be higher, student wages will be lower, and the college will get substantially less construction dollars for a new store from Barnes & Noble than from the Faculty-Student Association.\\" Professional endeavors In 1996, Howard spoke at a businesswomen's networking luncheon reception at the College that celebrated Women's History Month, and more specifically, Women's History Week.A potpourri on all aspects of women's history, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 9 March 1996, Swift, P., Retrieved 6 February 2014. In 1998, Howard attended the second conference of African-American college presidents, held in Washington, DC.Black leaders of colleges evaluate their numbers, The Washington Post, Washington, DC: The Washington Post, 14 June 1998, Goodman, P.S., Retrieved 4 February 2014.

Goodman stated that only 26 college presidents in the United States at the time were African-American, this number being reflective of the more than 1,800 colleges in America that are majority-white. The main purpose of the conference was to create dialogue about race in higher education and to increase the numbers of African-Americans holding top leadership posts in American academia. Tenure culmination When Howard announced that she was leaving the college to take on the national role of leading the AASCU, an organization that advocates for and promotes the interests of 430 public colleges and universities, Hoyt stated that her crowning achievement at the college was likely the Burchfield Penney Arts Center.Howard is departing Buffalo State for D.C. lobbying job, McClatchy - Tribune Business News, Washington, DC: McClatchy-Tribune Business News, 1 April 2009, Rey, J., Retrieved 5 February 2014.

He additionally stated that she would be difficult to replace, and that she would be sorely missed. Her leadership of the College provided increased stability for it, as well as increased student enrollment during her 13 years there. During her last year as president of the college, Howard's salary was reported to be $220,000.

Another concern of the group is that revitalization of the economy in the area must occur in addition to the completion of individual construction projects.

He is known for his significant role in the 1990s Aluminium in Russia, and his business ventures in Israel. He is also the founder of the Michael Cherney Foundation and a sponsor of The Intelligence Summit.\\"Kenneth Timmerman's Iranian 'Democracy' and the 'Intelligence' Summit\\", Ron Jacobs, 1 February 2006 (Monthly Review Zine website) Biography Cherney grew up in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, in a Jewish family whose father was a book-keeper and an engineer, the eldest of three sons. At the age of fourteen, Cherney started working, as he joined his father on moonlighting jobs. After high school, he was drafted into the Soviet Army and attended a technical college. Later, his athletic pursuits – boxing and football – led to employment in sports administration. In the early 1990s Cherney immigrated to Israel but kept close ties to Bulgaria, where he had bought a leading newspaper, a top football team and Bulgaria's only mobile phone company, Mobiltel. In August 2000 Bulgarian authorities denounced what they said were his ties to foreign criminal rackets and expelled him, saying he could not return to Bulgaria for 10 years. Furthermore, the United States has \\"denied Cherney a visa since 1999 because of alleged ties to the Russian mafia, according to The St. Petersburg Times\\". Cherney is wanted on an Interpol international arrest warrant on allegations of money laundering and organised crime, but in June 2010 The Jerusalem Post reported that Cherney is preparing an application to contest it before the European Union Court of Human Rights.Wanted: CHERNEY, MichaelInterpol In August 2010 the Israeli TV Channel Two aired a short program about the most expensive and lavish wedding ceremony in Israel until that time, costing 20 million ILS (about 5 million US dollars). The program revealed that the bride was Cherny's daughter, that the wedding was paid by him and that Israeli ministers and members of parliament (Knesset) of Russian origin attended.The most expensive wedding in Israel (Hebrew, TV Channel 2 Israel account on YouTube) Business interests TWG and founding of the Russian aluminium industry Cherney, together with his brother Lev Cherney and UK metals traders David and Simon Reuben, founded Trans-World Group (TWG) – the first and largest private company in Russia, which produced aluminium and sold it on Western markets. BusinessWeek reports that the brothers \\"were known for their rough style of doing business\\". In 1994, TWG was drawn into a government inquiry into the theft of more than $US100 million from Russia's central bank by a number of separate criminal groups during the early 1990s. In an article on TWG, Fortune magazine reported: \\"That a theft occurred is not in dispute, nor is the fact that the Cherneys ended up with a piece of the stolen money and used it to partially fund Trans World's startup phase in 1992.... The inquiry's objective was to determine whether the Cherneys knew the funds were indeed stolen.\\" In an attempt to clean up its reputation and refute allegations of questionable business practices, the Reuben brothers hired Mayer Brown & Platt, a US-based law firm. Terrence Burke, an investigator employed by the law firm and former acting head of the DEA, recommended that the Reubens sever their ties with Cherney after the FBI told him that \\"it believed Michael himself was an organised crime figure.\\" As a result, Michael was paid $US400 million \\"just to go away\\" while his brother Lev remained with the company. In August 2001 a Fortune article notes, \\"the prosecutor's office in Düsseldorf notified the Reuben brothers that it had terminated its probe into alleged money laundering, saying 'I hereby confirm expressly that there is no remaining suspicion of money laundering or any other criminal actions.'\\" However, the same article states that the Kroll report \\"doesn't discuss an essential part of the story\\", nor does it \\"explore the complex business and financial relationships in Russia between the Reubens and Lev and Michael Chernoy.\\" SuAl and partnership with Oleg Deripaska According to the Financial Times, in 1994, Oleg Deripaska, then an independent metals trader, won the backing of Cherney and TWG to become general manager of Sayansk aluminium plant in Siberia, which lead to formation of SibAl and a partnership between Cherney and Oleg Deripaska in this company. BulgarTabac In 2002, 80% of the capital in the Bulgarian State-owned tobacco company, Bulgartabac, was placed on the market. In April 2002 Cherney put together a three-partner consortium called \\"Metatabac\\" to bid for Bulgartabac. Ownership was structured between three groups: the Russian firm Soyuzcontracttabac, which owned 35%, MCG Holdings, a firm owned by Cherney, which owned 35%, and another 30% held by a Cypriot company named Metacontact Ltd. Mobiltel In 2002 Cherney was involved in the selling-on of the Bulgarian mobile provider Mobiltel. Cherney bought the company together with Austrian business men Martin Schlaff, former minister of the Austrian People's Party Josef Taus, and financial expert Herbert Cordt. The 768 million Euro deal was financed by BAWAG P.S.K.. In 2005 Mobiltel was sold for 1.6 billion euros to Mobilkom Austria Group with a huge profit of 830 million Euros.Schlaff, Elsner, Birdie und Telekom Critics found it hard to understand \\"why the state bought an asset for such a high price from someone who was effectively a go-between who stood to pocket a fat profit, rather than directly from the original owner of the company\\". The Intelligence Summit Cherney is the founder and primary sponsor of the Intelligence Summit. In February 2006, The New York Sun reported that John Deutch and James Woolsey had resigned from the Intelligence Summit's board of advisers after receiving information that the conference's primary sponsor, Cherney, had \\"alleged ties to the Russian mafia\\". Legal investigations Invalid passport On 21 May 1994, Cherney and his future wife were detained by immigration officers on arrival in Heathrow from Geneva. It was discovered that they had attempted to enter the UK on false Polish passports and they were deported back to Switzerland. The following day they were arrested by the Swiss police on the grounds that they had made use of false identities. Both were searched and found to be in possession of two allegedly invalid Polish driving licences. Cherney gave a statement to the police in which he admitted using a Polish passport in an attempt to enter the UK, which had been successful previously. On 25 October 1994 the Swiss authorities confirmed that they would not be pressing any charges against Cherney. On 20 November 1996 the Swiss Federal Aliens Office confirmed that he was no longer subject to a prohibition order and that there was nothing to prevent his coming into Switzerland. Alleged illegal payments to Avigdor Lieberman Cherney is a close friend of Avigdor Lieberman who allegedly received millions of shekels from various entrepreneurs, including Cherney, while serving as member of Knesset; under Israeli law, MKs are not allowed to receive any payment beyond their salary. One claim is that Cherney paid a company called Path to the East large amounts of money between the years 1999 and 2006, and that these sums were then allegedly passed on to Lieberman as a bribe. Other allegations concern a company called M.L.1, founded by Lieberman's daughter Michal when she was 21. These allegations concern money transferred to M.L.1 from unknown sources outside Israel; the money was later allegedly used for paying salaries to Avigdor and Michal Lieberman. In April 2007, Israeli police questioned Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, on suspicions of illegally financing his 2001 electoral campaign. According to the police, in May 2001, three months after Lieberman was appointed Minister of Infrastructure in Ariel Sharon's Cabinet, approximately $US500,000 was transferred to the bank accounts of Lieberman associates through Cyprus. This money could be traced back to Cherney. Cherney's attorney, Yaakov Weinroth, said the money was transferred by his client \\"for a totally transparent, legal wine deal\\". In May 2011, Haaretz reported that the Israeli Attorney General had issued a draft indictment against Avigdor Lieberman for fraud and money laundering, including allegations against Cherny. A second Haaretz article detailing the draft indictment reported that a company owned by Cherney had paid $US500,000 to a company owned by Avigdor Lieberman in May 2001. It added, \\"Prosecutors say Lieberman then used his government posts to try to restore Chernoy's Israeli passport, which he had been stripped of in 1999, and to assist him in other personal matters.\\" Cherney was acquitted. Over the years, Cherney's passport was returned by the Israeli authorities. Bezeq affair In 1999, businessman Gad Zeevi purchased shares in the Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq on behalf of businesses he owned. According to an indictment filed in 2004, Cherney provided the financial guarantee for the purchase—information that Cherney and Zeevi hid from the banks financing the deal, in fear that Cherney's direct involvement would not be approved by the Israeli ministry of communications. In 2015, Cherney, Zeevi and a number of other defendants were cleared of all charges, with the court stating that the information had not in fact been hidden, and the fact that Cherney loaned the necessary funds to Zeevi did not constitute fraud against Bezeq. Spanish allegations and attempted arrest in the United Kingdom According to sources cited in the Spanish daily El Mundo, Spanish authorities sought Cherney in connection to \\"Operation Avispa\\", a 2005 investigation that had resulted in the arrest of several prominent Russian mafia figures. The investigators believe that Cherney managed several Spanish businesses, registered in Alicante and Levante, used by the mafia for money laundering of 4 million euros. In May 2009, Spain's Supreme Court issued a detention order against Cherney. Along with his business partners Oleg Deripaska (head of RusAl) and Iskander Makhmudov (head of UGMK), Cherney is suspected of laundering money. The Spanish authorities claim they succeeded in tracing the organization's complicated money laundering track, including Deripaska's, Makhmudov's and Cherney's alleged participation. As a result, Interpol issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney. U.S. diplomatic cable from U.S. Embassy in Madrid released 7 December 2010. Lawsuit against Oleg Deripaska On 24 November 2006, Cherney filed a suit against Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who owns the huge Russian aluminium company, RusAl, in the Commercial Court of London's High Court. Cherney sought a Court declaration affirming that Deripaska holds 20% of the RusAl shares on behalf of Cherney or damages for breach of Deripaska's agreement to dispose of the shares and to account to Cherney for the proceeds. The claims are based on a written agreement between the two businessmen that was signed in a London hotel room in March 2001. Deripaska denies that Cherney owns shares and said in an affidavit that his relationship with Cherney was one of a businessman being extorted by a crime boss. After the 2001 meeting, Deripaska paid Cherney $US250 million. As of December 2006 RusAl was in the final stages of negotiating a takeover of domestic rival SuAl and the aluminium assets of Glencore, a major Swiss commodities trader, which could create a new company valued at up to $US30 billion. According to this estimate, Cherney's 20 percent stake in RusAl could be worth as much as $US3 billion.MSNBC report on lawsuit against Deripaska On 3 July 2008, a British judge ruled that Cherney had the right to sue Deripaska for £2 billion. High Court Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that Cherney might be assassinated or held on trumped-up charges if he tried to bring the case in Russia. At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person as an outstanding Interpol arrest warrant means he would be detained if he visited the UK. In late July 2011, the High Court ruled that Cherney may give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel and set trial for April 2012. The case was settled out of court between Cherney and Deripaska in September 2012. Illegal wiretaps On 13 January 2010, a Tel Aviv Court handed down its first verdict in the case of illegal eavesdropping on Cherney. Aviv Mor, a private investigator was found guilty of illegally gathering information of personal nature - in particular, tapping the phones of Cherney and sentenced to a plea bargained result which handed down a 14-month sentence to Mor. Part of the sentence will be in the form of community service and the rest will be a suspended sentence. The District attorney's office stated in court that the cases of other suspects in the illegal data collection case \\"are at an advanced stage and close to indictment .\\" In February 2008 Cheney filed a suit in a Tel Aviv court that alleged the illegal spying was commissioned by a Russian citizen, Alexei Drobashenko who at the time was the head of the External Relations department at Basic Element, a financial and industrial group that belongs to Oleg Deripaska. Cherney claimed that it was this Russian oligarch, acting through Drobashenko, who had hired Eskin, Pridan and Mor. In his claim, Cherney accused a group of 10 plotters, including Oleg Deripaska, Alexei Drobashenko and the already sentenced Aviv Mor, of illegal wiretapping, hacking the computers of his charity fund, publishing slanderous articles, and harassing him with insulting graffities and leaflets.

The model has successfully passed test flights under battery power and Smartfish is going forward with development to a 2-man aircraft.Hyfish Fuel Cell Treehugger News General history The Hyfish is a product of the German Air & Spacecenter and its international partners.Howard, Courtney E. \\"Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Technology Takes Off, Powering Hyfish UAV. (Cover Story).\\" Military & Aerospace Electronics 18.6 (2007): 1-14. The German Air & Spacecenter, otherwise known as the Deutsches Zentrum fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt, or DLR, is located in Stuttgart, Germany. These partners included, but were not limited to, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies of Singapore. Development of the Hyfish, an unmanned aerial vehicle that is jet powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology, took eighteen months of hard-work and laboring research. Unmanned aerial vehicles are also called UAVs. UAVs are difficult to power because they have to be small and light in order to be able to maintain flight in the air. To resolve this challenge, Scientists at the DLR Institute for Technical Thermodynamics in Stuttgart integrated Horizon Fuel Cell Technology's fuel cell system into the Hyfish. In order to prepare the Hyfish for flight, the SmartFish team had to test the CFD of the aircraft numerous times.\\"HyFish.\\" Smartfish. Team Smartfish GmbH, 2003. . The most influential reasoning behind the creation of the Hyfish was to demonstrate and test the effectiveness of fuel cells in a challenging environment, which in this case, involved flight in the air. However, the construction of the Hyfish also helped researchers educate themselves more in the subject of lightweight construction in addition to the subject of the packaging of fuel cell systems. This unmanned UAV took its first flight in 2007 in Bern, Switzerland. A birds-eye view of Bern, Switzerland, where the Hyfish took its first flight The Hyfish was put on display at the Hannover fair, otherwise known in Germany as the Hannover Messe, for spectators. This event lasted April 16–20, 2007.\\"HyFish: A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Powered UAV.\\" Tech Industry News, 16 Apr. 2007. . Fuel cell The Hyfish hydrogen fuel cell system had some unique attributes. It was ultra light and compact, which helped to keep the UAV's weight to 13.2 pounds. This fuel cell created no emissions, another great attribute, and consisted of polymer electrolyte. Because of this, it was able to create one kilowatt of electrical power output. All in all, the fuel cell weighed a measly 6.6 pounds, which included its pressurized hydrogen tank. The fuel cell stack gave power to an impeller jet which enabled flight for about six minutes, despite the less than ideal weather conditions for such an experiment. This kind of technology is what is used in jet skis.\\"Fuel Cell-Powered Model Jet UAV Performs Aerobatics in Maiden Flight.\\" The Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Letter. Berne, Switzerland. May 2007. >. The Hyfish excited scientists and made history because it was the first fast plane with jet wings to fly with only a hydrogen fuel cell and its only power source. It performed vertical climbs into the air, loops, circles, and various other aerial acrobatics and tricks while flying at extremely fast speeds reaching 124 miles per hour. George Gu, president and CEO of Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, verbally displayed his high hopes for the future of UAVs: \\"We are confident that record-breaking 15 to 30 hour flight times are now within reach for small UAVs, which would offer new and distruptive possibilities in the aviation industry.\\" The Hyfish development team included some notable and accomplished Scientists and researchers. SmartFish GmbH of Bern, Switzerland, developed the flight model. The gas-cell stack was designed and created by Horizon Fuel Technologies in Singapore. Drukon, located in Spitzkunnersdorf, Germany, developed and oversaw the pressure-reducing valve. And finally, Ainet in Germany developed the building of forms. Computer generated model of the Hyfish Other features Other features of the Hyfish were just as revolutionary as the hydrogen fuel cell, including the fuselage which was four feet long. The wings of this UAV were a mere three feet wide, an extremely small measurement. The composite structure of the Hyfish was completed and overseen by the company LTB Borowski. The vast majority of the parts that constructed the Hyfish were made from glass fibers. In other statistics, the thrust-to-weight ratio of the Hyfish was measured to be 1:3. The Hyfish was readily equipped to be able to fly at speeds ranging from 200 miles per hour to 300 kilometers per hour and at altitudes as high as 7,000 meters. The name is no coincidence; the Hyfish was actually inspired by a fish.\\"HyFish.\\" AFCS: Aircraft Fuel Cell Systems. AFCS GmbH, 2006. Web. 04 Mar. 2013. . Future applications Scientists and researchers will continue further research into these technologies to learn more about them. They have pondered the ability for such hydrogen-powered aircraft technologies to be able to monitor weather patterns at high altitudes. Scientists have also played around with the idea that the Hyfish could possibly lead to innovations that could take air samples to search for threatening and dangerous gases that could be in the atmosphere. Scientists have high hopes for the Hyfish technology and zero emission creation to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from aviation. These gases deplete the ozone layer and pose extreme threats to the environment. Aviation impact alone represents 9% of the total amount of emissions that are let into the atmosphere. Researchers from Smartfish hope to incorporate this design of the Hyfish into larger aircraft. Ideally, this idea would eventually lead way to commercial aviation to create aircraft that could hold a handful of passengers.

Fuller was part of a team in basic research that found answers to physical challenges. He helped develop synthetic rubber during World War II, he was involved in early experiments of zone melting, he is credited with devising the method of transistor production yielding diffusion transistors, he produced some of the first solar cells with high efficiency, and he researched polymers and their applications. Early life Calvin Souther Fuller at work (left) at a printing press as a teenager at the end of World War I. Calvin Fuller was born in Chicago 25 May 1902 to Julius Quincy and Bessie Souther Fuller. Studying chemistry at the University of Chicago, he received his B.S. in 1926, and working with William Draper Harkins, earned a Ph.D. degree in 1929. From 1920 to 1922 he worked for the General Chemical Company, and from 1924 to 1930 for the Chicago Tribune. In 1930 he moved to Murray Hill, New Jersey to take up a position as physical chemist for Bell Labs. On 17 September 1932 he married Willimine Works.Allen G. Debus (1968) World Who's Who in Science, Marquis-Who's Who In August 1942 Fuller became part of the effort to develop synthetic rubber as the supply of natural rubber was cut off by the Japanese. He travelled widely in the USA representing the Office of Rubber Reserve in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The effort involved several academic and industrial laboratories as well as scientists W.O. Baker and J.H. Heiss of Bell Labs. In 16 months they were able to begin production of Government Rubber-Styrene. Fuller and Baker developed methods to perfect the chemical process for large scale manufacturing. There were 700,000 tons of the synthetic rubber produced in 1945. Millman(1983) p 519 M.D. Fagan (1978) A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System, volume 2: National Service in War and Peace, p 345, Bell Labs, Solar battery Working with Bell Telephone scientists Daryl Chapin and Gerald Pearson, Fuller diffused boron into silicon to capture the sun's power. In doing so, they created the first practical means of collecting energy from the sun and turning it into a current of electricity. The invention of the solar battery resulted in a 600% improvement in the ability to harness the sun's power into electricity. First, Fuller ensured that silicon was uncorrupted and pure. Then Fuller accomplished the diffusion of boron into silicon. The inventors used several small strips of silicon to capture sunlight and render it into free electrons. Bell Laboratories, who had funded the research, announced the prototype manufacture of a new solar battery.Millman (1983) p 432 Robert W. Fuller, Calvin S. Fuller's oldest son, tells the following story: \\"In 1954 I was home from vacation from college to visit my parents. That night my father, Calvin Souther Fuller, came home with something that looked like a quarter with wires sticking out of it. This was a device that connected to a small electric windmill that stood on the table. He shined a bright flashlight on the quarter-like object, which was actually silicon solar cell, and the blades of the windmill started turning. It was so exciting to see the flashlight power the tiny windmill. While this device looked like a quarter to anyone else, it was actually the world’s first silicon solar battery - a device that later become known as the silicon solar cell.\\" The first public service trial of the Bell Solar Battery began with a telephone carrier system in 1955 in Americus, Georgia. By 1958, the US Department of Defense realized an extremely valuable application of this device as it deployed self-sufficient, power to vehicles and satellites in space. Polymers Fuller did basic research on polymers at Bell Labs. He studied how the bonds of the mers determined elasticity and tensile strength. Extending the work of Carothers at Du Pont, he investigated the condensation polymers polyester and polyamide.Millman(1983) p 482 Bell was seeking an ideal insulator to use in coaxial cables which would be effective for high frequency operation. Realizing that polyethelene was free of polar groups, Fuller produced some of the first cable with this now common insulator.Millman (1983) p 484 Personal life Calvin S. Fuller was married to Willmine Fuller. They had three children, Robert W. Fuller, Stephen Fuller, and John Fuller and eight grandchildren. Fuller moved to Vero Beach, Florida when he reached age 65 and was subject to mandatory retirement from Bell Labs. In retirement he acquired an Airstream RV and traveled widely in the USA with Willmine. In 1994 Fuller died in Vero Beach, Florida at age 92. According to stories told by Calvin's son Robert Fuller to his grandson, Ben Fuller, Calvin Fuller's hobbies included cultivating large red homegrown tomatoes in his New Jersey garden, photography of family and landscape images, and being capable of performing a wide range of home repairs and home improvements.

He was born to Simon Bojer and Barbara Staub. As a young man he was sent on expeditions to Africa and Mauritus by Franz Sieber. In 1821 he arrived at Mauritius. In 1822 the Mauritian governor Robert Townsend Farquhar sent him to Madagascar. He was accompanied by Malagasy Prince Rafaria who studied on Mauritius and James Hastie, a Scottish corporal and British envoy for King Radama I on Madagascar. Bojer explored the west coast of Madagascar before he arrived in Tananarive. In 1824 Bojer was sent to Africa as an interpreter. He explored several coasts of the African continent and collected a huge amount of minerals and plants. In 1829 he was one of the co-founders of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences (SRAS) at Mauritius. He died of paralysis in 1856. Many species of plants and animals (especially from Madagascar and the Mascarenes) were named after Bojer, including Gongylomorphus bojerii (Bojer's skink),Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The Middle Party played only a marginal role in Dutch politics. Party history Election poster from 1929 The party was founded by Abraham Staalman who had previously been member of the liberal Liberal State Party (LSP) after his own Middle Class Party had merged into that. Before the elections of 1929 Staalman had founded his own party and had left the LSP parliamentary party. The Middle Party entered in the 1929 elections, who held a personality-based campaign around the Bussum milk industrial and anti-toll campaigner Floris Vos. The Middle Party was able to win one seat in the House of Representatives. The party played a marginal role in parliament. Vos came into conflict with Staalman over his support for a law on mandatory closing times for shops. The party consequently fell apart in parties around Staalman and Vos, who fought legal battles over the ownership of the party's name. Neither party entered in the 1933 election. Ideology and issues The party wanted to increase public wealth by reducing the restrictions for trade, industry and agriculture. The most important issues of the Middle Party were the abolition of trade restriction, especially toll roads, import tariffs and several levies. The party wanted to reduce government expenditure by reducing the number of civil servants and the replacement of unemployment benefits by public works programs. Leadership and support This table shows the Middle Party's results in elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !

A gene cluster is a group of two or more genes found within an organism's DNA that encode similar polypeptides, or proteins, which collectively share a generalized function and are often located within a few thousand base pairs of each other. The size of gene clusters can vary significantly, from a few genes to several hundred genes. Portions of the DNA sequence of each gene within a gene cluster are found to be identical; however, the resulting protein of each gene is distinctive from the resulting protein of another gene within the cluster. Genes found in a gene cluster may be observed near one another on the same chromosome or on different, but homologous chromosomes. An example of a gene cluster is the Hox gene, which is made up of eight genes and is part of the Homeobox gene family. Hox genes have been observed among various phylum. Eight genes make up the Hox gene Drosophila. The number of Hox genes may vary among organisms, but the Hox genes collectively make up the Homeobox family. Formation Historically, four models have been proposed for the formation and persistence of gene clusters.  Gene duplication and divergence  This model has been generally accepted since the mid-1970s. It postulates that gene clusters were formed as a result of gene duplication and divergence. These gene clusters include the Hox gene cluster, the human β-globin gene cluster, and four clustered human growth hormone (hGH)/chorionic somaomammotropin genes. Conserved gene clusters, such as Hox and the human β-globin gene cluster, may be formed as a result of the process of gene duplication and divergence. A gene is duplicated during cell division, so that its descendants have two end-to-end copies of the gene where it had one copy, initially coding for the same protein or otherwise having the same function. In the course of subsequent evolution, they diverge, so that the products they code for have different but related functions, with the genes still being adjacent on the chromosome. Ohno theorized that the origin of new genes during evolution was dependent on gene duplication. If only a single copy of a gene existed in the genome of a species, the proteins transcribed from this gene would be essential to their survival. Because there was only a single copy of the gene, they could not undergo mutations which would potentially result in new genes; however, gene duplication allows essential genes to undergo mutations in the duplicated copy, which would ultimately give rise to new genes over the course of evolution. Mutations in the duplicated copy were tolerated because the original copy contained genetic information for the essential gene's function. Species who have gene clusters have a selective evolutionary advantage because natural selection must keep the genes together. Over a short span of time, the new genetic information exhibited by the duplicated copy of the essential gene would not serve a practical advantage; however, over a long, evolutionary time period, the genetic information in the duplicated copy may undergo additional and drastic mutations in which the proteins of the duplicated gene served a different role than those of the original essential gene. Over the long, evolutionary time period, the two similar genes would diverge so the proteins of each gene were unique in their functions. Hox gene clusters, ranging in various sizes, are found among several phyla.  Hox cluster  When gene duplication occurs to produce a gene cluster, one or multiple genes may be duplicated at once. In the case of the Hox gene, a shared ancestral ProtoHox cluster was duplicated, resulting in genetic clusters in the Hox gene as well as the ParaHox gene, an evolutionary sister complex of the Hox gene. It is unknown the exact number of genes contained in the duplicated Protohox cluster; however, models exist suggesting that the duplicated Protohox cluster originally contained four, three, or two genes. In the case where a gene cluster is duplicated, some genes may be lost. Loss of genes is dependent of the number of genes originating in the gene cluster. In the four gene model, the ProtoHox cluster contained four genes which resulted in two twin clusters: the Hox cluster and the ParaHox cluster. As its name indicates, the two gene model gave rise to the Hox cluster and the ParaHox cluster as a result of the ProtoHox cluster which contained only two genes. The three gene model was originally proposed in conjunction with the four gene model; however, rather than the Hox cluster and the ParaHox cluster resulting from a cluster containing three genes, the Hox cluster and ParaHox cluster were as a result of single gene tandem duplication, identical genes found adjacent on the same chromosome. This was independent of duplication of the ancestral ProtoHox cluster. Intrachromosomal duplication is the duplication of genes within the same chromosome over the course of evolution (a-1). Mutations may occur in the duplicated copy, such as observed with the substitution of guanine with adenine (a-2). Alignment of DNA sequences exhibits homology between the two chromosomes (a-3). All segments were duplicated from the same ancestral DNA sequence as observed by the comparisons in b(i-iii).  Cis vs. trans duplication  Gene duplication may occur via cis-duplication or trans duplication. Cis-duplication, or intrachromosomal duplication, entails the duplication of genes within the same chromosome whereas trans duplication, or interchromosomal duplication, consists of duplicating genes on neighboring but separate chromosomes. The formations of the Hox cluster and of the ParaHox cluster were results of intrachromosomal duplication, although they were initially thought to be interchromosomal.  Fisher Model  The Fisher Model was proposed in 1930 by Ronald Fisher. Under the Fisher Model, gene clusters are a result of two alleles working well with one another. In other words, gene clusters may exhibit co-adaptation. The Fisher Model was considered unlikely and later dismissed as an explanation for gene cluster formation.  Coregulation Model  Under the coregulation model, genes are organized into clusters, each consisting of a single promoter and a cluster of coding sequences, which are therefore co-regulated, showing coordinated gene expression. Coordinated gene expression was once considered to be the most common mechanism driving the formation of gene clusters. However coregulation and thus coordinated gene expression cannot drive the formation of gene clusters.  Molarity Model  The Molarity Model considers the constraints of cell size. Transcribing and translating genes together is beneficial to the cell. thus the formation of clustered genes generates a high local concentration of cytoplasmic protein products. Spatial segregation of protein products has been observed in bacteria; however, the Molarity Model does not consider co-transcription or distribution of genes found within an operon.  Gene clusters vs. tandem arrays  Tandem duplication is the process in which one gene is duplicated and the resulting copy is found adjacent to the original gene. Tandemly arrayed genes are formed as a result of tandem duplications.Repeated genes can occur in two major patterns: gene clusters and tandem arrays, or formerly called tandemly arrayed genes. Although similar, gene clusters and tandemly arrayed genes may be distinguished from one another.  Gene Clusters  Gene clusters are found to be close to one another when observed on the same chromosome. They are dispersed randomly; however, gene clusters are normally within, at most, a few thousand bases of each other. The distance between each gene in the gene cluster can vary. The DNA found between each repeated gene in the gene cluster is non-conserved. Portions of the DNA sequence of a gene is found to be identical in genes contained in a gene cluster. Gene conversion is the only method in which gene clusters may become homogenized. Although the size of a gene cluster may vary, it rarely comprises more than 50 genes, making clusters stable in number. Gene clusters change over a long evolutionary time period, which does not result in genetic complexity.  Tandem arrays  Tandem arrays are a group of genes with the same or similar function that are repeated consecutively without space between each gene. The genes are organized in the same orientation. Unlike gene clusters, tandemly arrayed genes are found to consist of consecutive, identical repeats, separated only by a nontranscribed spacer region. While the genes contained in a gene cluster encode for similar proteins, identical proteins or functional RNAs are encoded by tandemly arrayed genes. Unequal recombination, which changes the number of repeats by placing duplicated genes next to the original gene. Unlike gene clusters, tandemly arrayed genes rapidly change in response to the needs of the environment, causing an increase in genetic complexity. Gene conversion allows tandemly arrayed genes to become homogenized, or identical. Gene conversion may be allelic or ectopic. Allelic gene conversion occurs when one allele of a gene is converted to the other allele as a result of mismatch base pairing during meiosis homologous recombination. Ectopic gene conversion occurs when one homologous DNA sequence is replaced by another. Ectopic gene conversion is the driving force for concerted evolution of gene families. Tandemly arrayed genes are essential to maintain large gene families, such as ribosomal RNA. In the eukaryotic genome, tandemly arrayed genes make up ribosomal RNA. Tandemly repeated rRNAs are essential to maintain the RNA transcript. One RNA gene may not be able to provide a sufficient amount of RNA. In this situation, tandem repeats of the gene allow a sufficient amount of RNA to be provided. For example, human embryonic cells contain 5-10 million ribosomes and double in number within 24 hours. In order to provide a substantive number of ribosomes, multiple RNA polymerases must consecutively transcribe multiple rRNA genes.

Also known as classification or statistical classification, pattern recognition aims at building a classifier that can determine the class of an input pattern. This procedure, known as training, corresponds to learning an unknown decision function based only on a set of input-output pairs (\\\\boldsymbol{x}_i,y_i) that form the training data (or training set). Nonetheless, in real world applications such as character recognition, a certain amount of information on the problem is usually known beforehand. The incorporation of this prior knowledge into the training is the key element that will allow an increase of performance in many applications.  Prior Knowledge  Prior knowledgeB. Scholkopf and A. Smola, \\"Learning with Kernels\\", MIT Press 2002. refers to all information about the problem available in addition to the training data. However, in this most general form, determining a model from a finite set of samples without prior knowledge is an ill-posed problem, in the sense that a unique model may not exist. Many classifiers incorporate the general smoothness assumption that a test pattern similar to one of the training samples tends to be assigned to the same class. The importance of prior knowledge in machine learning is suggested by its role in search and optimization. Loosely, the no free lunch theorem states that all search algorithms have the same average performance over all problems, and thus implies that to gain in performance on a certain application one must use a specialized algorithm that includes some prior knowledge about the problem. The different types of prior knowledge encountered in pattern recognition are now regrouped under two main categories: class-invariance and knowledge on the data.  Class-invariance  A very common type of prior knowledge in pattern recognition is the invariance of the class (or the output of the classifier) to a transformation of the input pattern. This type of knowledge is referred to as transformation-invariance. The mostly used transformations used in image recognition are: * translation; * rotation; * skewing; * scaling. Incorporating the invariance to a transformation T_{\\\\theta}: \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\mapsto T_{\\\\theta}\\\\boldsymbol{x} parametrized in \\\\theta into a classifier of output f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) for an input pattern \\\\boldsymbol{x} corresponds to enforcing the equality : f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = f(T_{\\\\theta}\\\\boldsymbol{x}), \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\boldsymbol{x}, \\\\theta . Local invariance can also be considered for a transformation centered at \\\\theta=0, so that T_0\\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\boldsymbol{x}, by using the constraint : \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\right_{\\\\theta=0} f(T_{\\\\theta} \\\\boldsymbol{x}) = 0 . The function f in these equations can be either the decision function of the classifier or its real-valued output. Another approach is to consider class-invariance with respect to a \\"domain of the input space\\" instead of a transformation. In this case, the problem becomes finding f so that : f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = y_{\\\\mathcal{P}},\\\\ \\\\forall \\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} , where y_{\\\\mathcal{P}} is the membership class of the region \\\\mathcal{P} of the input space. A different type of class-invariance found in pattern recognition is permutation-invariance, i.e. invariance of the class to a permutation of elements in a structured input. A typical application of this type of prior knowledge is a classifier invariant to permutations of rows of the matrix inputs.  Knowledge of the data  Other forms of prior knowledge than class- invariance concern the data more specifically and are thus of particular interest for real-world applications. The three particular cases that most often occur when gathering data are: * Unlabeled samples are available with supposed class-memberships; * Imbalance of the training set due to a high proportion of samples of a class; * Quality of the data may vary from a sample to another. Prior knowledge of these can enhance the quality of the recognition if included in the learning. Moreover, not taking into account the poor quality of some data or a large imbalance between the classes can mislead the decision of a classifier.  Notes   References  * E. Krupka and N.

Family connections Christopher Pitt came from a family wide-spread in the West of England. Several of them had a political career, of whom the best known was William Pitt the Elder, a descendant of Christopher’s second cousin, Thomas Pitt.The Works of Thomas Carlyle, Cambridge University, 2010, Volume 30, p.139 Pitt himself was the second son of Dr Christopher Pitt, a respected physician at Blandford Forum. Having a Classical education himself, the father contributed a translation of the episode on the plague of Athens to Thomas Creech’s edition of Lucretius, while Robert Pitt, Christopher’s elder brother, followed his father’s medical profession, wrote on medical matters and also translated the first five books of Paradise Lost into Latin verse. There is a strong sense of family connections in Christopher Pitt’s poetical career. His first published work as an undergraduate, \\"A Poem on the death of the late Earl Stanhope\\" (1721), was dedicated to the earl’s widow, who was Christopher’s second cousin, Lucy. His collection of Poems & Translations (1727) was dedicated to his uncle, George Pitt of Stratfield Saye. And among his later poems were Horatian epistles addressed to John Pitt, another second cousin and one of Lucy’s brothers. Life Pitt was educated at Winchester College and went on to study at New College, Oxford in 1719. He is credited with arriving there with two manuscript volumes of his verse, one of which was a translation of Lucan’s Pharsalia. However, on discovering that Nicholas Rowe had already made a good translation of Lucan’s work, he never submitted his for publication. However, in 1721 he published two shorter works, the \\"Poem on the death of the late Earl Stanhope\\"Google Books and - anonymously as \\"a person of quality\\" - \\"The Plague of Marseilles\\".pp.20-22 His translation of Marco Girolamo Vida’s Art of PoetryHathi Trust in 1725 brought him some reputation and also the friendship of Alexander Pope, whose own An Essay on Criticism (a work that Pitt judiciously echoed in homage) covered much the same ground. From then on his time was divided between religious duties, which left him ample leisure for continuing his literary work, to visiting friends, and to recurring periods of gout. A facetious poem by his \\"brother\\" poet describes one such episode while paying tribute to his version of the Aeneid.Published in The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle,, for April 1775,p.193 This ambitious translation project, completed in 1740, guaranteed frequent publication of all his poetry for the rest of the century, as well as a biographical preface in Samuel Johnson’s Lives of the Poets. Christopher Pitt had been presented with the rectory of Pimperne by his uncle George and, having taken holy orders, lived there permanently from 1724. After his death in 1748 tributes noted that he died without a single enemy,The Poetical Works of Christopher Pitt, Edinburgh 1782, vol.2, p.vi and also echoed the wording on the memorial tablet in the church at Blandford referring to \\"the universal candour of his mind and the primitive simplicity of his manner\\".

Mattes holds an advanced degree in Communication Research from the University of Wisconsin and a law degree from the University of Miami. Before working for Fox, he served as a County Supervisor and city council member in Madison, Wisconsin and practiced law in Miami, Florida focusing on Public Policy Investigation. Journalistic work Iran-Contra affair While in Miami Mattes helped uncover illegal Contra gun and drug running in Central America and the role of Oliver North in the scandal. Mattes was one of the first persons to bring the Iran–Contra affair to the attention of Senator John Kerry. An aide to Senator Kerry at the time said “Quite frankly I don’t think our investigation would have proceeded without John”. As a Federal Defender in Miami, Mattes found himself in the thick of the cloak-and-dagger incidents of the Contras and their allies. Mattes defended self-described mercenary whistleblower and freelance intelligence operative Jack Terrell from charges he had violated the U.S. Neutrality Act because of his Contra-supply work. Ultimately the case was dismissed by a federal judge in 1990 on grounds that Terrell had not violated the neutrality act. In the course of legal discovery in the Terrell case, Mattes obtained stacks of previously classified documents about the secret Contra supply network. These he turned over to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and its Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Communications, headed by Senator John Kerry, which was then digging into Contra improprieties. The Kerry Committee report remains the most extensive inquiry into the Contra-CIA-drug connection. US Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs In 1992 Mattes served as Investigative Counsel to the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. As Investigative Counsel, Mattes conducted a nationwide investigation of bogus fundraisers who were claiming they would rescue POWS. After serving as counsel to the committee Mattes left and began his own investigation of POWS abandoned in Vietnam. In his investigation he uncovered a group of CIA assets left in Prisoner of War camps for decades. Based on what he uncovered Mattes filed suit in 1995 demanding back pay and recognition for the group, known as the Lost Army Commandos. The commandos acted as spies and saboteurs who infiltrated Communist territory. Between 1959 and 1964, 450 South Vietnamese commandos who were recruited, trained and paid by the U.S. government for a secret mission known as Operation 34-Alpha were captured in North Vietnam and Laos. Some were executed, while others were imprisoned and tortured. The last commando held captive was released in 1988. The Defense Department initially refused to acknowledge the commando mission, but Mattes discovered 500,000 pages of classified documents at the National Archives. The documents included pay rosters indicating that the Army listed the commandos as killed in action when they actually were in prison. The Army gave widows and survivors a minimal death payment of a few hundred dollars to close the cases. By declaring the prisoners dead, the Army no longer had to pay the families $2,000 a year while the commandos were in prison. It also kept the mission secret. After a three-year court battle Mattes won a 20 million dollar settlement for the Lost Army Commandos. In addition, Mattes also assisted in winning asylum for many POW families. ABC World News I-Team Mattes served as an investigative consultant for ABC World News I-Team based in Miami. After conducting a number of investigations into bogus charities and fraud for the network, Mattes became the chief investigative reporter for the TV station WAMI-TV in Miami. His investigations included uncovering a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at Miami International Airport, legal loan sharking in the auto title loan business, and financial ties between a local mayor and organized crime. From there, Mattes traveled across the country to become an investigative reporter for the nationally syndicated Uncovered TV in Los Angeles. His stories won him numerous awards and led one observer to suggest “They’re the kind of stories where John might want to be starting his car with a remote control” Investigative reporter Since 2002 Mattes has worked as an investigative reporter in San Diego, California. Mattes has founded InvestigativeGuy.com, an online site dedicated to working for consumers and exposing scams. Since the site has been created, a number of the scams exposed by the site have been shut down by law enforcement. During his time in San Diego Mattes has won numerous Emmy Awards, an Edward R. Murrow Award and a Golden Mike Award.  2016 U.S. Presidential Election  Since September 2016, Mattes has been investigating the interference of the Russian government in the U.S. Presidential Election of 2016. His investigation has been covered by numerous publications, including The Huffington Post, The New Yorker, and Buzzfeed. Mattes’s work was also covered on The Rachel Maddow show on March 21, 2017. Suleiman attack On September 6, 2006, Mattes received national attention when he was attacked by two people while investigating an alleged real estate scam. He had previously exposed the couple, Sam Suleiman and Rosa Barraza, in a series on mortgage fraud. He was injured with cracked ribs, bite wounds and cuts to his face. The attacking scene was caught on tape by his cameraman Dennis Waldrop. He was later interviewed by Bill O'Reilly on his show The O'Reilly Factor, as well as by television stations around the world after the video of the attack went viral. While Mattes recovered, the two attackers faced multiple charges. One week after the attack, Mattes returned to XETV to do an investigative report on mortgage fraud.

The Research Department's principal roles involve the analysis of information gathered by Aman's collection units and from the Intelligence Community at large; and forming tactical, strategic, and operative assessments, as well as reporting on the likelihood of war, and presenting these to military and political decisionmakers, including the Prime Minister. The Research Department is the most established, senior research branch in the Intelligence Community, and works closely with the research bodies of Mossad, Shabak, as well as those of the Airforce and Naval intelligence agencies, the regional command's intelligence research branches and other intelligence entities from the IDF, the Security Forces, and the military industries and development bodies. It has an available reserve of human resources it can draw upon from among active-service soldiers. The Department's activities are not limited to classical military intelligence research (i.e. purely military matters concerning hostile countries), but engages in a state, economic, industrial-developmental, internal security, and political areas which often do not have an immediate, literal military meaning. Israel is the only liberal-democracy in the world where military intelligence is charged with assessing the intelligence map on a national, military, and state levels, and there have been repeated calls to transfer some of these roles from the Research Department to a civilian body, such as the National Security Council, as is the case in the United States. The Department is currently led by Brigadier-General Itay Brun. History Although on the operative and tactical level, the Research Department has often proven quite successful, on the strategic and political front it has committed crucial failures which had a decisive impact on the course of Israeli and regional history. Above all others, the failure to warn that the Yom Kippur War was imminent, remains the Research Department's greatest blunder. The Agranat Commission, which investigated the failures of the war, very severely criticized Research in particular and the Intelligence Community, in general. A host of high-ranking intelligence officers were dismissed, most notably Aman Director, Aluf Eli Zeira, and head of Research, Brigadier-General Aryeh Shalev.

He became complacent after capturing Luoyang, however, and when the general Erzhu Rong, who supported Emperor Xiaozhuang, counterattacked later that year, Yuan Hao fled Luoyang and was killed in flight. Background Yuan Hao's father Yuan Xiang (元詳) was a son of Emperor Xianwen and a younger brother of Emperor Xiaowen, and was created the Prince of Beihai early in Emperor Xiaowen's reign. Yuan Xiang became powerful, as the prime minister, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen's son Emperor Xuanwu, but was later accused of corruption and stripped of his titles. He died in imprisonment 504, and after his death, although his titles were stripped, Yuan Hao was allowed to inherit the title of Prince of Beihai. His mother's family name was Fan (范), and she was not Yuan Xiang's wife. Yuan Hao was considered generous and ambitious in his youth. After inhering the title he was made a general, but later was accused of unspecified crimes, and both his general status and his princely title were stripped. During the reign of Emperor Xiaoming After Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515, his young son Emperor Xiaoming took the throne, and the imperial government was under the successive regencies of Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Cha, both of whom openly tolerated corruption. As a result, the empire fell into chaos, with many agrarian rebellions dividing the empire. In 524, while Yuan Cha was regent, Yuan Hao, who was considered military capable, was restored to his princely title and commissioned with an army to fight the forces of the rebel leader Hu Chen (胡琛). Yuan Hao enjoyed some early successes, and while he was unable to destroy either Hu Chen or Hu Chen's successor Moqi Chounu (万俟醜奴), he was largely able to hold his own. As a result, he received increasingly great responsibilities. In 527, however, when fellow general Xiao Baoyin's forces were defeated by Mozhe Tiansheng (莫折天生), Yuan Hao's forces also collapsed, and he was forced to flee back to Luoyang. In spring 528, Yuan Hao was again commissioned with an army and put into the post of governor of Xiang Province (相州, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), to defend the region against the rebel leader Ge Rong (葛榮), who had by this point taken much of the territory north of the Yellow River and claimed the title of Emperor of Qi. Flight to Liang Less than two months after Yuan Hao was posted to Xiang Province, Emperor Xiaoming and Empress Dowager Hu, who had been restored as regent in 525, were in serious dispute over Emperor Xiaoming's displeasure at Empress Dowager Hu's overtolerance of corruption by her lover Zheng Yan (鄭儼) and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (徐紇). Emperor Xiaoming conspired with the general Erzhu Rong to have Erzhu advance on Luoyang to force Empress Dowager to give up power and to kill Zheng and Xu. When this plot was discovered, Empress Dowager Hu poisoned Emperor Xiaoming and installed Yuan Zhao, a young child of an imperial prince, as emperor. Erzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao as emperor, and he advanced on Luoyang, capturing and then drowning Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao in the Yellow River. He made Yuan Hao's cousin Yuan Ziyou the Prince of Changle emperor instead (as Emperor Xiaozhuang). Erzhu subsequently carried out a great massacre of the imperial officials at Heyin (河陰, near Luoyang), and while he subsequently regretted that action, the surviving imperial officials became distrustful of him. He tried to appease other generals and officials who were out in the provinces by promoting them, and Yuan Hao was promoted to a high honorary post as Taifu (太傅, \\"imperial professor\\"). Apprehensive of both Erzhu Rong and Ge Rong's power, however, Yuan Hao considered seizing the region around Xiang Province and becoming independent. He tried to commission his uncle Fan Zhun (范遵) as the governor of the neighboring Yin Province (殷州, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei), but this move was resisted by the local officials who suspected his intentions. When he could not receive cooperation from those local officials, he abandoned his army and fled to Liang. Campaign back north When Yuan Hao met Emperor Wu of Liang, he made an impassioned plea in which he displayed both mournfulness and ambition. Emperor Wu was impressed, and in winter 528 he created Yuan Hao the Prince of Wei, with the intention that Yuan Hao seize the Northern Wei throne and serve as a vassal to Liang. Emperor Wu also commissioned the well- regarded general Chen Qingzhi to escort and support Yuan Hao on his campaign. Chen, however, was only given 7,000 men. In spring and early summer 529, Liang troops under Chen pushed into Northern Wei territory. Not far away was a large Northern Wei army commanded by the general Yuan Tianmu (元天穆) the Prince of Shangdang. However, Yuan Tianmu did not consider Yuan Hao a threat, and he instead proceeded to attack another rebel leader, Xing Gao (邢杲), who had claimed the title of Prince of Han. Yuan Tianmu and Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao were able to crush Xing and capture him. Meanwhile, however, Chen was able to win battle after battle against Northern Wei generals with much larger forces, and after Chen captured Suiyang, Yuan Hao declared himself emperor there. Chen's army then proceeded to capture Yingyang (滎陽, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), not far from Luoyang, and when Yuan Tianmu, realizing the seriousness of the Yuan Hao threat, advanced on Yingyang, intending to crush Chen's army, Chen defeated him, forcing him to flee. Yuan Hao then approached Luoyang. Emperor Xiaozhuang, fearful of Yuan Hao's army, fled Luoyang north of the Yellow River to rendezvous with Erzhu Rong and Yuan Tianmu. Yuan Hao was welcomed into Luoyang, whose people were resentful of Erzhu Rong and therefore hoped that Yuan Hao could deliver them. Most of the provinces south of the Yellow River also declared allegiance to him, while most of the provinces north of the Yellow River continued to recognize Emperor Xiaozhuang. Brief reign and death Yuan Hao, once he entered Luoyang, became complacent and believed that he was favored by the gods, and therefore grew arrogant and lazy. He put his old friends and associates into high posts, and he spent his days feasting, not caring about the matters of state. The Liang forces escorting him bullied the local populace, and the populace began to turn against Yuan Hao. Meanwhile, Yuan Hao, believing that he had already succeeded, began to secretly plot with Yuan Yu (元彧) the Prince of Linhuai and Yuan Yanming (元延明) the Prince of Anfeng to consider how to throw off the Liang yoke. When Chen, whose army was badly outnumbered, petitioned Emperor Wu of Liang for reinforcements, Yuan Hao preemptorily petitioned Emperor Wu, arguing that additional Liang troops would merely cause more shock to the Northern Wei people. Emperor Wu therefore stopped sending reinforcements. At one point, Chen considered assassinating Yuan Hao and seizing Luoyang himself, but decided against the idea. Meanwhile, Erzhu Rong's forces, as well as other forces loyal to Emperor Xiaozhuang, had arrived at the northern bank of the Yellow River opposite Luoyang. When they made exploratory attacks, Chen repelled each one. Erzhu Rong was so frustrated that he considered withdrawing, but after suggestions by the officials Yang Kan (楊侃) and Gao Daomu (高道穆) that doing so would only allow Yuan Hao to be entrenched, he prepared a surprise attack at night, crossing the Yellow River and capturing Yuan Hao's son Yuan Guanshou. Yuan Hao's forces subsequently collapsed, and Yuan Hao fled with his guards. Chen tried to withdraw in an orderly fashion, but his forces were trapped by the Songshan River (嵩山水, east of Luoyang) and crushed. Chen himself was able to flee back to Liang. Meanwhile, Yuan Hao's guards began to desert, and a local policeman of Linyin County (臨穎, in modern Luohe, Henan), Jiang Feng (江豐), killed him and delivered his head to Luoyang. Yuan Hao was never officially recognized as an emperor, although, for reasons unknown, Emperor Xiaowu later restored his title of Prince of Beihai and posthumously honored him with a number of honors.

Collaborators on this album are Sixpence bandmate Matt Slocum, and the songwriting/production team of Rick Nowels and Billy Steinberg. Commercially, the album did not perform well. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the album remains unknown among the masses due to the lack of promotion and airplay. So far, it managed to reach No. 25 in the Billboard Top Heatseekers charts; however, the bonus track \\"Blue Sky\\" reached No. 5 in Japanese pop music Chart due to its frequent airplay and the advertisement of \\"Toyota Prius\\" in Japan in 2007.

History Grüningen is first mentioned in 1243 as apud Gruningin. The village of Itzikon was first mentioned in 837 as in Izinheimo and Binzikon was mentioned in 854 as in willa Pinuzzinhovun. In the Strangenholz area of the municipality, burial mounds from a Hallstatt era population have been found. The Alamannic settlement dates to c. the 8th century, based on 9th-century records of Itzikon and Binzikon. Grüningen castle was built from the early 13th century, most likely by the counts of Rapperswil, who acted as reeves for Einsiedeln Abbey. Grüningen is recorded as a possession of Einsiedeln during 1217-1222\\\\. Around 1230, Grüningen passed from Einsiedeln to the Abbey of Saint Gall and was at first given as a fief to the counts of Kyburg, and in 1253 to Lütold VI, head of the baronial Regensberg family. The small settlement that had grown up around the castle was developed into a medieval city, with fortifications and market rights, around the mid 13th century, likely under Lütold VI. In 1269, Lütold was forced to cede the fief back to St. Gallen, as he was in financial difficulties following his feuds with both the city of Zürich and with count Rudolf von Habsburg The abbey pawned the fief to Walter von Elgg in 1273, but it was acquired by Rudolf von Habsburg, now elected King Rudolf I of Germany, in the following year. Grüningen held city rights since before 1370 (first record of the city seal and coat of arms), as one of four localities in the canton of Zürich which held city rights before the end of the medieval period, the other three being Zürich itself (1218), Winterthur (1264) and Elgg (1371). The town remained in Habsburg possession throughout the 14th century, administrated by the counts of Toggenburg from 1314, and by Heinrich Gessler of Meienberg from 1374. Gessler improved the castle fortifications against the threat of the Swiss Confederacy in the years leading up to the Sempach War, and Grüningen was raided several times by Zürich during the 1370s to 1380s. Grüningen bailiwick within the canton of Zürich (as of 1770) Heinrich Gessler died in 1403 and was succeeded by his son Hermann, who was finally forced to cede Grüningen to Zürich. Heinrich Hagnauer was elected reeve in 1416. Hagnauer implemented a strict regime, creating resentment towards the new lords. Frederick IV of Habsburg was upset over the loss of the territory, and made several attempts to regain Grüningen from Zürich, but ultimately without success. In 1440, Grüningen bailiwick was invaded by the forces of Schwyz and Glarus in the course of the Old Zürich War. A force of 1,000 laid siege to the town and castle, which were defended by Jakob Murer and a garrison of 40 men. The defenders surrendered on 10 November 1440, three weeks before Zürich was forced to sign the unfavourable peace of Lucerne, on 1 December 1440. Frederick V of Habsburg and III of Germany at this time requested the return of Grüningen to Habsburg, but the intercession of Bern, in the so-called Berner Spruch of 17 March 1441, prevented the loss of Grüningen (which would have left a Habsburg-owned enclave within the Swiss Confederacy after the re- admission of Zürich in 1450). With the renewed hostilities of 1443, Grüningen was besieged again, during 11 to 16 July, and the garrison surrendered once again. The attackers killed Zürich reeve Peter Kilchmann in spite of having offered safe conduct. The rest of the garrison retreated to Zürich, where they were imprisoned and fined for cowardice. With Grüningen in Swiss hands, the territory of Grüningen bailiwick was harried by Swiss troops led by Ital Reding. These laid siege to Greifensee in Mai 1444, where the entire garrison was killed upon surrendering. With the peace of 24 August 1450, Grüningen was returned to Zürich, and would remained a bailiwick (Landvogtei) administrated by Zürich reeves until the French invasion of 1798. Aerial view from 500 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1923) Conrad Grebel (c. 1498–1526), co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement, was likely a native of Grüningen. The former bailiwick became the district (Oberamt) of Grüningen in 1815. Development stagnated in the 19th century, and Grüningen barely participated in the industrial revolution. As of 1836, there were 300 people employed in farming, 200 in the cotton and silk homeworking industry, and 112 in other crafts. In 1831, the administrative seat of the district was moved to Hinwil. Population declined from c. 1,700 in 1850 to c. 1,200 in 1900. From 1836, there was a mail coach connecting Grüningen to Zürich, from 1838 one to Stäfa. Grüningen was on Wetzikon–Meilen tramway line, operating 1903-1950\\\\. Since 1950, Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee und Oberland have operated a bus service. Population grew slowly over the first half of the 20th century, back to c. 1,700 (the population of 1850) by about 1960. Population growth accelerated after c. 1960, passing the 3,000 mark by 2010. In 1976, Grüningen received the Wakker Prize for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage. In order to protect the historic town nucleus from through traffic, a bypass has been planned from 2003. A project by Santiago Calatrava was presented as the winning submission in September 2018.Stefan Hotz, \\"Santiago Calatrava befreit Grüningen vom Verkehr\\" NZZ, 4 September 2018.

The river Jona flows through the town. History The former Rüti Monastery in the late 17th century Aerial view from 300 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) In 807, Rüti's quarter Fägswil was first mentioned in a document of the Abbey of Saint Gall. In a document of the German Emperor Otto II (972), the municipality was described as Riutun, the Old High German word for Roden (= to convert forest into farmland), and later forwarded to the name of Rüti. In 1206 the Rüti Monastery was given by Liutold IV, Duke of Regensberg, and the present Reformed church was completed to 1283. In 1408 Rüti and the Premonstratensian monastery came as part of the so-called Herrschaft Grüningen under the reign of the government of the city of Zürich. In 1525 (Reformation in Zürich) the monastery was secularized and managed as Amt Rüti by an Amtmann (member of the city of Zürich government) until 1798. In mid 16th century, Rüti got one of the first public schools in the canton of Zürich, established by the Zürich reformers and the former monks of the Rüti Monastery. In 1866, the first Catholic Mass in the Zürcher Oberland was celebrated after the Reformation; in Tann ZH (politically part of the municipality Dürnten), the Catholic parish church was built in 1963. Geography Rüti has an area of . Of this area, 36.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 35.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 26.9% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.4%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 19.9% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (7%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 0.8% of the area. 25.9% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction. The municipality is located on at the confluence of the rivers Jona and Schwarz. It includes the hamlets of Weid, Moos, Weier and Fägswil. It grew up around the Rüti Monastery, which was built at the bridge along the pilgrimage route through the Thurgau to Einsiedeln Abbey. Economy Beginning in the Middle Ages, its hydropower was used for watermills along the Jona, later for textile production facilities. In the early 19th century, Rüti was one of the centers of the industrialization in the southeastern parts of the canton of Zürich. In 1847, Caspar Honegger, a factory for weaving machines, was established in the Joweid valley (river Jona), later Maschinenfabrik Rüti AG with its global relations, and in the 1990s of Sulzer and the G + F group. A collection of weaving machines produced by this company is now housed in a museum in nearby Neuthal. The Rüti hospital, later district Hospital, was built in 1875 (in 2000, for financial and political reasons it has been closed). The community services began its activities in 1897, the Swiss Post established an office in 1911.

Populations from Mexico and Central America are also regarded as the same species, although some authors prefer to separate them as a distinct species, Ostrya guatemalensis. Other names include eastern hophornbeam, hardhack (in New England), ironwood, and leverwood.Nelson Sutherland, C.H. (2008). Catálogo de las plantes vasculares de Honduras. Espermatofitas: 1-1576. SERNA/Guaymuras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras Description American hophornbeam is a small deciduous understory tree growing to tall and trunk diameter. The bark is brown to gray-brown, with narrow shaggy plates flaking off, while younger twigs and branches are smoother and gray, with small lenticels. Very young twigs are sparsely fuzzy to thickly hairy; the hairs (trichomes) drop off by the next year. The leaves are ovoid-acute, long and broad, pinnately veined, with a doubly serrated margin. The upper surface is mostly hairless, while the lower surface is sparsely to moderately fuzzy (rarely densely hairy). The flowers are catkins (spikes) produced in early spring at the same time as the new leaves appear. The staminate (male) catkins are long, and arranged in groups of 1-4. The pistillate (female) catkins are long, containing 10–30 flowers each. Pollinated female flowers develop into small nutlets long fully enclosed in a papery sac-shaped involucre long and wide. The involucre changes from greenish-white to dull brown as the fruit matures. American hophornbeam is similar to its close relative American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), which can be distinguished by its smooth bark and nutlets enclosed in open, three-lobed bracts.

A.E.Murray – central and southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador * Ostrya virginiana subsp. virginiana – eastern half of United States, eastern Canada Populations along the Atlantic coast have slightly smaller leaves, and are sometimes separated as O. virginiana var. lasia Fernald. Ecology The buds and catkins are important source of winter food for some birds, notably ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Additionally, the nutlets and buds are eaten by birds, deer, and rabbits. Uses It is grown as an ornamental plant and is sometimes used as a street tree. Its wood is very resilient and is valued for making tool handles and fence posts. Being a diffuse porous hardwood and having extremely high density and resistance to compression, it is an excellent material for the construction of wooden longbows.

He is most famous for having located the 1628 wreck of the Swedish galleon Vasa in 1956 and participated in her salvage 1959–1961. He also participated in the exploration for the wrecks of Swedish warships Kronan, Riksäpplet and Resande Man as well as Gustav Vasa's flagship Lybska Svan. Biography Franzén studied naval architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), but instead developed a strong interest for history and never graduated. He took employment with BP and later changed to the Swedish Naval Administration (which was a single- service forerunner to the Defence Materiel Administration, FMV) where he became an expert on oil and fuels. At the same time, Franzén was conducting amateur historical research in archives, where he was searching for information on old shipwrecks of the Swedish Navy. Early on, he had realised that in the brackish water conditions in Baltic Sea, wrecks of old wooden ships could survive without being attacked by shipworm. Around 1950 he had compiled a list of a dozen or so ships worth investigating further. From 1954, he focused his efforts on Vasa which he located in 1956 in Stockholm harbour. He combined his efforts with an experienced salvage diver Per Edvin Fälting (1911-1995). Franzén had strained relations to the Maritime Museum, which for a long time seemed to regard Franzén as an unwelcome competitor, while the Swedish navy and the city of Stockholm were a lot more interested. Franzén never worked for the Maritime Museum, but was given a position at his alma mater KTH, which also recognised him with an honorary doctorate in 1983, KTH's Great Prize in 1988, and a personal title as professor (approved by the Swedish government) in 1992. He was a founding member of the Sea Research Society and served on its Board of Advisors. In 1972 Franzén was awarded the Society's research/professional degree of Doctor of Marine Histories from the College of Marine Arts. Personal life Franzén was married to Helena Grönquist. He died in Stockholm was buried at Galärvarvskyrkogården.

They consist of a cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Though the teeth are not straight-sided (but usually of special form to achieve a constant drive ratio, mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), the edge of each tooth is straight and aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. These gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts. No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds. Spur gear can be classified into two pressure angles, 20° being the current industry standard and 14½° being the former (often found in older equipment)https://www.mcmaster.com/gears. Spur gear teeth are manufactured by either involute profile or cycloidal profile. When two gears are in mesh at one instant there is a chance to mate involute portion with non-involute portion of mating gear. This phenomenon is known as \\"interference\\" and occurs when the number of teeth on the smaller of the two meshing gears is less than a required minimum. To avoid interference we can have undercutting, but this is not a suitable solution as undercutting leads to weakening of tooth at its base. In this situation Corrected gears are used. In corrected gears Cutter rack is shifted upwards or downwards. The spur gears can be classified into two main categories: External and Internal. The gears with teeth cut outside of the cylinder are known as external gears. The gears with teeth cut on the internal side of the cylinder are known as internal gears. An external gear can mesh with an external gear or an internal gear. When two external gears mesh together they rotate in the opposite directions. An internal gear can only mesh with an external gear and the gears rotate in the same direction. Due to the close positioning of shafts internal gear assemblies are more compact then external gear assemblies. PCD and MOD In the case of Module (MOD) 4.0 spur gears: * Normal spur gears (over 17 teeth) have a Pitch circle diameter (PCD) equal to MOD x Number of Teeth.http://www.metrication.com/engineering/gears.html * Corrected spur gears (under 17 teeth) have a PCD equal to MOD x Number of Teeth + MOD.

It is capable of simultaneously binding both membrane lipids (via an ANTH domain) and clathrin and is therefore thought to recruit clathrin to the membrane of newly invaginating vesicles. In Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), deletion of the AP180 homologue, leads to enlarged but much fewer vesicles and an overall decrease in transmitter release. In D. melanogaster it was also shown that AP180 is also required for either recycling vesicle proteins and/or maintaining the distribution of both vesicle and synaptic proteins in the nerve terminal. A ubiquitous form of the protein in mammals, CALM, (Clathrin-assembly lymphoid myeloid leukaemia protein) is named after its association with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias where some translocations map to this gene.

He was a huge, strong man, and easily handled a large stick as whether it was nothing. He hit everybody against the knees who would approach him too closely from the front. At par with this was his introduction of a new kava circle layout (a formal gathering of the chiefs of the country under him), in which the king sat more apart from the others (including supposed assassins) than before. He also built there at Heketā the earliest known langi (burial tombs)– Langi Heketā and Langi Moungalafa (where four of his children were buried), but he himself would not use them. These stone structures still exist. He also made a sporting field to play sikaulutoa (reed throwing stick). Rule In addition to the Tui Tonga maritime empire, Tuitātui also inherited from his father-in- law Loau as a kind of prime minister. Together they put through landownership and social reforms, re-shuffled and strengthened the royal council of the Fale Fā (house of four), the ancient royal counselors and royal guardians of the Tui Tonga. Tuitātui removed from the Fale Fā, Matakehe and Tuifolaha and replaced them with Tuitalau and Tuiamanave from Talau of the northern island of Vava'u. As a prince Tuitātui probably had had a sheltered life, away from others. One story tells of how Tuitātui did not know that he had an older stepbrother named Fasiapule until he introduced himself to Tuitātui with riddles. The king was impressed and made Fasiapule a governor. Sāngone Tongan stories tell that Tuitātui had a pet turtle named Sāngone of which he was very fond. One day a Sāmoan named Lekapai stole the turtle and ate it. By the time Fasiapule came with a recovery expedition to Savaii, only the shell was left, buried at a secret place and guarded over by the dwarf Lafaipana. Only when Fasiapule had shown he was sharper witted than Lafaipana in solving riddles was he able to get the shell and return it to Tonga. This story might be symbolic for the start of a revolt in Samoa by the chiefs Lekapai and Lafaipana, counteracted by Loau Tuputoka and Fasiapule. It would still take a century or so before Sāmoans drove out the last Tongan occupier from their soil. Nua Another tale recounts how one day Tuitātui came along the weatherside of Eueiki island and saw a woman with her legs in the sea. For a while he was not sure whether she was a human or an evil ghost, but after some discussion and solving riddles, he decided she was human and asked her to come to Olotele, the residence of the Tui Tonga. She then told her name was Nua, and agreed to come with the king. Nua bore him three sons, Uanga, Afulunga, and Sina, along with a daughter named Fatafehi. Uanga built the Langi Leka, the first langi in Mua, he also moved the royal court there after his father's death. Last years Tuitātui had several big houses in Heketā, and they were provided with a high platforms, called fata, made from fehi wood, and as such called fatafehi. The word has since become a royal name in Tonga; one Fatafehi was the king's daughter. Another Tongan legend states that one day the king climbed up on such a raised platform and yelled to his sister, Lātūtama below: \\"Oh, some big vessels are coming, from Haapai very likely.\\" \\"Lies!\\", his sister answered. \\"Not lies, come up and see it for yourself. It is a large fleet, 1, 2, 5, no 100 boats I think\\", the king retorted. So the woman went up, and nothing to be seen. The king then seized her and raped her, knowing that no one could see them. Lātūtama's maiden attendants below saw blood trickling down and asked what it was. \\"Oh, it is from a flying fox\\", Tuitātui answered. As such the place is still known as Toipeka (blood drip of the peka (flying fox)).Lātūtama's brothers were enraged on hearing this and swore to kill the king. Tuitātui had to flee to Eua, but did not escape his fate. Meanwhile, Fasiapule had returned from Fiji, and hearing that Tuitātui was in Eua, he, and a Fijian friend, embarked in their canoe there. They were attracted by a strange light, which on arrival turned out to be the funeral torches of the dead king. Fasiapule killed his Fijian friend, substituted him on the place of Tuitātui and smuggled the body of the latter away from Eua. Approaching Tongatapu, he rested at one of the outer islands and that island from then on was called Motutapu (sacred island), because it had served as a resting place for a Tui Tonga. He then went on to Malapo. But night came, and the procession had to stop on an island in the lagoon, close to Folaha, and that island is still known as Moungatapu (sacred mountain). Next day, Malapo was reached and the body was taken care of by Tuitātui's mother's tribe, the Haangongo. There are claims that Tuitātui is not buried in Malapo, but in Mua. The people of Uiha claim that he is buried there in the southeast corner of the island. In a remote area is an ancient grave which contain the bones of a huge man and it is Tuitātui's. There is also a claim that he is buried somewhere in one of the small islands south of Uiha known as the Otu Motu Kinekina Felemea, as they have become a symbol for the Tui Tonga for this reason.

Aylward is remembered for his remarkable feat on 18–20 June 1777, when he scored 167 runs in one innings against the best bowlers and fielders of the day. This score set a record for the highest individual innings in first-class cricket, beating the 136 scored by John Small in 1775 and standing for 43 years until it was beaten by William Ward in 1820. Aylward played for Hambledon until 1779 when he was offered employment as a water bailiff by Sir Horatio Mann, and moved to Mann's house at Bourne Paddock in Kent and played for his patron's teams. Latterly he resided in London and died in Edward Street, Marylebone. He is buried in St John's Wood Churchyard, close to Lord's Cricket Ground.

Festival (commonly known as G!, in Faroese also called G! Festivalur or G! Festivalurin) is a Faroese musical festival, held annually at the seaside village Gøta on Eysturoy in mid or late July, but always before the Ólavsøka. It is one of the two largest music festivals on the Faroe Islands, the other being Summarfestivalurin. It was founded by Sólarn Solmunde and musician Jón Tyril, both locals. Jón is also the present chairman of the festival. The G! Festival is an innovative cultural event which has been well received. The festival brings together leading international musicians as well as local musicians. The founding goal was to change the musical landscape of the Faroes. Working to achieve this goal has earned the festival the position as the most important and influential musical event on the islands. History The G! Festival was the first real outdoor music festival ever held on the Faroe Islands. Around 1000 people bought tickets to the first festival in 2002, and ticket sales have grown steadily ever since. In 2005 the G! Festival arrangers announced the festival sold out, with ticket sales of 6000. An estimated 2000 to 4000 people partook in the music festival from outside the festival area, mainly in boats on the sea or in the hills and roads surrounding the area. It is believed that a fifth of the entire population of the Faroe Islands partook in the 2005 festival. In 2005 Jón Tyril received the M.A. Jacobsen Distinguished Prize for Cultural Achievement for his work with G! Festival. G! Festival cooperates annually with Iceland Airwaves.

Taylor specialises in researching the culture of gaming and online communities, in particular, esports, live-streaming, and MMOGs such as EverQuest and World of Warcraft. Education She received her Ph.D. (2000) in sociology from Brandeis University. Her dissertation, Living Digitally: Embodiment in Virtual Environments, explored design and embodiment in MUDs and graphical virtual worlds. Work Taylor was a founding faculty member of the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen where she was a professor from 2003-2012. Before that she was an assistant professor at North Carolina State University. She is currently a Professor in Comparative Media Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has been both a Visiting and Consulting Researcher with the Social Media group at Microsoft Research New England. She co-founded AnyKey.org with Morgan Romine and currently serves as its Director of Research. AnyKey's aim is to diversity the esport community by promoting inclusivity. Taylor is on the editorial boards of the journals Games & Culture and Social Media and Society. Research Taylor has been noted as providing insight into the emerging world of live streaming, the growth of professional esports, and the dynamics of ethnic stereotyping in virtual worlds. Taylor also explores the relationship between the self-expression of players in a virtual world and designers' imperatives, and challenges the perceived dichotomy between online and offline experience. Her first book, Play Between Worlds (MIT Press, 2006) focused on the massively multiplayer online game EverQuest. It explored the social aspects of play, powergaming, gender, and the creative practices of players (including intellectual property implications). Taylor's second book, Raising the Stakes (MIT Press, 2012), examined professional computer gaming. She visited the World Cyber Games, as well as a number of other tournaments and did interviews with a variety of participants in professional competitive gaming. The book looks at a number of topics in esports, including their status as sports, rulesets and competitive play, gender, and spectatorship and performance. Her most recent book is Watch Me Play (Princeton, 2018). Taylor analyzes the rise of game live streaming, focusing particularly on the platform Twitch. Continuing her interests in the sociology of play, governance, and management, she discusses how live streaming has come to transform everyday gaming, as well as amplify the growth of esports. The book explores the affective and precarious labor of these broadcasters, the emphasis on media entertainment within esports, and the transformative work of live streaming. It won the American Sociological Association's Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology section 2019 book award. In addition to her work on these subjects, she has also spoken and written on doing ethnographic work that spans both online and offline sites. She is the co-author (with Tom Boellstorff, Bonnie Nardi, and Celia Pearce) of Ethnography and Virtual Worlds: A Handbook of Method (Princeton, 2012) , which works as a guide for researches to apply familiar ethnographic research methods towards understanding virtual worlds and participants interactions within them.

In 2006 it was a candidate for the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non- Violence and was recognized with a mention of honor for \\"its outstanding contribution to this great cause\\". In 2012, co-editors Hillel Schenker and Ziad Abuzayyad were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Peace Award at the eighth International Media Awards held on May 5th.2012 Awards  The International Media Awards The Journal Half of every issue is devoted to exploring a major theme on the joint Israeli-Palestinian agenda, while the other half contains regular departments relating to Culture, Economics, Viewpoints, Book Reviews, Documents and a Chronology of Events. The Journals goal is to promote rapprochement and better understanding between Palestinian and Israeli people, and striving to discuss all issues without prejudice or taboos. The Journal is a unique joint venture promoting dialogue and the quest for a peaceful resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Journal operates on the basis of cooperation, understanding and equality between the Israelis and Palestinians who comprise its joint staff. All decisions and work are shared and managed equally and in cooperation between a joint staff of Palestinian and Israel co-editors, managing editors and other staff. The fact that decisions are made together through dialogue and understanding is a matter of principle as well as a working strategy of the Journal. The editors of the Journal are Palestinian journalist and former Minister Ziad AbuZayyad and veteran Israeli journalist and commentator Hillel Schenker. The editorial board is composed of an equal number of Israeli and Palestinian academics and journalists. Every issue contains an equal number of articles by Israeli and Palestinian contributors, with the addition of several international articles. History The Palestine–Israel Journal was founded in early 1994 by Ziad AbuZayyad and veteran Israeli journalist Victor Cygelman (1926–2007) who was former deputy-editor of the Israeli peace journal New Outlook. The Journal was established, concurrently with the first phases of the Oslo peace process, as a response to a much-needed avenue for dialogue among the opinion and policy- makers of the region. It was obvious from the start that, alongside the institutional efforts of Palestinians and Israelis, channels of communication had to be opened for academics and other experts; opinion, decision and policy makers, as well as grass-roots organizations and activists, to voice their views, promote and take part in the public debate for a democratic and just solution to the conflict. Many prominent academic experts, political figures, journalists and activists have written for the Journal. Among them are Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami, Mohammed Dajani, Shlomo Gazit, Manuel Hassassian, Shimon Peres, Rashid Khalidi, Ghassan Kanafani, Benny Morris, David Newman, Sari Nusseibeh, Yoav Peled, Don Peretz, Desmond Tutu, Khalil Shikaki, Prof. Daniel Kurtzer, Johan Galtung, Salim Tamari, Moshe Amirav, Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan and A.B. Yehoshua. When Cygelman retired, he was replaced by Prof. Daniel Bar- Tal of Tel Aviv University, who served as the Israeli co-editor from 2001–2005. In 2005, veteran Israeli journalist and commentator Hillel Schenker replaced Bar-Tal as Israeli co-editor of the Journal. Public events and Journal outreach After each issue is published, the Journal holds public discussions aimed at promoting widespread public debate on the topics raised by the issue. For each issue, three discussions are organized: one in Arabic for Palestinians, one in Hebrew for Israelis and one joint Palestinian-Israeli event run in English.

It is described as submarine inflow of fresh-, and brackish groundwater from land into the sea. Submarine Groundwater Discharge is controlled by several forcing mechanisms, which cause a hydraulic gradient between land and sea.William C.Burnett, Bokuniewicz, Henry, Huettel, Markus, Moore, Willard S., Taniguchi, Makoto. \\"Groundwater and pore water inputs to the coastal zone\\", Biogeochemistry, Volume 66, 2003, Page 3–33. Considering the different regional settings the discharge occurs either as (1) a focused flow along fractures in karst and rocky areas, (2) a dispersed flow in soft sediments, or (3) a recirculation of seawater within marine sediments. Submarine Groundwater Discharge plays an important role in coastal biogeochemical processes and hydrological cycles such as the formation of offshore plankton blooms, hydrological cycles, and the release of nutrients, trace elements and gases.Claudette Spiteri, Caroline P.

It effects coastal ecosystems and has been used as freshwater resource by local communities for millennia. Forcing mechanisms In coastal areas the groundwater and seawater flows are driven by a variety of factors. Both types of water can circulate in marine sediments due to tidal pumping, waves, bottom currents or density driven transport processes. Meteoric freshwaters can discharge along confined and unconfined aquifers into the sea or the oppositional process of seawater intruding into groundwater charged aquifers can take place. The flow of both fresh and sea water is primarily controlled by the hydraulic gradients between land and sea and differences in the densities between both waters and the permeabilities of the sediments.

Including the densities of freshwater (ρf = 1.00 g •cm-3) and seawater (ρs = 1.025 g •cm-3) equation (2) simplifies to: z=40*h Together with Darcy's Law, the length of a salt wedge from the shoreline into the hinterland can be calculated: L= ((ρs-ρf)Kf m)/(ρf Q) With Kf being the hydraulic conductivity, m the aquifer thickness and Q the discharge rate.Domenico, E. P. & Schwartz, F. W.; 1998. Physical and chemical hydrogeology. 2nd ed. New York. John Wiley & Sons Inc.: 506 Assuming an isotropic aquifer system the length of a salt wedge solely depends on the hydraulic conductivity, the aquifer thickness and is inversely related to the discharge rate. These assumptions are only valid under hydrostatic conditions in the aquifer system. In general the interface between fresh and saline water forms a zone of transition due to diffusion/dispersion or local anisotropy.Stuyfzand, P. J.; 1993. Hydrochemistry and Hydrology of the Coastal Dune area of the Western Netherlands. PhD thesis, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: 367. Methods The first study about Submarine Groundwater Discharge was done by Sonrel (1868) who speculated on the risk of submarine springs for sailors. However until the mid-1990s SGD remained rather unrecognized by the scientific community because it was hard to detect and measure the freshwater discharge. The first elaborated method to study SGD was done by Moore (1996)who used radium-226 as a tracer for groundwater. Since then several methods and instruments were developed to attempt to detect and quantify discharge rates. Radium-226 The first study which detected and quantified Submarine Groundwater Discharge on a regional basis was done by Moore (1996) in the South Atlantic Bight off South Carolina. He measured enhanced radium-226 concentrations within the water column near shore and up to about from the shoreline. Radium-226 is a decay product of thorium-230, which is produced within sediments and supplied by rivers. However, these sources could not explain the high concentrations present in the study area. Moore (1996) hypothesized that submarine groundwater, enriched in radium-226, was responsible for the high concentrations. This hypothesis has been tested numerous times at sites around the world and confirmed at each site. Seepage meter Lee (1977)David Robert Lee. \\"A device to measure seepage flux in estuaries and lakes\\", Limnology and Oceanography, Volume 22, 1977, pp. 140–147 designed a seepage meter, which consists of a chamber which is connected to a sampling port and a plastic bag. The chamber is inserted into the sediment and water discharging through the sediments is caught within the plastic bag. The change in volume of water which is caught in the plastic bag over time represents the freshwater flux. Pore water profiles According to Schlüter et al. (2004) chloride pore water profiles can be used to investigate submarine groundwater discharge. Chloride can be used as a conservative tracer, as it is enriched in seawater and depleted in groundwater. Three different shapes of chloride pore water profiles reflect three different transport modes within marine sediments. A chloride profile showing constant concentrations with depth indicates that no submarine groundwater is present. A chloride profile with a linear decline indicates a diffusive mixing between groundwater and seawater and a concave shaped chloride profile represents an advective admixture of submarine groundwater from below.

It was during this time that he was discharged from his club because of a quota for non-European Union players set in the league. In 2003 he presented his case to play against the Deutscher Handballbund (German Handball Federation) to the European Court of Justice, which ruled in his favour, thereby setting a precedent, now known as the Kolpak ruling. Kolpak and Kronau/Östringen were promoted to the Bundesliga in 2003 and 2005, with a highest Bundesliga placing of sixth in 2006, reached the final of the DHB- Pokal in 2006 and 2007, and played in the last 16 of the EHF Cup in 2007.European Handball Federation - 2006/07 Men's EHF Cup - Match Details, retrieved 18 December 2008 In 2006 Kolpak was also elected as the best goalkeeper of the final four of the DHB-Pokal.

History  In the 18th and 19th centuries, map makers recorded Gaelic placenames in Anglicised versions. One would expect important towns like Stornoway or Portree to have slightly different names in different languages, but it is unusual for this to be the case with small hamlets or minor topographical features, and the Anglicisation of placenames was resented by educated Gaels.Hutchinson, Roger (2005). A Waxing Moon: The Modern Gaelic Revival. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing. . In the 20th century, Inverness County Council, which until the latter part of the century was known for its antipathy towards the Gaelic language, was responsible for erecting road signs throughout the Highlands. The council insisted that these be entirely in English and follow the spellings on the Ordnance Survey maps. Gaelic language organisations had limited resources and thus did not see opposition to this policy as a priority. In September 1970 Aird District Council rejected a proposal for bilingual signs. Highland revival In 1973, however, the issue was forced onto the public agenda as a result of the Skye road sign controversy. The council was planning to build a new road south from Portree, and needed to purchase a strip of land belonging to landowner Iain Noble. Noble offered to donate the land to the council on condition that the three signs which were to be erected on the stretch of road be bilingual, a way of registering Gaelic on the linguistic landscape. The proposal was fiercely resisted by the council, and in particular by Lord Burton, Chairman of the Roads Committee, who later the same year attempted unsuccessfully to introduce legislation in the House of Lords limiting the use of Gaelic by Scottish local authorities. However, Noble was supported by a petition signed by many prominent Skye residents, and the experience of Wales, where bilingual signposting had already been accepted, was favourable. As the issue had aroused public interest, and a compulsory purchase order might have been slow and expensive, the council negotiated a compromise: Portree and Broadford both received bilingual signposts on an \\"experimental\\" basis. As Noble had hoped, and the council feared, this set a precedent, which was gradually followed throughout the 1980s, becoming generally accepted in the 1990s. Bilingual signposting is now the norm throughout the Western Isles (indeed for a time directional signposts there were monolingually Gaelic\\"European Commission - the Euromosaic Study\\" ) and also in large parts of the mainland on local authority roads. In 1996, Highland Council decided to make use of Gaelic-only signposts in some areas. In 2001, the Scottish Government announced plans to erect bilingual signage along many of the trunk roads in the Scottish Highlands, in addition to those already erected on local-authority-maintained roads. This project is now all but completed, although importantly it excludes the main A9 trunk road and also the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen. It has however included the A82 westerly trunk route from Inverness to Glasgow. Since the government has a strict policy of only erecting bilingual roadsigns when new signs in any case had to be erected, the costs to the public purse of making these bilingual has been negligible. In 2008, eight Caithness councillors were unsuccessful in their attempt to block Highland-wide support for bilingual English/Gaelic signage. In March 2009, Highland Council's Gaelic committee wrote to the Transport Minister, Stewart Stevenson, asking for the use of Gaelic signage to be extended on trunk roads. The Minister responded by saying that he awaited a review that had been commissioned, as he thought there was some anecdotal evidence of motorists encountering some difficulties with bilingual signage. Motorist research A report was published in 2012 by Transport Scotland stating that bilingual signs were not a danger to motorists. It was noted that the signs required slightly more attention on the part of motorists but that it did not pose any real risk. According to the study there has been no detectable change in accident rates. Research conducted by Leeds University indicates that multi-lingual signs consisting of four or more lines of text can cause drivers to brake to allow them time to process the additional information. Following drivers may not react appropriately to the change in speed of the leading vehicle. The study recommends the use of \\"separation techniques\\", such as using a different colour of font for each language, which eliminates the problem.Evaluating the Effects of Bilingual Traffic Signs on Driver Performance and Safety from eprints.whiterose.ac.uk. Published 2005 and retrieved 07 September 2013. Bilingual road signs in Scotland typically use white letters for English and yellow for Gaelic.

One of the Whirliebird helicopters now resides in the front yard of a private residence Despite memorable television advertisements over the decades, the park slowly deteriorated in the mid to late 1990s and had closed down by the end of the decade. Its demise has been linked to the high entrance fee for the time ($36 for a family of four in 1994) and the charging of separate fees to use some of the attractions . A plant nursery and the Saxon Wood town house estate occupied the Springvale Road site, but the entrance gate (without road), concrete castle, bridges, a train station, the Birthday Room and the miniature golf course from the former amusement park still remained within the nursery. In September 2012, the state government announced that a new Forest Hill police station was to be built on the site. The plant nursery has now closed.

The style of the satirical advertisements was reminiscent of the Wobbies World TV commercial, which did not have sophisticated production values.

The books do not include businesses that provide therapeutic massage services. The term massage parlour is used in the title of the books because the term massage is commonly used in Britain to euphemistically advertise sex work, soliciting prostitution being illegal in the country. McCoy has also written several other guides to sexual services in Britain and appeared in the media to discuss the country's sex industry. Early life Born in Malvern, Worcestershire in 1948, McCoy took up a career as an entrepreneur. He set up a mail order business selling records which by 1990 had a turnover of over £1.5 million. The business declined during the early 1990s. Guides McCoy began writing his Massage Parlour Guides in 1996. Since then he has been compiling and regularly updating them by means of visits to around 500 UK establishments. In 2015 McCoy stated that he had sold around 100,000 books online. In the summer of 2007 McCoy brought out the 11th edition of the Massage Parlour Guide and his first national dominatrix guide, McCoy's Guide to Corrective Services. In most of McCoy's books the entries are split up by county and then subdivided by town, while in the London Guide the entries are split into areas of London and then postal areas. Each entry lists basic details of establishments or women, such as name, phone number, web address, location, basic prices, availability, and then concludes with a paragraph comprising a resume of interesting features about the establishment or woman. Most entries in the guides are star rated and there are photographs of many of the women. McCoy has also produced city street plans to London, Birmingham and Manchester showing the locations of all the relevant cities' adult establishments: massage parlours, gay saunas, adult cinemas, sex shops, swinging clubs and striptease establishments with cartoons indicating their quality and details of each on the reverse side of the map. By the early 2010s McCoy was editing eleven different guidebooks, four national guidebooks including McCoy's British Massage Parlour Guide and McCoy's Guide to Corrective Services, and seven comprehensive regional guidebooks including in 2012 McCoy's Guide to the Agencies, Corrective Services and Parlours of London No.1 and McCoy's Guide to the Working Ladies of London No.1. Media appearances George McCoy has appeared on many television shows in the UK to discuss sexual services. In 1998 he appeared in the documentary Vice - The Sex Trade on ITV. In 2001 he appeared in Massage Parlours - The Real McCoy on Channel Five. In 2006 he appeared in Streets of Vice on BBC One. He has also appeared on television in three episodes of The Big Questions: in Leeds on 20 January 2008, in Bristol 24 May 2009 and in Bury 1 April 2012. Other appearances include the Welsh Panorama television programme Week In - Week Out which focused on adult services in Cardiff, as well as More4 News, 5 News, ITV News and Midlands Today, commenting on the sex industry. He has also appeared on chatshows such as Kilroy and been interviewed on BBC Local Radio shows, such as his appearance on BBC Radio Derby in August 2011.

The Tor Line was a freight shipping company. Together with its subsidiaries, the Tor Line operated a fleet of approximately 65 ro-ro, ro-pax and lo-lo ships, primarily on the North and Baltic Seas. It was ultimately purchased by Denmark-based DFDS, which renamed it DFDS Tor Line, and it operated as a freight-carrying division of DFDS along with DFDS Lisco, DFDS Lys Line and DFDS Container Line before retiring the brand. Tor Line was founded as a joint venture between the Swedish Trans Oil Shipping and Rex Shipping to operate car-passenger ferries between Sweden, England and the Netherlands. The company name was an abbreviation of the founding companies' names, Trains Oil and Rex Line. Tor Line begun passenger operations in 1966 and freight operations in 1969. In 1980 Tor Line formed a brief joint venture for passenger services, Sessan Tor Line, with Sessan Line. A similar joint venture was formed for freight services with Swedish Lloyd. Both proved short-lived: Stena Line acquired Sessan Line in 1981, and during the same year Tor Line passenger services were sold to DFDS. A year later DFDS also acquired Tor Line's freight services. Initially both divisions were marketed as DFDS Tor Line, but the passenger ferries were later moved under the DFDS brand. History Passenger operations 1966–1981 Two Swedish shipping companies, Trans Oil Shipping and Rex Shipping, decided to form a new company for providing car/passenger ferry services between Sweden, England and the Netherlands. The new Tor Line (an abbreviation of Trans Oil and Rex) ordered the construction of two state-of- the-art ferries from Lübecker Flender-Werke in West Germany. These entered service on the Gothenburg—Immingham—Amsterdam route in 1966 and 1967 as and , respectively. Meanwhile, Bratt-Götha and the Dutch KNSM (Koninklijke Nederlandsche Stoomboot-Maatschappij) joined as shareholders (25% each). Tor Line's main rivals on the Sweden—England route were England-Sweden Line (ESL), a joint service operated by Ellerman's Wilson Line, Swedish Lloyd and Rederi AB Svea. The ESL partner companies had also brought new ships on the route in 1966, but these were slower than the Tor ships, had less modern furnishings and lacked full-height cardecks. In 1975 Tor Line took delivery of the new, larger and faster for the Sweden—England—Netherlands service, followed in 1976 by , a second ship of the same design. With the delivery of the new ships the Tor Anglia and Tor Hollandia were sold. Also in 1976 the English terminal of Tor Line's services was moved to Felixstowe. The new ships were arguably the finest ferries of the time, and served as the final blow to the ESL service. Ellerman's Wilson Line and Rederi AB Svea had already dropped out of the joint service previously, and in 1977 Swedish Lloyd also ceased their passenger operations. Despite their dominant position in the Sweden-England service Tor Line's financial position was precarious. There was not enough passenger demand for two large ships on the service during the winter months; due to this the Tor Scandinavia was chartered out as an expedition ship during the winter seasons from 1979 onwards. To improve their financial position Tor line sought out partnerships with other shipping companies. In 1979 (the former Tor Anglia) was chartered for a planned joint Gothenburg—Kristiansand—Newcastle with Fred. Olsen, but Fred. Olsen pulled out before the service could commence. Instead the Espresso Olbia was laid up in Gothenburg. In early 1980 a more successful joint service was formed with Sessan Line, when Sessan Tor Line was established. Logos of the new joint service were painted on Tor Line's ships. Sessan Tor Line proved short-lived as Sessan's main competitors Stena Line purchased Sessan in early 1981. Subsequently, Tor Line entered negotiations to sell either the Tor Britannia or Tor Scandinavia to DFDS. Instead of buying just one ship DFDS purchased the entire Tor Line passenger division in late 1981. Initially the Tor ships were marketed as DFDS Tor Line, but were subsequently absorbed into DFDS' passenger division DFDS Seaways. Despite this they kept their original Tor-prefixed names until 1990–1991. Freight operations 1969 onwards Tor Line first initiated freight services in 1969 with , and the company acquired a larfe fleet of freight- carrying vessels during the subsequent years. In 1980, around the same time as the establishment of joint passenger services with Sessan Line, Tor Line established a joint freight service with their former competitors Swedish Lloyd, marketed as Tor Lloyd. During the Falklands War at least one of the Tor Lloyd ships, , was chartered to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence for service as a supply vessel. Like the joint Sessan Tor service, the joint Tor Lloyd service proved short-lived, and in 1982 DFDS acquired Tor Line's freight operations. Following the acquisition the former Tor Line ships were rebranded DFDS Tor Line, and subsequently the Tor division developed into DFDS' main freight-carrying subsidiary. Organisation changes 2010 onwards In 2010 DFDS acquired Norfolkline from Maersk. Following restructuring, the operations of DFDS Tor Line, DFDS Lisco and Norfolkline were integrated into DFDS Seaways. The merger led to changes and additions to freight destinations and an expansion in freight volumes. It is at this point that the historic Tor Line ceased to exist as a brand and entity, though its contributions to the legacy of North Sea and Baltic Sea maritime shipping remains. Fleet {  !

Mount St. Joseph is one of few schools in Australia that is a Josephite college, founded by the Josephite Order in 1964.Mount St. Joseph Girls' College Website  History   Beginnings  In the early 1960s, the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart made plans for a school for young women in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The school was built in Altona West and opened in February 1964. The logo at Mount St Joseph Girls' College is a white lily, and the College motto is 'Virtue Courage'.Mount St Joseph Girls' College Website  Previous Principals  The College has seen 10 principals since its foundation, 7 of which were Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart: * Mary John Forster RSJ (Founding Principal): 1964–1967 * Romuald Pierce RSJ: 1967–1970 * Anne O'Brien RSJ: 1971 * Nora Finucane RSJ: 1971–1973 * Giovanni Farquer RSJ: 1974–981 * Margaret Blampied RSJ: 1982–1985 * Helen T Reed RSJ: 1986–2002 * Regina Byrne: 2002–2008 * Catherine Dillon: 2008–2015 * Kate Dishon: 2016–present  Sport  There are 6 house colours for sport days and college events, which are:  PENOLA (yellow)  Named after the town in South Australia where Mary MacKillop and Julian Tenison Woods established the order of the Sisters of St Joseph and the first Josephite school.  KINCUMBER (blue)  Named after the town north of Sydney, where the Sisters of St Joseph opened an orphanage for street children in 1887.

PROVIDENCE (purple)  During the early years of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart's work across Australia, the Sisters established a number of Houses of Providence. These houses served as a refuge for young women and children who did not have access to a safe home or food.  Homerooms  There are seven homerooms at junior levels (7-9) into which the students are divided, in each year level; Anne, Catherine, Francis, Joseph, Therese, Veronica & Ignatius. These homerooms are named after saints, as this is a Catholic school. In the senior year levels (10-12) students are divided into homerooms based on their house colour, then divided into three groups, such as Cameron 1, Cameron 2, and Cameron 3.  Curriculum  Mount St Joseph Girls' College has a various selection of subjects from years 7–12 which include the following: * Accounting * Art * Biology * Business Management * Chemistry * Drama * English * English Language * English Literature * English as an Additional Language * Food and Technology * French * Further Mathematics * Health & Human Development * Humanities ** History ** Geography ** Civics and Citizenship ** Politics * Information Technology * International Studies * Italian * Japanese * Religion and Society * Laboratory Skills * Legal Studies * Maths Methods * Media * Music * Physical Education * Physics * Psychology * Specialist Mathematics * Text & Traditions * Textiles & Design Multimedia * Visual Communications, and more.

It was operated by Dominion, Kingsgate and then WPG Resources. The mine is now on Care and Maintenance. The deposit was named by the geologist who discovered it (David Edgecombe), after his dog. History The ore body was discovered in early 1995 by Dominion Mining Ltd. It was found by using the relatively new (at that time) method of sampling calcrete (calcium carbonate laterite). Broad sample spacing of 800m fortuitously \\"snagged\\" the sub-surface orebody with a single high gold in calcrete value attracting almost immediate follow-up. The top of the orebody was beneath less than metre of transported cover and calcrete. Exploration drilling commenced in mid-1995 and continued for several years on a campaign basis. The initial drilling programs intersected high grade ore but were unable to consistently hit the ore zones at depth. Further drilling and detailed structural interpretation of the drill core lead to the orebody being defined as several tightly folded linear shoots, plunging at about a 45 degree angle. As yet, the bottom of the ore body has not been discovered, although there are several faults offsetting the orebody. The project was Joint- ventured with Samantha-Resolute in late 1995. Activities stopped during the late 1990s while Dominion negotiated to buy back Resolute's share of the project and then find another Joint-venture partner. Dominion was unable to find a Joint-venture partner and so in 2001 the company decided to develop the mine itself. The mine was initially an open pit, commencing in 2002 and converted to underground mining in 2005. Geology and mineralisation The Challenger deposit is located within portions of Christie gneiss, a member of the Mulgathing Complex that forms part of the Gawler Craton, a large crystalline basement province consisting of late Archaean to Mesoproterozic rocks that became stabilised by around 1,450 Ma. The deposit occurs within quartz-feldspar-biotite ± garnet-cordierite gneiss, a variation of Christie gneiss. The host to gold mineralisation is a silica and feldspar rich greisenised pegmatite. These veins are typically ptygmatically folded. The deposit is typically shear hosted with the morphology of the mineralised envelope being lensoid in three dimensions and anastomosing in character. Coarse visible gold of variable size and in association with sulphide mineralisation is a common feature of the higher grade ore zones. Gold grains contain inclusions of arsenopyrite, pyritised pyrrhotite and native bismuth. All lodes remain open at depth and historical drilling of the M1 lode has demonstrated the continuity of the orebody to at least 2.8 km down-plunge. Both primary host rock and the quartz, feldspar, garnet veins associated with gold mineralisation are generally competent, necessitating minimal ground support. Underground conditions are effectively dry with little groundwater inflow into the mine. The mine had an estimated reserve of 512,000 ounces of gold from a resource of 1 million ounces of gold at June 2007. Mineral resource estimate on 30 June 2017 was 1,621,000 Tonnes of ore at a grade of 6.99 g/t for 364,000 oz gold. Kingsgate Website, accessed: 13 November 2014 Byrnecut Mining Australia is the underground mining contractor. Nature of facility Challenger Gold Mine is an underground gold mine and processing facility. The infrastructure covers an area of approximately and includes the processing plant, a mine village housing up to 140 personnel working a fly-in /fly-out roster, aerodrome, reagent and fuel storage facilities, offices, workshops, a laboratory, ancillary buildings and haul roads. Water is supplied from a process water bore field located approximately west of Challenger. A diesel power station (PS1), supplies power to the treatment plant, and village. A secondary diesel power station (PS2) supplies power to the underground mine and surface ventilation fan. The mine lease is located in the Far North of South Australia, north-west of Adelaide within the Woomera Prohibited Area on the Jumbuck Pastoral Company lease. The site is either accessed by a nine-hour drive along sealed and unsealed roads or by Air which takes approximately 1.5 hours by plane from Adelaide. The main access road is a private road and runs approximately west from the Stuart Highway. The project has changed hands several times, with Kingsgate taking over the project from Dominion in 2010, followed by WPG Resources in 2015. WPG appointed voluntary administrators, then receivers and managers in July and August 2018. The Challenger Mine has stopped operations and gone into Care and Maintenance.

It is a subsidiary brand of Stagecoach London and operates services under contract to Transport for London. Selkent shares its headquarters with sister company East London at West Ham.

On 1 April 1989, London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units, one of which was Selkent.Companies House extract company no 2328595 South East London & Kent Bus Company Limited Selkent was the first London Buses subsidiary to completely cease operation of AEC Routemasters, in March 1992, when the Catford garage allocation on route 36B was converted to driver-only-operated buses.Wharmby, Matthew and Rixon, Geoff, Routemaster Retrospective (Ian Allan Publishing, 2007). In September 1994, Selkent was sold to Stagecoach and renamed Stagecoach Selkent. In November 2000, Stagecoach consolidated its London operations under the Stagecoach London brand. In August 2006, Stagecoach sold its London bus operations to Macquarie Bank. The new owner restored the Selkent name and logo. In October 2010 Stagecoach reacquired its old London operations with Selkent once again rebranded as Stagecoach London.Stagecoach re-enters London bus market BBC News 15 October 2010 Livery Between 1988 and 1994 Selkent, along with the other London Buses subsidiaries, used a red livery with a grey skirt. Following privatisation, Selkent adopted an all-red livery. In November 2000, Stagecoach introduced a new standard livery of white with a dark blue skirt and orange and light blue swirls at the rear. For Selkent (and East London), the white was replaced by red, to conform with a contractual requirement for London buses to be 80% red. After the sale to Macquarie Bank, an all-red livery was reintroduced. Garages Selkent operates three bus garages. Bromley (TB) Plaxton Pointer 2-bodied Dennis Dart SLF on route 314 in West Wickham, July 2011 As of December 2018, Bromley garage operates routes 61, 146, 314, 336, 638, 664 and B14. History Bromley garage was opened by the London General Omnibus Company in April 1924. Built at a cost of £23,000, it was originally designed to house 60 buses, although the plan was to ultimately enlarge it to take an additional 40 when operations required it. Under an agreement reached with Thomas Tilling, the garage was allocated to the latter's use, along with Croydon and Lewisham, resulting in Tilling-type vehicles being the mainstay of the fleet until 1949, when the final petrol-engined STL-type double deckers were finally superseded. This was made possible by the hire of 17 AEC Regents from Leeds City Transport. Between 1972 and 1979, Daimler Fleetlines joined the AEC Regent III RTs, running alongside them. AEC Routemasters were not introduced to Bromley until 1975, being replaced in 1984 by Leyland Titans. With regards to single-deckers, Bromley first housed RF-class AEC Regal IVs, arriving in 1952, which were gradually replaced by AEC Swifts between 1968 and 1971. FS-class Ford Transit minibuses were introduced in 1972 for local route B1, before these were replaced in 1976 by BS-class Bristol LHSs. These were in turn replaced by longer, BL-class Bristol LHs in 1978. In 1977 Leyland Nationals replaced the last of the SMSs, and ran alongside the BLs until 1985, when Bromley became the domain of Nationals and Titans. In the early 1990s, the Nationals were replaced by Carlyle bodied Dennis Darts and MCW/Optare MetroRider midibuses. After the takeover by Stagecoach, some of the Titans were replaced by Volvo Olympians, before the fleet at Bromley began to be standardised on the Dennis Trident 2 and the Dennis Dart SLF. In slightly more recent years, a plot of land on the opposite side of the side road (Lower Gravel Road) was developed into an open yard for storage of the larger number of generally longer, taller, wider vehicles required for today's operations. Catford (TL) As of January 2019, Catford garage operated routes 47, 54, 75, 124, 136, 199, 208 (part allocation), 273, 380, 621, N199 and P4. History Catford Garage was opened in 1914 by the London General Omnibus Company, but was requisitioned a year later and did not re-open until 1920 when Thomas Tilling's Lewisham operation moved there due to space constraints at his other garage. Originally coded L, for Lewisham, it was changed to TL in 1924 to avoid confusion with Loughton. Thomas Tilling gained an agreement in 1923 to double the size of Catford and to open a new garage in Bromley to cope with the new housing estates that were springing up around the area. The roof has had to be raised twice, first in 1930 to enable double deck buses to use the garage and again in 1948 to accommodate AEC Regent III RTs. By 1954 Catford was operating some 194 RTs, the last leaving in 1978. Catford has done considerably better than most garages in numbers over the years, especially since de-regulation, having an allocation of 122 buses in 1994 rising to around 160 in the early 2000s. Plumstead (PD) As at December 2018, Plumstead garage operated routes 53, 96, 122, 161, 177, 422, 472, 601, 602 and 672. History Plumstead is well sited to serve the growing Thamesmead area, and was built in 1981 to replace the existing Plumstead and Abbey Wood garages and was intended to be called Thamesmead. Built to hold 185 buses, when opened in 1981 it had an allocation entirely made up of MCW Metropolitans, and by 1983 had changed entirely to Leyland Titans. The garage was home to 35 Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses that worked on route 453 between March 2003 and April 2008. Fleet As at September 2014, East London had a peak vehicle requirement of 405 buses.

Career  Gramick was born to a Polish Roman Catholic family in Philadelphia, and attended Catholic grade and high schools. She moved to Baltimore in 1960 to join the School Sisters of Notre Dame, teaching high school mathematics through the 1960s. Later, she was an associate professor of mathematics at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in the early 1970s. Having graduated in 1969 with an M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the University of Notre Dame, Gramick completed a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania, obtained in 1975.The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Religious Archives Network In 1971, while engaged in graduate studies, Gramick became involved in a pastoral outreach to the lesbian/gay community. In 1972-73 she co-founded chapters of Dignity USA in Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.,Biography of Jeannine Gramick. DePaul University as well as the Conference for Catholic Lesbians. Gramick co-founded with Fr. Robert Nugent, New Ways Ministry, a social justice center working for the reconciliation of lesbian/gay people and the Catholic Church. Many publications written and edited by Gramick explain her positions and ministry, including \\"Homosexuality and the Catholic Church,\\" \\"Homosexuality in the Priesthood and Religious Life,\\" \\"The Vatican and Homosexuality,\\" and \\"Voices of Hope: A Collection of Positive Catholic Writings on Lesbian/Gay Issues.\\" She is the co-author with Fr. Robert Nugent of \\"Building Bridges: Gay and Lesbian Reality and the Catholic Church,\\". \\"Building Bridges\\" was translated into Italian and published as \\"Anime Gay: Gli omosessuali e la Chiesa cattolica\\" (Editori Riuniti, Rome, 2003). She has served on the boards of the National Assembly of Women Religious, the Religious Network of Equality for Women, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Women's Ordination Conference and the National Coalition of American Nuns. Controversies Gramick's activities have not been without controversy. In 1984, because of alleged ambiguities in her presentation of church teaching on homosexuality, the Archbishop of Washington prohibited her from engaging in any pastoral activities with respect to homosexual persons in the archdiocese. At the same time, the Vatican's Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life ordered her and Fr. Robert Nugent to separate themselves from New Ways Ministry, stating that they were not to lead any pastoral care of homosexual persons without faithfully presenting the Church's teaching on homosexuality. In 1988, the Vatican opened an investigation of her and Fr. Nugent's activities, which after publication of their books and the possible doctrinal errors contained therein, was transferred in 1995 to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). In 1999, after a written dialogue with her and Fr. Nugent, the CDF issued a public notification that the two authors' writings and activities were doctrinally unacceptable and failed to correctly and fully present Catholic teaching on homosexuality and permanently prohibited them from any pastoral work with homosexual persons. In 2000, her religious congregation, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, told her to cease speaking publicly on the topic of homosexuality. Gramick rejected the request, stating publicly, \\"I choose not to collaborate in my own oppression by restricting a basic human right [to speak]\\".\\"Catholic Gay Group to Honor Nun, Priest Silenced by the Vatican\\", Dignity, May 16, 2001 After this, she transferred to the Sisters of Loretto, another congregation of Catholic women religious which supports her ministry of education and advocacy on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2014, she was a signatory to an open letter to President Obama that urged him to expand U.S. funding of abortion services in the cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment in foreign countries, currently prohibited under U.S. law by the Helms Amendment. In April 2015, Gramick was banned from speaking in the Diocese of Charlotte by Bishop Peter Jugis. A Diocese spokesman, on behalf of Bishop Jugis, stated: \\"We are not going to have someone who opposes Catholic teaching to be teaching in a Catholic diocese,\\" The event titled Welcoming LGBT People and Their Families in Faith Communities was scheduled at St. Peter Catholic Church before the Bishop intervened. The documentary film In Good Conscience: Sister Jeannine Gramick's Journey of Faith, by Barbara Rick, details Gramick's decades of ministry with the LGBT community and controversies with the Vatican.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on May 6, 1939. Title The title is derived from the Warner Bros.' 1938 acclaimed feature film, Angels with Dirty Faces. It is similar to Avery's later MGM crime/detective-oriented cartoon Who Killed Who?. Plot The film takes place in the fictional New York town of Everyville, which is home to a vast total of 112 banks. The title card and technical credits are followed by introductions of the two lead characters: \\"F.H.A. (Sherlock) Homes\\" as police chief \\"Flat-Foot Flanigan with a Floy Floy,\\" and \\"Edward G. Robemsome\\" (a caricature of Edward G. Robinson) as notorious gang leader \\"Killer Diller.\\" After these introductions, Killer and his gang are seen robbing every bank in the town in numerical order (except that they skip the 13th bank out of superstition) — with the newspaper Telegraph Post reporting the criminals' every move, and even declaring that they have robbed 87 banks in a single day. Despite the criminals' predictability and their endless sight gags (in which Killer does everything from causing one bank to behave like a casino machine to picking up a pay phone and inserting his gun into the speaker, resulting in the operator shrieking in terror and giving him many coins), the police are unable to arrest them. However, after so much bafflement, Flanigan himself gets help from an unlikely source: a man in the front of the theatre who had been sitting through the whole picture; he tells him that Killer is making plans to go to the estate of Mrs. Lotta Jewels at 10:00 in the evening. While Killer and his gang are spending time in said estate, listening to \\"The Lone Stranger\\" on radio, Flanigan and his men find the criminals and fire at them. Thus, Killer is captured, convicted, and given a long sentence — which is revealed to be a prison term in which he must write standards (\\"I've been a naughty boy\\") on a blackboard one thousand times, much like schoolkids of that era. The imprisoned Killer blows a raspberry as the cartoon irises out. Notes The cartoon was banned in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1939, because censors \\"felt the film was just an excuse to show criminal activity.\\"Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America by Karl F.

Fictional character biography Protoplasman is the comic-relief superhero of the Big Bang world, who works closely with Knight Watchman either as a partner or as an assistant.

When using his powers, Protoplasman seems to take on a liquid- like form, suggesting that his powers are derived from fluidity, rather than elasticity. Since Big Bang Comics began self-publishing, Protoplasman has become a favourite with fans, with a sense of humor derived from Plastic Man (on whom he was based) and the zany attitude of Canadian actor Jim Carrey.

Recent Renovations In early 2008 a bill was passed giving Pleasant Grove funds to build onto the school. At all of the schools new tile, security systems, and paint will be added. The middle school has installed new lockers, restrooms, a new library, and new teaching equipment. The highschool has installed new lockers, restrooms, and other improvements. As of this time a new intermediate school to be opened in the Fall of 2009 has just started construction to give more space at the elementary and middle schools.

Taking its name from La Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia (Italian for The Most Serene Republic of Venice), the ensemble specializes in the music of Venetian Baroque composer Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741) and his contemporaries. Established in 1994, La Serenissima is recognised as the UK's leading exponent of the music of eighteenth century Venice and connected composers. Uniquely, the group's entire repertoire is edited from manuscript or contemporary sources, and it has been praised for its \\"glorious and all- too-rare ability to make one’s pulse race afresh with every new project\\" (Gramophone). Since its first release on the AVIE label in 2003, La Serenissima's recordings have been lauded by numerous publications and have attracted multiple award nominations; Vivaldi: The French Connection won the 2010 Gramophone Award for Baroque Instrumental. Their interpretation of The Four Seasons was released in 2015, reaching Number 8 in the UK Specialist Classical Chart and featured as Editor's Choice (Gramophone Magazine) and Concerto Choice (BBC Music Magazine). Their 2017 release The Italian Job has been praised on BBC Radio 3's Record Review and on Classic FM as ‘Drive Discovery’, reached the Top Ten in the UK Specialist Classical Albums Chart, and won the 2017 Gramophone Award for Baroque Instrumental in the ceremony's 40th Anniversary year. The ensemble's 2018 release Vivaldi x2 is a disc of double concertos for pairs of horns and oboes, and violin and cello. It entered the UK Classical Music Charts at No. 1 in the week of its release, and featured as Classic FM's Album of the Week. La Serenissima has performed internationally to acclaim; recent highlights include concerts at Bridgewater Hall, Sage Gateshead and Wigmore Hall, festivals in Petworth, Sablé, Swansea and Valletta, and performances of Brescianello's opera Tisbe at the 2018 Buxton International Festival. During 2017 the ensemble curated its first residency The Grand Tour at St John's Smith Square, performing little-known works by Brescianello, Caldara and Dall’Abaco amongst others of the Italian baroque; the group gave three performances with choir and soloists at the 2017 Vivaldi in Venice Festival for Martin Randall Travel.

Founder Thomas George Wittingslow made his start during the dark years of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. After a brief apprenticeship at a city fun parlour, Thomas went out on his own in 1932, working small shows and fairs in country Victoria. Returning to Melbourne for his first Royal Melbourne Show, Thomas began what was to become a lifelong association. His game of ‘Guess Your Weight’ involved the operator estimating, within four pounds, the exact weight of the customer. After six years of war service, Thomas returned to the industry in 1946 and with son Des began working fairs in large provincial towns. They ventured into the first amusement rides at the Royal Melbourne Show, when merry-go-rounds or carousels were hugely popular after years of war-time austerity. The Melbourne Moomba Festival of 1948 saw Wittingslow present the first new generation \\"thrill\\" rides. Over the next 30 years, the Wittingslow family business grew steadily with three generations playing an active role. Bigger, more exciting rides and games from England, Europe and the United States delighted showground patrons. In 1982 Tom Wittingslow formed a partnership with Terry Cartlidge and engineer and owner of CAMAC Ride manufacturing. This led to ventures into new ride designs and construction led to successful projects, such as the Sea World Corkscrew rollercoaster on Queensland's Gold Coast and many other successful thrill rides. Disagreements between the parties led to the dissolving of this partnership in 1986. CAMAC went onto building other notable rides such as the Lethal Weapon rollercoaster and other notable rides throughout SE Asia. The Wittingslow Carnival operated at all major agricultural shows, including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, and many street festivals in Melbourne. Since the 1950s, Wittingslow rides have also operated at the Rye and Rosebud Christmas Carnivals on the Mornington Peninsula.

Biography Her first major championship was the 2002 European Athletics Championships, and she finished 13th in the heptathlon. She came close to the podium at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships, finishing fourth, and took part in her first Olympics at the 2004 Athens Games, where she was 16th in the final rankings with a national record of 6108 points. She again just fell short of the podium with a fourth place at the 2005 European Athletics Indoor Championships and was eighth outdoors at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics later that season. The 2006 season was a breakthrough for Ruckstuhl – she won silver medals at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg. Her new record performance of 6423 points at the European Championships (a Dutch record) meant that she was ranked fourth in the world in the heptathlon that year.Heptathlon 2006. IAAF (2007-05-12). Retrieved on 2010-04-29. She also improved indoors, registering a national record of 4801 points in the women's pentathlon for the bronze medal at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships. However, she did not manage to finish the heptathlon at that year's major competition – the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. She suffered a herniated disc in her back and underwent surgery in 2008. Her time out from the sport was extended even further after she injured her Achilles tendon in February 2010. Following such serious injuries and some two and a half years away from top level competition, she decided to stop competing in multi-sport events and focused her efforts on just long jumping.No more Heptathlons for Ruckstuhl.

As Clumly believes in absolute law, order, justice and a Judeo-Christian world view, the two butt their ideological heads in a number of dialogues, all recorded on audiocassette by Clumly. Each of these two characters attempts to exert power over the other—Clumly with the law behind him and the Sunlight Man with his magic and violence—until they wear down not only each other, but many of the other characters with whom they come into contact.

Background and release By 1999, Farmer had barely appeared in the media since her 1996 concerts at Paris-Bercy. The singer spent most of this time traveling many countries (such as China, Ireland, Italy and the United States), where she drew her inspiration for her next album, giving it a greater ethnic orientation. She was also inspired by the books Falling In Love by Francesco Alberoni, If This is a Man by Primo Levi, and books on Buddhism. While some media announced that the album would be called Immortelles, Mes Moires (according to the magazine Voici), Mémoires and Ensemble,Jukebox, No. 179, June 2002 Devant-soi.com (Retrieved 22 March 2008) rumor had it that the next album would have more techno sonorities (and the first single would be named \\"The Small World\\", according to the Belgian newspaper 7 Extra). It was recorded at studios Ocean Way Recording and Record One in Los Angeles, but mixed at Guillaume Tell studio in Paris. Finally, the album was released on 7 April, almost a month after that of the lead single \\"L'Âme-stram-gram\\" and was named Innamoramento, in reference to the book by Francesco Alberoni mentioned above. A quote from this author is also cited at the first page of the album's booklet.Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Mylène Farmer, Benoît Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 125-126 The photographs, produced by Marino Parisotto Vay, cost about 104,000 euros.Mylène Farmer, le culte - L'envers du décor, Sophie Khairallah, 2007, Why Not Ed., p. 58 The cover shows Farmer dressed in white on top of an open iron cage in the middle of the ocean. Lyrics and music All lyrics were written by Farmer, who also composed the music for five songs. They contain many references to literary writers and painters. The album deals with Farmer's anxieties, such as pain, unhappy love, sexuality and the passage of the time.L'Intégrale Mylene Farmer, Erwan Chuberre, 2007, City Ed., p. 171 () But as the album's title suggests, love is the central theme of the latter. The album is slower in comparison to Farmer's previous studio album, the rock- inspired Anamorphosée (1995). The sound is more electronic and intimate. Critical reception The album received mostly positive reviews from media. DH Magazine stated that this album doesn't contain \\"any surprise, but is \\"tidy, less sophisticated than Anamorphosée, and ultimately captivating. (...) It is more spiritual\\". L'Humanité stated in their review \\"Her songs resemble the prayers of a monk, whose writing has always been seen as a therapy\\". However, certain reviews were less positive. For example, one magazine declared that \\"the musical climates remain the same, with arrangements with big spectacle and an evident dance efficiency\\", but with \\"too many strings, (...) too many background vocals, no place to breathe\\". Another magazine said that, in spite of the sophistication of the lyrics which is equal to the lace of the arrangements of melodies, songs are however rather insignificant. The album is considered \\"identical\\" to the previous ones by another press article. It was finally trashed as a \\"Destroy\\" by Claude Rajotte of Canada's Musique Plus defunct show Le cimetière des CD, the same critic who had praised Farmer's previous effort, Anamorphosée. In 2000, Innamoramento won a NRJ Music Awards in the category 'Francophone album of the year'. Commercial performance In France, the album was released at a time when Francis Cabrel made also his comeback with his album Hors Saison which topped the French Albums Chart. As a result, Innamoramento failed to reach #1 on the chart, but went straight in at #2 on 10 April 1999, remaining there for two weeks. Despite not hitting the top spot, the album remained in the chart for 94 weeks, including 18 weeks in the top tenInnamoramento, French SNEP Albums Chart Lescharts.com (Retrieved 1 February 2008) and became one of Farmer's highest selling albums. It re-entered the chart during Farmer's Mylenium Tour and also when Universal organised further promotion of the album. Certified Diamond disc by the SNEP,Mylène Farmer certifications Chartsinfrance.net (Retrieved 1 February 2008) Innamoramento ranked #4, #43 and #92 on 1999, 2000 and 2001 End of Year Charts. In Belgium Wallonia, the album went directly in at #5 on 17 April 1999, and then climbed to #2 during the following week and stayed there for five consecutive weeks. As in France, Francis Cabrel's album prevented Innamoramento from reaching the top of the chart. The album remained for 27 weeks in the top ten and 66 weeks in the Top 50.Innamoramento, Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved 1 February 2008) It featured at #5 and #58 on the 1999 and 2000 End of Year Charts.

This tribute to the film Ryan's Daughter by David Lean (mentioned in the lyrics) deals with boredom, cold, Ireland, love and death.

At the end, she removes the headphones and leaves the studio. The song refers to Buddhism and especially to the book The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, by Sogyal Rinpoche. The text evokes the astrology and the supreme god of gnostic (cited under the acronym 'IAO' = Isis, Apophis and Osiris). - 7 \\"Innamoramento\\" 5:20 Mylenium tour *Mylène Farmer 2019 No See main article \\"Innamoramento\\" - 8 \\"Optimistique-moi\\" 4:19 Mylenium tour * NRJ Music Awards (22 January 2000, TF1) * Les Années tube (3 March 2000, TF1) * Hit Machine (11 March 2000, M6) * Tapis rouge (25 March 2000, France 2) See main article \\"Optimistique-moi\\" - 9 \\"Serais-tu là?\\" 4:40 No No Farmer addresses to her lover and seems to evoke the regrets that can be felt in love. In the refrain, she wondered if he would agree if she was willing to sacrifice herself for him. Some words quote Paul Verlaine's work Les Poèmes saturniens. - 10 \\"Consentement\\" 4:35 No No Enigmatic lyrics refer to a budding love which is conjugated with the second-person of plural in French-language (= to address the lover as 'vous').

The song serves as sound background for one of the bonus included in the DVD Mylènium Tour. - 11 \\"Et si vieillir m'était conté\\" 4:50 No No The song evokes the passage of time and thus the old age and the death, personifiing the night. In the collector version of the album, the song's lyrics are not included in the booklet, but they are published on a sheet itself enclosed in an envelope stuck in the booklet.

It was signed on 5 July 1933 and came into force on 1 May 1934.

It was released by Team Entertainment on January 19, 2005 in Japan only. Album information This release was unique in that composer Kenji Yamamoto collaborated with not just the standard Japanese performers of American as well as Japanese artists. American credits include Steve Lukather guitarist of the 1980s rock band Toto and 1970s R&B; Soul Funk band Tower of Power who can predominately be heard on tracks 22-24, but despite these credits the album remains a Japanese exclusive. Because this release focuses on the first two PS2 DBZ games, many of Yamamoto's orchestrated tracks heard in the story modes of both games were left out. Prompting many fans digitally rip music straight from the games themselves. For the most part, the tracks featured are very rock oriented with only a few featuring a jazzy funk vibe thanks in part to Tower of Power's influence. The back of the jewel casing gives both Japanese and English track listings for the songs, but the English list is not a direct translation of the Japanese. Instead, they are the names that were provided when the games were released as Budokai and Budokai 2. Easily giving the impression that the soundtrack producer anticipated a big demand of importing the album by fans in English-speaking countries.

Early life Lloyd was born in Norwood, Surrey, England and educated at Aske's Hospital School, London. His father's business failed in and he was sent to work for a family friend in Sydney in 1833. He opened a store and was postmaster at Hinton, near Raymond Terrace on the Hunter River. After his employer's bankruptcy, he became a farmer on the Williams River and then an auctioneer in Sydney. He married Mary Threlkeld in July 1841 and they had eleven children. With the discovery of gold, he moved into the gold related businesses of quartz crushing and gold escorting and then invested in shipping. He returned to London in 1855 and his company, Lloyd, Beilby & Co., acted as commercial agents to the Government of New South Wales until 1859, when he went bankrupt due to losses on his shipping business. In 1860, after discharging his bankruptcy, he returned to Sydney to re-establish himself in business. Political career Lloyd won the seat of Newcastle in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly against James Martin, three times premier, in December 1869, advocating free trade, immigration, compulsory education, railway extension and a local harbour trust. He was Postmaster-General in Henry Parkes' first government from May to December 1872, when he became Colonial Treasurer. He introduced the penny postage to areas within ten miles of Sydney. He also abolished tariffs, duty on the postage of newspapers and tonnage dues at Newcastle, Wollongong and Kiama. In March 1877, he was Secretary for Mines in Parkes' second government, but lost his seat in October 1877. Lloyd went bankrupt again in 1878. He won Newcastle back in 1880, lost it in 1882, won it again in 1885 and lost it 1887. Lloyd was a founder, auditor and original shareholder of the Australian Mutual Provident Society. He was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in February 1887, but was largely inactive in it after 1889.

After the sale to Macquarie Bank, an all red livery was introduced. Garages East London operates five bus garages. Barking (BK) Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 on route 15 at Ludgate Circus in May 2011 As at March 2019, Barking garage operated routes 62, 145, 167, 169, 179, [London Buses route 173173 , 362, 366 and 462. On 27 August 2017, route 5 passed to Blue Triangle. On 30 March 2019, route 396 passed to Blue Triangle. History Barking garage was opened in 1924 by the London General Omnibus Company to cater for the increased demand from the new housing estates springing up in Becontree. Barking is remembered by many enthusiasts as being the last garage to operate AEC Regent III RTs on 7 April 1979. In 1992, it was intended to close this garage, along with those at North Street (Romford) and Seven Kings, in favour of a new super-garage at Chadwell Heath. As it turned out, this super-garage was not built due to the land for it being contaminated, and only Seven Kings closed.Wharmby, Matthew, The London Titan (Ian Allan Publishing, 2008) Thus, by 1994, Barking found itself with a scheduled requirement for 109 buses, mainly Titans and Optare Deltas.

On 27 August 2017, routes 15 and N15 passed to Blue Triangle. History Opened as a tram depot by the north Metropolitan Tramways Company in 1908 on land once occupied by an asylum, it was converted to operate trolley buses in 1939. It was converted to motor bus operation in 1959 including the installation of large overground fuel tanks. Shortly after its conversion, it took up the allocation of the nearby Clay Hall garage when that closed. The garage has had a long association with the AEC Routemaster, receiving its first examples in the early 1960s, some of which remained right up until August 2004 when the type was withdrawn from route 8. In December 2007, Bow took over the running of Heritage route 15 from the closed Waterden Road garage until this moved to West Ham in June 2009. Leyton (T) The first Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 delivered to Leyton garage in 1998 As at March 2019, Leyton garage operated routes 55, 56, 215, 257, 275, and N55. History Leyton garage was built in 1912 by the London General Omnibus Company to replace an existing garage acquired from London Metropolitan, and was in an ideal position to benefit from developing areas. During the Second World War the garage suffered bomb damage but was not rebuilt until a major renovation in 1955. The garage was the first to receive post-war AEC Regent III RTs, 78 of which were allocated by 1947, with a further 30 added for the trolleybus conversion program in 1959. RT operation at Leyton ended in 1972. When the London buses subsidiaries were established, Leyton was taken up by the London ForestCompanies House extract company no 2328491 London Forest Travel Limited subsidiary. In 1991, plans to close the garage were a contributing factor in strike action by all of the company's staff, which ultimately resulted in the winding-up of London Forest, with Leyton garage passing to East London. Leyton was the first garage for another bus type in 1999, when Stagecoach began taking delivery of low-floor Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2s. On 25 February 2017, the route 48 was transferred to Arriva London. On 14 October 2017, the route 257 was transferred from Go-Ahead London (London General) London Bus Route 257 Romford (NS) As at March 2019, Romford garage operated routes 86, 247, 256 (Morning Peak), 294, 296, 365 (Overnight Only), 496, 498, 499 and N86. History Romford garage is also called North Street (hence its NS code) as London Transport already had a 'country bus' garage: Romford (London Road). It was opened in 1953 to take the strain off nearby Hornchurch garage, and also to cope with the new Harold Hill estate. Built in the post-war style of a London Underground station, it was initially able to house 115 buses, although only 67 were allocated when opened. The allocation grew to 90 by 1958. In 1992, along with Barking and Seven Kings (which did subsequently close although due to loss of routes by competitive tender), the garage was earmarked for closure in favour of a new super-garage at Chadwell Heath, which ultimately was never built. By 1994, Romford was allocated 84 buses, mainly Leyland Titans. In 2004 the allocation had dropped slightly to 76, although with a good year of tender wins in 2005 the garage is up to full capacity. The garage was home to East London Coaches private hire operation from 1990 to 2005 when the section moved to the now closed Waterden Road garage. On 2 March 2013 Route 86 was partially transferred from this garage to West Ham (WH). West Ham (WH) As at March 2019, West Ham garage operated routes 15 (Heritage), 97, 238, 241, 323, 330, 474, 549 and D3. On 27 August 2017, route 115 passed to Blue Triangle. On 30 March 2019, routes 262 and 473 passed to Tower Transit. History West Ham bus garage in July 2010 The present West Ham garage was opened in February 2008 as the replacement for Stratford garage. Whilst construction work was underway, all major engineering work on its buses was carried out at Rainham. The garage became fully operational in November 2009 taking over its own maintenance. The new garage is able to hold over 350 buses. It is the biggest bus garage in England and is the new location for Stagecoach London's head office and training centre. Former garages Stratford (SD) Stratford garage closed in February 2008 with operations transferred to West Ham to allow the site to be redeveloped for the 2012 Olympic Games. History Stratford garage opened in 1992. It was a large yard on an old industrial estate by the River Lea, opposite the Hackney garage which was owned by First London. It was originally called Bow Midibus Base because it housed midibuses which had been previously based at Bow and West Ham. It also operated buses with rooftop flashing beacons for the London City Airport contract. One vehicle from this garage was destroyed in the London bombings of 7 July 2005. Thirteen passengers were killed, but the driver of the bus, George Psaradakis, escaped serious injury and was able to return to work a few weeks later. The bus was replaced in October 2005 by the first Alexander Dennis Enviro400 off the production line, which was named \\"Spirit of London\\" and it is now at Rainham Waterden Road (WA) Waterden Road depot in January 2007 Waterden Road garage closed in December 2007 to allow the site to be redeveloped for the 2012 Olympic Games. History Waterden Road opened early in 2004 with an allocation for approximately 100 buses, mainly articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaros for route 25. By 2005, East London had relocated both its training centre and its private hire fleet to this garage. The private hire fleet was disbanded in 2007. The garage had been open for less than four years when Olympics work forced its closure, the training centre moving to West Ham. Upton Park (U) History Prior to West Ham being built it was the largest garage in the east end of London; Upton Park was opened by the LRCC in 1907 but was requisitioned for the war effort in 1915 and was not returned to use until 1919. In 1931, it was totally revamped and enlarged to create a capacity of just over 200 buses. In 1988, the garage operated the X15 Beckton Express using ex-Green Line AEC Routemaster RMCs. The service was a trial, and sold newspapers to commuters on board. On 16 September 2011, Upton Park garage closed. There were no driver redundancies as a result of the garage closure as they were moved with the routes to other locations.Upton Park Garage to Close Stagecoach Bus The site was sold for redevelopment as social housing by Telford Homes in November 2014.Upton Park Garage Stagecoach Bus Fleet As at May 2015, East London had a peak vehicle requirement of 607 buses.

It is now held by about 500 households worldwide. The name was first used unofficially by Jean Batailly, knight of Marchamp, who in 1358 took possession of La Farge at Propiere. 'Bataillard' (or Bataillart) was thus first used by Jean Batailly de Marchamp as a nom de guerre, probably to reflect his status as a knight, but also as an adaptation of the pre-existing name Batailly. Over the next few years, he would officially incorporate the name (Jean de Marchamp dit Bataillard, 1365); and in 1366, Guichard de Verneys notes that his daughter Jaquette was married to Jean de M. dit Bataillard. Two years later, he would remove Marchamp from his name, thus giving rise to the first true Bataillard on 17 September 1368. This omission was not continued by his immediate descendants, however, who chose to keep their nominal ties to the noble Marchamp family. The engagement of the damoiseau (not yet knight) Jean Bataillard dit Marchamp, is recorded to have taken place on 1 September 1374, and so from this it is inferred that he was the son of the chevalier Jean Bataillard. In December 1441, through an old feudal agreement, La Farge was relinquished from Jean de Marchamp dit Bataillard (probably the son of the former, and the grandson of Jean Bataillard), and given to Ardouin Marchamp. This seems to be the last member of the original Marchamp family who chose not to adopt the name Bataillard. The death of Ardouin Marchamp in 1451 marked the end of Marchamp in the Bataillard line, and in 1459 La Farge was given to Thomas de Verneys (a close descendant of Guichard de Verneys, father-in-law of Jean de M. dit Bataillard (Jean Bataillard)). Throughout the 15th century, the Bataillards maintained a political standing in the entire Savoie region: the presumed cousin of Jean Bataillard, Guichard de Marchamp, was appointed chancellor of Savoie in 1414. Since this time, most Bataillards have remained in the Savoie and surrounding region, and a significant number now reside in neighbouring regions of Switzerland. The coat of arms of the family are two- fold. 1\\\\. 1552 (Romanel) A sinople background, bearing a chevron and three clubs, all in gold. 2\\\\. 1618 (Romanel) A green or gold background, bearing an armoured arm holding a sword, bordeau-coloured. The scheme and colours changed gradually in different branches of the family throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but the basic motif of a sword-bearing armoured arm is consistent. The family motto, generally linked to the second coat of arms, is given as \\"Savoir vaincre et rester bon\\" (Know how to win and remain good) References *\\"Archives de la Mairie de Vincennes\\" (Archives of the town hall of Vincennes) Category:Surnames ","title":"Bataillard"},{"id":"6881747","text":"Michael John Mackey Erritt, CB (15 February 1931, Belfast - 3 October 2002, Lindfield, Sussex) was the Deputy Director of the British Government Statistical Service.

He said that among the subjects tackled are religion, literature, sexuality, a hope for a better life, a happy love, revolt, dream and self-mockery. Although he deemed the album \\"consistent and uniform\\", he added that it is confusing due to the \\"particularly abstruse\\" lyrics, including many puns and literary references unknown to the general public. Some critics thought the album did not contain any big surprises: \\"Farmer's voice is still light, fragile, sometimes quavering\\" to better evoke emotion. The piano gives the tempo but the strings dominate to create \\"a labyrinthine atmosphere\\".

The tourist railway snakes its way up through the Macalister Range on the Cairns-to-Kuranda railway line which is no longer used for regular commuter services, but instead operates as a tourist service, operating every day of the year, except Christmas Day. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater railway station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda. The line is used for some freight services and other passenger services, such as The Savannahlander. The railway is in length. It takes about one hour and 55 minutes to climb one way including the stop off at the falls. Attractions The tropical gardens Kuranda rail station are a well-known attraction in the area. Downhill the line cuts through the Barron Gorge National Park. The tourist train stops at a lookout, with a sweeping view of Barron Falls. A number of smaller waterfalls are passed, including Stoney Creek Falls, just metres from the train. The station is a short walk into town where there is a zoo, markets, art galleries and ethnic Aboriginal crafts. In the zoo, there is the option to hold a koala and feed kangaroos, a true Australian experience. At the bottom of the mountain, where many people pick up the train, Freshwater railway station has an information center, a gift shop, and a cafe that is inside of an old train carriage. As the train travels up and down, a detailed and informative commentary of the railway's construction is provided.  History  Kuranda station in 1924 Construction of the railway began in 1886. The railway was completed as far as Kuranda in 1891. Passenger services began operations on 25 June 1891. Many lives were lost as numerous tunnels and bridges were built. 15 hand-made tunnels and 37 bridges were built to climb from sea level to 328 metres up the Macalister Range. Three million cubic metres of earth had to be excavated during construction. The first operation of a tourist train from Cairns to Kuranda was in 1936, using four longitudinal seating carriages.The Kuranda Tourist Train in 1991 Beckhaus, John Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December 1992 pp283-299 In 1995 major repairs had to be carried out after a severe rock fall damaged the track.

Population: History It was founded in 1886 as the village of Lyutoga (). In 1905, it was ceded to Japan with the rest of the southern part of Sakhalin by the Treaty of Portsmouth and renamed by the Japanese. The village was recaptured by the Soviet Union in 1945; it was granted town status and renamed Aniva in 1946. The origin of the name of the bay is most likely associated with the Ainu words “en” and “willow”. The first is usually translated as “existing, located”, and the second as “mountain range, rock, peak”; thus, “Aniva” can be translated as “having ridges” or “located among the ridges (mountains)” Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Aniva serves as the administrative center of Anivsky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the town of Aniva and fifteen rural localities of Anivsky District are incorporated as Anivsky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Economy The town's economy relies mainly on fishing, particularly salmon.

The album was generally well received by the critics and was a great success in terms of chart and sales (#1 for twenty weeks), becoming the best-selling album throughout the singer's career and the twenty second best-selling album of all time in France.  Background  After her first concert tour in 1989, Mylène Farmer released the new song \\"À quoi je sers...\\" which was a synthesis of her musical work and marked the end of an age. While the album En concert was charted, she took advantage of the following months to travel in various countries including India, and to discover new literary works, such as those of Emil Cioran in which she drew inspiration. She also became interested in painting and visited many art galleries and museums that were also sources of inspiration for her.Mylène Farmer, biographie, Bernard Violet, J'ai lu ed., 2004, p. 131 () Then she decided to compose a third studio album which was recorded at the studios Mega. This one showed an evolution of the singer : indeed, the texts marked a change of mindset and testified to a transformation in her life including a greater openness to the other (hence the album's title).

At the end, Farmer said she is excommunicated and prefers go away from the world. - 2 \\"Désenchantée\\" 5:22  * 1996 Bercy * Mylenium Tour * Avant que l'ombre... à Bercy * N°5 on Tour * Timeless 2013 * Sacrée Soirée (17 April 1991, TF1) * La Une est à vous (20 April 1991, TF1) * Stars 90 (13 May 1991, TF1) * Tous à la une (31 May 1991, TF1) * Riva del Garda (September, Rai Uno) See main article \\"Désenchantée\\" - 3 \\"L'autre...\\" 5:26  * 1996 Bercy * Avant que l'ombre... à Bercy * Stars 90 (13 May 1991, TF1) * Tous à la Une (27 December 1991, TF1) See main article \\"L'autre...\\" - 4 \\"Je t'aime mélancolie\\" 5:29  * En concert * 1996 Bercy * Avant que l'ombre... à Bercy *Timeless 2013 * Sacrée Soirée (Décember 11, 1991, TF1) * Tous à la Une (27 December 1991, TF1) * Stars 90 (13 January 1992, TF1) * Ein Kessel Buntes (March 1992, Germany) See main article \\"Je t'aime mélancolie\\" - 5 \\"Psychiatric\\" 6:12 No No See main article \\"Psychiatric\\" - 6 \\"Regrets\\" 1 5:17  * Mylenium Tour * Star 90 (7 October 1991, TF1) See main article \\"Regrets\\" - 7 \\"Pas de doute\\" 5:09 No No At first sight, the song seems to tell the story of a couple in which the woman accuses the man to shirk his responsibilities and to not get involved in the love relationship.

He was the founder of PIKA Forest Machines which produced the first purpose-built forest machine in 1964 in Ylöjärvi , Finland. His inventions had over 50 patents. History Sakari Pinomäki's first company, PIKA Forest Machines, is credited with designing the first self-propelled tree length timber processor, the PIKA Model 60, in 1968, and the first fully mobile timber \\"harvester\\", the PIKA Model 75, in 1974. These machines differed significantly from other \\"retro-fitted\\" forestry machines in that they were designed from inception to be timber harvesting and processing equipment, and were not conventional farming or earth moving equipment with additional apparatus welded onto them to allow timber processing work to be possible. Pinomäki coined the term \\"harvester\\" to describe his Model 75 machine, which differs from a tree length processor in that a harvester grips, fells, de-limbs and sections the tree on site, while a processor simply de-limbs a tree that has been felled by chain saws and dragged to the delimbing equipment. His designs and innovations have been subsequently copied by at least five other major manufacturers of heavy timber equipment, including Timberjack, Valmet and Ponsse, and were instrumental in developing the \\"Scandinavian\\" system of timber harvesting, which is far more sustainable and nature conserving than the methods employed up till the mid-20th century. The two machine harvester-forwarder system consequently became the worldwide standard for sustainable forestry. One of the most significant of PIKA's inventions has been the Paralcon Hydraulic valve system that can be used on any twin boom extending-retracting crane. This valve uses return oil flow pressure to power the extension piston, and flow oil pressure to power the retraction movement of the crane, as opposed to standard configurations that use additional pumps to power these crane movements. The result is that far less motor torque is necessary to operate the crane, which consumes far less fuel; this in turn saves operators money and reduces CO2 emissions for the machinery in use. Additionally, S. Pinomäki Ky PIKA was first to market in the early 21st century with the world's first production \\"Combination\\" machine, a single machine that can function in both harvester and forwarder roles. This 50 percent reduction in machinery to perform the same harvesting work means far less environmental pollution from CO2 emissions and terrain damage from machinery operation, and has again be co-opted by every major manufacturer of heavy timber processing equipment. Sakari died on July 29, 2011 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his two daughters and three grandchildren.

The album was preceded by the hit single \\"Libertine\\". The album was rereleased in 1987, preceded by the song \\"Tristana\\". The album, which was Farmer's only one written and composed by Laurent Boutonnat, achieved success in France. Despite this success, it is considered moderate when compared with Farmer's standards and her later high- selling albums, but it helped to launch her career.  Background  After the moderate success of the first four singles (\\"Maman a tort\\", \\"My Mum Is Wrong\\" [the English-language version of \\"Maman a tort\\"], \\"On est tous des imbéciles\\" and \\"Plus grandir\\"), Farmer decided to release her first album. At the time, she had signed a contract for two albums with the recording company Polydor, which reserved the right to break the contract at any time. Fortunately, in 1986, the success of \\"Libertine\\" brought Farmer her first big hit and allowed her to produce Cendres de lune. The vinyl release of the album contained only nine tracks, including \\"Maman a tort\\", \\"Plus grandir\\" and its B-side \\"Chloé\\", plus six other songs. Polydor did not procure the copyright for \\"My Mum Is Wrong\\", \\"On est tous des imbéciles\\" and its B-side \\"L'Annonciation\\" from RCA, the label Farmer released those tracks on. However, in 1987, with the increasingly prominence of the Compact Disc, the album was reissued with a total of 12 titles: \\"Tristana\\", the 1987 hit written by Farmer, and two remixes (\\"Libertine\\" [remix special club], \\"Tristana\\" [remix club]) were added to the track listing. The album was also released in Canada and Germany. The cover, in black and white, was produced by Laurent Boutonnat and shows Farmer in profile, apparently sad, putting on a hat.  Lyrics and music  The lyrics were written by Laurent Boutonnat who claimed to have had difficulty in composing them.L'Intégrale Mylene Farmer, Erwan Chuberre, 2007, City Ed., p. 71-72 () However, \\"Plus grandir\\", \\"Tristana\\" and \\"Au Bout de la nuit\\" were written by Farmer herself (from \\"Tristana\\" onwards, she wrote all the lyrics of her songs), and \\"Maman a tort\\" by Jérôme Dahan. Generally, the lyrics deal with themes that would recur in Farmer's future albums, namely death, violence, suicide, sexuality, sadness and fear of aging.Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Mylène Farmer, Benoît Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 67-68 Therefore, the bases of the singer's universe were laid with this first album whose darkness contrasted greatly with the optimistic songs of the time. Except for \\"Maman a tort\\" and \\"Libertine\\", the music was produced by Laurent Boutonnat who used mostly synthesizers and acoustic keyboards and was inspired by the new wave.

While the first two stanzas glorify the love, the two following refer to the split which leads to a heavy solitude. A sigh performed by a male voice punctuates the song. The song is the B-side of the vinyl for \\"Tristana\\". * It nas never been performed on tour, but four times on television: Béart 87 (14 January 1987, Antenne 2), Ligne directe (2 April 1987, Antenne 2), C'est encore mieux l'après-midi (9 April 1987, Antenne 2) and Sida: le grand rendez-vous (4 June 1987, Antenne 2) - 3 \\"Vieux Bouc\\" 5:38 Laurent Boutonnat Laurent Boutonnat  * The song is about a rite of witchcraft called the Sabbath, in which the goat symbolizes the Devil. Farmer addresses him and takes part in Satanic rites including baptism. A phrase of Jean-Paul Sartre's book Huis-clos (\\"L'enfer, c'est les autres\\") is cited in the lyrics. A choir of children, a goat's bleating and the singer's laughter are used in the background vocals. * At the beginning of the song, Farmer imitates a question-and-response from the Sabbath, in English: \\"Do you love the devil, my dear?/Oh, yes, I love him!\\". It was recorded in style suggesting usage of an effect known as backmasking, as well as being recorded and played back normally. * It has never been performed on tour nor on television; however, on Mylène's performance of \\"Chloé\\" on Azimuts, the final seconds of the song were heard just before she sang \\"Chloé\\". - 4 \\"Tristana\\" 1 4:35 Mylène Farmer Laurent Boutonnat  * It was performed during the 1989 tour and 26 times on television. - 5 \\"Chloé\\" 2:35 Laurent Boutonnat Laurent Boutonnat  * This rhyme, inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet, deals with the death of Chloé, the fictitious younger sister of the singer.

The song is the B-side of the vinyl for \\"Plus grandir\\". * It has never been performed on tour, but three times on television: Aujourd'hui la vie (16 September 1989, Antenne 2), Azimuts (24 September 1986, FR3 Lorraine) and Mon Zénith à moi (September 1989, Canal+) * In 2012 the song was partially redone on the album Monkey Me as \\"Nuit d'hiver\\". - 6 \\"Maman a tort\\" 4:04 Jérôme Dahan Laurent Boutonnat & Jérôme Dahan  * It has been performed during the 1989, 2000 and 2013 tours and 24 times on television. - 7 \\"We'll Never Die\\" 4:15 Laurent Boutonnat Laurent Boutonnat  * This song (with lyrics in French language) may be understood as tackling the theme of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It evokes a child who makes war for his homeland, which is futile because his death is inevitable. A musical bridge is sung in English by Carole Fredericks. In 1986, this song was released as a single in Canada. * It has never been performed on tour or on television. - 8 \\"Greta\\" 4:48 Laurent Boutonnat Laurent Boutonnat  * This song is a tribute to Greta Garbo, called \\"Divine\\" in the lyrics. Several allusions to the actress' life - the death of her parents, her distance from her fans - are mentioned in the couplets and slogans accompanying the release of some of her films are used in the refrain. Original statements by Garbo from several films are sampled at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the song.

It is more or less covered with silvery or rust-coloured scales and has narrow wedge-shaped leaves with a notched tip, and umbels of white to cream-coloured, five-petalled flowers. Description Phebalium daviesii is a shrub that grows to a height of and is more or less covered with silvery or rust-coloured scales. The leaves are narrow wedge-shaped, up to long and wide with a notched tip, a short petiole and glabrous on the upper surface. The flowers are white to cream-coloured and arranged in sessile umbels on the ends of branchlets, each flower on a pedicel about long. The sepals are joined to form a hemispherical calyx long and wide with triangular lobes. The five petals are broadly elliptical, about long and wide. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy Phebalium daviesii was first formally described in 1859 by Joseph Dalton Hooker and the description was published in The botany of the Antarctic voyage of H.M. Discovery ships Erebus and Terror. III. Flora Tasmaniae. Distribution and habitat St Helens wax flower is only found in a small area along of the George River near St. Helens on Tasmania's north-east coast. It grows in Eucalyptus viminalis woodland with a heathy understorey. Conservation status This phebalium is listed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and a recovery plan has been prepared. It was assumed to be extinct, having not been collected since 1892, until it was rediscovered in 1990, although in 2001, only 23 mature individuals were recorded. The main threats to the species are its small population size, damage caused by flooding and susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi fungus. Use in horticulture St Helens wax flower can be readily grown from cuttings and has been propagated in several plant nurseries. Culture In 2001, each Australian state nominated a native flower as a floral emblem to celebrate the centenary of the Federation of Australia. The St Helens wax flower was chosen as the Tasmanian Federation Flower.

The memorial is still in the center of the Grand′ Place (central square) of Lille, and has been surrounded by a fountain since around 1990. The siege The siege of September 1792 was one of the many battles fought during the French Revolutionary Wars and considered a major event in the city's history by its inhabitants, despite its relatively low military significance on a wider scale. A few months earlier, in April 1792, French forces in the same area did not conduct themselves well - fleeing after a skirmish with Austrian forces and afterwards killing their own commander, Théobald Dillon.; This might have made the Austrians expect an easy victory, which as it turned out was not the case.Rickard, J (8 January 2009), Battle of Baisieux, 29 April 1792 An Austrian army of 20,000 men besieged the city of Lille. Then the city was attacked by Albert Casimir, Duke of Teschen. For nine days and nights, the Austrians bombarded the city without intermission, but had ultimately to raise the siege, faced with the determined resistance of the citizens, led by Mayor François André. The Austrians destroyed many houses and the main church (Saint-Etienne) of the city, which was on the Grand′ Place (today the Place du Général de Gaulle). \\"The siege of Lille in 1792 was, from a purely military perspective, not a significant event. It is clear that contemporaries sought to exaggerate both the scale and the importance of the Austrian attack on Lille.\\" The monument \\"Column of the Goddess\\", erected to commemorate the Lille citizens' stand against the Austrian army Column of the Goddess on Grand Place The church was never to be re-built and the Grand' Place of Lille is still one of the few local central places without either a church or a belfry (unlike similar cities such as Bruges and Brussels). Hyacinthe Jadin composed his Marche du siège de Lille in 1792, in the direct aftermath of the siege. For many years there was, however, no physical monument in the city itself. Some fifty years later, the local authorities became aware that nothing had been made to commemorate the 50th birthday of this event. They decided on the building of a memorial, just in time to lay the first stone in September 1842, but it was not before 1845 that the memorial was finished. The memorial consists of a column topped by a statue. The column was designed by the architect Charles Benvignat, while the statue was sculpted by Théophile Bra as an allegory of the besieged city wearing a mural crown. It was nicknamed the Goddess by the inhabitants of Lille soon after the erection of the memorial, as some local poems suggest.

History The group formed in mid-1999 after the downfall of bands Caustic Soda and Mid Youth Crisis from which guitarists Donnie Dureau and Adrian Lombardi were members. In forming the initial lineup they were joined on bass by Dave Snow, formerly of The Bradshaw Figure, and Lachlan Hodgson, who drummed for Caustic Soda, and recorded their first EP, A Working Title In Green, released on Sony. Shortly after the release, Hodgson left the band and they were dropped by Sony. Shaun Lohoar (who has also played in a number of Melbourne-based bands, most notably Pollyanna) was recruited as the new drummer. After being signed by Fueled by Ramen (who then licensed their albums to Redline Records for release in Australia), the band released their debut album, The Apology Wars in 2001. The album included the lead single \\"Making the Nouveau Riche\\" which was voted into the No. 68 position in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001. Subsequent releases have included a 12 track compilation with Midtown, The Movielife and Secondbest, their second album Text Bomb in 2003 and a 6-track split EP in 2005 with Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (who subsequently supported Blueline Medic on an Australian tour) on Casadeldisco Records. 2007 saw the release of their third album 42:19. In 2008, Blueline Medic joined Melbourne label Hobbledehoy Record Co. and released The Middle Of The End 7\\", whom later released 42:19 on vinyl and the CD format (outside of Australia). Their last show before breaking up for the first time was in January 2009, in Brisbane. For this show, Donnie and Adrian played an acoustic set. In July 2010, they played their first show in 18 months at their \\"spiritual home\\" at The Arthouse, Melbourne. On New Year's Eve 2011/2012, the band played an unannounced 4 song set (with fill-in drummer Chris Cowburn from Loser). On 13 September 2013, the band played at The Reverence Hotel as part of the Poison City Weekender. The band also played with Bodyjar on a national tour in 2014.

The cartoon follows the early custom of Warner Bros. cartoons in being built around (and thus pushing) a melody from the Warners catalog, in this case, a song called \\"The Lady in Red\\" from the 1935 Warner film In Caliente (also known as Viva Señorita).In Caliente (1935) Plot The film features the antics of a society of cockroaches in a Mexican café in the absence of its owner. The owner Manuel is reportedly \\"off to the bullfights\\". The film opens with an instrumental of the title song, but interrupts the song with a solo performed by the gondolier cockroach hero. He sings the 1926 John Stepan Zamecnik-Harry D. Kerr composition, \\"Neapolitan Nights\\". The title song begins again and is interrupted with a solo by a cockroach parody of Rudy Vallee. He sings the Al Dubin-Harry Warren song, \\"Sweet Music\\" from the 1935 Warner Bros. film of the same name, The scene shifts to a rendition of the title song by a cockroach chorus. They are performing as the background singers to a lady cockroach, who performs as dancer. Her \\"red velvet gown\\" consists of a scarlet meat frill.

This semi-independent state was thought to serve as a safe haven for Lithuanians if the Republic of Lithuania would be occupied. In 1924 Kazys Pakštas considered Quebec to be the best location for such a colony. Later his attention switched to the state of São Paulo (Brasil) (1927), Angola (1930) and Madagascar. Efforts to establish a Lithuanian colony in Venezuela were abandoned due to the unstable political situation there. So finally it was decided to establish the Lithuanian colony in British Honduras. Meetings to set a land purchase or lease deal with local authorities in British Honduras were held. But due to the rise of an independence movement in British Honduras this project was not realised. The last considered location for Dausuva were the Bahamas, but support for this project was getting weaker and it never came close to realisation.

It stands at the head of Scandale, six kilometres north of Ambleside, at a height of 637 metres (2090 feet). It is an eastern outlier of Dove Crag in the Eastern Fells, although it does have 34 metres of prominence from that fell making it both a Hewitt and a Nuttall fell. It is frequently climbed as part of the Dovedale horseshoe, an 11 kilometre walk over the neighbouring fells of Hartsop above How, Hart Crag, Dove Crag and High Hartsop Dodd, starting and finishing at Brothers Water. Topography Little Hart Crag is composed of grassy slopes on its eastern slopes above the Scandale Pass, with the tiny Scandale Tarn tucked in a hollow in the hill. To the east it drops steeply into Caiston Glen. On its west side it is connected to Dove Crag by the boggy hollow of Bakestone Moss and to the north east a ridge falls away towards Patterdale going over High Hartsop Dodd before dropping steeply to the valley. The fell is craggy on its northern side as the crags of Black Brow fall into Dovedale. Geology The summit is an outcrop of Middle Dodd Dacite, the underlying rock being volcaniclastic sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit The summit is of interest, there being two distinct tops about 100 metres apart, both of whom are rocky. The western top is the higher and is marked by a cairn, while the eastern one is more shapely but a few metres lower and has quartzite set into its rocks. The view from the top of the fell is restricted by higher fells, but it does give the opportunity of studying the crags of Dove Crag and Red Screes in detail. Ascents Little Hart Crag is nearly always climbed in conjunction with other adjacent fells, there being no feasible direct ascent although it can be climbed from Patterdale via the top of the Scandale Pass. The most direct route from Patterdale starts at Brothers Water and firstly ascends High Hartsop Dodd before continuing to the summit of Little Hart Crag. Also from Patterdale the fell can also be climbed in conjunction with Red Screes or Dove Crag and even Fairfield.

Life and career Early life Wieman was born in Osnabrück, the only son of Carl Philipp Anton Wieman and his wife Louise. Raised in Osnabrück, Wiesbaden and Berlin, where he studied four terms of philosophy, history of art and languages, Wieman wanted to actually become an airplane technical designer and flier. He started his acting career on the stage in Berlin under the direction of Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater. In the early 1920s, he was a member of the Holtorf-Truppe, a stock theater group that included future director Veit Harlan. His fellow stage actors included his future wife, Erika Meingast, Marlene Dietrich, Dora Gerson and Max Schreck (the vampire in Nosferatu). Later he began working in silent and sound films; he landed supporting roles in Assassination, Queen Louise and Land Without Women. In 1930, along with Leni Riefenstahl, he appeared in Storm over Mont Blanc, and in 1932 he played the lead in Riefenstahl's The Blue Light. At the height of his film career, during the decade of the 1930s, Wieman acted in such productions as Man Without a Name, L'Atlantide, The Countess of Monte Cristo, Fräulein Hoffmanns Erzählungen, The Rider on the White Horse, Victoria, Patriots, and Togger. In 1936 Wieman produced the Frankenburger Würfelspiel of the Nazi playwright Eberhard Wolfgang Möller in association with the 1936 Summer Olympics and the inauguration of the Dietrich-Eckart-Bühne, and also played the Black Knight. He also had an international success with his appearance in The Eternal Mask. The movie was awarded with the American National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Film in the United States in 1937 (National Board of Review Awards 1937). The film was also nominated for an award at the Venice Film Festival. Also in 1937, Wieman was made Staatsschauspieler, an honorary title bestowed by the German government and the highest honour attainable by an actor in Germany. 1940s and after Wieman was classed as \\"persona non grata\\"Gedächtnisfeier für Mathias Wieman, Lindtberg: Reden und Aufsätze - Atlantis Verlag - Zürich - 1972. Pages 238-241. by Joseph Goebbels, this greatly reduced his activity. He acted in the following movies in the 1940s: Ich klage an, Her Other Self, Paracelsus, Dreaming and How Do We Tell Our Children?. After the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler happened in 1944, Mathias and his wife Erika helped the family of Count Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg. This assistance is detailed by Charlotte von der Schulenburg in the book Courageous Hearts: Women and the Anti-Hitler Plot of 1944 (Dorothee Von Meding, Berghahn Books, 1997). After World War II he was able to work more intensively in the film business again, normally in support roles. To his fairly well known work belongs No Greater Love, As Long as You're Near Me, The Last Summer, Ripening Youth, The Girl and the Legend, and opposite Ingrid Bergman in Roberto Rossellini's Fear. Two of the films Mathias starred in were in competition at the Cannes Film Festival: In 1952, No Greater Love; and in 1954, As Long as You're Near Me. Wieman also made many records (LPs) of classic stories where he would narrate the story accompanied by orchestral music. One example is Peter und der Wolf with Mathias and the Berlin Philharmonic in 1950 conducted by Fritz Lehmann and the Orchestre National de France in 1962 conducted by Lorin Maazel. Another example is Mathias Wiemans kleine Diskothek. In 1992 Deutsche Grammophon issued a commemorative set of CDs in honour of the 100th anniversary of Wieman's birth: Für Kenner & Kinder. Stage work Condolence Telegram from German President Gustav Heinemann on death of Mathias in 1969 Wieman grave, Osnabrück On stage, Wieman appeared in a number of productions including, Goethe's Faust, Pygmalion (play) by George Bernard Shaw, the most famous play of Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author, and in Bertolt Brecht's In The Jungle of Cities (Im Dickicht der Städte). His many friends included such diverse people as Hanna Reitsch, Lida Baarova, Hans Fallada, Anny Ondra, and Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg. Later life After World War II, Wieman moved to Switzerland with his wife, stage actress Erika Meingast, there in 1969 he died of cancer. Mathias and his wife Erika (died in 1972) were cremated and the ashes buried in the Wieman family plot in the Johannesfriedhof cemetery in Osnabrück. Honours In 1958, his hometown of Osnabrück awarded him the prestigious Justus-Möser-Medaille for his achievements in acting on stage and screen. And in 1965, Wieman received the Bambi Award.

Themes Much of the humour of the show springs from the characters' varying views on death and their contrasting beliefs about the relative importance of their work. The show often derives humour from the fact that the characters are not primarily forensic pathologists. Davison's character, Anthony Webster, is frequently at pains to explain that he is a histopathologist, for example. Their case load therefore infrequently verges into the more \\"exciting\\" area of crime-related death. Nevertheless, one of the running gags of the programme was that the character originally played by Tracy-Ann Oberman, the anatomical pathologist Ruth Anderson, was secondarily credentialled as a forensic pathologist, but had so rarely used these skills that her deductive reasoning skills were faulty. Two other major themes can be seen throughout the history of the programme. One is the desire, especially on the part of Donaldson and Webster, to educate the public about pathology. Various schemes, notably including the first radio broadcast of an autopsy, are hatched to accomplish this goal. Another predominant theme is the effect of a career in pathology on the personal lives of its practitioners. This is especially evident in Series 3 where every character has at least one subplot revolving around the issue. Chief among these is the series-long arc in which Ruth and Anthony try to conceive a child non-sexually — he because his relationship with his naturally-conceived daughter has fallen into ruin, and she because of an inability to sustain a meaningful romantic relationship with a man. Because of the inclusion of several recurring characters who are not practicing pathologists, but rather administrative or laboratory staff, the programme can also be classed as an office comedy in the vein of the television programmes, 30 Rock, The Thin Blue Line and NewsRadio. Characters Rigor Mortis employs a two-tiered ensemble structure, with the majority of the narrative surrounding the actions of the three pathologists, and the other recurring characters being used to further the actions of the main three characters. This structure is confirmed by the announced credits, which mention only the actors playing the pathologists during the opening title sequence. Pathologists *Dr. Anthony Webster (Peter Davison) — Webster is the one person in the office who is completely happy with his job. He's dreamed of being a pathologist since his youth, and indeed was mentored in his craft by his father. He has no illusions about what the job is or could be, and is never happier than when performing autopsies. So keen is his love for his speciality in histopathology, that he has been known to examine his own tissue samples, simply because there's nothing good on TV. For all of his scientific brilliance, he has great difficulty with the parts of life that occur outside the mortuary. This is exemplified by his relationship with his teenaged daughter, around whom he is extremely awkward. His zeal for pathology has instilled in him a sense of detachment from life, to the extent that he cannot form what many would consider \\"normal\\" interpersonal relationships. He is the nominal chief pathologist, although since there are ostensibly only two practicing pathologists in the department, this title has little practical relevance. His ex-wife is not a featured character, although she does finally appear in the penultimate episode of Series 3. *Dr. Ruth Anderson (Tracy-Ann Oberman, Matilda Ziegler) — Ruth's approach to pathology is decidedly more relaxed than that of Dr. Webster. She is frequently portrayed as bored by the overwhelming number of cases that come into her mortuary, as they generally reveal only natural causes of death. She is the only licensed forensic pathologist on staff, but this credential has gone mostly unused. Where Webster was drawn to pathology for serious scientific and familial reasons, she chose the career path apparently because of its romanticisation in popular culture. When the odd forensic case does arrive, she's quick to dust off her credentials, and equally quick to draw the wrong conclusions. Her search for romance has also been the subject of various subplots. *Professor Graeme Donaldson (Geoffrey Whitehead) — Donaldson is the administrative head of the department, and therefore the boss of Webster and Anderson. Though he is a qualified pathologist, he rarely gets involved in actual autopsies. He is generally used to introduce new staff policies or NHS directives, which Webster and Anderson must then implement. Supporting staff *Gordon McCallister (Tom Price) — Gordon is the lab assistant, who's stayed with the department long beyond his six-month training rotation. He is frequently depicted as an over-user of alcohol, though it's not implied that he is, in fact, an alcoholic. Rather, he's just seen as enjoying a good party. However, he frequently has memory loss after a serious bender, including one incident where he began receiving threatening notes from an anonymous enemy, only to find that he wrote the notes himself during a blackout. He is often portrayed as somewhat afraid of the staff secretary, Chloe. His relationship with Webster is complex, at once admiring of the pathologist's professional skills, but somewhat dismissive of him personally. He almost always refers to his seniors by their titles and the first letter of their last name, as in, \\"Dr. W.\\" or \\"Dr. A.\\" *Chloe Montague (Marianne Levy) — Chloe is the secretary at the department and openly dismissive of the educational gulf between herself and the pathologists. She frequently gives advice on personal matters to all the other characters, but takes affront if the advice isn't followed. She is somewhat catty with Ruth. *Sgt. Simon Oliver (Gus Brown) — Simon is the local police officer with whom the pathology department are in most regular contact. He has a bit of a crush on Chloe. His fear of death and the dead make him utterly unsuited to be the department's liaison with the police. Production and broadcast Rigor Mortis was recorded live in front of a studio audience at London's Drill Hall, typically at the rate of one episode each Friday night for six weeks.https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2003/05/09/4296.shtml Coverage of series 1 recording on the BBC's Doctor Who website. Little, if any, post-production work was applied to the recording. It was produced in three series over the course of four years. Each series contained six episodes. Series 1 was broadcast from 12 June to 17 July 2003. Series 2 went out from 11 November to 16 December 2004. Series 3 hit the airwaves from 26 January to 2 March 2006. Series 1 was subsequently rebroadcast on Radio 7 prior to the start of each subsequent series on Radio 4. Series 2 was not rebroadcast until mid-2007. The sixth episode of series 3 was purported to be the programme's last. Individual episodes were not titled, either by the voice-over announcer or the programme guide listings. The character of Dr. Ruth Anderson was recast after the end of the first series. Reception The first series of Rigor Mortis was well-received, cited as \\"brilliantly funny\\" and selected as the radio \\"Pick of the Day\\" by The Independent.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030612/ai_n12690797 Sturges, Fiona. \\"PICK OF THE DAY: Radio: Rigor Mortis\\". The Independent, 12 June 2003. The Sunday Times said Rigor was \\"wonderfully funny . . . the wit flashes as brightly as the scalpels\\", while Sue Arnold of The Observer wrote that it was \\"the sharpest, blackest and most original sitcom I've heard in years.\\" Availability in other media Rigor Mortis has never been released on CD or audio cassette. For a time after the initial broadcast of each episode, it was available for replay on the Radio 4 website. When the show was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 7 in 2007, it was again made available on the BBC Radio Player and re-broadcast in 2011 on BBC Radio 4 Extra. According to writer Laurence Howarth's agent, a script was in development for a televised version, as of 2006. The project seemed to still be in development as of 25 March 2007 but appears to since have gone into abeyance, with the website no longer live.

It is distinguished from the first tithe (Hebrew: ma'aser rishon מעשר ראשון), the third or poor tithe, and the terumat hamaaser. In the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, the second tithe involved the setting aside of one tenth of specific agricultural produce during the first, second, fourth and fifth years of each seven-year cycle, for the purpose of taking it to the holy city of Jerusalem, and consuming it there.  In the Hebrew Bible  Instructions for the second tithe are provided in Deuteronomy , supported by references in and .Rewriting the Torah: literary revision in Deuteronomy, p167, Jeffrey Stackert (2007) \\"It is precisely this issue that I shall pursue in this chapter: is there a literary relationship between the extant 5 As Tigay notes, LXX for Deut 26:12 already knows of a first and second tithe\\" provides instructions for the third or poor tithe, which is performed in the third and sixth years of the seven-year cycle.The Gutnick Edition Chumash - Book of Deuteronomy, p109, ed. Chaim Miller (2005). \\"(That year you will not separate the second tithe and take it to Jerusalem. Instead, you will give the poor man's tithe, ... THE EXPLANATION The Torah's “ permission” to exchange the second tithe for money could be interpreted in three ways...\\"The Commentary of Abraham Ibn Ezra on the Pentateuch: Deuteronomy, p68, Abraham ben Meïr Ibn Ezra, Jay F. Shachter (2003). \\"Having just mentioned the second tithe, Scripture now says: Do not think that you fulfill your duty with only the second tithe, within your gates The first tithe should be given to him who resides within your gates.\\"Law and theology in Deuteronomy - p71, J. Gordon McConville (1984). \\"Weinfeld's interpretation has in common with the traditional Jewish idea of a second tithe the belief that the tithes of Numbers and Deuteronomy are entirely incompatible with each other. There are difficulties with Weinfeld's position,\\" The remaining seventh year is described as the Shmita, the Sabbatical Year. As described, the tithe should be of grain, wine, and olive oil, but if the distance to Jerusalem made the carriage of these crops unreasonable, the monetary value of the tithe could be brought to Jerusalem instead, and used to purchase anything edible that the owner desired to eat there - an ox, a sheep, some wine, or beer, or \\"whatever your soul desires\\" - for a feast with the person's household in the presence of God.  In the Mishna and Talmud  The Mishnah, in Tractate Rosh Hashanah, describes four new years for various purposes. The new year for tithes for general crops is the first of Tishrei (the holiday of Rosh Hashanah), for animal tithes the first of Elul, and for the produce of trees the fifteenth of Shevat (the holiday of Tu Bishvat). The Talmud and later commentaries reflect a substantial amount of debate about the start and end of the tithing year for various types of crops in various situations.  The practice of the ma'aser sheni  The second tithe is a distinct tithing obligation of 10% of the produce after terumah and the first tithe were separated. If any of these tithes were not separated, the produce was known as tevel and forbidden for consumption.Talmud Bavli Hersh Goldwurm - 2007 \\"Rav Yosef says: The same six penalties would apply ... even when the olive's volume is composed of one mashed ant plus .... Tevel is produce grown in Eretz Yisrael that has reached the tithing stage but has not been tithed. \\" The owner of the produce was required to separate tithe, of any kind, after the particular kind of produce was finished in its common preparation for ingathering. Unlike the first tithe, the second tithe was only separated on the first, second, fourth and fifth years of the sabbatical year cycle. The poor tithe was separated on the third and sixth years. The produce was required to be maintained in a state of purity and eaten in a state of purity in Jerusalem, at any time of the year. If the owner did not desire, or was unable to, bring the produce to Jerusalem, he was entitled to redeem the produce on a coin of equal value, in addition to adding a fifth to the value. The ability to redeem produce on money results in money which is mikudash (sacred, as earmarked for Temple purposes), while the produce became desanctified and available for any use. The money could only be used for limited categories of use in keeping with its sacred status. Improper spending of the money was forbidden. The Scriptures include a commandment to remove all the tithes from one's house in the end of the third year (). Since the Torah enjoined the owner of the produce to share the second tithe with the poor, needy and disenfranchised, a large portion was shared as a form of charity.  In contemporary Orthodox Judaism  Orthodox Judaism still regards tithe obligations as in effect on produce grown in the Land of Israel, although proceeds from the tithes are no longer given to a Kohen or Levite or taken to Jerusalem. Contemporary practice is to set aside terumah, separate first tithe (ma'aser rishon), separate terumat ma'aser, separate either the second tithe or the poor tithe (depending on the year), then (if applicable) redeem the second tithe with a coin. The coin can be a minimal amount capable of purchasing food and need not be the value of the produce. When the value of the coin is \\"filled\\", the coin can be redeemed on a coin of higher value or discarded in a way that prevents its future use. Terumah and terumat ma'aser must be discarded in a manner consistent with their sanctity. The reason for discarding in such a manner is that the set-aside produce is still considered mikudash or sacred. While dedicated offerings cannot actually be offered in their traditional form in the absence of the Temple, because one must consume terumah and maaser sheni in a state of purity, they also cannot be used for mundane purposes. However, the mundane use of maaser sheni was not considered me'ilah (unauthorized or inappropriate use of Temple property/hekdesh). Every three years, on the mincha (afternoon service) of the last day of Pesach (Passover), they would say the Vidui Maaser (a confession of tithing prescribed specifically in the Torah). The reason this is done at the end of the festival, at the last prayer is because until that time (during the Temple era), people were still eating their Maaser Sheni.  Critical perspectives  In Classical Rabbinical Literature, according to which the entire Torah was principally written by a single author (Moses), the maaser sheni, and maaser ani were contrasted with the Maaser Rishon as entirely different tithes from each other, and for this reason gave the tithes the distinct names they possess.Jewish Encyclopedia However, according to the view of some textual scholars, the latter tithe, which is mentioned in the Priestly Code, and constitutes an annual tithe given over to the Levites, additionally tithing cattle and wine, is a conflicting version of the same single tithe as the tithe formed by the maaser ani and maaser sheni taken together; the maaser ani and maaser sheni together being the Deuteronomist's version and the maaser rishon being the version of the priestly source; despite the fact that those tithes appear in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The Jewish Encyclopedia article (1911) concludes that there is no significant textual evidence that the tithes come from different sources and the theory ignores the role of terumah and terumat maaser, which were separated for the priests. In both alleged \\"versions\\" it is required that a portion be given to the Leviim because they had no inheritance of land, unlike the other tribes, and were considered to be more likely to be supported by others' property. Although the deuteronomist is generally considered to be a later author than the priestly source, scholars believe that much of the Deuteronomic Code was a reaction against the regulations introduced by the Priestly Code,Richard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the Bible? and that here it reflects the earlier situation. Some scholars speculate that maaser sheni developed as a tribute to the king; the Books of Samuel mention that the Israelites were ordered by Samuel (speaking on behalf of God) to give a tenth of everything to the king, seemingly referring to such a tribute in a passage (1 Samuel 8:15) which textual scholars believe belongs to the monarchial source, and predates both the Priestly Code and the Deuteronomic Code.Jewish Encyclopedia, Books of Samuel This is in contrast to the reading of the text which was a warning by Samuel to the Children of Israel about the abuses of power that a king may impose. There is no example of an Israelite king actually imposing such a 10% tax. Further, ma'aser sheni was retained for consumption by the farmer who produced the crop or redeemed by said farmer for money to be used by him and his family. Some scholars speculate that these tributes began to be used for public festivals, often including religious ones, and thus gradually came to be seen as associated with the priests.Jewish Encyclopedia, Tithe Joseph Jacobs, M. Seligsohn, Wilhelm Bacher Once again, this is unlikely as the Levites who received ma'aser rishon were not priests (called \\"kohanim\\"). The kohanim received terumah and terumat ma'aser from the Leviim, not ma'aser rishon, as would be thought if they had written the Torah to enhance their own agenda. Moreover, this has nothing to do with ma'aser sheni, which, once again, was retained by the farmer who was liable to separate the tithe.

Background Isabel was born in Carrick, Scotland. Her parents were Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. Her brothers included Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, and Edward Bruce who briefly was High King of Ireland. In 1293 at the age of 21, she traveled to Norway with her father and was married at Bergen to King Eric. Her dowry for the marriage was recorded at the time by Norwegian nobleman Audun Hugleiksson who noted she brought: precious clothes, 2 golden boiler, 24 silver plate, 4 silver salt cellars and 12 two-handled soup bowls (scyphus) to the marriage. Isabel was king Erik's second wife, he having previously been married to the daughter of King Alexander III of Scotland, Margaret of Scotland, who died in childbirth in 1283. Upon the death of King Alexander three years later, his granddaughter, Eric's daughter Margaret, Maid of Norway became heir to the throne of Scotland. King Eric arranged the marriage of his daughter to the English King Edward I's son Edward, which became moot upon the child's death in 1290. The death of Queen Margaret left Scotland without a monarch, and at the mercy of Edward I of England. Soon, John Balliol tried to take the Scottish crown with the aid of John Comyn, the Red Comyn. The Bruce family captured strongholds in Galloway, and fighting in the name of the Maid of Norway (Margaret), suppressed the rebellion with many important families like the Stewards supporting them. At the time of Isabel's marriage in 1293, her brother was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne. The Bruces were aligned with King Edward against King John Balliol and his Comyn allies. In 1306, Robert the Bruce was chosen to be King of Scotland. Scottish historian G.W.S. Barrow observed that King Eric's renewed contacts with Scotland \\"increased the ties of friendship which bound him to the English king.\\"Barrow, G.W.S., Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland, Edinburgh University Press, 2005 Activity  Isabel was widowed, at age 26, at the death of King Eric in 1299. Erik was succeeded by his brother, King Haakon V of Norway who reigned until his own death in 1319. Isabel never remarried, despite surviving her husband by 59 years. Their marriage did not produce a male heir, though it did produce a daughter, Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, who, having firstly been engaged to Jon II, Earl of Orkney, married Valdemar Magnusson of Sweden, Duke of Finland, in 1312. Isabel herself arranged both engagements. She did not return to Scotland, but lived in Bergen, Norway, the rest of her life, and died there. As a queen consort, there is little information about her life, but her life as a queen dowager is better documented. Queen Isabel participated in many official events and ceremonies and did not lack influence. She was present with the royal couple at the inauguration in 1305 of Bishop Arne Sigurdssön, the new Bishop of Bergen. She had a good relationship with the clerical powers in Bergen, made donations and in 1324, received several houses from the church. It has been suggested, that she participated as a mediator in the negotiations between Norway and Scotland regarding Orkney and Shetland during 1312 under which the Treaty of Perth was reaffirmed. In 1339, the king pardoned a prisoner at her request. She exchanged letters with her sister Christina Bruce and sent soldiers in her support. In 1357, she was one of the heirs of her daughter Ingebjorg, Duchess of Uppland, Öland and Finland.

The distance can vary with species and in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from bird migration. Definition All insects move to some extent. The range of movement can vary from within a few centimeters for some sucking insects and wingless aphids to thousands of kilometres in the case of other insects such as locusts, butterflies and dragonflies. The definition of migration is therefore particularly difficult in the context of insects. A behaviour oriented definition proposed is This definition disqualifies movements made in the search of resources and which are terminated upon finding of the resource. Migration involves longer distance movement and these movements are not affected by the availability of the resource items. All cases of long distance insect migration concern winged insects. General patterns Migrating butterflies fly within a boundary layer, with a specific upper limit above the ground. The air speeds in this region are typically lower than the flight speed of the insect. These 'boundary-layer' migrants include the larger day-flying insects, and their low-altitude flight is obviously easier to observe than that of most high- altitude windborne migrants. Many migratory species tend to have polymorphic forms, a migratory one and a resident phase. The migratory phases are marked by their well developed and long wings. Such polymorphism is well known in aphids and grasshoppers. In the migratory locusts, there are distinct long and short-winged forms. The energetic cost of migration has been studied in the context of life-history strategies. It has been suggested that adaptations for migration would be more valuable for insects that live in habitats where resource availability changes seasonally. Others have suggested that species living in isolated islands of suitable habitats are more likely to evolve migratory strategies. The role of migration in gene flow has also been studied in many species.Hanski, I. and Kuussaari, M. (1995) Butterfly metapopulation dynamics. In: Cappuccino, N. and Price, P.W. (eds) Population Dynamics: New Approaches and Synthesis. Academic Press, New York, pp. 149–171. Parasite loads affect migration. Severely infected individuals are weak and have shortened lifespans. Infection creates an effect known as culling whereby migrating animals are less likely to complete the migration. This results in populations with lower parasite loads. Orientation Migration is usually marked by well defined destinations which need navigation and orientation. A flying insect needs to make corrections for crosswinds.Srygley, R.B., Oliveira, E.G. and Dudley, R. (1996) Wind drift compensation, flyways, and conservation of diurnal, migrant Neotropical Lepidoptera. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 263, 1351–1357. It has been demonstrated that many migrating insects sense windspeed and direction and make suitable corrections.Heran, H. and Lindauer, M. (1963) Windkompensation und Seitenwindkorrektur der Bienen beim Flug über Wasser. Zeitschrift für vergleichende Physiologie 47:39–55. Day-flying insects primarily make use of the sun for orientation, however this requires that they compensate for the movement of the sun. Endogenous time-compensation mechanisms have been proposed and tested by releasing migrating butterflies that have been captured and kept in darkness to shift their internal clocks and observing changes in the directions chosen by them. Some species appear to make corrections while it has not been demonstrated in others.Oliveira, E.G., Dudley, R. and Srygley, R.B. (1996) Evidence for the use of a solar compass by neotropical migratory butterflies. Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 775, 332. Most insects are capable of sensing polarized light and they are able to use the polarization of the sky when the sun is occluded by clouds.Hyatt, M. (1993) The use of sky polarization for migratory orientation by monarch butterflies. PhD thesis, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The orientation mechanisms of nocturnal moths and other insects that migrate have not been well studied, however magnetic cues have been suggested in short distance fliers. Recent studies suggest that migratory butterflies may be sensitive to the Earth's magnetic field on the basis of the presence of magnetite particles. In an experiment on the monarch butterfly, it was shown that a magnet changed the direction of initial flight of migrating monarch butterflies. However this result was not a strong demonstration since the directions of the experimental butterflies and the controls did not differ significantly in the direction of flight.

The Bogong moth is a native insect of Australia that is known to migrate to cooler climates. The Madagascan sunset moth (Chrysiridia rhipheus) has migrations of up to thousands of individuals, occurring between the eastern and western ranges of their host plant, when they become depleted or unsuitable for consumption.

The Australian painted lady periodically migrates down the cost of Australia, and occasionally, in periods of strong migration in Australia, migrate to New Zealand. The monarch butterfly migrates from southern Canada to wintering sites in central Mexico where they spend the winter. In the late winter or early spring, the adult monarchs leave the Transvolcanic mountain range in Mexico to travel north. Mating occurs and the females seek out milkweed to lay their eggs, usually first in northern Mexico and southern Texas. The caterpillars hatch and develop into adults that move north, where more offspring can go as far as Central Canada until the next migratory cycle. The entire annual migration cycle involves five generations. The painted lady (Vanessa cardui) is a butterfly whose annual 15,000 km round trip from Scandinavia and Great Britain to West Africa involves up to six generations. The hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum) migrates from Africa and southern Asia to Europe and northern Asia. Orthoptera Locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) regularly migrate with the seasons. Short-horned grasshoppers sometime form swarms that will make long flights. These are often irregular and may be related to resource availability and thus not fulfilling some definitions of insect migration. There are however some populations of species such as locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) that make regular seasonal movements in parts of Africa; exceptionally, the species migrates very long distances, as in 1988 when swarms flew across the Atlantic Ocean. Odonata Pantala flavescens is the world's longest known distance travelling dragonfly Dragonflies are among the longest distance insect migrants. Many species of Libellula, Sympetrum and Pantala are known for their mass migration. Pantala flavescens is thought to make the longest ocean crossings among insects, flying between India and Africa on their migrations. Their movements are often assisted by winds. Coleoptera Ladybird beetles such as Hippodamia convergens, Adalia bipunctata and Coccinella undecimpunctata have been noted in large numbers in some places. In some cases, these movements appear to be made in the search for hibernation sites.

Founded in 1871 by Milton Wright (father of the Wright brothers), it was originally sponsored by the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. In 1946, members of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the Evangelical Church to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church, with which the seminary then became affiliated. When that denomination merged with The Methodist Church in 1968, United Theological Seminary became one of the thirteen seminaries affiliated with the new United Methodist Church. The school was known as the Bonebrake Theological Seminary from 1909 to 1954. Although the seminary is affiliated with the United Methodist denomination, students come from many denominations and are ordained by a wide range of denominations upon graduation. The seminary houses a Hispanic Christian Academy, a UMC Course of Study program for UM local pastors, and a United Church of Christ House of Studies. The seminary also has strong ties to the African-American church tradition, with a number of major figures in the American Civil Rights Movement later going on to become students or faculty at United. In recent years, the seminary has become a leading center for discussion of church renewal. It has also been named one of the fastest- growing seminaries in the United States.http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/publications- presentations/documents/why-100-schools-have-grown.pdf History In 1869, the General Conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ voted to create and fund a seminary. The motion was suggested by Milton Wright, who later joined the seminary as the chairman of its first executive committee and named the seminary. The denomination's publishing house was already located in Dayton, making the city an ideal location for its seminary. The school opened as Union Biblical Seminary in Dayton in 1871, operating with two full-time professors. In 1873 the seminary began admitting women. The first graduating class completed their studies in 1874, while the first woman graduated in 1883. An important early supporter of the school was the prominent Rike family, who founded and operated Rike Kumler Co. The school changed its name to Bonebrake Seminary in 1909 to honor Mary and John Bonebrake, who gave the seminary 3,840 acres of land in Kansas in an effort to raise revenue for the school. After the land was sold this amounted to a gift of nearly $100,000. Due to the seminary's growing popularity and increasing enrollment, school officials had already been looking to expand the school's campus. In 1911 the seminary, which had previously consisted of only one building, was able to buy a new 274 acre tract of land which was located a mile and a half away from the seminary's previous plot of land. However, the school did not break ground to build any new facilities until 1920. Eventually the school constructed three buildings on the land, with the new campus being designed by the internationally acclaimed Olmsted Brothers, who also helped design dozens of other national parks, university campuses, and landmarks around the world, including Biltmore Estate, The Jefferson Memorial, and Yosemite National Park and whose father, Frederick Law Olmsted, designed Central Park. The school was able to hire the Olmsted Brothers due to a sizable contribution from John Henry Patterson, the founder of the National Cash Register Company. The three buildings were all completed in 1923, at which time the seminary sold the building it had previously been occupying. The building was bought by the Evangelical School of Theology, which had formerly been located in Reading, Pennsylvania. In 1943, the United States government established a top-secret testing site at the Bonebrake Theological Seminary for the Dayton Project, which was part of the broader Manhattan Project, where research was conducted on the creation of an atomic bomb and polonium was produced that would eventually be used in the atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. After many years of planning the Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the Evangelical Church, forming a new denomination which would be called the Evangelical United Brethren Church, with which the seminary then became affiliated. As a result of the merger that created the Evangelical United Brethren Church efforts were made to merge the seminaries of the two denominations. In 1954, United Theological Seminary was formed when the existing Bonebrake Seminary (the former United Brethren seminary) merged with The Evangelical School of Theology (the former Evangelical Church seminary located on the campus of Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania). Four of the faculty members from the Evangelical School of Theology moved to the new United Seminary in Dayton, Ohio. A new library was constructed in 1952 and a new dormitory completed in 1957, while 1961 saw the completion of a new worship center. In 1968, the Evangelical United Brethren Church and The Methodist Church denominations completed a merger to become the present day United Methodist Church and United Theological Seminary merged. became one of thirteen seminaries affiliated with the new denomination. The seminary began offering a Doctor of Ministry degree for the first time in 1971, with the first students to receive a doctorate graduating in 1973. The school established the Communication Center in 1973, with a sizable amount of multimedia technology resources and a television production studio. The seminary soon became known as a leader and innovator in religious programming and the application of new technologies to theological education. The seminary was also one of the first seminaries to offer curriculum and research related to biblical storytelling, with New Testament professor Tom Bommershine being credited as the creator of the discipline. The Harriet L. Miller Women's Center was created in 1977 to support theologians and clergy who wished to research or support feminist theology, womanist theology, and mujerista theology. The seminary later hired leading womanist theologian Prathia Hall as director of the center before she was later named dean of the seminary. During the 1970s and 1980s, several other new initiatives were undertaken and the seminary expanded their degree offerings at the masters level to offer two new degree programs. 1992 saw the creation of a Doctor of Missiology degree program. In 1996 a second campus was established in Buffalo, New York, on the campus of Houghton College, which was in existence until 2005, when school officials decided to shut down the campus and allocate funds to improve other institutional programs. Another campus site had earlier been created at the University of Charleston. That campus was later moved to West Virginia Wesleyan College, which is still a popular venue for students living in the Mideastern United States. Two years after celebrating their 130th anniversary in 2001, the seminary formed the Institute for Applied Theology in 2003, which offers courses and workshops to clergy, lay leaders, and community members. In 2012, the seminary changed the name of the Institute for Applied Theology to the School for Discipleship and Renewal. In 2005, the seminary moved their campus from Dayton to the suburb of Trotwood, purchasing property that was formerly owned by the Dayton Jewish Federation. The school's campus now sits on an eighty-acre piece of land just inside the Trotwood city limits. The main building on the property, formally known as the Jesse Phillips Building, was renovated, and the 78,000 square-foot space now houses the seminary's classrooms, faculty offices, student lounge, bookstore, multimedia recording studio, and library. O'Brien Library, named for two former longtime librarians at the school, features a replica Wright Glider to commemorate Dayton's aviation heritage and the leadership of Milton Wright (father of the Wright Brothers) at the seminary, as well as the Uncial 0206, which are a group of manuscripts from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The library currently holds over 150,000 books, periodicals, journal articles, audio and visual materials, and other resources. During the 2000s United has developed several distance learning programs and continues to attract students from nearly every state in the United States, as well as from a number of countries around the world. The school celebrated its 140th anniversary in 2011. In 2012 the school was named one of the fastest-growing seminaries in the United States. As of 2012, there are over 5,500 living alumni/ae who are living in all fifty states and over thirty countries around the world. The school has also become a leading center for discussion of church renewal and offers a variety of resources on the subject. Academics The seminary offers Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.), Master of Arts in Christian Ministries (M.A.C.M.), and Master of Ministry (M.Min.) degrees at the masters level, as well as a Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degree at the doctoral level. Students in the Master of Divinity program can choose a number of concentrations, such as Church Renewal, Pastoral Caregiving and Wesleyan and Methodist Studies. Students who live in a geographic area where theological education is not readily accessible can choose one of the seminary's online programs. The school's Doctor of Ministry program is one of the largest in the nation. Students in the program can choose from over forty concentrations, which each involve participation in a peer focus group cohort led by a faculty mentor specializing in the given concentration. United also offers a number of non- degree programs. The seminary also offers an Online Teaching and Learning Certificate (OTLC) for professors, pastors, and administrators who are hoping to expand their expertise in distance learning and online education, as well as the Course of Study School of Ohio online program. The school also houses the School for Discipleship and Renewal, which includes the Pohly Center for Supervision and Leadership Formation, the Center for Urban Ministry, the Center for Worship, Preaching and the Arts, the Harriet L. Miller Women's Center, and the Center for Hispanic/Latino Ministries, which all offer classes for enrolled students, clergy, and lay leaders. In February 2013, the seminary created a new online Hispanic lay ministry school as part of its Center for Hispanic/Latino Ministries.

It was also produced as a video.  Background  After the successful concerts tour of 1996, whose shows were spread out from 25 May to 15 December, a live album was recorded and produced by Thierry Suc, and sponsored by NRJ. It was remixed in studio to give it a better sound. The re-orchestrations, composed by Laurent Boutonnat, were very dynamic with very rock sonorities.L'Intégrale Mylene Farmer, Erwan Chuberre, 2007, City Ed., p. 193-194 () The photos illustrating the booklet were realized by Claude Gassian. The track listing contains songs from the four studio albums of Farmer, but Anamorphosée was sharply privileged, because all its songs were included on the album, except \\"Eaunanisme\\". This live was released on 21 May 1997.Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Mylène Farmer, Benoît Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 188-190 In May, a musical video of the concert was also realized, first as a VHS. For the first time, François Hans participated in the shooting of a live. As for the previous live album En concert, several scenes were re-filmed without the audience. The live video contains nevertheless numerous errors of editing, because it was compiled from four shows: three at Bercy and another in Geneva. It contains besides a making of and new images. Two years later, in May 1999, the video was released as a DVD, which constituted moreover the first DVD of the singer. However, it doesn't contain the bonuses available on the cassette. The DVD was dedicated to the singer's brother, Jean-Loup Gautier, died on 26 October 1996 after a road accident.  Critical reception  Generally well received by media, the album was nevertheless criticized for having been too much remixed in studio. For example, the journalist Caroline Bee declared: \\"Everything is emphasized: Mylène's voice, the shouts of the public, Abraham Laboriel's powerful drum, the bass and both guitars, impeccable. All that gives a perfect whole, without dissonance, but which sounds more as an album studio than as a real transcription of concert\\".Mylène Farmer – La part d'ombre, Caroline Bee, Antoine Bioy & Benjamin Thiry, 2005, Archipel Ed., p. 364-365  Commercial performance  In France, the album debuted at number 3 on French Album Chart, on 24 May 1997. It then reached its peak position, #2, for two consecutive weeks, and for two other weeks two months later. Andrea Bocelli's Romanza, then Era's eponymous album made it unable to reach number one. It remained for 18 weeks in the top ten, and dropped until #36 on 8 November, but managed to re-entered the top 20 the week after and there stayed for nine weeks. It almost kept on dropping the months after and left the chart (Top 75) after its 44th week of attendance, on 28 March 1998. Three days before, the album achieved Double platinum status by the SNEP, the French certifier, for a minimum of 600,000 copies sold.1998 certifications, by SNEP Disqueenfrance.com (Retrieved 3 April 2008) The video, both the VHS and the DVD, reached the first position on the French Videos Chart. They were both certified Diamond videos on 24 October 2001, for more than 100,000 sold copies. In Belgium Wallonia, the album went straight to number 4 on 7 June 1997 and then peaked at #2 for 12 consecutive weeks (Era topped the chart then). After 18 weeks in the top ten, the album slowly dropped the four following months and disappeared from the chart (Top 50) on 31 March 1998, after 35 weeks of attendance.

The construction of the Robb Sports Centre in 2005 is an example of this. The building includes two indoor basketball or badminton courts, netball courts, tiered seating for up to 200 people, a weights room, an aerobics studio, two squash courts and an artificial climbing wall. In 2009 construction of a new English block was completed, along with a new library and computer rooms. A new Junior School area (Year 7 - 8 students) was completed in 2014. Also in 2014 Owl Farm was launched, a demonstration farm that is a joint venture between St Peter's School, Cambridge and Lincoln University. Students use the farm regularly for a wide variety of applications including animal feeding, breeding and health, pasture composition, growth rates and dry matter percentage, weed identification, and more. Also in 2014, the Business and Entrepreneurial Centre (BEC) was opened. It is an initiative that helps students understand the importance of business, and to develop enterprising attributes and skills. For those students who have a keen interest in business, the BEC provides an environment where they can get practical support to get their ideas off the ground. The Avantidrome, Home of Cycling, was built on the school's grounds in 2014. It was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The board of the school approved the International Baccalaureate programme to be taught alongside the current NCEA curriculum at Year 12 and 13, effective 2009. It is the only school in the Waikato to offer the IB Diploma. In 2018 it reached a record roll of over 1130 students. Junior Sports Academies (Rugby, Football, Netball and Cricket) were introduced in 2017 as curriculum-based options in Years 7 - 10. School teams for these sports are offered at all age groups as co-curricular opportunities for all students, regardless of whether they choose to enrol in a curriculum academy or not. St Peter's has other sports academies including Equestrian, Rowing, Swimming, Golf, Rugby, and Cycling. In 2018 the school implemented the Well-being Curriculum and Pastoral Care structure. The Well-being Curriculum is at the leading edge of educational circles and provides benefits to all students and staff. The school has plans to open a purpose-built Well-being Centre in 2019-2020. As part of this, learning (tutor) groups were introduced. They are single gender in Year 9 and 10 and mixed gender in Years 11, 12 and 13. The Musical Theatre Academy was also launched in 2018. It provides student with intensive vocational training outside of academic class time. The programme is influenced by research that was conducted on top performing arts schools around the world. New Zealand musical theatre director David Sidwell is the Academy Advisor.

It retraces her two first albums, Cendres de lune and Ainsi soit je... and contains a cover, \\"Je voudrais tant que tu comprennes\\", originally sung by Marie Laforêt. Background From May 1989, Farmer began a series of concerts through all France, which was successful. After these performances, a live album, mixed by Thierry Rogen, was eventually recorded on 20 and 21 October 1989 in Brussels. The photos, made by Marianne Rosenstiehl, illustrate the booklet with images from various shows of the singer on stage. The album was released on 4 December 1989. It was the last album edited by Bertrand Le Page for Mylène Farmer, because he was later dismissed. A video of the concert, released in May 1990, was directed by Laurent Boutonnat who added to the concert some rather morbid sequences, such as satanic monks and cemeteries, giving thus to the video the look of a film. The editing was produced over a period of one yearL'Intégrale Mylene Farmer, Erwan Chuberre, 2007, City Ed., p. 116-117 () and was criticized, because certain scenes were re-filmed without the audience.Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Mylène Farmer, Benoît Cachin, 2006, Tournon Ed., p. 210 Two singles were released to promote En concert - what was rather rare at the time for a live album: \\"Allan\\" and \\"Plus grandir\\", which had a minor success, but were much aired in nightclubs.

Official university publications have claimed that the club was formed in 1856,BBC Cambridge... the birthplace of football?! on BBC, 13 June 2006 being also recognised as such by The Football Association.How Sheffield lost their position as world's oldest club by David Miller on The Telegraph, 9 Aug 2005 The FA awarded Cambridge a plaque in 2006 in honour of its \\"150th anniversary\\", giving its foundation date official recognition.Cambridge University FA rules football hall of fame honour on BBC News, 19 Oct 2016 Nevertheless, other sources state that the date of establisnment of the Cambridge AFC is not clear enough, setting it between 1856 and 1866.7 OLDEST FOOTBALL CLUBS: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? by Alfie Potts Harmer on HITC website, 2019 Cambridge currently plays in the Midland 1A of the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS), the governing body for university sport in the United Kingdom. The club has also a women's football section, managed by an independent committee. The section has two teams playing in their respective divisions.  History   Background  Varieties of football have been played for many centuries, but until the mid-19th century, none of the modern codes of football existed. Many different games were played at English Public schools and all of these were known simply as \\"football\\". Naturally, children who had learnt these games at school now sought to play them at university, but this was problematic because they were used to so many different sets of rules. Eton, Harrow and Winchester, in particular, developed codes which revolved around a roughly spherical ball being kicked along the ground (Weir, 2004). In 1846, H.C. Malden of Trinity combined these and other football games in the Cambridge Rules, one of the first codes of football, posting them on the trees around Parker's Piece. Debate on the rules continued, and in 1846, a revised set of Cambridge Rules were created. Some records (see Harvey) cite this as the foundation date of the club. The Cambridge Rules of 1856, one of the first codes of football that formed the basis of the current association football rules The foundation date of 1856 is based upon the 1856 copy of the Cambridge Rules held by Shrewsbury School which is entitled: \\"The Laws of the University Foot Ball Club\\". The Club history probably goes back even further: for example, Harvey states: \\"Salopians formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846\\"Adrian Harvey, Football: The first hundred years. Routledge 2005, page 251, reference no. 187 Certainly in the early 1840s Charles Astor Bristed confirms that at Cambridge there were games played between football clubs from different colleges and housesCharles Astor Bristed (1852) Five Years in an English University, page 365 Similarly, other sources show that an Arthur Pell established a football club at Cambridge in 1839.The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Rugby by Richard Bath, Carlton, page 10 This may have been the origin of the Cambridge AFC. Colin Weir asserted in his history of CUAFC that: \\"it would be hard to exaggerate the influence that the University footballers of Cambridge have had on the game in England and subsequently all over the world\\". This is borne out by the fact that the Cambridge Rules were an influence on the initial rules of The Football Association (FA) in October 1863, the first code for association football. Cambridge graduates set up many early football clubs, such as Hallam F.C. in the north and the Forest Club in Essex.  Club establishment  Meanwhile, within the University the 1860s witnessed the foundation of a formalised Cambridge University Association Football Club (CUAFC); the university club had previously been a somewhat ad hoc mix of students from Trinity and Jesus. Once Oxford had followed suit, there was immediate talk of a Varsity match, and on 30 March 1874 the two Universities first met. Although the Light Blues succumbed 1–0, they were to dominate their Oxford counterparts until the end of the century. In 1882, and CUAFC were still playing on Parker's Piece. A meeting of the Club concluded that it would be advisable to buy a ground, for Parker's Piece was not appropriate \\"owing to the fact that anyone can walk across and about the ground during the game\\". But it was not until 1895, however, that they were able to acquire Grange Road, in tandem with the Rugby Club, for £4,300. They were still paying it off until just before the First World War. Grange Road remains the university ground, although it was joined by Fenner's in 1975. The 1883 side was the first team to introduce the \\"pyramid\\" 2–3–5 formation (two defenders, three midfield, and five strikers).Csanadi Arpad, Hungerian coaching manual \\"Soccer\\", Corvina, Budapest 1965Wilson Jonathon, Inverting the pyramid: a History of Football Tactics , Orion, 2008 Following the success of the \\"Cambridge pyramid\\" this formation became the norm for all football teams. Notable players of 1883 side included W.N. Cobbold, A.T.B. Dunn and Pawson.The History of Cambridge University Association Football Club, 1872–2003, Colin Weir, Yore publications, Harefield, Middlesex, 2004 Their passing, attacking style led to a 3–2 victory in the Varsity match. The changes to team formation and playing style introduced by Cambridge AFC led to the longest consecutive run of victories (1883–1887) against the other university and their spectacular 5–1 victory in 1886 Combination play by Cambridge University FC is suggested in contemporary accounts as early as Dec 1872: \\"The goal for the university was the result of the combined efforts of Adams, Sparham and Smith\\".Sporting Gazette (London, England), Saturday, 21 December 1872; Issue 554. In this account Cambridge \\"played well together\\". In 1882, and CUAFC were still playing on Parker's Piece. A meeting of the Club concluded that it would be advisable to buy a ground, for Parker's Piece was not appropriate \\"owing to the fact that anyone can walk across and about the ground during the game\\". But it was not until 1895, however, that they were able to acquire Grange Road, in tandem with the Rugby Club, for £4,300. They were still paying it off until just before the First World War. Grange Road remains the university ground, although it was joined by Fenner's in 1975. Scene of a match v Oxford in 1905 Nationally, with the new social legislation of the early 20th century that distributed more money to the working classes and increased leisure time (particularly on Saturday afternoons) and with new technological advances, such as the expanse of railways, which facilitated the nationalisation of leagues, the game of football was truly blooming. All the great clubs of today were formed at this time. The munitions workers at Woolwich Arsenal put down their tools and started picking up their boots in 1886. Members of the cricket club at Everton widened their sporting interests in 1878. However, a disgruntled manager would later decide to form a rival club that played in red. With the support of the Three Crowns, Newton Heath was founded in 1878, soon joining with another side to become Manchester United, while Aston Villa grew out of the Bible Class at a Wesleyan Chapel in 1874. Fair to say that CUAFC's creation had truly captured the imagination of people from all walks of life. Cambridge University embraced this football explosion. It provided almost fifty England internationals in the early years. It was given a seat on the FA Council, which it maintains to this day. It has played against a plethora of league sides from within Britain and abroad; the first overseas tour took place in Hungary in 1902. Varsity matches were contested at Wembley Stadium until 1989.  Present days  The pride in this history and tradition within the club held the celebrations of its 150th anniversary in 2006: there was a lunch at the new Wembley Stadium, attended by officials of the FA, UEFA and FIFA. There was also a match against an FA XI on 1 May 2006, and a German TV documentary in which current players helped re-created that first game on Parker's Piece in 1866. In 2016 the National Football Museum presented a special award to CUAFC who the museum recognise as the oldest football club in the world, setting its date of foundation in 1856.“Oldest club in the world” inducted into the Football Hall of Fame on the UC website, 19 Oct 2016 (archived, 1 Mar 2017) A professional coaching set-up is being maintained. Both the Blues and Falcons are now competing in National BUCS leagues.  Legacy   Development of the modern passing style  In a detailed investigation into the evolution of football tactics based upon contemporary accounts, Adrian Harvey refers to the teams responsible for the early development of the passing game (including Sheffield, The Royal Engineers and Queens Park) but comes to the following conclusion about the finished, modern team product: \\"Curiously, the side that was generally credited with transforming the tactics of association football and almost single-handedly inventing the modern game was not a professional team but the Cambridge University XI of 1882. Contemporaries described Cambridge as being the first \\"combination\\" team in which each player was allotted an area of the field and played as part of a team in a game that was based upon passing\\". In a discussion by CW Alcock on the history of a \\"definite scheme of attack\\" and \\"elaborate combination\\" in football playing style, he states in 1891: \\"The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years. The Cambridge University eleven of 1882 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack\\"Association Football, chapter by CW Alcock, The English Illustrated Magazine 1891, page 287 Although there is some disagreement over whether the innovation began with the team of 1882 or 3, other historians have backed up this view,Principles of modern soccer By George Beim, Houghton Mifflin, 1977, page 5 including the football historian Sir Montague Shearman.Football, Badminton Library Series, 1904  England internationals  Twenty-four Cambridge players were capped for England.

He represented Richelieu in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent Conservative from 1870 to 1872 and 1874 to 1878. He was born Isidore Barthe in Restigouche (now Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation), Lower Canada, in 1834 and studied at the Séminaire de Nicolet. He articled in law and was called to the bar in 1856. With a partner, he published a newspaper Le Bas-Canada which advocated an independent Lower Canada; he went on to publish several other newspapers. Barthe was the first secretary-treasurer for Trois- Rivières in 1855 to 1857. In 1861, he married Joséphine-Charlotte, the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Meilleur. He was elected mayor of Sorel in 1864. Barthe was elected to represent Richelieu in an 1870 by-election after the death of Thomas McCarthy; he was defeated in 1872 but reelected in 1874. In 1882, Barthe returned to Trois-Rivières. From 1887 to 1894, he served as magistrate in the district court of Trois-Rivières. In 1894, he founded L'Indépendance canadienne which advocated a more decentralized Canadian union. In 1897, he was named official translator for the House of Commons. He died in Ottawa in 1900. His brother Joseph-Guillaume was also a lawyer and journalist and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada.

Background Born in Belfast in 1888. In 1902 he joined the first Fianna Éireann under Bulmer Hobson. In 1903 he moved to Glasgow where he joined the Gaelic League prior to entering a seminary. He served as monk in Scotland in his early adulthood until he got permission in 1913 from the abbot to leave the monastery and participate in the Irish independence movement. He married Brigid Keating and had eight children.Irish Bureau of military History- Séumas Robinson's witness statement – Statement 1721 Revolutionary 1916 Rising Robinson and his brother Joseph Robinson joined the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1913 in Glasgow, and in January 1916 joined the Kimmage Garrison in Dublin. He was appointed section leader by his superior George Plunkett and participated in the Easter Rising of 1916. On Easter Monday, he marched his section to Sackville Street and was greeted by Peadar Bracken who showed him an order from Commandant James Connolly which directed him to seize Hopkins and Hopkins jeweller's on the corner of Sackville Street. He held this position under constant fire until Thursday where he directed his section across the road to the General Post Office. Remarkably, his entire section survived this perilous manoeuvre. He was then stationed in the GPO and the Metropole Hotel for the remainder of the week. He was originally sentenced to death by William Lowe for his part in the Rising, but his sentence was subsequently commuted by General John Maxwell. He was then sent to Frongach internment camp for a number of months and was released on Christmas Eve 1916. Irish War of Independence In 1917 Robinson came to Tipperary at the request of Eamon Uí Dubhir, whom he had met while they were both imprisoned. Robinson became active in the work of the Irish Volunteers in South Tipperary,Bureau of Military History – Witness Statement 1348 Michael Davern and in 1918 was elected as commanding officer of the Third Tipperary Brigade.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1433 - Michael Fitzpatrick In 1919 together with Seán Treacy, Dan Breen and Seán Hogan, he led the party which took part in an attack on a convoy transporting gelignite during the Soloheadbeg Ambush in County Tipperary on the same day that 1st Dáil met. They shot the two policemen dead and stole the explosive. This is considered to be the first engagement of the Irish War of Independence.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1432 - Patrick Dwyer A few weeks after the ambush, Robinson decided to join Seán Hogan, Seán Treacy and Dan Breen on the run. These four men were referred to as 'the big four' and were keenly sought by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RiC) and the British military. A large police and military manhunt was launched to find them. A thousand-pound reward was offered for information leading to their capture, this was later raised to ten thousand pounds. The Police Gazette, ‘The Hue and Cry' regularly published accurate descriptions of the wanted men.Divided Loyalties; The Royal Irish Constabulary in county Tipperary 1919–1922- John Reynolds - University of Limerick The houses of known or suspected nationalists were ransacked by the RIC. Fairs and markets were banned in South Tipperary and martial law was imposed. On 23 February 1919 at a Brigade meeting in Nodstown Tipperary, Robinson and other Brigade officers drafted a proclamation (signed by Robinson) ordering all British military and police forces out of South Tipperary and, if they stayed they would be held to have \\"forfeited their lives\\". GHQ refused to sanction the proclamation and demanded it not be publicly displayed. Despite this it was still posted in several places in Tipperary.Seán Treacy and the 3rd. Tipperary Brigade by Desmond Ryan (Tralee 1945)Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1721, Séumas Robinson The leadership of the Irish Volunteers in Dublin, arranged for the big four to be shipped to America, however they refused to go. Robinson and Seán Treacy travelled to Dublin and met Michael Collins and told him that they, Hogan and Breen would remain in Ireland.Irish Bureau of military History - Séumas Robinson's witness statement - Statement 1721 Following Hogan's capture in May 1919, Robinson took part in his rescue at Knocklong railway station in East Limerick while Hogan was being transported from Thurles to Cork.Seán Treacy and the Third Tipperary Brigade I.R.A.- Desmond Ryan -Kerryman Limited, 1945 After Knocklong, Robinson, Treacy, Breen and Hogan relocated to Dublin where they participated with Dublin volunteers in a number of attacks in the early part of the war. Robinson returned to Tipperary at the end of 1919 to resume his role commanding the Third Tipperary Brigade. Under Robinson's leadership a series of attacks on RIC barracks were undertaken by the brigade in 1920. In September 1920 he appointed Dinny Lacey as O/C of the brigade's first flying column and later that year he established the brigade's second flying column with Seán Hogan as O/C. In April 1921, he became the second in command of the IRA Second Southern Division, under Ernie O'Malley. Civil War He was opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. When the Irish Civil War broke out over the Treaty, Robinson sent some of his Tipperary men to help the anti-Treaty IRA fighters in Dublin, after a plea from Oscar Traynor. However, the Tipperary contingent arrived too late to take part in the Battle of Dublin. At the outbreak of civil war, he was appointed O/C of the IRA Southern Division. He was critical of the leadership of the anti-Treaty side however, saying that they had no coherent military or political strategy. Politics At the 1921 general election, Robinson was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin TD for Waterford–Tipperary East. He failed to win a seat at the 1922 general election. Robinson left Sinn Féin and joined as a founding member of Fianna Fáil. He was elected to Seanad Éireann for Fianna Fáil in 1928 and re-elected in 1931 and 1934. He resigned his seat in 1936 after serving 8 years as a Senator. Later life In 1947 he was appointed one of the five founding members of the Bureau of Military History, associated with the history of the independence movement that lasted from 1913 to 1921 and was responsible for appointing military pensions to all those who had fought in the conflict from this period. Robinson died in Dublin on 8 December 1961 aged 72. He is survived by his two daughters.

It is a bottom- dwelling inhabitant of lagoons, estuaries, and reefs, generally at a depth of . Reaching across, this large ray is characterized by a thick, rounded pectoral fin disc covered by small tubercles on top, and a relatively short tail bearing a deep ventral fin fold. In addition, it has a variable but distinctive light and dark mottled pattern on its upper surface, and a black tail. Generally nocturnal, the round ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious, and is an active predator of small, benthic molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos sustained by yolk, and later histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") secreted by the mother; up to seven pups are born at a time. Although not aggressive, if provoked the round ribbontail ray will defend itself with its venomous tail spine, and it has been responsible for at least one fatality. It is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers. This slow-reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing, both targeted and as bycatch, and habitat degradation across much of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable. Taxonomy and phylogeny As Taeniura meyeni, the round ribbontail ray was described by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, based on two syntypes collected from Mauritius. However, this species is better known under the name Taeniura melanospila (or melanospilos), which was applied by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker to a juvenile specimen from Java, in a 1953 volume of the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië. Other common names for the round ribbontail ray include black spotted ray, black-blotched stingray, black-spotted stingray, fantail ray, fantail stingray, giant reef ray, blotched fantail ray, and speckled stingray. In Australia, it is one of several species referred to as \\"bull ray\\". A minority of authors place this species with the river stingrays in the family Potamotrygonidae. Preliminary morphological examination has suggested that the round ribbontail ray is more related to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura than to the congeneric bluespotted ribbontail ray (T. lymma), which is closer to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays. Description Characteristic features of the round ribbontail ray are its rounded, thick disc and mottled coloration. The round ribbontail ray has a thick pectoral fin disc wider than it is long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the floor, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. Camouflaged round ribbontail ray showing granules and tubercles on upper surface The pelvic fins are small and narrow. The tail is relatively short, not exceeding the width of the disc, and bears one (rarely two) long, serrated stinging spine on the upper surface. The base of the tail is broad; past the spine the tail rapidly thins, and bears a deep ventral fin fold that runs to the tail tip. The upper surface of the disc and tail are roughened by a uniform covering of small, widely spaced granules. There is also a midline row of sharp tubercles on the back, with two shorter rows alongside. The first of these tubercles develop at a length of around , over the \\"shoulders\\" and in the single midline row. The dorsal coloration is light to dark gray, brown-gray, or purplish, becoming most intense towards the fin margins, with a highly variable pattern of irregular darker mottling and white speckles or streaks. The tail past the spine, including the fin fold, is uniformly black, while the underside is creamy white with darker fin margins and additional dots. Young rays are more plain in coloration than adults. One of the largest stingray species, the round ribbontail ray can grow to across, long, and in weight. Distribution and habitat The round ribbontail ray frequents sandy patches near coral reefs. The round ribbontail ray has a wide distribution in the Indo-Pacific region: it is found from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa northward along the East African coast to the Red Sea, including Madagascar and the Mascarenes; from there, its range extends eastward through the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and Micronesia, occurring as far north as Korea and southern Japan, and as far south as Australia, where it is found from at least Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia to Stradbroke Island off Queensland, including Lord Howe Island. In the easternmost portion of its range, it has been reported from Cocos Island and the Galápagos Islands, with individuals possibly dispersing as far as Central America. Bottom-dwelling in nature, the round ribbontail ray is typically found close to shore at a depth of , though it has been reported anywhere from the surf zone to a depth of . It favors sand or rubble bottoms in shallow lagoons or near coral and rocky reefs, and may also enter estuaries. Biology and ecology The round ribbontail ray is relatively inactive during the day, often resting on sand near reef structures. The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal habits and rests motionless for much of the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or cobia (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti. Little information is available on the life history of the round ribbontail ray. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous: the unborn embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\", containing proteins, lipids, and mucus) produced by the mother. Reproductive aggregations numbering in the hundreds have been observed at Cocos Island shortly after the onset of La Niña, which brings cooler temperatures. During these periods a single female may be pursued by dozens of males. Females bear litters of up to seven pups, each measuring across and long. Off South Africa, birthing may take place in the summer. Males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of ; the maturation size of females is unknown. Human interactions A round ribbontail ray in the Maldives, where it is a valuable ecotourist draw. The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and has been known to approach and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive rate, and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, longliners, and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption. Off South Africa, the round ribbontail ray is captured incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, but is not utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.

History The district was created in 1896 under the name Bang Phai Nat (บางไผ่นารถ). The district office was in Ban Bang Phai Nat, Tambon Bang Sai Pa, on the east bank of the Tha Chin River. Later the government moved the central district to Tambon Bang Pla on the west bank of the Tha Chin. At the same time the district name was changed accordingly to Bang Pla. In 1939 the district was again renamed and received its current name Bang Len. The district office was moved to Tambon Bang Len in 1978. The term Bang Len refers to 'place of mire', named after Khlong Bang Len, a tributary of Tha Chin river. Geography Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise): Song Phi Nong of Suphanburi Province; Lat Bua Luang of Ayutthaya Province; Sai Noi of Nonthaburi Province; and Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Chai Si, Don Tum, and Kamphaeng Saen of Nakhon Pathom Province. Economy Wat Lampaya floating market (ตลาดน้ำวัดลำพญา) on the Tha Chin River is a well-known floating market as is Don Wai in Sam Phran. In mid-2019, the Department of Airports (DOA) proposed the construction of a new airport in Nakhon Pathom Province, 50 kilometres west of Bangkok, to relieve pressure on Bangkok's two existing airports. The 20 billion baht airport would occupy 3,500 rai of land in Bang Len as well as Nakhon Chai Si District. Its capacity would be 25 million passengers annually. If approved, construction would start in 2023 and the airport would be operational by 2025 or 2026.

It is free software, released under the Apache License. Originally developed by Hewlett-Packard as proprietary software in the 1980s, it was released as open source in 2005 and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.Announcing Tesseract OCR - The official Google blog In 2006, Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available.  History  The Tesseract engine was originally developed as proprietary software at Hewlett Packard labs in Bristol, England and Greeley, Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some migration from C to C++ in 1998. A lot of the code was written in C, and then some more was written in C++. Since then all the code has been converted to at least compile with a C++ compiler. Very little work was done in the following decade. It was then released as open source in 2005 by Hewlett Packard and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Tesseract development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.  Features  Tesseract was in the top three OCR engines in terms of character accuracy in 1995.Rice Stephen V., Frank R. Jenkins, and Thomas A. Nartker The Fourth Annual Test of OCR Accuracy, expervision.com, retrieved 21 May 2013 It is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. However, due to limited resources it is only rigorously tested by developers under Windows and Ubuntu. Tesseract up to and including version 2 could only accept TIFF images of simple one-column text as inputs. These early versions did not include layout analysis, and so inputting multi-columned text, images, or equations produced garbled output. Since version 3.00 Tesseract has supported output text formatting, hOCR positional information and page-layout analysis. Support for a number of new image formats was added using the Leptonica library. Tesseract can detect whether text is monospaced or proportionally spaced. The initial versions of Tesseract could only recognize English-language text. Tesseract v2 added six additional Western languages (French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch). Version 3 extended language support significantly to include ideographic (Chinese & Japanese) and right-to-left (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew) languages, as well as many more scripts. New languages included Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, German (Fraktur script), Greek, Finnish, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak (standard and Fraktur script), Slovenian, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. V3.04, released in July 2015, added an additional 39 language/script combinations, bringing the total count of support languages to over 100. New language codes included: amh (Amharic), asm (Assamese), aze_cyrl (Azerbaijana in Cyrillic script), bod (Tibetan), bos (Bosnian), ceb (Cebuano), cym (Welsh), dzo (Dzongkha), fas (Persian), gle (Irish), guj (Gujarati), hat (Haitian and Haitian Creole), iku (Inuktitut), jav (Javanese), kat (Georgian), kat_old (Old Georgian), kaz (Kazakh), khm (Central Khmer), kir (Kyrgyz), kur (Kurdish), lao (Lao), lat (Latin), mar (Marathi), mya (Burmese), nep (Nepali), ori (Oriya), pan (Punjabi), pus (Pashto), san (Sanskrit), sin (Sinhala), srp_latn (Serbian in Latin script), syr (Syriac), tgk (Tajik), tir (Tigrinya), uig (Uyghur), urd (Urdu), uzb (Uzbek), uzb_cyrl (Uzbek in Cyrillic script), yid (Yiddish). In addition Tesseract can be trained to work in other languages. Tesseract can process right-to-left text such as Arabic or Hebrew, many Indic scripts as well as CJK quite well. Accuracy rates are shown in this presentation for Tesseract tutorial at DAS 2016, Santorini by Ray Smith. Tesseract is suitable for use as a backend and can be used for more complicated OCR tasks including layout analysis by using a frontend such as OCRopus.Announcing the OCRopus Open Source OCR System (Thomas Breuel, OCRopus Project Leader). Tesseract's output will have very poor quality if the input images are not preprocessed to suit it: Images (especially screenshots) must be scaled up such that the text x-height is at least 20 pixels, any rotation or skew must be corrected or no text will be recognized, low-frequency changes in brightness must be high-pass filtered, or Tesseract's binarization stage will destroy much of the page, and dark borders must be manually removed, or they will be misinterpreted as characters.  Version 4  Version 4 adds LSTM based OCR engine and models for many additional languages and scripts, bringing the total to 116 languages. Additionally scripts for 37 languages are supported so it is possible to recognize a language by using the script it is written in.  User interfaces  Tesseract configuration window in OCRFeeder Tesseract is executed from the command-line interface.Google Code – Tesseract Readme While Tesseract is not supplied with a GUI, there are many separate projects which provide a GUI for it. One common example is OCRFeeder. Reception In a July 2007 article on Tesseract, Anthony Kay of Linux Journal termed it \\"a quirky command-line tool that does an outstanding job\\". At that time he noted \\"Tesseract is a bare-bones OCR engine. The build process is a little quirky, and the engine needs some additional features (such as layout detection), but the core feature, text recognition, is drastically better than anything else I've tried from the Open Source community. It is reasonably easy to get excellent recognition rates using nothing more than a scanner and some image tools, such as The GIMP and Netpbm.\\" See also *Libtiff  References   External links  * *Hacking Tesseract V0.04 – C/C++ structure of Tesseract extracted from Doxyfied source code (based on Tesseract V1.03) *Tesseract OCR Engine An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine.

Inspired by an earlier blues song, it was one of his first hits. \\"I'm a Man\\" has been recorded by a variety of artists, including the Yardbirds, who adapted it in an upbeat rock style. Bo Diddley song \\"I'm a Man\\" was one of the first songs Bo Diddley recorded for Checker Records. Unlike his self- titled \\"Bo Diddley\\" that was recorded the same day (March 2, 1955 in Chicago), \\"I'm a Man\\" does not use the Bo Diddley beat. Rather, it was inspired by Muddy Waters' 1954 song \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", written by Willie Dixon. After Diddley's release, Waters recorded an \\"answer song\\" to \\"I'm a Man\\" in May 1955, titled \\"Mannish Boy\\", a play on words on Bo Diddley's younger age as it related to the primary theme of the song. In a Rolling Stone magazine interview, Bo Diddley recounts that the song took a long time to record because of confusion regarding the timing of the \\"M ... A ... N\\" vocal chorus. There are conflicting accounts regarding the instrumental backing musicians for the song. Reissues of Bo Diddley's first album, Bo Diddley, list them as: Bo Diddley on vocals and guitar, Frank Kirkland on drums, Jerome Green on maracas, Lester Davenport on harmonica, and either Otis Spann or Henry Gray on piano. However, the song has also been identified as Chicago harmonica player Billy Boy Arnold's first contribution to a Checker recording. Arnold later played harmonica on several Bo Diddley songs. \\"I'm a Man\\" was released as the B-side of Bo Diddley's first single in April 1955. The single became a two- sided hit and reached number one on the Billboard R&B; chart. The song is included on several of his compilation albums, including Bo Diddley (1958) and His Best (1997). He also recorded it with Muddy Waters and Little Walter for the 1967 Super Blues album. The Yardbirds versions English rock band the Yardbirds recorded a live version of \\"I'm a Man\\" for their first UK album Five Live Yardbirds with Eric Clapton in 1964, that was later included on their second American album Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds. In 1965 during their first American tour, the Yardbirds with Jeff Beck on guitar, recorded a studio version of \\"I'm a Man\\", that is also included on Having a Rave Up. Their versions feature their signature \\"rave-up\\" arrangement, when the beat shifts into double time and the instrumentation builds to a crescendo. Beck added a \\"scratch-picking\\" technique to produce a percussive effect during the song's instrumental section, which critic Cub Koda notes \\"provides the climax on the studio version of 'I'm a Man', perhaps the most famous Yardbirds rave- up of all\\". Recording took place at the Chess Studios in Chicago, with additional recording at the Columbia Studios in New York. It was released as a single and later included on their 1965 Epic Records album Having a Rave Up. The Yardbirds' version (with \\"Still I'm Sad\\" as its B-side, released by Epic Records in the U.S.) peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. The song was later released in the UK in 1976. Diddley praised their cover as \\"beautiful\\" and it has been called \\"a defining moment for the band\\". In addition to the 1964 live version with Clapton, other live versions include those with Jeff Beck (1965 Yardbirds ...On Air, released 1991) and Jimmy Page (1968 Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page, released 1971 and Yardbirds '68, released 2017). Recognition Bo Diddley's original \\"I'm a Man\\" is ranked number 369 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". In 2012, the song along with the self-named A-side song \\"Bo Diddley\\" was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\\" American sound recordings. In 2018, \\"I'm a Man\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Blues Hall of Fame as a \\"Classic of Blues Recording\\".

Hales was born in Ballinadee, County Cork, where he and his brothers Tom, Donal and Robert, were involved in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence.The IRA & its Enemies, Hart, Oxford University Press, 1998, At the 1921 elections Hales was elected to the Second Dáil as a Sinn Féin member for the Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West constituency. At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the Third Dáil as a pro-Treaty Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the same constituency. He received 4374 first preference votes (7.98%). Shortly afterwards, the Irish Civil War broke out between the pro-Treaty faction, who were in favour of setting up the Irish Free State and the anti-Treaty faction, who would not accept the abolition of the Irish Republic. On 7 December 1922, Hales was killed by anti-Treaty IRA men as he left the Dáil. Another TD, Pádraic Ó Máille, was also shot and badly wounded in the incident. His killing was in reprisal for the Free State's execution of anti-treaty prisoners. In revenge for Hales' killing, four republican leaders who the Free State held in custody were executed on 8 December. See also Executions during the Irish Civil War. According to information passed on to playwright Ulick O'Connor, an anti-Treaty IRA volunteer named Owen Donnelly of Glasnevin was responsible for the killing of Hales. Seán Caffrey, an anti- treaty intelligence officer told O'Connor that Donnelly had not been ordered to shoot Hales specifically but was following the general order issued by Liam Lynch to shoot TDs or senators if they could.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 4,541. History The bay on which Tomari now stands was visited between July 12 and 14, 1787 by two French frigates, Boussole and Astrolabe, commanded by Lapérouse. The French named it Langle Bay after the captain of the Astrolabe. At that time, it was no more than a small cluster of huts. The French had good relations with the local people who they considered to be in the very distant past of northern Chinese origin, describing them as intelligent, good-looking, and short in stature. The locals were engaged primarily in fishing, hunting, and herding, with hardly any agriculture. They traded regularly with the communities on the Amur River on the mainland and with Japan. Lapérouse gives a very detailed description of his relations with these people in his work Voyage de Laperouse Autour du Monde, published in 1797. Modern Tomari was founded in 1870. Along with the rest of the southern portion of Sakhalin, it was placed under Japanese control by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905 and remained so until 1945, during which time it bore the name of , derived from an Ainu term meaning on the bay. It reverted to the Soviet Union in 1945 and was granted town status and renamed Tomari in 1946. Tomari is one of the only Ainu place names in Sakhalin that wasn't renamed from the Japanese administration era. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tomari serves as the administrative center of Tomarinsky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the town of Tomari and thirteen rural localities of Tomarinsky District are incorporated as Tomarinsky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Economy Fish, coil, and timber are extracted in the town. The largest industrial facility in the town, a paper factory, went bankrupt in the mid-1990s; its collapse provoked a large emigration.

It caters for boys from Grade 00 to Grade 12 and offers both boarding and day options to its pupils.home page of gc.ecape.school.za It was founded in April 1873. History Education in Grahamstown in the second half of the 19th century tended to divide the population along denominational and economic lines and, with few exceptions, was not altogether of a satisfactory standard. At a public meeting held in 1872 a resolution was moved to the effect that: \\"It is highly desirable to establish a high class nondenominational school in Grahamstown, with a view to providing an education which is not furnished by any of the present schools.\\" And so in April 1873, with an enrolment of 25 boarders and 45 day boys, under the headmastership of the Rev. Robert Templeton, the Grahamstown Public School opened its doors in the Drostdy Barracks and the Drostdy House, newly vacated by the Colonial military authorities. Both these buildings have since been swallowed up in the Rhodes University campus. The new school grew rapidly and within ten years the enrolment had reached 200. The first candidate for the matriculation examination was entered in 1874, and the school began preparing candidates for the examinations of the University of the Cape of Good Hope. The political troubles at the end of the nineteenth century saw the British Army wanting their buildings back and the school moving to new premises in Beaufort Street in 1898. It occupied this site until moving to its present campus in Somerset Heights in 1974. The site in Beaufort Street has since been renovated and taken over by Victoria Girls' High School. Over the years the name of the school has undergone several changes. During the period in which it offered matriculation classes to young ladies, it was known as Victoria High School, and finally in 1938 it adopted the name \\"Graeme College\\". Current state The school is divided into a pre-primary (Grades 00-R), a foundation phase (Grades 1-3), a junior school (Grades 4-7) and a high school (Grades 8-12). It consists of approximately 600 boys and 33 teachers. The majority of the boys that attend the school are day scholars. A hundred or so boys populate the hostels of Grant House (Grades 4-12) and Wallace House (Grades 1-3). Graeme College has four houses: Wiles, Vernal, Nielson and Hutton, each named after previous headmasters of the school. Academics The following subjects are taught at Graeme College (* = Grade 4 to Grade 9): * Mathematics * Maths literacy * English * Afrikaans * isiXhosa * Life Orientation * History * Geography * Computer Application Technology * Economic Management Sciences * * Physical Science * Life Science * Natural Science * * Technology * * Music * Accounting * Visual Art * Design * Business Studies Graeme College also participates in a number of academic competitions, some of which are the \\"Eskom Expo for Young Scientists,\\" the \\"Harmony Mathematics Olympiad,\\" the \\"South African National English Olympiad,\\" the \\"SAASTA National Astronomy Quiz\\" (of which the school was the winner in 2011), and the \\"Amesa Mathematics Olympiad.\\" Graeme College is currently ranked 35th academically of all the public schools in Africa. Cultural The school has a choir of more than 100 boys. There is also an elite choir for excellent singers, known as the \\"Leopard's Voice.\\" There are three steelbands. In the junior school, there is a Marimba band which maintains close relations with the Grahamstown-based \\"African Musical Instruments\\", the leading producer of marimbas in Africa, as well as the Rhodes University Music Department. Debating is also offered, with the debating first team coming second in the 2013 Eastern Province Debating Championships and winning the Championships in 2015.

O \\"Courage and Toil\\" was the watchword > then 'Tis the watchword now, and for days to come; For courage and toil are > the mark of men On the fastest pitch, in the fiercest scrum, At the hardest > task when all goes wrong – And this is the creed of the Graemians' song We > may wander away on the wings of hope To distant scenes in the far off years, > But our hearts will return to the terraced slope The gabled roofs and the > winding stairs, For time and distance but make more strong The spirit caught > from the Graemians' song.

From 1992 to 2003, Bölts took part in 12 consecutive Tours de France, arriving in Paris on every occasion, both of which feats are German records. These records have since been surpassed by Jens Voigt. His best placing in the hardest stage race in the world was in 1994, when he was ninth. In 1996 and 1997, he was an important helper of teammates and eventual winners of the Tour, Bjarne Riis and Jan Ullrich. During the 1997 Tour, he was noted for the words he shouted to Ullrich when the latter was about to crack: Quäl dich, du Sau! (force yourself, you sod!).

Joseph \\"Joe\\" Erskine (26 January 1934 – 18 February 1990) was a heavyweight boxer from the Butetown district of Cardiff, Wales. He was an Amateur Boxing Association Champion, Inter-Services Champion, and British Army Champion in 1953. He began fighting as a professional in 1954 and was trained by Freddie Elvin. He held the British heavyweight title from August 1956 to June 1958. In all, he won 45 of his 54 professional bouts, losing 8, with one drawn. His best wins were against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Dick Richardson, Uli Ritter, Jack Bodell, Johnny Williams, Joe Bygraves and Willie Pastrano. Erskine was a small heavyweight who outmaneuvered rather than overpowered his opponents. Angelo Dundee who saw his prospect Pastrano defeated by Erskine said he was surprised by his skill – further remarking that if Erskine had been just a bit bigger he could have been a world beater.I only talk winning; Angelo Dundee Career On 15 December 1955, Erskine had his first fight against Henry Cooper, at Harringay Arena, in an eliminator for the British heavyweight title, and won the ten-round fight on points. On 27 August 1956, Erskine won the British heavyweight title, which had been vacated by the retirement of Don Cockell. He beat fellow Welshman, Johnny Williams on points in a fifteen-round fight at the Maindy Stadium, Cardiff. On 17 September 1957, he added the British Empire (Commonwealth) heavyweight title, when he beat Henry Cooper for the second time. The fight was at Harringay Arena over fifteen rounds, and was won on points. He successfully defended his British Empire (Commonwealth) against Jamaican-born heavyweight Joe Bygraves on 25 November 1957, again winning over fifteen rounds on points. On 21 February 1958, he unsuccessfully fought for the European heavyweight title against Ingemar Johansson, in Gothenburg, Sweden, losing on a technical knockout in the thirteenth round. On 3 June 1958, he defended both his titles against Brian London, of Blackpool in a bout at the White City Stadium, London. Erskine was knocked out in the eighth round. On 24 February 1959, Erskine fought and defeated the talented American boxer Willie Pastrano, who was later (in 1964) to become World light-heavyweight champion. The fight was at the Wembley Stadium over ten rounds and Erskine won on points. On 24 June 1959, he fought another Welsh boxer, Dick Richardson in a ten-round bout at Coney Beach Arena, Porthcawl, Wales, and won on points. In the meantime Henry Cooper had defeated Brian London to take the British and Commonwealth titles from him. On 17 November 1959, Erskine fought Cooper for both titles, having beaten him on their two previous meetings. The bout was held at the Earls Court Arena, London. Cooper won the fight on a technical knockout. Cooper, who was renowned for the power of his left hook, floored Erskine twice with terrific left hooks and Erskine was hanging almost unconscious over the lower rope when the referee stopped the bout. On 21 March 1961, Erskine fought Cooper again for the two titles, this time at the Empire Pool, Wembley, and again lost on a technical knockout, this time in the fifth round. Erskine went to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to fight George Chuvalo, who was hoping to show that he had the talent to fight for the world title against Floyd Patterson. Unfortunately for Chuvalo the fight, on 2 October 1961, was stopped in the fifth round and Chuvalo was disqualified for persistent head butting. Erskine claimed that he was butted eight times during the five rounds, while Chuvalo claimed he was retaliating for getting thumbed in the eye by Joe. On 2 April 1962, he fought Cooper for the fifth and last time, this time at the Ice Rink, Nottingham. Cooper retained his titles by winning on a technical knockout in the ninth round. On 13 October 1963, he fought the famous German southpaw, Karl Mildenberger, in Dortmund, Germany, and lost the ten-round bout on points. On 3 March 1964, Erskine fought Jack Bodell, a British champion of the future, and defeated him on points over ten rounds. His last fight was against Billy Walker on 27 October 1964 at the Empire Pool, Wembley. He lost the ten- round bout on points. In his 54 professional bouts, he won 45 (13 on knock- outs), and lost 8 (6 on knock-outs). One of his bouts was drawn.

Together with Georg Christoph Wagenseil and Josef Starzer, Monn formed the Viennese Pre-Classical movement (Wiener Vorklassik), whose composers are nowadays mostly known only by their names. However, his successful introduction of the secondary theme in the symphony was an important element for the First Viennese School (Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert) that would come some fifty years later.  Biography  Much less is known about Monn's life than about his musical ideas. Only his appointments as an organist are known, at first in Klosterneuburg near Vienna. Afterwards, he was appointed in the same position at Melk in Lower Austria and at the Karlskirche in Vienna's Wieden district. He died of tuberculosis aged 33. His brother, Johann Christoph Mann (never Monn, 1726?-82), was also a composer whose works have sometimes been confused with Monn's. The reason for this is that most of Monn's compositions only survive in copies from the 1780s and could therefore also be the works of his younger brother. There is no absolute proof that the Johann Georg Mann is the same person as the Georg Matthias Monn who died in 1750. His role as pioneer of the symphony is a scholarly image, coined in the early 20th century, and could need some basic musicological reevaluation. From Baroque to Classical Together with Georg Christoph Wagenseil and other contemporaries such as Leopold Mozart and Josef Starzer, Monn could be said to represent a school of Austrian composers who had thoroughly studied the principles of counterpoint as practised by Johann Sebastian Bach and Johann Joseph Fux, but also effected a change from the formalistic, imposing and ornate Baroque style to the simpler, more graceful Galante music. Moreover, they renewed the sonata form by expanding the concepts of secondary theme and development. Later on, Michael and Joseph Haydn would develop these concepts to a much greater extent. The catalog of works written by Matthias Monn contains sixteen symphonies, a score of quartets, sonatas, masses and compositions for violin and keyboard. A harpsichord concerto by Monn was \\"freely\\" arranged by Arnold Schoenberg as a cello concerto for Pablo Casals. The Monn/Schoenberg cello concerto in D major has been recorded by Yo-Yo Ma and many other cellists. Schoenberg also wrote \\"continuo realizations\\" for several works by Monn, including a cello concerto in G minor which was recorded by Jacqueline du Pré.

Biography  Ramon Perellós (1637–1720) was the son of the Eighth Lord of Benetússer and Fifth Baron of Dos Aguas and of María de Rocafull y Vives de Boil, his consort. He joined the Order of Malta at the age of sixteen following family tradition. In 1658 he joined the board of the Master and in 1697 was elected Grand Master and remained so until his death in 1720.Ceresa, Massimo (1986). DAL POZZO, Bartolomeo. Dizzionario Biografico. Retrieved 2 July 2016. Malta had organised the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for the first time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellós. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar enough with maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on similar approach to Barcelona and Messina.http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.02(1956-59)/MH.2(1958)3/orig04.pdf p. 166. In 1697, Perellós gifted a collection of tapestries to St. John's Co- Cathedral, and commissioned another set of tapestries for the Grand Master's Palace. Perellós established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, for the first time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from Malta. p. 9. During his rule the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with the reorganisation of the drainage system in Valletta.http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150621/life- features/origin-and-development-of-vallettas-mandraggio.573635 He built two country residences, Villa Perellos in Paola and Casa Perellos in Żejtun. He died after 22 years as a ruler, due to illness and old age. His coat of arms was represented by three black pears against a golden background. His funerary monument is found at St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta and is considered to be one of the best examples of baroque art in Malta.Aldo E. Azzopardi, Malta e le sue isole, Sesto Fiorentino, Centro Stampa Editoriale, . p. 118 War against corruption Soon after his appointment, Ramon Perellós became very active in correcting cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime at the service of the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them. War against the Ottoman pirates Villa Perellos in Paola, Malta Perellós dedicated many of his efforts to stop the attacks at sea by Ottoman pirates, who would sail along the coasts of Spain and Italy to plunder merchant ships and enslave civilians. He ordered the knight of St. Pierre of the French Royal Naval Fleet to build a new war fleet to fight the Ottoman scourge. Meanwhile, the old galleys, together with the might of a vessel armed with 80 cannons, waged war at sea against the pirates. The Grand Master's new fleet was ready in port by 1706 and was headed by the same knight of St. Pierre. Three large vessels were launched that year by the names St. Vincent, St. Joseph and St. Raymond. Shortly afterwards, the fleet sailed west, where they encountered three Tunisian vessels, one of which was seized and incorporated into the fleet under the name of Santa Croce. One year later, the commanding knight Giuseppe de Langon, surrounded Oran and with his sole vessel, which harbored a force of 50 cannons, traversed the entire enemy fleet despite the vain efforts of the Algerians to catch him. He was subsequently nominated Lieutenant General of the Maltese fleet. In 1709, the Grand Master's fleet anticipated and repelled eight Turkish vessels which attempted to infiltrate the island of Gozo. During the same year, the Grand Master sent part of his fleet to also repel a Turkish unit which was threatening Calabria. Headed by the commanding knight of Langon, the fleet managed to sink an admiral ship. In the following year the commanding knight of Langon was defeated at sea after attacking an Algerian admiral vessel. Nevertheless, the Maltese fleet emerged victorious. Between 1713 and 1715, the fleet of the Order patrolled all the coasts around the Mediterranean succeeding in various important undertakings. Hospital of the Order During the rule of Grand Master Perellós, the Order was amassing great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellós, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident. Siege of Venice During the years preceding the siege of Venice, it was believed that the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army. Possibly alarmed by Malta's preparations, the Ottoman sultan directed his attention to the Republic of Venice, with which he declared war in 1716. In reply to a plea for assistance, the Grand Master Perellós lent five of his warships and a few galleys to repel the Ottoman invasion.

Birmingham City Transport was the local authority-owned undertaking that provided road-based public transport in Birmingham, England, between 1899 and 1969. It was locally known as the Corporation Buses. Initially, it was called Birmingham Corporation Tramways, and, after the first motor bus services started in July 1914, it became Birmingham Corporation Tramways and Omnibus Department in 1928. Finally, in November 1937, it was renamed \\"Birmingham City Transport\\", though Birmingham itself had been a City since 1889. It was incorporated into the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive in 1969. Introduction Birmingham City Transport was acknowledged as one of the country's finest transport undertakings. An employee of a neighbouring undertaking once said enviously that one could eat off the floor of a Birmingham bus. Birmingham City Transport ceased to exist at midnight 30 September 1969 when it became the largest component of the new West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, which at the same time took over the municipal undertakings of Walsall, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton. Birmingham also possessed a relatively small fleet of trolleybuses and the design of all except the first series ran parallel to the contemporary motor-buses. Birmingham City Transport seems to have inspired remarkable loyalty amongst its officers and troops - even if they did not feel it at the time, their pride is unmistakable now Birmingham City Transport has gone. Birmingham City Transport was a conservative operator will well-established principles - too conservative, some would say. In the 1920s, Birmingham led the way with closed top double-deck buses. When Birmingham City Transport did evolve its \\"New Look\\" bus in 1950, it took the British bus industry by storm. Many operators saddled themselves and their passengers with unreliable standee single-deckers but Birmingham City Transport exercised caution and then were the first city with one-man double deckers. Birmingham City Transport's reputation was founded on quality and attention to detail. History Birmingham's 'Outer Circle' bus route, issued by the \\"Birmingham Corporation Tramways & Omnibus Department\\" In 1899 Birmingham Corporation decided to follow the example of municipalities elsewhere and operate its own tramways upon expiry of the various leases granted by the Corporation to private companies. Powers to operate and electrify its own tramways were sought, resulting in the Birmingham Corporation Act 1903. The Corporation possessed limited powers to operate its own motorbuses under the Birmingham Corporation Act, 1903, but these powers restricted the running of such vehicles to periods during the construction, alteration or repair of tramways, or in prolongation of any tramway route, the extension of which might be contemplated. By November 1913 two motor omnibus routes were running from Selly Oak (tram terminus), one to Rednal and the other, overlapping the first route between Selly Oak and Longbridge but then striking west to Rubery. Ten Daimler 40 h.p. buses with 34-seat bodies, numbered 1-10, were purchased to operate the services and were thus the first buses to carry the Corporation blue and cream livery. The country was soon plunged into the Great War (1914-18), and many operators were faced with the commandeering of their motorbus chassis. Services had to be pruned as a result, and because BCT was unable to provide any \\"extras\\", Austins at Longbridge ran some 15-20 of their own buses which were the origin of the various independent services to works that are still a feature today. However more problems were on the way; in mid-1917 services were again drastically cut due to the acute shortage of petrol. By February 1926 the tramway route from Selly Oak had been extended to both Rednal and Rubery, so the Corporation decided to replace the two motor bus routes with tramways routes. In 1937 Birmingham City Transport was created out of Birmingham Corporation Tramways. The name reflected the fact that there was now a mixture of trams, trolleybuses and motorbuses operated in Birmingham. In 1945, to celebrate VE Day, an illuminated tram ran in the city.Colour footage of this tram at Erdington can be seen on the Heritage Media DVD, 'Birmingham - the way we were' Between 1947 and 1954, Birmingham City Transport purchased 1,748 new buses to replace its entire fleet of trams and trolleybuses, along with utility buses (built to inferior standards during the Second World War), and all except 40 or so of its pre-War fleet. The last tram ran on 4 July 1953. Birmingham City Transport placed a turban ban on all employees in 1960, which led to Sikhs going on strike. The ban was lifted in 1962. A preserved Daimler Fleetline CRG6LX bought new by Birmingham City Transport A preserved bus heads along the A38 Bristol Road near the Gun Barrels pub, Birmingham From the earliest days of motorbus operation the Corporation adhered to an agreement with the Midland Red bus company that routes would not operate beyond the city boundary. In return, Midland Red services from outside of the city would charge fares above that levied on the Corporation buses to discourage 'local' passengers. The only exceptions were jointly operated routes to Soho, Bearwood, Oldbury / Dudley and West Bromwich / Wednesbury (the latter with West Bromwich Corporation). Birmingham City Transport survived until 1969 when it became incorporated in the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive.

They return to the stage with slightly older fans and slightly larger pants to complete some unfinished business. These days they spend less time singing about tears, eternity, angels and their 'baby' and more time singing about divorce, shopping, and picking up the kids from school. As their triumphant tour draws to a conclusion all the personal issues that have been safely buried away for twenty years come bubbling to the surface with explosive consequences. Suddenly the band has to deal with allegations of infidelity, paternity tests, a miming fiasco, a band member \\"outing\\" himself live on stage, an awards night disaster, solo albums, a mysterious disappearance, and a plane journey that will cement the BoyTown legend forever. BoyTown Confidential The official BoyTown website features clips from a mockumentary BoyTown Confidential, hosted by Tony Martin as \\"Kenny Larkin\\", his character from the movie. The mockumentary was supposed to be included in its entirety on the DVD release of BoyTown, but was not included. Mick Molloy's Molloy Boy Productions has commented that it was left out due to lack of post-production funding. However, Tony Martin said that he would have paid the estimated $5000 post- production cost as he believed it was one of his finest works. Speculation persists that Molloy thought the mockumentary would upstage the film itself. This has led to an ongoing rift between longtime collaborators Martin and Molloy.

Today the institution is a non-denominational comprehensive school. Originally, the grand red sandstone building located on Eastmuir Street (now Shettleston Road) was thought to be \\"too grand\\" for the tiny village of Shettleston, which at the time was separate from Glasgow. The roll of the school quickly grew over the years, and required the construction of an annexe building in 1901, which housed primary education until Eastbank Primary School gained its independence from the Academy in 1969 following the construction of its own dedicated building on nearby Gartocher Road. Although now operationally separate, the two institutions retain their affiliation, sharing the same badge, colours and motto; the primary school being one of Eastbank Academy's five feeder primaries. The original 1894 building grew increasingly inadequate over the decades, with practical departments being scattered across a series of pre-fabricated buildings on the Amulree Street side of the school campus. As part of the GEAR (Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal) initiative, a brand new building was constructed and opened in 1986. At the time state-of-the-art, the 1986 Eastbank Academy building was noted for its extensive use of open plan teaching areas for science and practical subjects. The old 1894 building was extended, refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 into a home for John Wheatley College, whilst the 1901 Annexe building was acquired by Greater Glasgow Health Board in 1995. Consolidation of Glasgow's secondary school portfolio in the late 1990s led to the former John Street secondary being closed, and Eastbank's catchment area increased once again. The 1986 building was once again too small, and required yet another new building which opened in 2002. Following John Wheatley College's move to a new purpose built campus in the Haghill area in 2007, the original 1894 building of Eastbank Academy is now used by other community organisations. Motto The school's motto, Splendeat Lux, may have been a contraction of the Latin phrase Splendeat Lux Vestra which, when taken from the Sermon on the Mount, translates as \\"Let your light shine.\\" Alumni Famous alumni of Eastbank Academy include: *Junior Campbell (William Campbell) – lead guitarist, singer and songwriter with the sixties band The Marmalade).

It was founded in 1993 by Dutch designers Viktor Horsting (born 1969, Geldrop) and Rolf Snoeren (born 1969, Dongen). For more than twenty years Viktor & Rolf have sought to challenge preconceptions of fashion, and bridge the divide between fashion and art. Viktor & Rolf have designed both haute couture and ready-to-wear collections. The duo is renowned for their avant-garde designs, which rely heavily on theatrical and performative fashion runways. Background Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren first met while studying at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design in 1989.Evans, Caroline and Susannah Frankel (2008).The House of Viktor & Rolf. Merrell Publishers. p.225. Upon graduation in 1992, the pair began working together and relocated to Paris. Initially, Viktor & Rolf were shunned by the fashion industry, however, the designers were received well by the art world. Subsequently, art institutions such as the Groninger Museum began to acquire garments from the designers. Initial collections established the extravagant silhouettes, witty use of materials and irreverent concepts the designers would come to be known for. In 2000, Viktor & Rolf launched their company logo of a wax seal bearing the monogram V&R;, and began to devote their artistic talent to ready-to-wear collections.Evans, Caroline and Susannah Frankel (2008).The House of Viktor & Rolf. Merrell Publishers. p.227. In 2003, the designers launched a Menswear collection which co-existed alongside the women’s line until 2009.Evans, Caroline and Susannah Frankel (2008).The House of Viktor & Rolf. Merrell Publishers. p.232. Additionally, Viktor & Rolf created perfumes: the female fragrance Flowerbomb (2004) and the male fragrance Antidote (2006).Evans, Caroline and Susannah Frankel (2008).The House of Viktor & Rolf. Merrell Publishers. p.234-236. In 2015, the designers halted ready-to-wear production and returned once more to haute couture citing that they wanted to \\"explore the limits of wearability, function and form.\\"Loriot, Thierry-Maxime (2016). Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists. National Gallery of Victoria. p.155. Collections The fashion company has created both ready-to-wear and haute couture fashion collections.

Below are small summaries of Viktor & Rolf’s most recent haute couture designs. Bonbon (Spring/Summer 2014) Interested in exploring the point at which skin and clothing meet, Viktor & Rolf created a collection of latex couture pieces titled Bonbon.Loriot, Thierry-Maxime (2016). Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists. National Gallery of Victoria. p.51. The fluid materiality of latex (not commonly used in high fashion) juxtaposed with the light colour palette resulted in an almost ethereal and angelic collection. The pieces were created seamlessly and designed to appear as a second skin. To depict an illusion of depth stylistic birds, bows and ribbons were hand painted onto the latex, in a trompe-l'œil technique. The Bonbon collection was modelled by ballerinas en- pointe. Red Carpet Dressing (Autumn/Winter 2014-15) Described as a \\"surrealist commentary,\\" Viktor & Rolf's collection Red Carpet Dressing explored the reciprocal relationship between celebrity and designer.Loriot, Thierry-Maxime (2016). Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists. National Gallery of Victoria. p.125. The duo humorously exploited the concept of dressing for the red carpet by designing 22 couture gowns from red carpet. Elegant high fashion pieces were made from unassuming rough and rigid carpet. The designs incorporated animal skin patterns made from the same material and sewn onto the base. The monochromatic palette gave primary focus to the design and pattern making techniques, which recalled primitive knotted constructions and classic couture styles. Viktor & Rolf again used the haute couture platform to comment on the fashion industry and contemporary culture. Van Gogh Girls (Spring/Summer 2015) The ideas of momentum and growth were of central importance in the 2015 haute couture collection. To visualise the central concept, Viktor & Rolf adopted the quintessential summer outfit of a floral sundress, flip flops and a straw dress, and transformed the imagery into three-dimensional sculptural pieces. The collection escalated from a simplistic baby doll silhouette into extravagant couture pieces. Floral outlines evolved into three-dimensional fabric flowers, as simple straw hats extended laterally to connect with the pleated dresses. The evocative colours and black graphic outlines present throughout the garment collection were reminiscent of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, of whom the collection was aptly named after. Van Gogh Girls is not only an exercise in exaggerating forms and imagery, but additionally showcased the close relationship between artists and fashion designers. Wearable Art (Autumn/Winter 2015-16) The fluid link between art and fashion was perhaps most clearly portrayed with the Wearable Art haute couture collection. Twenty models, dressed in simple denim artist's smocks, walked the runway draped in what appeared to be oil paintings. Designed to mimic the imagery of classical paintings with gilded frames, the garments included cloaks, dresses and skirts. Through painterly illusion and construction, Viktor & Rolf transformed framed paintings into haute couture garments, and then back to paintings. During the display, the designers removed five of the garments from the models and hung them back on a white wall. The collection provoked public conversation as to the definition of art mediums. Vagabonds (Autumn/Winter 2016-17) Vagabonds entwined recycling with haute couture. Focused on conscious designing, Viktor & Rolf manifested a collection made entirely from discarded materials from their atelier.Loriot, Thierry-Maxime (2016).Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists. National Gallery of Victoria. p.144. Strips of fabric were braided, offshoots of tulle were sewn together, and buttons were clustered as embellishment. Overall the garments expressed the artistic possibilities of recycling. The collection was described as \\"a wondrous feat of conflating rag rugs to riches.\\"Verner, Amy (2016). \\"Fall 2016 Couture Viktor & Rolf\\", Vogue. Whilst still defined as haute couture, Vagabonds was noted to be a more wearable collection from the duo, offering the public a practical display of eco-friendly haute couture.Menkes, Suzy (2016). \\"#SuzyCouture: Gaultier Goes Green, Viktor & Rolf Recycle\\",Vogue Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Spring/Summer 2017) Imperfection was the central concept of Viktor & Rolf’s most recent haute couture collection. Recalling the message of recycling from the Vagabonds, Boulevard of Broken Dreams pairs contrasting patterned fabric with a fantastical and delicate colour palette. The recycled layers appear almost like shards of glass placed onto Viktor & Rolf’s signature exaggerated couture forms. The designers chose to consciously exploit such imperfections, following the Japanese principle of Kintsugi by gilding faults and seams in gold.Menkes, Suzy (2016). \\"#SuzyCouture: Viktor & Rolf- Gilding Broken Dreams\\", Vogue. The aesthetic and intention of the collection was summarised by critic Suzy Menkes: \\"The patchwork of grandeur was as pretty in its choice of colour as it was in the feminine shapes. And if recycling could be this elegant, maybe it could draw more fashion people to the party.\\" Exhibitions Below is a comprehensive list of art exhibitions which have featured the work of Viktor & Rolf.

Rather than being named after one person, the JHH is named in honour of three men, all of whom were called John Hunter. They were: * John Hunter, a former governor of New South Wales and the namesake of the whole Hunter region * John Hunter, the famed 18th-century surgeon and pioneer of anatomical pathology, and * John Irvine Hunter, an Australian anatomist who died in 1924 at the age of 26, having already been appointed the youngest anatomy professor at the University of Sydney  References   External links  *John Hunter Children's Hospital website *Hunter New England Local Health Network Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1991 Category:Hospitals in New South Wales Category:Buildings and structures in Newcastle, New South Wales Category:Teaching hospitals in Australia Category:Hospitals established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Australia ","title":"John Hunter Hospital"},{"id":"6882625","text":"'See also: 1998 in South African sport, 1999 in South Africa, 2000 in South African sport and the Timeline of South African sport. \\\\---- Football (Rugby Union) * 19 June - South Africa (Springboks) beats Italy 101-0 Football (Soccer) * 10 April - South Africa's national soccer team, Bafana Bafana loses 1 - 0 against Gabon at the Odi stadium in an African Nations Cup qualifier game * 5 June - Bafana Bafana beats Mauritius 2-0 in a home game * 27 November - Bafana Bafana beats Sweden 1-0 in the Nelson Mandela Challenge held in Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria South Africa ","title":"1999 in South African sport"},{"id":"6882629","text":"The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz flux equation (or GHK flux equation or GHK current density equation) describes the ionic flux across a cell membrane as a function of the transmembrane potential and the concentrations of the ion inside and outside of the cell. Since both the voltage and the concentration gradients influence the movement of ions, this process is a simplified version of electrodiffusion. Electrodiffusion is most accurately defined by the Nernst–Planck equation and the GHK flux equation is a solution to the Nernst–Planck equation with the assumptions listed below. Origin The American David E. Goldman of Columbia University, and the English Nobel laureates Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Bernard Katz derived this equation. Assumptions Several assumptions are made in deriving the GHK flux equation (Hille 2001, p. 445) : *The membrane is a homogeneous substance *The electrical field is constant so that the transmembrane potential varies linearly across the membrane *The ions access the membrane instantaneously from the intra- and extracellular solutions *The permeant ions do not interact *The movement of ions is affected by both concentration and voltage differences Equation The GHK flux equation for an ion S (Hille 2001, p. 445): :\\\\Phi_{S} = P_{S}z_{S}^2\\\\frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}\\\\frac{[\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}\\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)}{1 - \\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)} where *\\\\PhiS is the current density (flux) across the membrane carried by ion S, measured in amperes per square meter (A·m−2) *PS is the permeability of the membrane for ion S measured in m·s−1 *zS is the valence of ion S *Vm is the transmembrane potential in volts *F is the Faraday constant, equal to 96,485 C·mol−1 or J·V−1·mol−1 *R is the gas constant, equal to 8.314 J·K−1·mol−1 *T is the absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (= degrees Celsius + 273.15) *[S]i is the intracellular concentration of ion S, measured in mol·m−3 or mmol·l−1 *[S]o is the extracellular concentration of ion S, measured in mol·m−3  Implicit definition of reversal potential  The reversal potential is shown to be contained in the GHK flux equation (Flax 2008). The proof is replicated from the reference (Flax 2008) here. We wish to show that when the flux is zero, the transmembrane potential is not zero. Formally it is written \\\\lim_{\\\\Phi_{S}\\\\rightarrow0} V_{m} e0 which is equivalent to writing \\\\lim_{V_{m}\\\\rightarrow0} \\\\Phi_{S} e0, which states that when the transmembrane potential is zero, the flux is not zero. However, due to the form of the GHK flux equation when V_{m}=0, \\\\Phi_{S}=\\\\frac{0}{0}. This is a problem as the value of \\\\frac{0}{0} is indeterminate. We turn to l'Hôpital's rule to find the solution for the limit: :\\\\lim_{V_{m}\\\\rightarrow0} \\\\Phi_{S} = P_{S}\\\\frac{z_{S}^2F^{2}}{RT}\\\\frac{[V_{m}([\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}\\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT))]'}{[1 - \\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)]'} where [f]' represents the differential of f and the result is : :\\\\lim_{V_{m}\\\\rightarrow0} \\\\Phi_{S} = P_{S}z_{S}F([\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}) It is evident from the previous equation that when V_{m}=0, \\\\Phi_{S} e0 if ([\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}) e0 and thus :\\\\lim_{\\\\Phi_{S}\\\\rightarrow0}V_{m} e0 which is the definition of the reversal potential. By setting \\\\Phi_{S}=0 we can also obtain the reversal potential : :\\\\Phi_{S}=0=P_{S}\\\\frac{z_{S}^2F^{2}}{RT}\\\\frac{V_{m}([\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}\\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT))}{1 - \\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)} which reduces to : :[\\\\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}\\\\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)=0 and produces the Nernst equation : :V_{m}=-\\\\frac{RT}{z_{S}F}\\\\ln\\\\left (\\\\frac{[\\\\mbox{S}]_{i}}{[\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}}\\\\right ) Rectification Since one of the assumptions of the GHK flux equation is that the ions move independently of each other, the total flow of ions across the membrane is simply equal to the sum of two oppositely directed fluxes. Each flux approaches an asymptotic value as the membrane potential diverges from zero. These asymptotes are :\\\\Phi_{Si\\\\to o} = P_{S}z_{S}^2 \\\\frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}[\\\\mbox{S}]_{i}\\\\ \\\\mbox{for}\\\\ V_{m} \\\\gg \\\\; 0 and :\\\\Phi_{So\\\\to i} = P_{S}z_{S}^2 \\\\frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}[\\\\mbox{S}]_{o}\\\\ \\\\mbox{for}\\\\ V_{m} \\\\ll \\\\; 0 where subscripts 'i' and 'o' denote the intra- and extracellular compartments, respectively. Keeping all terms except Vm constant, the equation yields a straight line when plotting \\\\PhiS against Vm. It is evident that the ratio between the two asymptotes is merely the ratio between the two concentrations of S, [S]i and [S]o. Thus, if the two concentrations are identical, the slope will be identical (and constant) throughout the voltage range (corresponding to Ohm's law scaled by the surface area). As the ratio between the two concentrations increases, so does the difference between the two slopes, meaning that the current is larger in one direction than the other, given an equal driving force of opposite signs. This is contrary to the result obtained if using Ohm's law scaled by the surface area, and the effect is called rectification. The GHK flux equation is mostly used by electrophysiologists when the ratio between [S]i and [S]o is large and/or when one or both of the concentrations change considerably during an action potential. The most common example is probably intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, which during a cardiac action potential cycle can change 100-fold or more, and the ratio between [Ca2+]o and [Ca2+]i can reach 20,000 or more.

The diocese covers the counties of East and West Sussex. The see is based in the City of Chichester where the bishop's seat is located at the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity. On 3 May 2012 the appointment was announced of Martin Warner, Bishop of Whitby, as the next Bishop of Chichester. His enthronement took place on 25 November 2012 in Chichester Cathedral. The bishop's residence is The Palace, Chichester. Since 2015, Warner has also fulfilled the diocesan-wide role of alternative episcopal oversight, following the decision by Mark Sowerby, then Bishop of Horsham, to recognise the orders of priests and bishops who are women. Between 1984 and 2013, the Bishop of Chichester, in addition to being the diocesan bishop, also had specific oversight of the Chichester Episcopal Area (the then Archdeaconry of Chichester), which covered the coastal region of West Sussex along with Brighton and Hove. Earliest history at Selsey The episcopal see at Selsey was founded by Saint Wilfrid, formerly Bishop of the Northumbrians, for the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Sussex in the late 7th century. He was granted land by Æthelwealh of Sussex to build a cathedral at Selsey. However, shortly afterwards Cædwalla of Wessex conquered the Kingdom of Sussex, but he confirmed the grant to Wilfrid. The bishop's seat was located at Selsey Abbey. Nine years after the Norman conquest, in 1075, the Council of London enacted that episcopal sees should be removed to cities or larger towns. Accordingly, the see at Selsey was removed to Chichester. Some sources claim that Stigand, the last Bishop of Selsey, continued to use the title Bishop of Selsey until 1082, before adopting the new title Bishop of Chichester, indicating that the transfer took several years to complete.Dallaway.

Winona is said to have leaped to her death from this high precipice rather than marry a suitor she did not love. This theme is found in a number of apocryphal, post-contact tales in the place-name lore of North America. The legend Photo of the statue in Central Park, Winona, MN, here seen on the cover of a promotional cookbook. There are several variations of the story. Winona's father is sometimes said to be Chief Wabasha (Wapasha) of a village identified as Keoxa, now known as Winona, Minnesota, or perhaps Chief Red Wing of what is now Red Wing, Minnesota. Rather than marry a suitor she does not love, Winona chooses to leap from the cliff of Maiden Rock to her death. The story is very similar to the apocryphal legend of a young Cherokee woman of Noccalula Falls Park in Gadsden, Alabama, as well as events in James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans. The identity of the suitor depends on the version of the tale. Some versions feature him as a French trapper; others say he is a Native American of another tribe. In Last of the Mohicans the man is a brutal murderer, and the young woman chooses death over life as a slave or battered woman. In the traditional Dakota language, \\"Winona\\" is not a personal name, but a general term for a first-born child of any class distinction who happens to be female. The concept of the central figure as a \\"princess\\" (and in some lore called, \\"Princess Winona\\") is in keeping with a European-American stereotype about Native American \\"princesses.\\" However, the Sioux do not have an equivalent title for \\"princess\\" in any of the major dialects, and Native American cultures do not see their leaders as royalty. Today \\"Winona\\" has become regularly used as a personal and place name throughout the United States. The location Maiden Rock at Lake Pepin. One of many bluffs said to be the precipice from which Winona jumped. Winona, Minnesota is associated with the legend because it was formerly the site of Keoxa. The character of Winona has entered popular regional culture. The name has been featured in Watkins Incorporated advertising, a prominent statue (currently located by Huff St. between 5th and 6th Streets after being located in other city parks), a stained glass window, and elsewhere. While the Upper Mississippi version of the legend is the most prominent, there are other sites with variations of this legend. Mark Twain in Life on the Mississippi wrote: \\"There are fifty Lover's Leaps along the Mississippi from whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped.\\" Other locations with a similar legend include Winona Falls in Pennsylvania, Camden County, Missouri and Cameron Park in Waco, Texas. The Wenonah Fountain is located in downtown Winona, Minnesota at Windom Park, named after the Politician William Windom, and was donated by William J. Landon in memory of his wife Ida Cone Landon in 1900.

The film stars Priyanshu Chatterjee, Sandali Sinha, Himanshu Malik and Raqesh Vashisth in leading roles. The music is composed by Nikhil-Vinay, with lyrics penned by Faaiz Anwar. The background score is composed by Babloo Chakravarty. A sequel of the film, Tum Bin 2 (2016) stars Taran (Neha Sharma), Amar (Aashim Gulati) and Shekhar (Aditya Seal). The film follows the life of Taran who loses her fiance Amar in a skiing accident. The film was remade in Telugu as Ela Cheppanu (2003) starring Tarun and Shriya Saran. Plot  After Amar Shah's accidental death in India, Canada-based Shah Industries is on the verge of collapse. Pia, Amar's fiancée, is devastated, Girdhari, his dad, is in shock and unresponsive towards others while Amar's sister and grandmother are in mourning. Inspector D'Mello who is investigating the case is determined to find the person responsible for the accident despite his superiors' indifference towards the case. Months after Amar's death, a highly respected and talented business worker named Shekhar Malhotra offers to re-build and restore Shah Industries without any compensation, stating Amar met him in India and offered him a job before his death. He is given the chance and goes about the uphill task of making the company viable again. Gradually, Shekhar heals the gaping wound left in the Shah family by Amar's death and they come to accept him as one of the family while he falls in love with Pia. What they don't know — except for Bosco, Shekhar's friend in Canada — is that it was Shekhar's jeep that accidentally had hit Amar after he swerved to avoid hitting an innocent girl who had walked into the road, causing his death. Ridden by guilt Shekhar came to Canada to confess, ask for forgiveness, and do whatever he can for the family. Abhigyan is a wealthy Canadian industrialist who meets Pia and realizes that she is the right woman for him. He is considering proposing to Pia and helping to rebuild Shah Industries. But Pia has fallen in love with Shekhar. Eventually, a conflict arises between Pia and Shekhar regarding a proposition made by Abhi to take over Shah Industries. Shekhar realizes that Pia does not need his help anymore and decides to return to India. Pia stops Shekhar while he boards his flight and confesses her feelings for him. Shekhar denies his feelings and boards the plane. Devastated, Pia goes home and gets engaged to Abhi. At the airport arrives Inspector D'Mello (Manoj Pahwa), from India in search of the person who killed Amar, and arrests Shekhar. They wait, with Bosco, to board the next flight to India. Shekhar calls Pia and tells her how much he loves her and confesses that it was he who hit her fiancé. Being drunk, Shekhar meets with an accident. Pia feels guilty about falling for the man who caused Amar's death and confesses it to Girdhari, who surprises her by speaking for the first time after his son's death. He tells her that Shekhar had told him the truth when he first visited them and he believes Shekhar. Amar's family then makes Pia realize how much Shekhar has done for the family and that he is like Amar to them. Bosco informs them about Shekhar's accident. Abhi tells a skeptical Pia to go back to Shekhar as he is her true love. Meanwhile, D'Mello who is in the hospital with everyone, understands that the family needs Shekhar more than the law does and simply closes the case and leave. The movie ends with Shekhar recovering and uniting with Pia while Abhi is left devastated and is comforted by his uncle.

Early years Niels Anton Christensen was born on a farm in Tørring-Uldum Municipality, Denmark. He showed an early aptitude for mechanics and apprenticed to a machinist in Vejle, Denmark. After completing his apprenticeship, he entered the Technical Institute of Copenhagen, now the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science. In 1891, Christensen immigrated to the United States when he was 26 years old.No. 555:O-Ring (John H. Lienhard, University of Houston) The invention Christensen became a leading draftsman at Fraser and Chalmers in Chicago, a manufacturer of machinery for industry, mining, and transportation. While working in Chicago, he witnessed an accident of a new electric railway, which resulted in two deaths and a number of injuries because the conductor was unable to stop the rail cars in time using the mechanical brake. Christensen decided to design and build a power brake. The Christensen air brake was successfully tested on Detroit's streetcar system, but a downturn of the economy prevented Christensen from manufacturing and marketing the system. He worked briefly on electrical systems for Chicago’s Columbian Exposition and then was hired by the E. P. Allis Company of Milwaukee. While at E. P. Allis, he continued to develop his air brake for electric rail cars and streetcars. In 1896 he obtained financial backing that allowed him to make an experimental test apparatus. He also secured patents on the new valve mechanism. In early 1897, he founded Christensen Engineering Company, which initially operated in the Menomonee Valley at 718 Hanover. His operations were co-located with the Seamless Structural Company at the corner of Hanover and Burnham Streets. In December 1906, Westinghouse sued for patent infringement. George Westinghouse, had developed an air braking system for steam locomotives and he didn’t take lightly what he considered an illegal use of his patent rights. Westinghouse Air Brake Company acquired National Electric, renamed the company the National Brake & Electric Company, which refused to pay royalties to Niels Christensen. Christensen promptly countersued, starting a 24-year legal battle that went before the US Supreme Court on three separate occasions over the rights to manufacture compressed air brake systems for streetcars. In 1933, working in his basement, Christensen discovered by trial and error that a ring-shaped piece of rubber in a groove one and a half times long as the minor radius of the ring made a reliable, tight seal of a piston sliding in a cylinder. He applied for a U.S. patent in 1937 and it was granted two years later.O-Rings: A Public Radio Commentary by Bill Hammack (William S. Hammack Enterprises) After Pearl Harbor, the United States government bought the rights to many war-related patents, and made them available to manufacturers royalty-free. Christensen was paid $75,000. When the war ended (formally in 1952) and the patent rights were transferred back to him, the patent had only four years left. Litigation resulted in a $100,000 payment to his heirs in 1971, 19 years after his death.O-Ring History (Ge Mao Rubber Industrial Co., Ltd.)

He was descended from a Scottish family of masons and architects, and was the second son of Robert Mylne (1733–1811), surveyor to the New River Company, and builder of the first Blackfriars Bridge in London. Initially, William's elder brother Robert was intended to take over his father's business, but when Robert opted for a military career, William began to assist his father, surveying land for the Eau Brink Cut, on the River Great Ouse, in 1797.Colvin, pp.686-687 He also undertook work on the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal. In 1804 he was employed by the New River Company as assistant to his father, and upon his father's retirement in November 1810,Ward, p.197 he became chief engineer of the Company, a post he held until 1861. From 1819 Mylne was engaged in laying out residential streets on the New River Company's property at Clerkenwell, including Myddelton Square, Amwell Street, Inglebert Street, and River Street. Mylne later designed the gothic St Mark's Church, Myddelton Square (1826–1828), and Clerkenwell Parochial Charity Schools (1828). Mylne designed several bridges, including the iron Garret Hostel Bridge in Cambridge (1835–1837, demolished 1960), and repairs to the Caversham Bridge in Reading (1815). He also entered the 1827 competition to design Clifton Bridge in Bristol. Other architectural works include a card room at Stationers' Hall, London, Harpole Rectory in Northamptonshire (1826), and his own home, Flint House, Great Amwell (1842–1844). Mylne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1826. He was a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers from 1811, serving as treasurer from 1822 until his death, and as president in 1842 and 1859.Watson, p.59 He joined the Institute of British Architects on its foundation in 1834, and the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1842. He gave evidence to Edwin Chadwick's Health of Towns reports of 1844-1845. He died in Great Amwell. He had married Mary Smith, the daughter of George Coxhead and had three sons and three daughters. One son, Robert William Mylne, FRS (1817–1890) also became an architect and geologist.

Biography He was born in Nazi-occupied Bagnères-de-Luchon, France, to a Jewish family. In April 1944, shortly before his second birthday, he escaped with his family to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the Portuguese ship Serpa Pinto.Alexis Kanner Arrival in Montreal at the age of two years in the Canadian Jewish Congress - Photo Gallery Kanner attended the Montreal Children's Theatre under the tutelage of Dorothy Davis and Violet Walters. Kanner made his first impression as an actor in the role of Alex, among a French Canadian cast, in the television drama series Beau Temps, Mauvais Temps (1955–1958). He moved to England in the late 50s to join the Birmingham Repertory Theatre to further his acting career. This led to the Royal Court and the Royal Shakespeare Company where he played in The Tempest in 1961 and the lead role in Hamlet under the direction of Peter Brook in 1965. His earliest UK television appearance appears to have been as Peter in the Sunday Night Theatre play Echo From Afar in 1959. He appeared as Stephen in the film Reach for Glory (1962) about the brutal war games of evacuated teenage boys during the Second World War. This led to him first meeting the film's assistant director David Tomblin, who would a few years later be the producer of The Prisoner series. He had a small role in the comedy film We Joined the Navy (1962) playing Gerrett. The only real notable thing about the film was the number of future British small screen comedy stalwarts who were acting in either similar small roles or uncredited cameos. Other plays in which he performed were: * ITV Play of the Week: Birds in the Wilderness as Peter (1962) and The Facing Chair (1963) as Clem Goodwin * Television Playhouse: The Interview as The Young Man (1962) and Along Came A Spider as Brian (1963) * Drama '63: The Freewheelers as Jeremy (1963) * Armchair Theatre: Living Image (1963) as John Manders playing a son who wonders if he can love his father even though he violently disapproves of everything he stands for He appeared on British television in an episode of The Saint, \\"The Ever Loving Spouse\\" (1964) as Alec Misner and in the first of three episodes in ATV's Love Story, A Future Holiday as Frank Watkins. His other appearances in that series were in the following year in Briefly Kiss The Loser as Big Silver Gardner and in 1967 as Colin Turner in Cinéma Vérité. He appeared as Detective Constable Matt Stone in 9 episodes of Softly, Softly (BBC, 1966), a spin-off series from Z-Cars. He claimed in interviews later that he left not wanting to be typecast. Only one complete Softly, Softly episode featuring Kanner survives in the BBC archives, 'A-Z' (broadcast 30 March 1966), and another partially. His film career continued with an appearance in The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965) as part of a Mohocks gang. In 1967 he went back to Montreal to star as the lead character Ernie Turner in the film The Ernie Game which was written and directed by Don Owen for the National Film Board of Canada. The Prisoner Kanner's performances in the 1967–1968 British television series The Prisoner brought lasting recognition for his acting. When he was first enrolled, Patrick McGoohan, the star and co-creator of the series, was planning the final four episodes. There was some opposition to the choice, but McGoohan was looking to cast the rebellious and maverick qualities that Kanner displayed. His first guest-star role was in the mock Wild West episode \\"Living in Harmony\\", in which he portrayed the \\"Kid\\" (the alter-ego of Number Eight), a violent mute dressed in circus pants and a top hat, who is eventually shot in a duel by McGoohan's character, Number Six. McGoohan was impressed by his acting skills and perfectionism (to prepare the duel scene, both actors practised quick-draw assiduously). As a result, McGoohan wrote for Kanner the role of Number Forty-eight, who is made to stand trial as the representative of rebellious youth in \\"Fall Out\\", the final episode of the series. Additionally, Kanner gave an uncredited performance as the photographer in the comic-book episode \\"The Girl Who Was Death\\", in which he performed a number of stunts on a roller coaster. Later career In 1969 he starred as Graham Baird in the little-known short feature film Twenty Nine, a story of a promiscuous young husband's night out in swinging London. It was only 26 minutes long and co-starred Yootha Joyce. This was shown as the B film in Britain with the feature film If..... The band Tuesday's Children, who had a cameo role in a nightclub scene, released the song \\"She\\" that they played in it as a single soon afterwards. He starred in a number of feature films soon after, including Crossplot (1969) with Roger Moore, Connecting Rooms (1970) with Bette Davis and Michael Redgrave, and Goodbye Gemini (also 1970). He is wrongly credited with appearing in Invasion:UFO in 1972, a compilation film made up of the episodes from the TV series UFO made in 1970. He had appeared in an episode called The Cat with Ten Lives but no footage of this was used in the feature film. He moved back to Canada and his next film was Mahoney's Last Stand (released in the US as Mahoney's Estate, 1972) with Sam Waterston and Maud Adams, which he also co-wrote and co-directed. The original motion picture soundtrack of the same name was recorded by Ronnie Lane (who was a friend of Kanner) and Ron Wood, then of The Faces. Other famous names who worked on the album included Pete Townshend and Kenney Jones. He worked again with Patrick McGoohan on the Canadian hostage drama film Kings and Desperate Men, in which he starred as well as writing, producing and directing. He apparently spent two years editing the film which, although filmed in December 1977, did not premiere until the 1981 Montreal World Film Festival. During the late 80s Kanner sued the producers of the film Die Hard claiming that they stole the idea for that movie from this film (he lost). His final known acting role was in Nightfall (released in 1988), a science-fiction film based on the Isaac Asimov story of the same name. He settled back in London in 1996 and was working on a new film project called J R Profitt that never came to fruition. Death He died of a heart attack at his London home on 13 December 2003. He had requested that his body be flown to and buried in Jerusalem at the Mount of Olives, in Israel. https://www.match-cut.de/spdln/spdln107.htm Filmography * Reach for Glory (1962) * We Joined the Navy (1962) * The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965) * The Ernie Game (1967) * Crossplot (1969) * Connecting Rooms (1970) * Goodbye Gemini (1970) * Mahoney's Last Stand (1972) * Kings and Desperate Men (Shot in 1977, released in 1981) * Nightfall (1988) References  External links  * * Alexis Kanner Obituary in The Stage Category:1942 births Category:2003 deaths Category:English male stage actors Category:English male television actors Category:English male film actors Category:Jewish English male actors Category:Royal Shakespeare Company members ","title":"Alexis Kanner"},{"id":"6882779","text":"Harcourt Garden after South Island Line construction works in 2018 Granite Blocks Harcourt Garden before the construction work (2006) Queensway.

As described by Verne, Sword was a \\"submersible boat of only twelve tons\\", carrying a crew of four and commanded by a lieutenant. Her screw was worked by a couple of dynamos fitted with accumulators that needed to be charged in port, and which enabled her to cruise for only one or two days. She was divided into three watertight compartments. The aft one contained the accumulators and machinery. The middle, occupied by the pilot, was surmounted by a periscope fitted with lenticular portholes through which an electric search-lamp lighted the way through the water. The forward compartment was used for passengers. In the 1890s, Sword was in the Port of St. George at the Bahamas when authorities found the pirate Ker Karraje had established himself in a cavern, accessible only by submarine, on the desolate neighboring island of Back Cup. Karraje had with him the French inventor, Thomas Roch, who agreed to give a powerful new explosive to the pirate. The news had arrived through a message placed in a keg by the engineer, Simon Hart, held captive in the pirate stronghold. Sword, under Lt Devon, was sent to penetrate the stronghold and take Roch and Hart aboard. This Devon and his men did, but before they could get away they were discovered by the bigger pirate submarine and sunk. The British crew perished while Roch and Hart were recovered by pirate divers, to take part in the cataclysmic end of the story. Verne conceived submarine fighting as mainly ramming. The book was written when Verne was well-disposed towards the British (his attitude fluctuated). Lt Devon is a noble and heroic officer, the equal of naval heroes in books by British writers. The Royal Navy did, in 1943, give the name \\"Sword\\" to a surface ship being laid out at Newport News, Virginia, to be delivered to Britain as part of lend-lease. However, before it was completed the deal was off and the ship was delivered to the United States Navy, commissioned in 1944 as USS Rushmore. She had a long and distinguished career.

It has been listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The name is derived from maes, meaning field or plain in Brythonic Welsh, and burh, meaning fort in Old English. There is also a record of the name Merksburi in 705 AD, meaning boundary fort. The area was a boundary between the Romano- British Celts and West Saxons during the period 577-652 AD, when the nearby Wansdyke fortification comprised part of the border. The enclosure has an area of , and lies at a height of 292 m (950 ft), with views in many directions. This includes the Somerset Levels to Glastonbury Tor and Brent Knoll which are the closest and probably the most easily identifiable landmarks from the site. The fort has a single rampart up to 6 m high, with an outer ditch (univallate). Entrances are to the south-east and north-east (with possible outworks). The Fort and surrounding grounds are now owned by the Stevens' Family who have been farming in Somerset for over 60 years.  Background  Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction.\\" The site rises to above sea level and enables a view over the surrounding valleys and hills. The hill has not eroded as fast as the surrounding limestone as it is made of Old Red Sandstone deposited in the Devonian period approximately 400 million years ago.

This type of fortification was common during the English Civil War, and the remains of one such structure can be seen on Fort Royal Hill in Worcester, England.Fort Royal, Worcester During the Eighty Years' War for Dutch independence, the sconces (schans in Dutch) were often used to defend strategic places, but were used also during sieges and in circumvallations. Several more or less intact sconces remain in the Netherlands. The Zaanse Schans, one of the top tourist locations in the Netherlands, derived its name from its original function as a sconce. Sconces played a major part in the Serbian Revolution, countering the numerical superiority of the Turkish army. Etymology The etymology of sconce is from the Latin absconsus, via the French esconce: a word of many meanings, mostly signifying a covering or protection, or, by extension, that which is covered or protected.

The rock is estimated to have formed some 350 million years ago during the early Carboniferous period. It is the remains of a volcanic pipe which cut through the surrounding sedimentary rock, before cooling to form very hard dolerite, a coarser-grained equivalent of basalt. Subsequent glacial erosion was resisted more by the dolerite, which protected the softer rock to the east, leaving a crag and tail formation. The summit of the castle rock is above sea level, with rocky cliffs to the south, west and north, rearing up to from the surrounding landscape. This means that the only readily accessible route to the castle lies to the east, where the ridge slopes more gently. The defensive advantage of such a site is clear, but the geology of the rock also presents difficulties, since basalt is an extremely poor aquifer. Providing water to the Upper Ward of the castle was problematic, and despite the sinking of a deep well, the water supply often ran out during drought or siege, for example during the Lang Siege of 1573.

The park contains a basketball court, a hard surface football ground, sitting out areas, a public toilet, and a child care centre. Access is available from Eastern Street and Hospital Road. Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is located near the park. History There are two King George V Memorial Parks in Hong Kong. One is on the Hong Kong Island while the other is located in Jordan, Kowloon. In 1936, following the death of King George V, parks were planned for both the city of Victoria on Hong Kong Island, in the garden of and the site of one of the wings of the Civil Hospital, and one on Canton Road in Kowloon, both to be paid for by public subscription.The Hong Kong Telegraph, October 7, 1936, p. 4 In June 1941, the Memorial Park in Kowloon, King George V Memorial Park, Kowloon, was opened; it is located beside Canton Road.The Hong Kong Daily Press, June 12, 1941, p. 12 Administrator Norman Lockhart Smith hosted the ceremony for this park. It had a statue of King George V in the centre of the park. During the Japanese occupation, facilities were destroyed. Three Chinese styled kiosks were built after World War II. In 1941, King George V Memorial Park, originally planned as King George's Field, adjacent the old Civil Hospital in Hong Kong, had yet to be built. West Island Line construction Site of the station according to the current proposal: under a football field In March 2004, the MTR changed the planned location of the Sai Ying Pun station east and south of the initial alignment to an area deep under King George V Memorial Park. A source from MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) revealed to the local newspaper Ming Pao that this location was chosen to avoid any nuisance during works under major roads. The location would also better serve Mid-Levels residents, the MTR said.http://hk.news.yahoo.com/050630/12/1e2fh.html Part of the park was closed temporarily to the public for the duration of construction.

CIHI provides comparable and actionable data and information that are used to accelerate improvements in health care, health system performance and population health across Canada. Historical overview CIHI was incorporated under the Canada Corporations Act in 1994. Federal, provincial, and territorial governments created CIHI as a \\"not-for-profit, independent organization dedicated to forging a common approach to Canadian health information\\".About the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Statistics Canada. (2011, October 25). About the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). CIHI has a unique mandate to make health information \\"publicly available\\" to Canadians. The CICI is governed by a 16-member Board of Directors that links federal, provincial and territorial governments with non-governmental health groups. Board members represent all health sectors and regions of Canada. The membership of the Board is dominated by Deputy Ministers of Health, although it does add a small number of academics to its associates. CIHI has offices in: Toronto and Ottawa as well as branches in Montreal, and Victoria. The Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (Romanow Report) tabled a final report to the House of Commons on 28 November 2002 that recommended that a Health Council of Canada should be established by the provincial, territorial and federal governments to facilitate co-operation and provide national leadership in achieving the superior health outcomes. The Health Council would be built on the existing infrastructure of the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, which was formerly known as the Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment (CCOHTA). The following year, in November 2003, the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, released a report (the Senator \\"Kirby\\" report) that emphasized the need for \\"cooperation among all stakeholders to reduce problems of distribution, undersupply, and jurisdictional competition\\" within the Canadian healthcare system. The report also recommend the federal government to \\"work with other concerned parties to create a permanent national coordinating body for HHR [health human resources], to be composed of representatives from key stakeholder groups and the different levels of government\\". CIHI co-authored a report to this standing senate committee with Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) entitled Charting the Course – A Pan-Canadian Consultation on Population and Public Health Priorities, May 2002. An outcome of the final senate report was CIHI's creation of the #Health Personnel Database with funding by #Health Canada. Mandate A medical record folder being pulled from the cabinet CIHI's core mandate is to deliver comparable and actionable information to accelerate improvements in health care, health system performance and population health across the continuum of care. Stakeholders use the broad range of health system databases, measurements and standards, together with evidence-based reports and analyses, in their decision-making processes. CIHI protects the privacy of Canadians by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the health care information. CIHI produces various reports to support policy makers and health systems research. CIHI's partners CIHI works with a broad range of health organizations and partners across the country, providing data and information to help them fulfill their mandates. Partners include * Ministries of health — They contribute to CIHI's work and help achieve the mandate * Statistics Canada and Health Canada — Both provide data that complement CIHI's work The partnerships help CIHI avoid duplication of effort and cost, while ensuring value for Canadians. They also ensure that the policies and decisions that influence health in this country are based on accurate, comparable and unbiased information. Data sharing agreements CIHI tracks data in the different provinces with the help of information that is provided by hospitals, regional health authorities, medical practitioners and government bodies. This information is used by these various bodies to assess the various facets of our health care system and use it as a planning tool. There are several different submission applications available, some being system specific. Most clients use the application called eDSS (Electronic Data Submission Service) to provide a secure and timely method for sending data files to CIHI and receiving data files from CIHI over the Internet. eDSS requires a registered client access codes that provides a user the ability to submit data to CIHI. Other applications include the Canadian MIS Database Submission reports provide feedback to those providing the data, ensuring that the data provided meets the technical requirements of the MIS standards, these are private reports that can only be viewed by a selected representative. The CJRR web based data submission tool allows those included in the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry to enter and submit data and produce various reports over the internet in real time. The Home Care Reporting System (HCRS) submission report provides those authorized with secure and timely access to reports generated by through from the data that is provided by HCRS. The e-Management Reports tool allows clients to see a web-based snapshot of all of their data submissions to six of CIHI's data holdings. Users can also access summaries of their submissions, statistics on error rates and timeliness. Data requests Researchers, decision-makers and health managers can request specific data from one or more of CIHI's databases. Data can be retrieved at an aggregate or record level. CIHI responds to data requests on a cost-recovery basis, which costs $160 an hour for Canadian health care facilities, media (data requests only), governments, not-for-profit health agencies, universities (except for students through the Graduate Student Data Access Program), health professionals and researchers from the public sector (Price A clients), OR $320 an hour for private commercial operations (including but not limited to software vendors and consultants), foreign clients (Price B clients) and others not qualifying for Price A. Graduate Student Data Access Program CIHI has set up a Graduate Student Data Access Program (GSDAP) that provides qualifying graduate students with access to CIHI's data at no cost whatsoever. Graduate students may only use this program in order to fulfill academic requirements of their program. The objective of the GSDAP is to: *To build the capacity of graduate students to undertake health service research; *To increase awareness of CIHI and CIHI's data holdings, and the importance of data quality and privacy, as graduate students pursue health service careers. Students must be conducting research and can access data through the various databases that fall under the following subject headings, health services, health spending and health human resources. Their research must fall in line with CIHI's mandate \\"to provide accurate and timely information that is required for sound health policy, effective management of the health care system and public awareness of health determinants.\\" Databases CIHI manages a number of Canadian health databases. These include: The Health Personnel Database * National Physician Database (NPDB) * Registered Nurses Database (RNDB) * Pharmacist Database (PDB) * Occupational Therapist Database (OTDB) * Medical Radiation Technologist Database (MRTDB) * Medical Laboratory Technologist Database (MLTDB) * Physiotherapist Database (PTDB) * Scott's Medical Database (SMD) CIHI health spending databases * Canadian Management Information System Database (CMDB) * National Health Expenditure Database (NHEX) Health services information * Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) * National Rehabilitation Reporting System (NRS) * National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System (NPDUIS) * Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Health Database (Canadian Segment) * National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) * Canadian Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR) * National Trauma Registry (NTR) * Therapeutic Abortions Database (TADB) * Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) * Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB) * National Health Expenditure Database (NHEX) * Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR) * Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS) * Hospital Mental Health Database (HMHDB) * Canadian Management Information System Database (CMDB) * Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Monitoring System (CMSMS) Each CIHI database record is accompanied by Data Quality Documentation that considers coverage, collection and response, and general data limitations. This documentation is informed by the CIHI Data Quality Framework, which outlines a data quality work cycle, dimensions of data quality (Accuracy, Timliness, Comparability, Usability, Relevance), and guidelines for data quality assessment reports. Each database is also subject to a Privacy Impact Assessment. Provincial database management CIHI also plays a role in provincial database management. Although the Ontario Case Costing Initiative (OCCI) is a Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) database, it depends on \\"methodology... based on the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) MIS Guidelines\\". CIHI also manages the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS), an Ontario exclusive database. Under the OMHRS, \\"hospitals collect and submit information to CIHI. CIHI collects and processes MDS-MH data and provides… outcome measures and quality indicators reports to the hospitals\\". This provincial reporting system is \\"scalable [and] designed for pan-Canadian usage and expansion… to other Canadian jurisdictions\\". Vendor licensing CIHI furthermore provides vendor licensing for OMHRS and other databases; \\"vendors providing… data collection software to participating facilities must be licensed with CIHI\\". These databases depend on CIHI's Vendor Licensing Agreement. Vendors must renew their license annually.  Canadian Population Health Initiative (CPHI)  The Canadian Population Health Initiative is a significant component of CIHI's outreach strategy. The CPHI was created and integrated with CIHI in 1999 with funding from Health Canada as part of the Roadmap I project. CPHI's specific focus is expanding the public's knowledge of population health issues by accomplishing two main goals: fostering a better understanding of factors that affect the health of individuals and communities; and contributing to the development of policies which reduce inequities and improve the health and well-being of Canadians. CPHI achieves these goals mainly through funding population health research, gathering and analyzing population health data, and providing the public and policy-makers alike with numerous reports, presentations, and other publications. CPHI reports are released regularly in its main publication Improving the Health of Canadians alongside Health of the Nation, an e-newsletter that was launched in February 2004 in conjunction with the organization's flagship series. In addition to these regular reports, CPHI has also released numerous other publications and products covering a range of topics that have been identified by CPHI as priority issues throughout its history. From 2004 to 2007, CPHI reporting focused mainly on the issues of obesity, place and health, and youth health. Between 2007 and 2010, CPHI's priority themes included mental health, gaps and inequalities in health care services, geographical disparities in health, and promoting healthy weights. Electronic health records In 2003 Canada Health Infoway Inc. and the CIHI signed a Memorandum of Understanding that formalized a partnership to develop and maintain standards required in support of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data definitions and standards in Canada. Infoway led the development of EHR Solution standards and acted as the overall program manager for EHR standards-related work, whereas CIHI's operated as the preferred partner in the development of these standards. CIHI's role also encompassed continued responsibility for data definitions, content standards and classification systems because of CIHI's widely recognized role as leader in the development of health informatics standards and records, and its record of successful collaborations with other health organizations in Canada. This initiative was aimed mainly at improving primary health care (PHC) in Canada, the most commonly experienced type of health care among Canadians. Interoperable EMRs are intended to assist in ensuring that PHC clinicians have timely and relevant information necessary to deliver, coordinate and administer care. Additionally, EMR information generated at the point of service can also be used to support quality improvement initiatives, such as clinical program management, research, and monitoring the health of the population, as well as to improve the efficiency of the health care system overall. CIHI led the project and achieved a major milestone in 2011 with the establishment of the Draft Pan-Canadian Primary Health Care Electronic Medical Record Content Standard. The PHC EMR CS consists of 106 data elements that are commonly found in EMRs, used to support both primary uses of EMR data, such as reminders and alerts for patients with chronic conditions, and health system uses, such as a jurisdictional diabetes management registry. Moving forward, CIHI and its partners' plans include establishing more products and services that facilitate the adoption and implementation of the PHC EMR CS in addition to enacting strategies and plans for the longer-term governance and maintenance of the PHC EMR CS so that it remains clinically and technically relevant in the future. CIHI as a research tool CIHI uses data from governments and hospitals across Canada to determine comparative statistics and costing algorithms that are available for use by healthcare ministries, hospital boards and the general public. According to former CIHI president and CEO Richard Alvarez, CIHI's scope of research and data tracking is wide-ranging and broad. In a 2000 interview, Alvarez said of CIHI : \\"You name it, we track it,\\" including subjects such as physician migration patterns, availability of nurses, supply and demand of organs, and survival rates for transplant patients. For example, in 2000 CIHI determined that the rate of caesarean births in different regions of the country varied from a low of 12% to a high of 28%. This CIHI generated information was then used by hospital boards to measure themselves against the national and international benchmark (15% in 2000). A 2009 study in the journal Chronic Diseases in Canada compared perinatal information in the CIHI's Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) with information found in a range a smaller clinically focused databases. According to findings of the researches, CIHI's DAD data compared favourably with the other databases and proved accurate for many of the diagnoses/procedures examined.Josephs, K., & Fahey, J. (2009). Validation of perinatal data in the discharge abstract database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Chronic Diseases in Canada, 29(3), 96-100. The authors of the report concluded by supporting the use of the data in the CIHI DAD for national perinatal surveillance and research, with a caveat that appropriate inference rest on an understanding of clinical practice and the use of sensitivity analyses to identify robust findings. The CIHI DAD is used to identify patients admitted for hip fracture surgery to any acute care hospital in Canada between 2003 and 2012 in the Canadian Collaborative Study of Hip Fractures. Privacy and security CIHI ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its health information through a comprehensive and integrated privacy and security program. Its Privacy and Security Framework outlines how the organization approaches data governance, and maintains privacy and security protection. CIHI enacts numerous policies and practices to prohibit personal identification, one key policy being strict levels of data suppression. In the past, some news media outlets have raised concerns about the safety of personal health records in large medical/science databases like CIHI. In 2001, a Toronto Star article expressed fears that large health information vendors like CIHI could potentially leak the private health information of Canadians.Hamilton, T. (2001, January 8). Up for sale: Your secret health files. The Toronto Star. The article suggested that the identities of individuals who had abortions and profiles of the mentally ill could potentially be leaked from CIHI's databases if proper security practices were not in place. The article also surmised that the greatest danger to patient and research subject privacy was the possibility of CIHI's health information being compromised through involvement with commercial entities. However, the findings of a three-year review by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) published in a 2008 report allayed some of these concerns and largely supported CIHI's assertion that the organization's security policies, procedures and protocols ensure high standards of privacy protection. According to the report, the \\"IPC is satisfied that CIHI continues to have in place practices and procedures that sufficiently protect the privacy of individuals whose personal health information it receives and that sufficiently maintain the confidentiality of that information,\\" and that as of October 31, 2008, the IPC was satisfied that CIHI met the requirements of the Personal Health Information Protection Act. Since 2005, CIHI has maintained prescribed entity status under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA).Canadian Institute for Health Information. (2012, Jan. 18).

The park is named after Sun Yat Sen, and is the only one in Hong Kong named for a Chinese historic figure. History Residents of Western had long lamented the limited recreation and leisure options in the district. Two recreation projects on the Western reclamation near Sai Ying Pun were approved in the Urban Council Capital Works Programme 1986/87–1990/91: an indoor games hall (now the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park Sports Centre) and the original Western Park. Only part of the site was originally released to the Urban Council since most of the land was required for the construction of the Western Harbour Crossing in the 1990s. Western Park, comprising two hectares, opened in 1991. Construction of the Western Park Sports Centre commenced in May 1992, and the facility opened on 22 May 1995. It was renamed Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park Sports Centre on 1 June 2011. In 1999, the Provisional Urban Council approved the redevelopment of the park into a memorial park for Sun Yat-sen. This opened in 2003, but only as a temporary park and still only occupying part of the waterfront reclamation. The rest of the waterfront lands lay idle and fenced off, under the management of the Lands Department, following completion of the Western Harbour Crossing. The park was criticised for failing to live up to its name, containing little more than a plaque quoting Dr. Sun. Expansion of the park was planned, but delayed due to budgetary constraints. The expansion and redevelopment of the park was among 25 priority projects identified in the 2005 policy address. The park closed on 28 March 2008 for reconstruction. Phase one of the reconstructed park opened to the public on 26 June 2010.

Coyote and the Road Runner * Willoughby * Witch Hazel * Yosemite Sam Rocky and Mugsy Rocky and Mugsy are animated cartoon characters in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. They were created by Friz Freleng. Biography As an animator, Friz Freleng enjoyed creating new adversaries for Warners' star Bugs Bunny, since he felt that Bugs' other nemeses, such as Beaky Buzzard and Elmer Fudd (who actually appeared in many more Freleng shorts than is commonly realized), were too stupid to give the rabbit any real challenge. Considered revolutionary for almost all of the late 1940s though he might have been, Freleng's own Yosemite Sam had not yet been proven capable of fully fulfilling his creator's intentions. Freleng introduced two of these more formidable opponents as a pair of gangsters in the 1946 film Racketeer Rabbit. In the film, Bugs decides to find himself a new home, but the one he chooses is unfortunately occupied by a duo of bank robbers. The characters here are called \\"Rocky\\" (drawn like movie gangster Edward G. Robinson) and \\"Hugo\\" (a caricatured Peter Lorre). Both gangsters are performed by the Warner studio's longtime chief voice actor, Mel Blanc. Appearances Freleng liked the mobster idea, and he used the concept again in the 1950 short Golden Yeggs. This time, it is Porky Pig and Daffy Duck who run afoul of the mob, only this time Rocky has not only one sidekick, but an entire gang. Freleng also redesigned Rocky for this short, making him a more generalized caricature of the \\"tough guy\\" gangster rather than Robinson in particular. Freleng used several of the same techniques that would make Sam, his other Bugs villain, such a humorous character: despite Rocky's tough-guy demeanor, everlasting cigar (or cigarette) and foppish gangster dress, he really is little more than a dwarf in a much-too-large hat. In 1953's Catty Cornered, Freleng set the mob against another of his comic duos, Sylvester and Tweety Bird. Gang leader Rocky, this time aided and abetted by a hulking simpleton named \\"Nick\\", kidnaps Tweety Bird, and when Sylvester's bumbling predations accidentally free the bird, the poor puss is hailed as a hero. The duo reappear in 1954's Bugs and Thugs, this time in the form that Freleng would keep them in for the rest of their run. Rocky is aided by a new thug, \\"Mugsy\\". Although his body type is similar to that of Nick's, he has less hair and is even less intelligent. Before the Warner studio closed for good in January 1965, Rocky and Mugsy would appear in two more Freleng cartoons: Bugsy and Mugsy (1957) and The Unmentionables (1963). Mugsy also appears without his boss in a cameo as one of Napoleon Bonaparte's guards in the 1956 Freleng short Napoleon Bunny-Part and also appeared as a bank robber in Satan's Waitin'. Rocky and Mugsy have also appeared in various Looney Tunes-related merchandise. They are semi-regular characters in Looney Tunes comic books, for example. They also play the villains in the 2002 Xbox video game Loons: The Fight for Fame, a vs. fighting game in which the no-good gangsters attempt to run a film studio into the ground so that they can buy up the stock for next to nothing. Also, in Bugs Bunny Lost in Time, the pair are bosses of the 1930s era. They also appeared in episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries and Duck Dodgers, as well as made cameo appearances in the movie Space Jam. In the movie they are spotted wearing rabbit's ears and are shown shocked and terrified when Bugs gets crushed by a Monstar named Pound who was meant to crush Lola, because he and the other Monstars are violating the game which they should immediately lose. Both of them also appeared as kids in an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures. In Loonatics Unleashed, Stoney and Bugsy (voiced by Joe Alaskey and James Arnold Taylor) were brief descendants of Rocky and Mugsy who adopted Pinkster Pig (who was a descendant of Porky Pig). Rocky and Mugsy recently made cameos in The Looney Tunes Show. In \\"It's a Handbag\\", Rocky and Mugsy's pictures were seen in the police's notebook. They were also seen in the Merrie Melodies segment \\"Stick to My Guns\\", sung by Yosemite Sam in the episode \\"Mrs. Porkbunny's\\" where Yosemite Sam mentions how he declared his vendetta on the Mafia when Sam threw a garbage can into their house. Around the end of the song, Rocky and Mugsy joined in on the final verse with Nasty Canasta, an angry bride, a female cannibal, a grizzly bear, and Toro the Bull. Shorts * Racketeer Rabbit (1946) - Features a prototype of Rocky. * Golden Yeggs (1950) - Rocky's first cartoon, only cartoon paired with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. * Catty Cornered (1953) - Only pairing with Sylvester and Tweety. * Bugs and Thugs (1954) - Mugsy's first cartoon. * Napoleon Bunny-Part (1956) - Mugsy cameos as a guard. * Bugsy and Mugsy (1957) * The Unmentionables (1963) - Final appearance of Rocky and Mugsy. Parodies Rocky and Mugsy are parodied in the South Park characters Nathan and Mimsy in the episode \\"Crippled Summer\\", Nathan having been introduced in the earlier episode Up the Down Steroid. Throughout the episode's storylines, with various campers being parodies of other Looney Tunes characters, Nathan (Rocky) attempts to arrange fatal accidents for Jimmy Valmer (a counterpart to Bugs Bunny) which get ruined by Mimsy (Mugsy)'s stupidity. Nathan and Mimsy become reoccurring characters following their return appearance in the episode \\"Handicar\\". A poster depicting Rocky and Mugsy can be seen on the wall of Nathan's room. Blacque Jacque Shellacque Blacque Jacque Shellacque is a fictional cartoon character in the Looney Tunes cartoons. He was created by Robert McKimson and Tedd Pierce, and first appeared in the 1959 Merrie Melodies short Bonanza Bunny set in the Klondike of 1896. Maurice LaMarche voiced the character from 2011 to 2014 in The Looney Tunes Show. The character was the inspiration for a specific version of five card draw poker mixed with blackjack named \\"Blacque Jacque Shellacque\\" in which the pot is divided between the winning poker hand and the winning blackjack hand. If everyone loses in blackjack, the winning poker hand takes all. Like many of other Bugs Bunny's enemies, Blacque Jacque Shellacque is a male with a foreign accent and a beard, playing into a character trope of evil un-American foreigners with facial hair. While similar in many ways to Yosemite Sam—both are short in stature and temper—Blacque Jacque possesses his own unique characteristics, not the least of which is his comically thick French Canadian accent, performed by Mel Blanc. Also, like Yosemite Sam and many other villains, Blacque Jacque Shellacque does not have a high level of intelligence, preferring to use force instead of strategy to fight Bugs. His usual swear word is Sacrebleu, and he is often portrayed as a thief. Appearances Blacque Jacque first appeared in Bonanza Bunny, which takes place in the middle of the Klondike gold rush. Blacque Jacque attempts to seize Bugs' bag of gold (actually \\"a bunch of old rocks and some yellow paint,\\" according to Bugs) through card cheating, trickery and out-and-out threats, but Bugs outwits him as always and defeats him by replacing his bag of gold with gunpowder while poking a hole in the bag and tossing a lit match on it, causing a massive explosion. Blacque Jacque later clashed with Bugs in 1962's Wet Hare, in which his illegal damming of a river (\\"I feel like pezky little beav-aire!\\") brings him into conflict with the rabbit—not only because he is committing a crime, but because he has blocked off the waterfall that Bugs uses as a shower. After demolishing several of Blacque Jacque's dams, Bugs turns the tables by damming the river upstream of Jacque's dam. Jacque, unsurprisingly, is enraged and wheels a small cannon along the riverbed to destroy Bugs' dam—but when he does he only reveals another dam further upstream. Jacque blows up several of Bugs' dams in succession and finally follows Bugs all the way to the \\"Grand Cooler Dam\\" (a pun on the name of the Grand Coulee Dam). Jacque tries to blow it up with his cannon, but the dam is so massive and thick that the cannonball he launches ricochets back into the cannon's barrel and the recoiling force lands both Jacque and the cannon into the back of a waiting paddy wagon, which then takes him away. Legacy Blacque Jacque is one of the more obscure Looney Tunes characters, but he has his share of fans. Canadian television networks in particular put his shorts in regular rotation (on shows such as The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show), and the cartoons have an unusual number of Canadian references for the time period in which they were made (for example, Bugs claims that he received a call from Jacque's girlfriend, \\"Fifi from Montreal\\"). In the video game Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time, he appears in various levels as an enemy to defeat. During this appearance, he was voiced by Billy West. Although Blacque Jacque did not appear in Looney Tunes: Back in Action, he was featured in the film's video game adaptation, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. He was stealing paintings from the Louvre and being defeated by Bugs Bunny. Blacque Jacque Shellacque appears in The Looney Tunes Show, voiced again by Maurice LaMarche. In this show, Blacque Jacque Shellacque is the cousin of Yosemite Sam. In the episode \\"It's a Handbag,\\" his picture is seen in a police notebook. In \\"Ridiculous Journey,\\" Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hunting Hugo the Abominable Snowman in Alaska when he turns his attention towards Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz and pursues them. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them on a train heading south and starts hunting them. Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz escape him by detaching the cars that are connected to the train. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then finds them in the cars of the Three Bears and tries to grab them until Baby Bear throws him out of their car and off the Golden Gate Bridge. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them in the desert when they end up in the desert and ends up cutting Beaky Buzzard's balloon. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then goes on the attack and manages to catch them. It turns out that Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hired by Bugs Bunny and Granny to rescue them upon the two of them being hooked up by Yosemite Sam. Blacque Jacque Shellacque appears in New Looney Tunes, voiced by Jim Cummings. Baby Looney Tunes Melissa Duck's most notable role is from the series Baby Looney Tunes, which casts the adult characters from the original Looney Tunes theatrical shorts as their infant selves. Melissa had a crush on Daffy Duck ever since she was an infant. However, unlike well-known male characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, female characters were rare in the original shorts; with Melissa Duck, Petunia Pig and the Tasmanian She-Devil only making few appearances each, while Lola Bunny was created for the 1996 movie Space Jam. In Baby Looney Tunes, Melissa, a yellow duckling with darker hair than her adult self, acts as a comedian and enjoys making her friends laugh, even though her humor sometimes gets her into trouble. She is voiced there by Janyse Jaud.  Pete Puma  Pete Puma is a cartoon puma, originally voiced by Stan Freberg. He debuted in the November 15, 1952 short film Rabbit's Kin.  History  Though Pete Puma made only two appearances, in Rabbit's Kin and in Pullet Surprise, he is often vividly remembered by cartoon fans, especially for his bizarre, inhaled, almost choking laugh (based on comedian Frank Fontaine's \\"Crazy Guggenheim\\" and \\"John L.C. Silvoney\\" characters). In Rabbit's Kin, Pete is chasing a young rabbit called 'Shorty' who asks Bugs Bunny for help. Bugs is eager to oblige, and subjects Pete to some of his trademark pranks. Pete Puma's voice was used by Daws Butler for Sam the Cat in the Sylvester cartoons Trick or Tweet in 1959 and Mouse and Garden in 1960.  Later appearances  More recently, he has made occasional appearances on Tiny Toon Adventures (as the Acme Looniversity janitor), episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, co-starred with Foghorn Leghorn in Pullet Surprise (voiced again by Freberg in all of these appearances), made a cameo appearance in the crowd scenes of Space Jam, Carrotblanca (as a waiter), Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas (working as a janitor again), and is a supporting character in the Looney Tunes comic books. Pete appears in The Looney Tunes Show voiced by John Kassir, He is a dimwitted friend of Daffy Duck and does various jobs around town. He appears in Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run voiced by Jess Harnell, He serves as an intern to the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn. Pete Puma appears in New Looney Tunes, voiced again by John Kassir.

It was set up by members of the Swedish band Eggstone and has been running since 1991. The studio is best known for The Cardigans albums, which were almost all recorded there. Besides Eggstone themselves, other bands to have recorded there are Bob hund, Envelopes, Cloudberry Jam, Deivine Dennis, Green and Lady Lynette as well as international artists such as Saint Etienne, Good shoes and Tom Jones.  Lawsuits  Besides being a recording studio Tambourine Studios also handled the economy of several bands and artists, something that resulted in seven lawsuits among the artists and the studio. It started in June 2010 when Timbuktu claimed that 4,9 million Swedish krona had disappeared from his account and been transferred to other artists' companies. Timbuktu sued the active or former companies belonging to the bands The Hives, Europe, The Ark, Weeping Willows and The Soundtrack of Our Lives for 5 million Swedish krona. The Hives responded with counter-suing Timbuktu for 3.2 million Swedish krona. Some of the involved artists stated that funds were missing and claimed that Tambourine Studios borrowed money from some accounts and lent it to others, all without approval of the involved artists. In May 2011 Timbuktu recalled his lawsuit against The Hives after they had paid his company 2 million Swedish krona back. Later a settlement was also reached with The Ark. Soon after The Cardigans sued The Hives for 18 million Swedish krona that they meant were lent to The Hives but never returned. The Hives sued Tambourine Studios for 9 million Swedish krona because they felt that the studio did not perform the services correctly. In May 2012 The Hives also sued their accountancy firm PWC for 177 million Swedish krona reasoning that the lawsuits had inhibited their creativity. In July 2011 The Ark sued The Hives among others for not repaying their debts. 16 April 2013 Lund District Court sentenced The Hives to pay 23.6 million Swedish krona to The Cardigans. In the judgment report the claims about the studio making accounting mistakes were dismissed as false.

He was tortured and beheaded by Japanese forces for refusing to disclose the location of a U.S. service member hiding in Guam. Early life Dueñas was born on March 19, 1911, to his parents of Luis Paulino Dueñas and Josefa Martínez Baza in Hagåtña, Guam, with siblings Pedro, Eduardo, among others. Education Dueñas studied for the priesthood in Manila, and became the second Chamorro Catholic priest when he was ordained in 1938. During the World War II Japanese occupation of Guam, Japanese forces who suspected Dueñas of knowing the whereabouts of a fugitive American serviceman tortured and, on July 12, 1944, killed him. Japanese occupation In December 1941, Japan invaded and occupied Guam. In early 1942, Father Dueñas was appointed temporary head of Guam's Catholic church.Father Jesus Baza Duenas, An Heroic Martyr By Eric Forbes, OFM. Guampedia He sometimes told local people not to cooperate with the Japanese, and his independence and status on Guam worried them. The Japanese kept a close watch on Dueñas and wanted to exile him, but worried that relations with local people would worsen if they did so. Japan decided to send to Guam two more cooperative Catholic priests, Monsignor Dominic Fukahori and Father Petro Komatzu, but Duenas at personal risk often refused to co-operate with them. Friends and associates operated secret radio receivers and kept Dueñas well informed on the progress of the war. Father Dueñas knew much about the movements of the six American servicemen who had escaped capture during the December 10, 1941 Japanese ground invasion, and about those who helped and harbored them. He is also said to have known about the plans of Japanese search teams searching for the fugitives and their helpers. Arrest and beheading The Japanese had long suspected that Dueñas knew a great deal about the only American to escape capture, George Tweed. In July 1944, Dueñas was informed about Japanese plans to arrest him, but refused to escape. He told the men who hoped to assist him that the Japanese would retaliate against their families, reportedly saying, \\"Go look after your families. God will look after me. I have done no wrong.\\"Father Dueñas School: History From the Father Dueñas Memorial School Website, accessed July 26, 2011 When he was captured and interrogated about the whereabouts of Tweed, Dueñas is said to have responded, \\"It is for me to know, and for you to find out.\\" He added that he answered only to God and \\"the Japanese are not God.\\" After torturing him for three days, the Japanese beheaded him and his nephew, Eduardo Camacho Dueñas, on July 12, 1944, at Tai, Mangilao. Legacy and honor In early 1945, the body of Fr. Dueñas was exhumed from a crude grave. When his body was buried at St. Joseph's Church in Inarajan, hundreds of people and the island's highest officials attended the ceremony. The Father Dueñas Memorial School (FDMS) was established in 1948 in his memory. In 1970, Guam officially designated July 12 as \\"Father Dueñas Day.\\" References External links * Father Jesus Baza Duenas, Guampedia. * Father Duenas' Execution Site, From Significant World War II Sites on Guam, by the National Park Service.

It has been dated to 1452, although the style and material of the minarets point to the close of Mahmud Begada's reign (1511) or later. The body of the building was destroyed in 1753 during the war between the Marathas and the Khan of Gujarat Sultanate; only two minarets and the arched central gateway connecting them remain.

Though much damaged, especially near the foot, the stairs inside the minarets may still be used. The minarets are three stories tall with carved balconies. A gentle shaking of either minaret results in the other minaret vibrating after a few seconds, though the connecting passage between them remains free of vibration. The mechanism of this is not known, although the layered construction is thought to be a factor. The phenomenon was first observed in the 19th century by Monier M.

It is purported to generate thrust by reflecting microwaves internally in the device, in violation of the law of conservation of momentum and other laws of physics. The device is also known as an EmDrive and has been often referred to by the media as the Impossible Drive. It was introduced in 2001 by Roger Shawyer. There exists no official design for this device, and neither of the people who claim to have invented it have committed to an explanation for how it could operate as a thruster or what elements define it, making it difficult to tell whether a given object is an example of such a device. However, several prototypes based on its public descriptions have been constructed and tested. In 2016, the Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory at NASA reported observing a small apparent thrust from one such test, a result not since replicated. No other published experiment has measured apparent thrust greater than the experiment's margin of error.  History and debunking  Rocket engines operate by expelling propellant, which acts as a reaction mass and which produces thrust per Newton’s third law of motion. In the 1960s, extensive research was conducted on two designs which emit high-velocity ionized gases in similar ways: ion thrusters that convert propellant to ions and accelerate and eject them via electric potentials, and plasma thrusters that convert propellant to plasma ions and accelerate and eject them via plasma currents. All designs for electromagnetic propulsion operate on the principle of reaction mass. A drive which does not expel propellant in order to produce a reaction force, providing thrust while being a closed system with no external interaction, would be a reactionless drive. Such a drive would violate the conservation of momentum and Newton's third law, leading many physicists to consider the idea pseudoscience. Such drives are a popular concept in science fiction, and their implausibility contributes to enthusiasm for exploring such designs. The original proposal for an RF resonant cavity thruster came from Roger Shawyer in 2001. He proposed a design with a conical cavity, which he called \\"EmDrive\\". He claimed that it produced thrust in the direction of the base of the cavity. Guido Fetta later built the Cannae Drive based on Shawyer's concept as a resonant thruster with a pillbox-shaped cavity. Since 2008, a few physicists have tested their own models, trying to reproduce the results claimed by Shawyer and Fetta. Juan Yang at Xi'an's Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) was unable to reproducibly measure thrust from their models, over the course of 4 years. In 2016, Harold White's group at NASA's Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory reported in the Journal of Propulsion and Power that a test of their own model had observed a small thrust. In December 2016, Yue Chen of the communication satellite division of the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), said his team had tested several prototypes, observed thrust, and was carrying out in-orbit verification. In September 2017, Chen talked about this CAST project again in an interview on CCTV. Media coverage of experiments using these designs has been controversial and polarized. The EmDrive first drew attention, both credulous and dismissive, when New Scientist wrote about it as an \\"impossible\\" drive in 2006. Media outlets were later criticised for misleading claims that a resonant cavity thruster had been \\"validated by NASA\\" following White's first tentative test reports in 2014. Scientists have continued to note the lack of unbiased coverage, from both polarized sides. In 2006, responding to the New Scientist piece, mathematical physicist John C. Baez at the University of California, Riverside, and Australian science-fiction writer Greg Egan, said the positive results reported by Shawyer were likely misinterpretations of experimental errors. In 2014, White's conference paper suggested that resonant cavity thrusters could work by transferring momentum to the \\"quantum vacuum virtual plasma.\\" Baez and Carroll criticized this explanation, because in the standard description of vacuum fluctuations, virtual particles do not behave as a plasma; Carroll also noted that the quantum vacuum has no \\"rest frame\\", providing nothing to push against, so it can't be used for propulsion. In the same way, physicists James F. Woodward and Heidi Fearn published two papers showing that electron-positron virtual pairs of the quantum vacuum, discussed by White as a potential virtual plasma propellant, could not account for thrust in any isolated, closed electromagnetic system such as a quantum vacuum thruster. Physicists Eric W. Davis at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin and Sean M. Carroll at the California Institute of Technology said in 2015 that the thrust measurements reported in papers by both Tajmar and White were indicative of thermal effect errors. In May 2018, researchers from the Institute of Aerospace Engineering at Technische Universität Dresden, Germany, concluded that the dominant effect underlying the apparent thrust could be clearly identified as an artifact caused by Earth's magnetic field interacting with power cables in the chamber, a result that other experts agree with.NASA's 'Impossible' Space Engine Tested—Here Are the Results.

Technische Universität Dresden, Germany. Presented at Barcelo Renacimiento Hotel, Seville, Spain 14 – 18 MAY 2018. In December 2019, White left the leadership of the Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory to lead research and development at Limitless Space Institute. Among other work, he will continue to conduct research on the EmDrive. A U.S. Navy research, Salvatore Cesar Pais, recently applied for a patent similar to the EmDrive. The DARPA project will continue through May 2021. Mike McCulloch, the current DARPA EmDrive project leader, José Luis Perez-Diaz, a physics professor and mechanical engineer at Charles III University of Madrid, and Tajmar have continued to experiment and to develop a theoretical explanation, with papers from Tajmar due in February 2021.  Designs and prototypes  Simplified schematic drawing of an EmDrive prototype by Tajmar and Fiedler.  EmDrive  In 2001, Shawyer founded Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd, in order to work on the EmDrive, a drive that he said used a resonant cavity to produce thrust without propellant. The company was backed by SMART award grants from the UK Department of Trade and Industry. In December 2002, he described a working prototype with an alleged total thrust of about powered by an 850 W cavity magnetron. The device could operate for only a few dozen seconds before the magnetron failed, due to overheating.  Second device and New Scientist article  In October 2006, Shawyer conducted tests on a new water-cooled prototype and said that it had increased thrust. He reported plans to have the device ready to use in space by May 2009 and to make the resonant cavity a superconductor, neither of which materialized. New Scientist magazine featured the EmDrive on the cover of 8 September 2006 issue. The article portrayed the device as plausible and emphasized the arguments of those who held that point of view. Science fiction author Greg Egan distributed a public letter stating that \\"a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers\\" made the magazine's coverage unreliable, sufficient \\"to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science\\". Especially, Egan said he was \\"gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy\\" in the magazine's coverage, alleging that it used \\"meaningless double-talk\\" to obfuscate the problem of conservation of momentum. The letter was endorsed by mathematical physicist John C. Baez and posted on his blog. New Scientist editor Jeremy Webb responded to critics: New Scientist also published a letter from the former technical director of EADS Astrium: A letter from physicist Paul Friedlander:  Later work  In 2007, the UK Department of Trade and Industry granted SPR an export licence to Boeing in the US. According to Shawyer, in December 2008 he was invited to The Pentagon to present on the EmDrive, and in 2009 Boeing expressed interest in it, at which point he stated that SPR built a thruster which produced 18 grams of thrust, and sent it to Boeing. Boeing did not, however, license the technology and communication stopped. In 2012, a Boeing representative confirmed that Boeing Phantom Works used to explore exotic forms of space propulsion, including Shawyer's drive, but such work later ceased. They confirmed that \\"Phantom Works is not working with Mr. Shawyer,\\" nor pursuing those explorations. In 2013 and 2014, Shawyer presented ideas for 'second- generation' EmDrive designs and applications at the annual International Astronautical Congress. A paper based on his 2014 presentation was published in Acta Astronautica in 2015. It describes a model for a superconducting resonant cavity and three models for thrusters with multiple cavities, with hypothetical applications for launching space probes. In 2016, Shawyer filed further patents and launched a new company, Universal Propulsion Ltd., as a joint venture with Gilo Industries Group, a small UK aerospace company.  Cannae and other drives  The Cannae Drive (formerly Q-drive), another engine designed to generate propulsion from a resonant cavity without propellant, is another implementation of this idea. Its cavity is also asymmetric, but relatively flat rather than a truncated cone. It was designed by Fetta in 2006 and has been promoted within the US through his company, Cannae LLC, since 2011. In 2016, Fetta announced plans to eventually launch a CubeSat satellite containing a version of the Cannae Drive, which they would run for 6 months to observe how it functions in space. In China, researchers working under Yang at NWPU developed their own prototype resonant cavity thruster in 2008, publishing a report in their university's journal on the theory behind such devices. In 2012 they measured thrust from their prototype, however, in 2014 they found this had been an experimental error. A second, improved prototype did not produce any measured thrust. At the China Academy of Space Technology, Yue Chen filed several patent applications in 2016 describing various RF resonant cavity thruster designs. These included a method for stacking several short resonant cavities to improve thrust, and a design with a cavity that was a semicylinder instead of a frustum. That December, Chen announced that CAST was conducting tests on a resonant cavity thruster in orbit, without specifying what design was used. In an interview on CCTV in September 2017, Chen Yue showed some testing of a flat cylindrical device corresponding to the patent describing stacked short cavities with internal diaphragms.  Theoretical inconsistencies  The proposed theory for how the EmDrive works violates the conservation of momentum, which states any interaction cannot have a net force; a consequence of the conservation of momentum is Newton's third law, where for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The conservation of momentum is a symmetry of nature. An often cited example of apparent nonconservation of momentum is the Casimir effect; in the standard case where two parallel plates are attracted to each other. However the plates move in opposite directions, so no net momentum is extracted from the vacuum and, moreover, energy must be put into the system to take the plates apart again. Assuming homogeneous electric and magnetic fields, it is impossible for the EmDrive, or any other device, to extract a net momentum transfer from either a classical or quantum vacuum. Extraction of a net momentum \\"from nothing\\" has been postulated in an inhomogeneous vacuum, but this remains highly controversial as it will violate Lorentz invariance. Both Harold White's and Mike McCulloch's theories of how the EmDrive could work rely on these asymmetric or dynamical Casimir effects. However, if these vacuum forces are present, they are expected to be exceptionally tiny based on our current understanding, too small to explain the level of observed thrust. In the event that observed thrust is not due to experimental error, a positive result could indicate new physics.  Tests and experiments   Tests by inventors  In 2004, Shawyer claimed to have received seven independent positive reviews from experts at BAE Systems, EADS Astrium, Siemens and the IEE. However no independent expert has published a positive review, and at least one directly disputed Shawyer's claim. In a letter to New Scientist, the then-technical director of EADS Astrium (Shawyer's former employer) denied this, stating: In 2011, Fetta tested a superconducting version of the Cannae drive. The RF resonant cavity was suspended inside a liquid helium-filled dewar. The weight of the cavity was monitored by load cells. Fetta theorized that when the device was activated and produced upward thrust, the load cells would detect the thrust as a change in weight. According to Fetta, when pulses of RF power were sent into the resonant cavity, there was a reduction in compressive force on the load cells that could indicate thrust. None of these results were published in the scientific literature, replicated by independent researchers, or replicated consistently by the inventors. In a few cases details were posted for a time on the inventors' websites, but no such documents remain online as of 2019.Fetta's experimental notes are no longer available, but an archived version as of 2 November 2012 is on archive.org: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS (retrieved 11 February 2015) In 2015, Shawyer published an article in Acta Astronautica, summarising existing tests on the EmDrive. Of seven tests, four produced a measured force in the intended direction and three produced thrust in the opposite direction. Furthermore, in one test, thrust could be produced in either direction by varying the spring constants in the measuring apparatus.  Northwestern Polytechnical University  In 2008, a team of Chinese researchers led by Juan Yang (杨涓), professor of propulsion theory and engineering of aeronautics and astronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in Xi'an, China, said that they had developed a valid electro-magnetic theory behind a microwave resonant cavity thruster. A demonstration version of the drive was built and tested with different cavity shapes and at higher power levels in 2010. Using an aerospace engine test stand usually used to precisely test spacecraft engines like ion drives, they reported a maximum thrust of 720 mN at 2,500 W of input power. Yang noted that her results were tentative, and said she \\"[was] not able to discuss her work until more results are published\\". This positive result was over 100x more thrust per input power than any other experiment. In a 2014 follow-up experiment (published in 2016), Yang could not reproduce the 2010 observation and suggested it was due to experimental error. In that experiment they refined their experimental setup, using a three-wire torsion pendulum to measure thrust, and tested two different power setups. In one trial, the power system was outside the cavity, and they observed a \\"thrust\\" of 8–10 mN. In a second trial, the power system was within the cavity, and they measured no such thrust. Instead they observed an insignificant thrust below their noise threshold of 3 mN, fluctuating between ±0.7 mN with a measurement uncertainty of 80%, with 230 W of input power. They concluded that they were unable to measure significant thrust; that \\"thrust\\" measured when using external power sources (as in their 2010 experiment) could be noise; and that it was important to use self-contained power systems for these experiments, and more sensitive pendulums with lower torsional stiffness.  NASA Eagleworks  Since 2011, White has had a team at NASA known as the Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory, or Eagleworks Laboratories, which is devoted to studying exotic propulsion concepts. The group has investigated ideas for a wide range of untested and fringe proposals, including Alcubierre drives, drives that interact with the quantum vacuum, and RF resonant cavity thrusters. In 2014, the group began testing resonant cavity thrusters of their own design and sharing some of their results. In November 2016, they published their first peer-reviewed paper on this work, in the Journal of Propulsion and Power.  EmDrive and tapered cavities  In July 2014, White reported tentative positive results for evaluating a tapered RF resonant cavity. Testing was performed using a low-thrust torsion pendulum able to detect force at the micronewton level within a sealed but unevacuated vacuum chamber (the RF power amplifier used an electrolytic capacitor unable to operate in a hard vacuum). The experimenters recorded directional thrust immediately upon application of power. Their first tests of this tapered cavity were conducted at very low power (2% of Shawyer's 2002 experiment). A net mean thrust over five runs was measured at 91.2 µN at 17 W of input power. The experiment was criticized for its small data set and for not having been conducted in vacuum, to eliminate thermal air currents. The group announced a plan to upgrade their equipment to higher power levels, to use vacuum-capable RF amplifiers with power ranges of up to 125 W, and to design a new tapered cavity that could be in the 0.1 N/kW range. The test article was to be subject to independent verification and validation at Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. , this validation has not happened.Topic: EM Drive Developments – related to space flight applications – Thread 8, Nasa Spaceflight Forum, posts by Paul March, 26 November 2016. In 2015, Paul March from Eagleworks made new results public, measured with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50 µN with 50 W of input power at 5.0×10−6 torr. The new RF power amplifiers were said to be made for hard vacuum, but failed rapidly due to internal corona discharges. Without funding to replace or upgrade them, measurements were scarce for a time. They conducted further experiments in vacuum, a set of 18 observations with 40-80W of input power. They published the results in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics's peer-reviewed Journal of Propulsion and Power, under the title \\"Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum\\". This was released online in November 2016, with print publication in December. The study said that the system was \\"consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2±0.1mN/kW\\", and enumerated many potential sources of error. The paper suggested that pilot-wave theory (a controversial, non-mainstream deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics) could explain how the device produces thrust. Commenters pointed out that just because a study reporting consistent thrust was published with peer-review does not necessarily mean that the drive functions as claimed. Physicist Chris Lee was very critical of the work, saying that the paper had a small data set and a number of missing details he described as 'gaping holes'. Electrical Engineer George Hathaway analyzed and criticized the scientific method described in the paper.  Cannae drive  White's 2014 tests also evaluated two Cannae drive prototypes. One had radial slots engraved along the bottom rim of the resonant cavity interior, as required by Fetta's hypothesis to produce thrust; another \\"null\\" test article lacked those radial slots. Both drives were equipped with an internal dielectric. A third test article, the experimental control, had an RF load but no resonant cavity interior. These tests took place at atmospheric pressure. About the same net thrust was reported for both the device with radial slots and the device without slots. Thrust was not reported for the experimental control. Some considered the positive result for the non-slotted device a possible flaw in the experiment, as the null test device had been expected to produce less or no thrust based upon Fetta's hypothesis of how thrust was produced by the device. In the complete paper, however, White concluded that the test results proved that \\"thrust production was not dependent upon slotting\\".  Dresden University of Technology  In July 2015, an aerospace research group at the Dresden University of Technology (TUD) under Martin Tajmar reported results for an evaluation of an RF resonant tapered cavity similar to the EmDrive. Testing was performed first on a knife-edge beam balance able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1 mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at . They used a conventional ISM band 2.45 GHz 700 W oven magnetron, and a small cavity with a low Q factor (20 in vacuum tests). They observed small positive thrusts in the positive direction and negative thrusts in the negative direction, of about 20 µN in a hard vacuum. However, when they rotated the cavity upwards as a \\"null\\" configuration, they observed an anomalous thrust of hundreds of micronewtons, significantly larger than the expected result of zero thrust. This indicated a strong source of noise which they could not identify. This led them to conclude that they could not confirm or refute claims about such a thruster. At the time they considered future experiments with better magnetic shielding, other vacuum tests and improved cavities with higher Q factors. In 2018, the TU Dresden research team presented a conference paper summarizing the results from the most recent experiments on their upgraded test rig, which seemed to show that their measured thrust was a result of experimental error from insufficiently shielded components interacting with the earth's magnetic field. In their experiments, they measured thrust values consistent with previous experiments, and the thrust reversed appropriately when the thruster was rotated by 180°. However, the team also measured thrust perpendicular to the expected direction when the thruster was rotated by 90°, and did not measure a reduction in thrust when an attenuator was used to reduce the power that actually entered the resonant cavity by a factor of 10,000, which they said \\"clearly indicates that the \\"thrust\\" is not coming from the EMDrive but from some electromagnetic interaction.\\" They concluded that \\"magnetic interaction from not sufficiently shielded cables or thrusters are a major factor that needs to be taken into account for proper μN thrust measurements for these type of devices,\\" and they plan on conducting future tests at higher power and at different frequencies, and with improved shielding and cavity geometry.  Tests in space  In August 2016, Cannae announced plans to launch its thruster on a 6U cubesat which they would run for 6 months to observe how it functions in space. Cannae has formed a company called Theseus for the venture and partnered with LAI International and SpaceQuest Ltd. to launch the satellite. No launch date has yet been announced. In November 2016, the International Business Times published an unconfirmed report that the U.S. government was testing a version of the EmDrive on the Boeing X-37B and that the Chinese government has made plans to incorporate the EmDrive on its orbital space laboratory Tiangong-2. The US Air Force has only confirmed that the X-37B mission in question did an electric propulsion system test using a Hall-effect thruster, a type of ion thruster that uses a gaseous propellant. In December 2016, Yue Chen told a reporter at China's Science and Technology Daily that his team was testing an EmDrive in orbit, and that they had been funding research in the area for five years. Chen noted that their prototype's thrust was at the \\"micronewton to millinewton level\\", which would have to be scaled up to at least 100–1000 millinewtons for a chance of conclusive experimental results. Despite this, he said his goal was to complete validation of the drive, and then to make such technology available in the field of satellite engineering \\"as quickly as possible\\".  Experimental errors  Experimental errors in the testing of the prototypes generally fall into four categories * Measurement errors. Most theoretical scientists who have looked at the EmDrive believe this to be the likely case. * Electromagnetic effects. * Exhaust not being measured or taken into account. * Speculation that our current understanding of the laws of physics are completely wrong.  Measurement errors  The simplest and most likely explanation is that any thrust detected is due to experimental error or noise. In all of the experiments set up, a very large amount of energy goes into generating a tiny amount of thrust. When attempting to measure a small signal superimposed on a large signal, the noise from the large signal can obscure the small signal and give incorrect results. The strongest early result, from Yang's group in China, was later reported to be caused by an experimental error.  Shift in center of gravity due to thermal effects  Infrared image showing heating of the heat sink The largest error source is believed to come from the thermal expansion of the thruster's heat sink; as it expands this would lead to a change in the centre of gravity causing the resonant cavity to move. White's team attempted to model the thermal effect on the overall displacement by using a superposition of the displacements caused by \\"thermal effects\\" and \\"impulsive thrust\\" with White saying \\"That was the thing we worked the hardest to understand and put in a box\\". Despite these efforts, White's team were unable to fully account for the thermal expansion. In an interview with Aerospace America, White comments that \\"although maybe we put a little bit of a pencil mark through [thermal errors]... they are certainly not black-Sharpie-crossed-out.\\" Their method of accounting for thermal effects has been criticized by Millis and Davies, who highlight that there is a lack of both mathematical and empirical detail to justify the assumptions made about those effects. For example, they do not provide data on temperature measurement over time compared to device displacement. The paper includes a graphical chart, but it is based on a priori assumptions about what the shapes of the \\"impulsive thrust\\" and \\"thermal effects\\" should be, and how those signals will superimpose. The model further assumes all noise to be thermal and does not include other effects such as interaction with the chamber wall, power lead forces, and tilting. Because the Eagleworks paper has no explicit model for thrust to compare with the observations, it is ultimately subjective, and its data can be interpreted in more than one way. The Eagleworks test, therefore, does not conclusively show a thrust effect, but cannot rule it out either. White suggested future experiments could run on a Cavendish balance. In such a setup, the thruster could rotate out to much larger angular displacements, letting a thrust (if present) dominate any possible thermal effects. Testing a device in space would also eliminate the center-of-gravity issue.  Electromagnetic interaction with the vacuum chamber's wall  Another source of error could have arisen from electromagnetic interaction with the walls of the vacuum chamber. White argued that any wall interaction could only be the result of a well-formed resonance coupling between the device and wall and that the high frequency used imply the chances of this would be highly dependent on the device's geometry. As components get warmer due to thermal expansion, the device's geometry changes, shifting the resonance of the cavity. In order to counter this effect and keep the system in optimal resonance conditions, White used a phase-locked loop system (PLL). Their analysis assumed that using a PLL ruled out significant electromagnetic interaction with the wall.  Lorentz force from power leads  Another potential source of error was a Lorentz force arising from power leads. Many previous experiments used cups with Galinstan metal alloy, which is liquid at room temperature, to supply electrical power to the device in lieu of solid wires. Martin Tajmar and his graduate student Fiedler characterized and attempted to quantify possible sources of error in their experiment at Dresden University of Technology. They ran multiple tests on their experimental setup, including measurements of the force along different axes with respect to the power supply current. While eliminating or accounting for many other sources of error in previous experiments, such as replacing a magnetic damping mechanism with an oil damper, less efficient but significantly less interacting with electromagnetic field, the study remained inconclusive as to the effects of electromagnetic interaction with the apparatus' power feed, at the same time noting it as possibly the most significant source of noise. White's power setup may have been different, but their paper does not state if the connections are all coaxially aligned with the stand's rotation axis, which would be required to minimize errors from Lorentz forces, and it gives no data from equivalent tests with power into a dummy load so these influences can be compared with those seen in the Tajmar- Fiedler run.  Speculation regarding new physical laws  White's 2016 paper went through about a year of peer review involving five referees. Peer review does not mean the results or observations are true, only that the referees looked at the experiment, results and interpretation and found it to be sound and sensible. Brice Cassenti, a professor at the University of Connecticut and an expert in advanced propulsion, spoke to one of the referees, and reported the referee did not believe the results point to any new physics, but that the results were puzzling enough to publish. Cassenti believes there is a mundane explanation for the results, but the probability of the results being valid is slim but not zero. White's paper was published in the Journal of Propulsion and Power. Marc Millis and Eric Davies who ran NASA's previous advanced propulsion project, the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program have commented that while White used techniques that would be acceptable for checking the electric propulsion of Hall thrusters, the tests were not sufficient to demonstrate that any new physics effect exists.

It is marketed as the world's thinnest slider phone. Since the end of 2006, a Wine Red edition was added and 2007 marked the introduction of a chrome edition to the lineup. There is also an upgrade of this model, the Samsung D900i which can be used to access documents on your computer from your phone and added an FM radio as well as was made out of higher-quality materials. The D900 was succeeded by Z720, also known as Ultra Edition 13.8 in August 2006, following the 3MP camera, QVGA display, upgraded interface and high-speed HSDPA/3G connectivity and it was available exclusively for Vodafone, Movistar (Spain only) & China Mobile (Z728 only). Vodafone also sold the exclusive McLaren Special Edition units along with Sharp GX29 and 770SH. Features The phone has features including: * Quad-band capabilities, allowing it to be used as a mobile phone on all major GSM networks across the globe * Built in hands-free function * Built in Bluetooth wireless technology * Custom animated backgrounds (varies with country of sale) * Memory card slot for optional MicroSD memory card up to 2GB ( 2 GB only with the latest firmware) * 60 MB internal memory * MP3 Ringtones * Speakerphone * Digital audio player with MP3, WMA and AAC/AAC+ playback * 3.15 Megapixel digital camera with many shooting modes and an integrated LED photo/video light (flash), autofocus, and the ability to perform basic image editing functions * MPEG-4, 3gp video recording CIF 352x288 @ 30fps/playback * Java games * Alarm clock with three configurable alarms * Calendar * Calculator * FM Radio (D900i only) The slider can be configured to accept and close calls, as well as locking and unlocking the keypad. Settings are available which allow for the phone to stay unlocked even when closed. However, the Samsung SGH-D900 also lacks some basic physical features common to most cellphones. For one, there is no standard carrying case or belt clip, nor are there any compatible belt clips, so the only way to fix it to a belt is to purchase a generic belt holder that has the same dimensions as the phone. Also, there is no protrusion upon which to tie a cellphone strap. This means that people who enjoy personalizing their cellphones with charms, pendants, and other personal straps will not have this choice. The SGH-D900 suffers from a number of software quirks. The Java implementation does not allow applications to access the network without repeatedly asking the user for permission - there is no \\"always allow\\" option. The handset also lacks the ability to use imported files as an SMS alert tone, leaving only the small default selection of sounds available to the user. The camera features also have a number of quirks, such as the shutter sound preceding the actual image capture by approximately half a second (leading to blurred and poorly aimed images as the user moves the phone after the expected exposure duration has passed.) In addition the camera does not take a photo if you hold down the camera button - the user must press and release quickly. Photos cannot be saved directly to the memory card, and moving the photos already taken leads to duplicate file names. Also, only images in \\"My Photos\\" folder can be zoomed, so any imported images must be moved to that folder before they can be zoomed. For the SGH-D900i, Samsung removed Picsel Document Viewer in favor of the FM radio function. Performance  The SGH-D900 was the thinnest slider phone until the introduction of the SGH-U600 model in 2007, (the Samsung U600 has a thickness of and the D900 and D900i both have thicknesses of 12.9mm) and then when the E840 was released (thickness of ). The D900 comes with a 3.15 megapixel camera (2048x1536 pixels). Video capabilities are higher than the usual standards and recording is made in CIF (352x288 pixels) resolution. The internal memory and optional MicroSD card slot makes it ideal for listening to music on the go. A loud speakerphone and voice clarity filtration software makes for easy use in noisy locations. The battery life is decent for such a compact cellphone, and can last for few days on standby or approximately 5 to 6 hours of conversation. The slider is easy to operate, with a protrusion for the thumb that allows it to be easily extended or retracted. The interface inside it does not allow the users to modify the phone's profiles or add applications, compared to its rivals where you can upgrade the firmware through USB.

History Situated at a natural gorge of the Whippany River, several hydraulic powered forges existed, predating the establishment of the ironworks by Stephen Vail and two business partners. Vail became sole owner of the works in 1815 and expanded it, producing a variety of agricultural and industrial machinery. The ironworks innovated the first durable iron tire for railroad locomotives in January 1836. With changing industrial trends and a decline in the flow of the Whippany River, the ironworks were shut down in 1873, its equipment being sold to ironworks in Brooklyn and Coatbridge, Scotland.

The Vail Homestead or Speedwell Village, as it is sometimes known, is the site of Historic Speedwell, a National Historic Landmark, part of the Morris County Park Commission. The site is set up as an open-air 19th century estate, complete with residential buildings, a granary and two carriage houses. The site is currently open to the public, with 19th century ironworking materials and historical artifacts about communication on exhibit. Today, the site is maintained as a public park and museum by the Morris County Park Commission. It includes nine buildings furnished to depict life at Speedwell during the early 19th century. The Vail House, a historic house museum restored to 1840s period style, possesses some original family furniture and Vail memorabilia. The Wheel House houses an operational overshot waterwheel. The Homestead Carriage House houses an exhibit on the SS Savannah, the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, with an engine built at the Speedwell Ironworks, and an exhibit about the history of the ironworks. The Ford Cottage is a 19th-century saltbox cottage, the Moses Estey House is an 18th-century Georgian mansion, and the early 19th century L'Hommedieu-Gwinnup House houses changing exhibits and education space.

Speedwell Village was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974, preserving seven buildings. and Telegraph The old factory building on the grounds of the ironworks, a national historic landmark, was constructed by Stephen Vail for hobby purposes upon his retirement. It is the site of the first public demonstration of the Morse electromagnetic telegraph on January 11, 1838. Although Morse and Alfred Vail had conducted most of the research and development in the ironworks facilities, they chose the factory house for demonstration. Without the repeater, the range of the telegraph was limited to two miles (3 km). The inventors had pulled two miles (3 km) of wires inside the factory house for the demonstration. The first public transmission was witnessed by a mostly local crowd.

The abscissa shows the domain of the (to be tested) function. In mathematics, the vertical line test is a visual way to determine if a curve is a graph of a function or not. A function can only have one output, y, for each unique input, x. If a vertical line intersects a curve on an xy-plane more than once then for one value of x the curve has more than one value of y, and so, the curve does not represent a function. If all vertical lines intersect a curve at most once then the curve represents a function. To use the vertical line test, take a ruler or other straight edge and draw a line parallel to the y-axis for any chosen value of x. If the vertical line you drew intersects the graph more than once for any value of x then the graph is not the graph of a function. If, alternatively, a vertical line intersects the graph no more than once, no matter where the vertical line is placed, then the graph is the graph of a function. For example, a curve which is any straight line other than a vertical line will be the graph of a function. As another example, a sideways parabola (one whose directrix is a vertical line) is not the graph of a function because some vertical lines will intersect the parabola twice.

XAP processors are a family of 16-bit and 32-bit cores, all of which are intended for use in an application-specific integrated circuit or ASIC chip design. XAP processors were designed for use in mixed- signal integrated circuits for sensor or wireless applications including Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, RFID or Near Field Communication chips. Typically these integrated circuits are used in low cost, high volume products that are battery-powered and must have low energy consumption. There are other applications where XAP processors have been used to good effect, such as wireless sensor networks and medical devices, e.g. hearing aids. The XAP soft microprocessor has been implemented in several on-chip design styles, including self-timed asynchronous circuit, 1-of-4 encoding, fully synchronous circuit, A.

This makes it useful for making fair comparisons between on-chip design styles. History XAP1 The first XAP processor was XAP1, designed in 1994 and used for a number of wireless and sensor ASIC projects at Cambridge Consultants. It was a very small, 3,000-gate, Harvard architecture, 16-bit processor with a 16-bit data bus and an 18-bit instruction bus intended for running programs stored in on-chip read-only memory or ROM. Data and instructions were each addressed by separate 16-bit address bus. XAP2 A more powerful XAP2 was developed and used from 1999. It also had a Harvard architecture and 16-bit data, and it adopted a more conventional 16-bit instruction width suitable for program storage in Flash or other off-chip memories. Large programs were accommodated by a 24-bit address bus for instructions and there was a 16-bit address bus for data. XAP2 was a 12,000-gate processor with support for interrupts and a software tool chain including a C compiler and the XAPASM assembler for its assembly language. XAP2 was also used in Cambridge Consultants' ASIC designs and it was also provided to other semiconductor companies as a semiconductor intellectual property core, or IP core. XAP2 was adopted by three fabless semiconductor companies that emerged from Cambridge Consultants: CSR plc (Cambridge Silicon Radio) is the main provider of Bluetooth chips for mobile phones and headsets; Ember Corporation is a leading supplier of ZigBee chips; and Cyan Technology supplies XAP2-powered microcontrollers. As a consequence, and combined with other licensees and Cambridge Consultants’ ASIC projects, there are now over one billion (1,000 million) XAP processors in use worldwide. XAP3 XAP3 was an experimental 32-bit processor designed at Cambridge Consultants in 2003. It was optimised for low cost, low energy ASIC implementations using modern CMOS semiconductor process technologies. The instruction set was optimised for GNU GCC to achieve high code density. The XAP3 was the first of Cambridge Consultants’ processors to use a Von Neumann architecture with a logically shared address space for Program and Data. The physical program memory could be Flash or one-time programmable EPROM or SRAM. ASIC design was simplified by using a single memory where there was no need to pre-determine the split between Program (instructions) and Data at design time. The XAP3's instruction set with the GCC compiler produced very high code density. This reduced the size of the program memory, which reduced the chip unit cost and reduced the energy consumption. XAP4 In 2005, further project requirements saw a new 16-bit processor, the XAP4, designed to supersede the XAP2 taking into account the experience gained on XAP3 and the evolving requirements of ASIC designs. XAP4 is a very small, 12,000-gate, Von Neumann bus, 16-bit processor core capable of addressing a total of 64 kBytes of memory for programs, data and peripherals. It offers high code density combined with good performance in the region of 50 Dhrystone MIPS when clocked at 80 MHz. XAP4 was designed for use in modern ASIC or microcontroller applications capable of processing real-world data captured by an analog-to- digital converter (ADC) or similar sources. The processor's 16-bit integer word supports the precision of most ADCs without carrying the overhead of a 32-bit processor. XAP4 also offers a migration path from 8-bit processors, such as 8051, in applications that need increased performance and program size, but cannot justify the cost and overhead of a 32-bit processor. The XAP4 registers (all 16-bit) are; 8 General Purpose, Program Counter, Vector Pointer, FLAGS, INFO, BRKE, 2 Breakpoint. The XAP4 instructions are 16 and 32-bit. The XAP4 compile chain is based on GNU GCC and Binutils. XAP5 Development of an extended version of this architecture commenced in 2006 and resulted in the XAP5, which was announced in July 2008. XAP5 is a 16-bit processor with a 24-bit address bus making it capable of running programs from memory up to 16 MBytes. XAP4 and XAP5 are both implemented with a two-stage instruction pipeline, which maximises their performance when clocked at low frequencies. This is tailored to the requirements of small, low-energy ASICs as it minimises processor hardware size (the XAP5 core uses 18,000-gates), and it fits designs that are clocked relatively slowly to reduce an ASIC's dynamic power consumption and run programs direct from Flash or OTP memory that has a slow access time. Typical clock speeds for XAP5 are in the range of 16 to 100 MHz on a 0.13 process. XAP5 has particular design features making it suitable for executing programs from Flash including a Vector Pointer and an Address Translation Window, which combine to allow in-place execution of programs and relocation of programs regardless of where they are stored in physical memory. The XAP4 registers (16 and 24-bit) are; 8 General Purpose, Program Counter, Vector Pointer, FLAGS, INFO, BRKE, 4 Breakpoint. The XAP5 instructions are 16, 32 and 48-bit. The XAP5 compile chain is based on GNU GCC and Binutils. XAP6 XAP6 is a 32-bit processor and was launched in 2013. It has the same type of load-store architecture as the XAP4 and XAP5, but has 32-bit registers and 32-bit buses for Data and Address. The XAP6a implementation has a three-stage instruction pipeline. Like all the XAP processors, the XAP6 has been optimised for low-cost, low-energy and easy verification. XAP6 is tailored for small low-energy ASICs and minimises processor hardware size (the XAP6 core uses 30,000-gates). The XAP6 registers (all 32-bit) are; 8 General Purpose, Program Counter, Vector Pointer, Global Pointer, FLAGS, INFO, BRKE, 4 Breakpoint. The XAP6 instructions are 16, 32 and 48-bit. The XAP6 compile chain is based on GNU GCC and Binutils. Features XAP4, XAP5 and XAP6 are all designed with a load-store RISC architecture that is complemented with multi-cycle instructions for multiplication, division, block copy/store and function entry/exit for maximum efficiency. Cambridge Consultants’ engineers recognised the requirement for these processors to run real-time operating systems capable of handling pre-emptive events and with a fast interrupt response. Consequently the processors are designed with hardware and instruction set support for protected software operating modes that partition user code from privileged operating system and interrupt handler code. The XAP processor hardware manages the mode transitions and call stack in response to events and this approach ensures a fast and deterministic interrupt response. The protected operating modes enable a system on a chip to be designed that is a secure or trustworthy system and offers high availability. The current XAP processors are designed using the Verilog hardware description language and provided as RTL code ready for logic simulation and logic synthesis with a test bench. They are supported with Cambridge Consultants’ xIDE software development tools and SIF debug technology. These processors and tools enable functional verification and software verification that reduces the project risk, accelerates time-scales and cuts cost of ownership, especially for software engineering.

It included population, territorial properties, buildings, cattle, offices, all kinds of revenue and trades, and even geographical information from each place. It was encouraged by king Ferdinand VI of Spain and his minister the Marquis of Ensenada, and is known today as the Catastro of Ensenada. The general answers of each place to the 40 questions of the Catastro produced a huge volume of documentation that affords historians an opportunity to analyze the economy, the society, the practices of the señorío system (manorialism) and environmental data from 18th-century Spain. It is the best statistical register of the pre-statistical age of the Ancien Régime in Europe. Today the word catastro means “register of the properties”, but the etymology comes from “enquire”. In the 18th century there was a distinction between a catastro, which was made by central officers who traveled to the places to enquire, and the amillaramiento, which was made by local authorities. The single tax The Catastro originated in a proposal for a single tax (única contribución), studied by 16 members of the Council of Castile, the Hacienda (Treasury), the Indies (America), the Military Orders, five intendentes (first provincial authorities) and the head of the Barcelona Court. After receiving the negative opinion of Councils and the positive opinion of the intendentes, the king saw fit to begin the survey in the interest of the Crown and the vassals (October 10, 1749). With the royal order came a comprehensive set of instructions, or handbook, for the correct implementation of the Catastro by the enquirers and the public. Measures were taken to prevent fraud, with public readings of the findings at each locality. Officers from other provinces were called when the local officers were not trustworthy. Test inquiries were also held in one locality within each province, to detect errors of implementation. The number of officers in the Contadurías de Rentas Provinciales (i.e., the central treasury bureaucracy) rose from no more than three to more than a hundred, now under the orders of the Real Junta de Única Contribución (royal commission for a single tax). The reform of the Rentas Provinciales (a complex and heterogeneous mixture of revenues including all sorts of taxes, such as the alcabalas, tithes, millones, cientos, tercias reales, etc.) was the objective of the new system. A single tax, proportional to the income of each person, was to be determined from the results of the Catastro. The single tax proposal was inspired by a very modern economic doctrine (nearer the Physiocratic school than mercantilism), which viewed the old tax system as anti-economic and injurious to the nation because it was only paid by the productive part of the population: the common people. The nobility and the clergy, exempt from other taxes by their privileged condition, were also able to avoid the \\"sales taxes\\" because they raised their own crops, out of the regular markets where this tax (the alcabala) was paid. The existing tax system made free trade nearly impossible. The Catastro did not lead to a substantial Treasury reform. Such a far-reaching reform was made impossible by the resistance of the privileged. The French revolted against a similar tax system, while Spain made that change silently (the only disturbances were the easily calmed Esquilache Riots of 1766, and those were only tenuously connected with other reformist episodes), because the two countries were in unequal states of transition from feudalism to capitalism. Other documents were completed simultaneously, like the so-called Census of Ensenada, which produced an accurate estimation of 9.400.000 inhabitants for the peninsular territory of Spain in 1756. The quality of the answers varied from province to province and from town to town. Given its accuracy, the data from the province of Jaén (which covered more territory than it does today) were copied and sent as an example for the other provinces. The Respuestas Generales (general responses) are held in several archives of the Spanish state, and the General Archive of Simancas keeps copies of all the answers. Most of the documents were microfilmed in the 1980s and are now available on the Internet.

Club career After Giorgio Ferrini and Paolo Pulici, Zaccarelli is the third player with the most appearances for Torino in Serie A. He began his career in the youth ranks of Junior Ancona, a historical team in the doric district of Vallemiano; at age 15 he entered the Torino youth system, then was sold to gain experience in Serie B with Catania and Novara, up until his debut in Serie A with Verona in 1973. He returned to Turin in the summer of 1974; forming an exceptional midfield with Eraldo Pecci, Claudio Sala and Patrizio Sala the following season. He won the Scudetto with Torino in the 1975–76 season. He retired at the end of the 1986–87 season with the Granata, having made 413 appearances and scored 21 goals in all competitions. International career Perugia in 1976, battling his former teammate, Aldo Agroppi Zaccarelli represented the Italy national football team for five years, making 25 appearances and scoring two goals. He participated at the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, where Italy finished fourth. He was played from bench as second to Giancarlo Antognoni, eventually making five appearances scoring one goal; that of a 2–1 comeback victory against France. Style of play Zaccarelli was a traditional advanced playmaker, who was elegant, practical and a consistent performer in midfield. Towards the end of his career he was moved back on the pitch and reinvented himself as a libero, almost as an additional midfielder. In this role he lived a second youth, to the point he was awarded the Guerin d'Oro in 1986 as the best footballer of the 1985–86 season. Managerial career After hanging up his boots, Zaccarelli alternated his managerial career with that of an executive. He was the director of football of Torino under the presidency of Roberto Goveani, then team manager under Gianmarco Calleri. In the 1992–93 season, he was named the director of football of Alessandria. He began his managerial career in service of the Italy under-21 Serie B representative team, then was assistant coach of the Italy under-21. He returned to Torino in 2002 as head of the youth system, then as general manager in 2003, replacing Sandro Mazzola. He would later coach Torino during the 2002–03 season (succeeding Renzo Ulivieri) then in the 2004–05 Serie B season, taking over for Ezio Rossi prior to the promotion playoffs, won in the final against Perugia. The later would prove decisive for the fate of the club: while not being promoted to Serie A by virtue of the Covisoc decisions, Torino were subsequently allowed to stay in Serie B under the law Lodo Petrucci under the guidance of Urbano Cairo. In 2005–06 he moved to Bologna as the director of football.

The scheme allows the safety of the medicines and vaccines that are on the market to be monitored. The Scheme was founded in 1964 after the thalidomide disaster, and was developed by Bill Inman. It is run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines. It was extended to hospital pharmacists in 1997, and to community pharmacists in 1999. Suspected adverse reactions are collected on all licensed medicines and vaccines, from those issued on prescription to medicines bought over the counter from a pharmacist or supermarket. The Scheme also includes all herbal preparations and unlicensed medicines. Adverse reactions can be reported by anyone; this is usually done by healthcare professionals – including doctors, pharmacists and nurses – but patients and carers can also make reports. The sort of adverse reactions that should be reported are: * those that have caused death or a serious illness * Any adverse reaction, however minor, if associated with a new medicine or one that is under continued monitoring (highlighted in the British National Formulary with a ▼ black triangle) * Any adverse reaction, however minor, if associated with a child (under 18 years of age) or in pregnancy Yellow Cards are available from pharmacies and a few are presented near the back of the BNF as tear-off pages, copies may also be obtained by telephoning +44 (0) 808 100 3352.A side effect of your medicine?

The band was founded by Rik Kenton (b. 31 October 1945, in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England) Glynnis (voc) Ned Morant (perc.) Carol Isaacs (keyboards/background vocals) and Andrew Edge (drums). They were a mixed-race group of musicians who used traditional pop styles as well as reggae, Caribbean dance rhythms and African rhythms. Savage Progress joined the Thompson Twins on the \\"Into the Gap\\" tour of Britain (February 1984) as support act. Savage Progress' biggest hit was \\"My Soul Unwraps Tonight\\", which was written by Kenton, a former member of Roxy Music. Early years The band started with the meeting of Kenton and Glynnis in 1982. They later recruited Morant, who was not a professional percussionist, but was eager to learn and fitted in with the visual style of the band.

Racial mix The racial mix within Savage Progress was never fully stressed in the media, but had a definite effect on their music: Glynnis was born in Zimbabwe to mixed race /African parents, Kenton is from Nottingham, Isaacs is English-Jewish, Morant has Indian parentage, and Edge is from Leeds, in northern England. This mix of differing cultures proved to be advantageous for Savage Progress' music, as Kenton infused their songs with as many cultural influences as possible.

It is a member of the Czech ELH after reforming when the original club, now known as Mountfield HK, moved to Hradec Králové over a sponsorship dispute. Home stadium of the team ČEZ Motor České Budějovice is Budvar Arena in České Budějovice. History Bandy era in České Budějovice The long history started in 1911, when group of young gymnasium students devised a plan to start a bandy team. Their first hockey rinks were situated exactly where the Malše river and Vltava river merge. Dr. Zdeněk Černý was the first coach, manager, as well as a player of the team. The bandy club lasted until World War I. Some of the first victims of the war were players from České Budějovice such as Áda Schrabal, Karel Selinka, Jan Vrkoč, and Leo Feigl. Adaptation to ice hockey On December 3, 1921, SK České Budějovice played its first amateur ice hockey match in Strakonice. On January 10, 1928, a club known as AC Stadion České Budějovice was founded by the merging two clubs in České Budějovice - Viktoria and Slovan. The club joined Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League, the nation's top ice hockey league, in 1936. In their first season, they finished third behind LTC Praha and AC Sparta Praha. Lone championship & decades of failure In the 1950–51 season, the club, now called SKP České Budějovice, won its first and only championship in any top-tier league. The club has failed to finish higher than third place (1952–53) in the highest league ever since. After a disastrous 1962–63 season in which the team won none of the 32 games, the club was relegated to the Czechoslovak Second League until 1968. Overall, HC České Budějovice had been relegated to the second-tier league five other times since the 1958-59 season ; in each case the club re-earned promotion to the top league the following season. Although it lost in the semifinals of the 2007–08 Czech Extraliga season, HC České Budějovice qualified for the 2008–09 Champions Hockey League as the winner of the regular season. However, its success was short-lived, as it finished eleventh and survived a relegation round the following season. War of the Beers Following the 2012–13 season, the Czech Extraliga reached a sponsorship deal with Radegast to sell its beer in all Extraliga arenas. This agreement conflicted with the deal České Budějovice already had with Budweiser Budvar Brewery for their arena. Under the agreement, the club and the city of České Budějovice would face stiff penalties for selling any beer other than Radegast products. Unable to resolve the dispute, the club decided on June 18, 2013 that no new agreement could be reached between the parties involved and voted to immediately relocate to Hradec Králové for the 2013-14 season. In July 2013, plans were unveiled to resume professional hockey in České Budějovice, with a club playing in the Czech First National League.

It is also known as the Boston Municipal Protective Services Department (BMPS). Before the establishment of that agency, there was the Boston Municipal Police (Munis, \\"Ghostbusters\\"or BMP). The primary responsibility of the agency is to enforce all laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and ordinances of the City of Boston on and within all properties owned and operated by the City of Boston. It is an agency of Boston's Property & Construction Management Department. History The formal founding date of the Boston Municipal Police is 1979. The department was created so the former Public Facilities Department (now known as Property Management) could have a fully functional police force to respond to alarms in schools and other City buildings when the City was experiencing many problems due to the busing situation. The department at its origin consisted of unarmed officers; over time, the department consisted of both unarmed (site officers) and armed officers (patrol and superior officers). Boston Municipal Police was dissolved on January 1, 2007, at 12:00 a.m.For municipal police, it's the end of the line - The Boston Globe On the same day, it was replaced by the \\"Boston Municipal Protective Services.\\" It is currently an unarmed security force. Jurisdiction The Municipal police patrol officers had jurisdiction citywide and were sworn Special Police Officers under Boston Police Department Rule 400A with full police powers. Now as the Boston Municipal Protective Service, the officers are limited to patrolling specific \\"sites\\" located throughout the City, but still hold full police powers and are licensed as Special Police Officers despite being unarmed. Their authority is derived from the Boston Police Commissioner. The main agencies and departments serviced by BMPS include the following city owned assets: *Boston Police Department property *Boston Redevelopment Authority property *Community Schools property and employees *Community Centers property and employees *Economic Development and Industrial Corporation (EDIC) property and employees *Inspectional Services Department property and employees *Library Department property and employees *Property Management and Construction property and employees *Neighborhood Development property and employees *Boston Public Schools Central Administration Building *The City of Boston Cemeteries *The City's Parks and Recreation facilities and employees *The Boston Transportation Department property and employees Merger In mid-2006, Mayor Thomas M. Menino organized a forced merger of the Boston Police and the Boston Municipal police (which was really not a \\"merger\\" in the true sense of the word; the so- called \\"merger\\" was actually an opportunity granted to the Boston Municipal patrol officers to apply to the Boston Police Department as lateral transfers, although employment was not a guarantee). This prompted protest from the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association. The Boston Municipal Police unlike members of the BPPA were not Civil Service Officers. None of the Officers of the BMP had to pass a civil service exam to get hired on the BMP like members of the BPPA have for the BPD. BMP Officers were politically connected positions. They by-passed thousands on the Massachusetts Civil Service Exam hiring list for the City of Boston including Veterans and Minorities. BMP Officers did not attend the full six month Boston Police Academy that BPPA members have. Unlike BPPA members, who have passed a Civil Service Exam to get hired, BMP Officers were allowed to back door the process via the courts to become civil service Officers. Despite the BPPA's objections, the Munis who passed a vigorous background check, medical & psychological exam, as well as a physical agility test were transferred to the Boston Police Department December 31, 2006. There were only 33 who were transferred to the BPD. On January 1, 2007, the rest of the Munis were either laid off or allowed to reapply to the City's Municipal Protective Services Department as site officers.

The school is the first long-term alternative school in the Pinellas County School District and is a member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. History In 1997, Pinellas County School Board members committed to building an alternative high school. Locating the campus on property already owned by the School Board near 58 St N and 150 Ave N, in Clearwater, was proposed, but residents complained about having the at-risk students in their neighborhood. The School Board purchased the current site for $2,400,000 after voters approved a referendum in November, 2002, and work began during Fall, 2003. The school opened in the Fall semester of 2004. Campus Bayside High School is located on of land at 14405 49 St N, in Clearwater, FL, across the street from the Pinellas County Jail. The school building houses a reception area with nearly high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. Visual and performing arts studios are also located there. The school utilizes 65 surveillance cameras. Students As of 2005-06, Bayside High School enrolled 376 students while the school can enroll approximately 500 students. Students apply and are accepted into Bayside High School because they have been truant at their previous school, they are too old for their grade level, or they are unlikely to graduate. Curriculum Bayside High School schedules four classes per day; many other high schools in Pinellas County have seven. The maximum class size is 22 students but has been known to exceed 30 students for certain classes needed for graduation, such as mathematics. Bayside offers the a standard 18 credit diploma, which allows students to earn a state certified diploma and attend a college or trade school. Recently (2019), Bayside High School has begun adding a trades certification option for students to graduate with a diploma and a certification in a trade. School accountability The Florida Department of Education assigned the grade A to Bayside High School for the 2004-2005 school year, the grade A for the 2005-2006 school year, and the grade A' for the 2006-2007 school year.

The subject matter of elder law arises from careful legal analysis of the concerns of elders and their caregivers as to planning for foreseeable circumstances (e.g., property or capacity) and dealing with harmful situations (e.g., abuse or neglect). Elders in Massachusetts See generally Elder law (United States), Elders in the United States The concerns of elders and the concerns of their caregivers typically coincide—quality of life, quality of care, wellbeing of the primary caregiver (ordinarily a spouse or family member), and wellbeing of loved ones, including pets. Elders often find it unavoidable to address these problems: (a) to maximize financing for expensive long-term care versus leaving an inheritance for loved ones; and (b) to wisely select fiduciaries to act on their behalf in case of physical or mental incapacity. Such problems present significant emotional, financial, and legal challenges. Elder Law in Massachusetts Massachusetts elder law draws on both federal and State law for its legal content. The Massachusetts Medicaid program has been renamed MassHealth. Other distinctive features include * the absence of legislation recognizing living wills substituting reliance upon health care proxies instead * a well-developed mental health law * a well-developed case law of trusts based on a traditional \\"prudent man\\" standard for investments rather than a list of fixed classes of statutory investment vehicles as required elsewhere. The Massachusetts law of trusts serves as the paradigm, although certain changes have been made in states which have adopted the Uniform Probate Code (which Massachusetts has not as of 2006). The famous Rogers decision requiring court-appointed monitors for ordered antipsychotic medications by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was subsequently approved and followed by the United States Supreme Court. Massachusetts is the only state whose judges are permanently appointed as in the federal courts, which has resulted in a bench largely free of political pressure and of greater longevity and experience than in any other state. Elder Law Attorneys Attorneys who specialize in assisting elders and their caregivers to appraise and execute their options in such matters are generally known as elder law attorneys. See generally Elder law (U.S.), Elder Law Attorneys See generally Elder law (U.S.), Assessing Professional Competence * The Massachusetts chapter is the largest and most active State NAELA chapter in the country. Its members meet monthly except during the Summer for continuing legal education and discussions of current legal issues of concern in Massachusetts. Planning for Foreseeable Circumstances Health and long- term care See also Health law Declining health, mobility, and mental capacity are important yet often unpredictable facts of life for many elders. Experience teaches that the maintaining of caregiver wellbeing through respite and support programs is one of the best and least expensive ways to maintain the wellbeing of a dependent elder. Adequate health insurance after reaching the age of 65 is available at reasonable rates under the Medicare program to everyone who qualifies for Social Security benefits. Coverage was increased in 2006, but many elders nonetheless choose to carry supplemental health insurance to fill in the gaps (hence the name Medigap insurance). However, Medicare excludes coverage for skilled nursing facilities except up to 100 days arising from hospitalization after 90 days away from hospital or nursing home. Funding for long-term care may come from the patient, long-term care insurance, or Medicaid benefits when the patient qualifies. In 1998, a randomly selected 65-year-old was said to have a 45% chance of requiring long- term care, the average length of stay being 6 years. [cite?] Obviously, in some circumstances, such as chronic illness or family susceptibility, a future need for long-term care becomes a probability verging to a certainty. A top concern for most elders is continuing to live at home for as long as possible. It is widely believed more would remain at home if health aides and visiting nurses were covered as an intermediate step towards full skilled nursing. Medicaid is often described as possessing an \\"institutional bias\\" in favor of nursing homes over in-home care. Recent public and private studies suggest substantial cost savings could accrue from a revision of Medicaid policy. [cite?] Costs drive change, so new options should be watched for. Nursing home choices depend primarily on the medical needs. Some need intermediate care facilities and others need skilled nursing facilities (SNF's). Medicaid ordinarily covers SNF's only. An alternative placement of particular interest to couples only one of whom requires long-term care is the continuing care community, also known under several cognate names. The couple may start in an apartment, one enter the SNF, the other a smaller apartment, and so on. Although they tend to be expensive, they have worked very well for some. Assistance with LTC facility selection may be provided by a gerontologist or visiting nurse, often a case manager for an elder law attorney. Changing from one facility to another after admission is not impossible but poses difficulties that may be avoided at least for a time. In some locales, legal assistance may be advisable for nursing home admission agreement negotiations. Many protections for the elder can be agreed upon. Medicaid Planning (MassHealth) * Eligibility Applicants must demonstrate both a health need and a financial need for MassHealth (Medicaid). Health need may be shown by a resident in a skilled nursing facility simply by submitting a certificate from the facility, whereas in other cases documentary proof may be required. Financial need must be shown by submitting a form financial statement with supporting documentation that demonstrates full compliance with MassHealth regulations, an exercise comparable to preparing, filing, and prosecuting a bankruptcy petition or an offer in compromise with the IRS. In general, financial eligibility depends on a showing of countable assets less than a certain threshold ($2,000 in 2006). There are income requirements as well. Some assets are always countable, such as cash. Other assets are countable only at certain times, such as the marital home, not countable while occupied by the applicant's spouse or disabled child, countable otherwise. MassHealth may record a lien on the home for security. Probate estates are subject to claim for repayment to MassHealth, and probate requires notice to MassHealth.

Beach Road is a road located within the planning areas of Kallang, Rochor and the Downtown Core in Singapore. The road starts at its junction with Crawford Street in Kallang in the north, runs in a generally southerly direction, enters the Downtown Core at its junction with Ophir Road, and ends at its junction with Stamford Road and St. Andrew's Road to the south. As its name implies, Beach Road used to run along Singapore's southern coast, before land reclamation took place in the Kallang Basin area. Etymology and history The Concourse, by Beach Road Beach Road is one of the early roads developed in Singapore and appears in George Drumgoole Coleman's 1836 Map of Singapore. The road was actually a coastal road fronting the sea coast in the early decades of the British colonial city – hence its name. The Chinese used to call the road thih pa sat khau, meaning \\"the street to which the iron market opens or faces\\", a reference to Clyde Terrace Market, which was taken over and run as a public market by the Municipal Commissioners in 1910. Clyde Terrace Market, also known as Beach Road market, had its foundation stone laid on 29 March 1873, with Masonic honours. Costing $37,889, the building was completed in 1874. It was demolished in 1983 to make way for The Gateway twin office towers, designed by architect, I.M. Pei, which stand now on this site. Beach Road was also known as sio poh kai ki in Hokkien, which means \\"small town seashore\\". Sio poh is \\"small town\\", referring to that part of Singapore to the north of the Stamford Canal Road, as opposed to tua poh or \\"big town\\", the Singapore River end of the town. Beach Road was known as kadalkarai sadakku or \\"seaside road\\" in Tamil. Raffles Hotel on Beach Road Up till the 1870s and 1880s, the sea came right up to Beach Road. At the time, large seaside villas stood here – just as Stamford Raffles had envisaged when he laid out his 1822 Town Plan. Raffles reserved Beach Road for the residences of the European merchants. By 1825, there were 20 such buildings. These luxurious homes earned the street its Chinese name ji chap keng or \\"Twenty House Street\\". In 1886, one of these 20 houses, owned by W.R. George, was bought over by the Sarkies brothers and later became the Raffles Hotel. By the 1880s, these houses were turned into hostels or eating places to cater to the increasing flow of travellers and Beach Road ceased to be a prestigious residential district. Apart from houses, there were hotels, clubs and bars well. The Singapore Cricket Club had its roots here. The area was also the scene of frequent brawls, as in the days before Tanjong Pagar became the port area, European sailors on shore leave would make for Beach Road. Brawls and other unruly behaviour were the reason why Mrs Balestier, the first American consul's wife, presented the historic Revere Bell to Saint Andrew's Church in 1843. The bell was intended not only for church service but also to be struck in the afternoon to warn seamen to return to their ships before darkness fell. A sandy beach once existed in front of Raffles Hotel on the Beach Road side, and may account for the few steps which today lead to the lobby, as apparently it was common for the water to come up and over Beach Road at high tide, before the land now in front of Beach Road was reclaimed. The first land reclamation beyond the foreshore line of 1843 alongside Beach Road was to provide land to build the Alhambra and Marlborough Cinemas, a police station and the Singapore Volunteer Corps Headquarters and Drill Hall (later converted to the Singapore Infantry Regiment Headquarters). Further land reclamation began around the 1880s, gradually robbing Beach Road of its sea frontage. Over the years, Nicoll Highway and later Marina Square and Suntec City were built on reclaimed land, pushing Beach Road even further inland. Landmarks The Concourse The prominent landmarks located along Beach Road include (from north to south): *South Beach Residences, Mixed Development with Grade A offices, hotel and residential component *DUO, a contemporary twin-tower integrated development comprising residences, offices, a 5-star hotel and retail gallery *Golden Mile Complex and Golden Mile Tower *Destination Singapore Beach Road *Golden Mile Food Centre *Masjid Hajjah Fatimah *Saint John Headquarters *The Concourse *Parkroyal on Beach Road *The Plaza *The Gateway *Shaw Tower *Old Beach Road Police Station *South Beach *Raffles Hotel *Civilian War Memorial and War Memorial Park *Raffles City with Swissôtel The Stamford and Fairmont Singapore Les Garçons Singapore References * *Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), Toponymics – A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern University Press, *National Heritage Board (2002), Singapore's 100 Historic Places, Archipelago Press, Category:Roads in Singapore Category:Kallang Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Category:Rochor ","title":"Beach Road, Singapore"},{"id":"6883469","text":"Random chimeragenesis on transient templates (RACHITT) is a method to perform molecular mutagenesis at a high recombination rate.

Cooplands produces takeaway food chiefly for the lunch-time trade, specialising in sandwiches, pasties, desserts, cakes, and bread. It competes with other local cafés and takeaway outlets, and national and international high street food chains and franchises. By 2011, it had expanded to become the third largest bakery chain in the UK. In 2011 the company's annual turnover was £23 million. Cooplands of Doncaster is a completely separate bakery chain and is not connected to Cooplands (Coopland & Son (Scarborough) Ltd) in any way. The similar company name and business model led to much confusion in the past (see below). History Cooplands was founded as a single shop in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in 1885, and was incorporated in 1949. In 1999, the company opened ten new stores, and expanded production at its Scarborough-based bakery with the creation of 80 new jobs. A further expansion was announced in June 2007 when it acquired the Hull-based bakery, Skeltons. The purchase added 34 outlets to the Cooplands chain. In 2005, Cooplands was noted as being an \\"established NVQ training centre\\", and received a National Training Award for staff training. The same year it held a \\"Careers in the Bakery Industry\\" event, with career advisors discussing employment opportunities. In April 2011, Woodhead Bakery, a rival Scarborough-based chain, fell into administration. Of the 29 Woodhead outlets, Cooplands bought 18, and the rest were purchased by the Haldane Retail Group. In 2017, Cooplands received £8.5 m investment from BGF to accelerate the rollout of its shops across the north of England. Cooplands Doncaster The Doncaster-based Cooplands chain is in no way affiliated with Coopland & Son (Scarborough) Ltd. Coopland (Doncaster) Ltd. It has outlets across South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, North Nottinghamshire and parts of Lincolnshire. It is a Private Limited Company, incorporated in 1933, with a 2011 turnover of £18.6 million. In February 2015 Cooplands Doncaster announced it had gone into administration and would close 39 stores and its head office and bakery in Doncaster. However, on the same day, the business and certain assets of Alison's Coffee Shops, including 29 retail units were acquired by a new company, Cooplands Retail Ltd. The 150 employees of TACS (Alisons Coffee Shops) have been retained by Cooplands Retail Ltd and the business continues to trade as Cooplands from the 29 outlets throughout Yorkshire.

Festival history The festival was started in honor of the ancient can-do spirit of the people of Jämtland and to show the rest of Sweden that although this region is sparsely populated, its people have the zest, courage and knowledge to create a festival of international size and standard. A goal which they have reached by gathering around 55,000 visitors every year, and it being the second-biggest festival in Sweden (the biggest city festival in Sweden). The festival is held in the middle of Östersund the last weekend of July. Although the event starts the weekend before with the opening of Krogstråket, when regional bars and restaurants gather near the lake. Jämtland is a self- proclaimed republic (started by the people behind the festival) and has its own president, Ewert Ljusberg, who at precisely midnight on Saturday appears in front of 25,000 people at the town square to deliver his annual speech on the topic of freedom, humanity and solidarity, though the speech usually contains some anti-Swedish government and anti-EU propaganda as well. The president's entrances are usually quite spectacular. In 1996 he rode in on a seven-ton elephant, in 1999 he entered in a huge air balloon that landed at a house roof on the square, and in 2000 he surfed over the crowd to the stage. After his speech the crowd sings the Jamtlandic anthem: \\"Så tåga vi tillsammans bort\\" or as it is known in Jamtlandic: \\"Mæ går på stigom å leit oss opp\\". Though the Swedish (and original) version of the song is the one that's usually sung. The Jamtland Republic Until 1178 the province of Jamtland was an independent, self-governing region, before Norwegian authorities seized control. After the conquest Jamtland still remained semi- autonomous and had the same status within Norway as the possessions overseas until the very late 15th century. Not until 1645 and after several wars and regional conflicts was it ceded to Sweden by Denmark-Norway. However, through these periods, and today, the people of Jämtland have claimed a strong independence from the southern parts of Sweden and taken deep pride in their own culture, cuisine, and dialects.

It is the method of calculating capacity for the storage, handling, transporting and invoicing of goods. Vehicles and storage units have both volume and weight capacity limits and can easily become full in terms of volume before they reach their capacity in weight. By dimensioning for capacity needs, companies and warehouses can make optimal use of space in order to minimize costs in order to maximize profits.  Background  In 1985, the Norwegian company Cargoscan, which officially became part of the Mettler Toledo group in 2000, began supplying dimensioners and data capture products to transport and logistics companies around the world. The aim was to provide the industry with a system for revenue recovery and protection. It seemed that if carriers were to take both weight and volume into consideration when invoicing, they could charge customers more fairly according to services provided and make better use of resources. Cargoscan - facts about the producer  In transport and logistics  Shipping costs have historically been calculated based on weight alone. By charging only by weight, lightweight, low-density packages become unprofitable for freight carriers due to the amount of space they take up in trucks, aircraft, and ships in proportion to their actual weight. By using dimensioning technology to calculate an item's dimensional weight, carriers are able to charge based on either volume or weight, depending on which is greater. In the warehousing industry, dimensioning is used to provide an overview of the volume items in stock which can reduce the costs of materials, return handling, shipping and manpower. It can also be used to determine capacity limits for storage to determine if additional storage requirements are needed at some point. The main reasons that companies choose to invest in automated dimensioning systems include reduced operational costs, revenue recovery, increased throughput, reduced returns and quality control. \\\\- Why dimensioning? Dimensioning systems are used not only by the biggest companies in the industry such as DHL Express, United Parcel Service, FedEx and TNT but also by postal companies, shipping retailers, and small handling companies around the world  References  Category:Freight transport ","title":"Dimensioning"},{"id":"6883567","text":"(born 7 January 1972) is a Japanese former ski jumper.

In this letter, ETS hinted that New Oriental used their past exam questions in teaching without authorization. In January, 2001, New Oriental was sued by the ETS for illegally copying, publishing, and selling its testing questions for examinations for non-English-speaking students since 1997. On September 27, 2003, the First Intermediate People's Court of Beijing made a ruling during the first trial, ordering the Chinese school to pay over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) to the ETS in compensation for the infringement. The Higher People's Court of Beijing maintained that the Beijing-based New Oriental School (NOS) should pay compensation to the ETS, for the infringement of copy and trademark rights. However, the higher court reduced the sum of compensation by over 6 million yuan (about 722,000 US dollars) to 3,740,186.2 yuan (about 450,624 US dollars) plus 22,000 yuan (about 2,650 US dollars) for court charges.G.H.

Housed in the Galleria degli Uffizi, in Florence, Italy, Fortitude was the first recorded masterpiece by Botticelli. This work originally belonged to a set of seven panels representing Virtues, intended to decorate the Tribunal Hall of Piazza della Signoria in Florence. The other six panels are painted by Pietro Pollaiolo's workshop. Unlike the other panels in the cycle, painted on cypress wood, the Fortitude is painted on poplar, a more commonly used wood for painting on panels in Tuscany.\\"Fortitude,\\" Le Gallerie degli Uffizi The 1.67 x 0.87-meter painting was produced with tempera paint on a wood panel. Tempera paint consists in mixing the dry powdered colors with yolk of egg, slightly thinned with acetic acid or water, instead of mixing the colors with oil or varnish as in the case of oil painting.Fry, “Tempera Painting,” 175. The colors thus mixed are usually laid on a priming of gesso, though other grounds may be used.Fry, “Tempera Painting,” 175. The woman represented in Fortitude could be Lucrezia Donati. Composition Upon first glance, the eye is pulled to the most illuminated point of the painting: the face of Fortitude. Her gaze is turned down and away from the observer and because of this, her expression is perceived as passive and uninterested. This was a characteristic feature of Botticelli's female figures.\\"Fortitude,\\" Le Gallerie degli Uffizi. It is a fascinating contrast to the theme of the title because if she represents strength, why does she express otherwise? This work, which is one of seven virtues, was intended to be placed high upon a wall. This would be higher than the eye level of the viewer, therefore requiring them to look upward. In the line-up of all seven paintings of the virtues, Fortitude is the first. Perhaps her gaze is intended to literally and figuratively watch over the other virtues as well as the viewers. Without strength, one can never fathom taking on the other six virtues. The most striking color in the work is obviously Fortitude's red robe, which is so elegantly draped off one shoulder and laid across her lap. Tempera paint is incapable of producing the hard and cutting edges that occur in oil painting, and this because of a very remarkable property, namely, the comparative transparency of even opaque colors when mixed with yolk of egg.Fry, “Tempera Painting,” 175. Thus, in some cases, one may find a robe painted in the following manner.Fry, “Tempera Painting,” 175. The color red, most associated with the extremes of emotion; passionate love, anger, rage, and violence can be symbolic of the strength that we must have when overcoming hardship. The contrast of the soft, flowing folds in her clothing to the harshness in her metallic armor creates an interesting play on themes of masculinity versus femininity. She appears to be regal and delicate while also maintaining vigor and bravery. Strength is not a quality subjective to sex. The linear perspective of the painting also adds to the regal impression of Fortitude. Having her centered, pushed forward to the picture plane, and sharply lit focuses the viewer solely on the virtue she represents. In early Italy, Fortuna was the name of the goddess who controlled the destiny of every human being.Monaghan, The Book of Goddesses and Heroines, 110. Fortuna was originally “she who brings,” the goddess who permitted the fertilization of humans, animals, and plants; thus was she worshiped by women desiring pregnancy, and the gardeners seeking bumper crops.Monaghan, The Book of Goddesses and Heroines, 110. Though Fortitude's overall complexion is virtually perfect, there is one element of her face that conveys some sort of hardship. This is the discoloration that rests under her eyes. This slight bluish tint transmits a message to the observer that Fortitude has seen misfortune. It adds an element of humanism that is relatable to any passerby that sets their gaze upon this Botticelli piece. Meaning To a fifteenth- century audience, the Seven Heavenly Virtues represented a combination of philosophical and religious influences. According to Pseudo-Dionysius, an early Christian writer, the Virtues are \\"bestowers of grace and valor,\\" represent the \\"out-pouring of divine energy,\\" and are \\"possessed of unshakable virility.”Davidson, \\"The Celestial Virtues,\\" 156. During the Renaissance, allegory was used towards the Christian doctrine of salvation. This resulted in a broader application of philosophical systems and social wonders.“Allegory,” Grove Art Online. Botticelli was an admirer of both influences. His works abound with sophisticated reflections of his knowledge and deep appreciation of literature including – besides Dante – the Bible, Livy, Ovid, St. Augustine, Boccaccio, Alberti, and Poliziano.Stapleford, “Vasari and Botticelli,” 400. In Renaissance art and culture, personifications that had taken on unclassical appearances during the Middle Ages were restored to classical forms – such as the idealization of the human figure – but also retained some aspects of medieval imagery. “Allegory,” Grove Art Online. The medieval use of differentiated virtues (virtutes) was replaced by that of Virtue in general (with a recollection of the antique virtus), personified first by Hercules, later (c.1510) as a female figure sitting or standing on a rectangular block to emphasize her stability.“Allegory,” Grove Art Online. This exact personification can be seen in Botticelli's Fortitude Virtue. Even while sitting, Fortitude has a slight contrapposto in her positioning. Her upper body weight is leaning on one arm while she also has one foot slightly shifted forward than the other. This posture creates a forward-moving energy that seems as if she will rise up from her throne and join the observer viewing her. Botticelli's Virtue also stands out for the different type of marble bench, with its richer engraved decorations.“Fortitude,” Le Gallerie degli Uffizi. History The cycle was for the Tribunal Hall of Piazza della Signoria in Florence.\\"Fortitude,\\" Le Gallerie degli Uffizi. The Tribunale di Mercanzia was the body that decided on the business disputes between Florentine merchants and administered justice among the guilds, known as Arts.\\"Fortitude,\\" Le Gallerie degli Uffizi. Later, these panels would be moved to the Uffizi, when the wealth and heritage of the Renaissance judiciary were absorbed by the Chamber of Commerce in 1777. At the time of their commission in the fifteenth century, the Mercanzia was of prime importance in Florence's economic life. This made the commission extremely prestigious, and the job was sought by many painters. Pollaiolo's understandable protests to Botticelli's involvement, contributed to limiting Botticelli's participation in the commission to this single figure.\\"Fortitude,\\" Le Gallerie degli Uffizi. Botticelli could count on the help of Tommaso Soderini, one of the Mercanzia commissioners, and because of his intrusion, the painters’ guild amended their statutes to protect its members from other outside interference.Lugli, “Metamorphic Heads: A Footnote on Botticelli's and Pollaiuolo's Mercanzia Virtues,” 28. Soderini was one of the most prominent members historically of an influential Florentine patrician family and was elected as gonfalonier for life in 1502.

This dhahir changed the legal system in parts of Morocco where Amazigh languages were primarily spoken, while the legal system in the rest of the country remained the way it had been before the French invasion. Sultan Muhammad V signed the dahir under no duress, though he was only 20 years old at the time. The new legal system in Amazigh communities would ostensibly be based on local Amazigh laws and customs rather than the authority of the sultan and Islamic Sharia, and it would written in French. The French colonial authorities sought to facilitate their takeover of the Berber tribes' property while maintaining a legal cover. The Berber Dahir reinforced a dichotomy in popular Moroccan historiography: the division of the country into Bled el-Makhzen—areas under the direct control of the Sultan and the Makhzen, or the state, (especially urban areas such as Fes and Rabat)—and Bled es-Siba—typically geographically isolated areas beyond the direct control of the state, where Amazigh languages are primarily spoken and where Islamic Sharia was not applied. However, this legislation explicitly characterized the former as \\"Arab\\" and the latter as \\"Berber.\\" The Berber Dahir gave birth to the Moroccan nationalist movement. Protests broke out in Salé, Rabat, Fes, and Tangier, and international figures such as Shakib Arslan took it as evidence of an attempt to \\"de-Islamize\\" Morocco.  September 11, 1914  A first formulation appeared under the influence of a group of specialists of Berbers of High Atlas and Middle Atlas, such as Maurice Le Glay (civil Controller and author of Récits de la plaine et des monts, les sentiers de la guerre et de l'amour, la mort du Rougui etc.), a core of professors hostile to Islam and in collaboration with bishop of Rabat. The purpose of this dahir was the recognition \\"Berber Justice,\\" and their independence from Islamic law. The Berbers followed their own set of laws, and had been allowed to operate independently for centuries. This dahir recognized that independence, and formalized the French policy in Morocco under the governance of the Resident-General Lyautey who signed the dahir of September 11, 1914. The fundamental characteristic of this policy consisted in preserving the traditional autonomy of Berbers, primarily in the legal field, by disassociating them from the Islamic legislation or \\"Chrâa\\", and by maintaining their common law known as or \\"Azref\\". The Resident General had sultan Yusef sign the Dahir or legislative text, Dahir of September 11, 1914 which gave it the force of law. The net result was that some Berber tribes were separated from the Islamic law, and made many Berber courts subject to French jurisdiction.  May 16, 1930  The Dahir of May 16, 1930,Dahir of May 16, 1930 performed a similar function to the order of September 11, 1914. There were certain clarifications under this new dahir which met with some resistance. In particular, Article 6 clarified that criminal trials were subject to French courts. Nationalist reaction Before arriving at the sultan, the text drafted by France was translated into Arabic. The translator, Abdellatif Sbihi, alerted nationalists from Salé. They saw it as an attempt to \\"divide Moroccan people\\", especially Article 6. On Friday, June 20, 1930, Imam Ali Haj Awad presided at the Great Mosque of Salé and read the \\"Latif.\\" Robert Rezette in his book The Political Parties of Morocco wrote: the campaign against the Berber Dahir began with the recitation of \\"Latif\\" in the mosques of Sale. The Latif was a simple prayer chanted during times of calamity. At the noon service, the largest service of the week, the imam incorporated it into his sermon. On July 4, the Latif was recited under the leadership of Mohamed Lyazid, and July 5 at the mosque in Fez Quaraouiyine through Al Alam Chahbi Qorchi. It then spread to other major cities. The text of the Latif read \\"For our Berber brothers who are deprived of Muslim law and who can no longer live under the law and customs of their ancestors.\\" The goal of the nationalist movement's response to the Berber Dahir was to incite unrest against the French. The Berbers had traditionally been semi-independent, following their own set of laws and customs. However, the nationalist movement saw this dahir as an attempt to Christianize the Berbers. This was unacceptable in the largely Islamic nation of Morocco. Sultan's reaction Sultan Muhammad V The Resident-General needed to quickly suppress resistance to the dahir. He exerted pressure on Sultan Muhammad V, who issued a statement on August 11, 1930. This coincided with the celebrations of the prophet's birthday, and the Sultan's statement was read in all the mosques of the country. The Sultan denounced the nationalist movement's tactics in no uncertain terms (namely, their use of mosques as the source of their propaganda). The Sultan re-iterated his commitment to the Berber tribes, and in an attempt to combat the Latif offered an Islamic judge to any Berber tribes who wished to submit to Islamic law. Petition against Dahir This statement was not enough to stop the islamist nationalists as on August 28, 1930, one hundred nationalists gathered in the house of Ahmed bin Haj Mohamed Lahrech in Salé where Mufti Boubker Zniber wrote the \\"Petition Against the Berber Dahir\\" to be sent to Grand Vizier al-Muqri by a delegation from Salé. Moroccan activists mobilized to alert the international and Arab press ; then Shakib Arslan made a brief stop in Morocco to inform and educate the nationalists.  April 8, 1934  In 1934, another Dahir was issued, titled \\"Dahir regulating the functioning of justice in the tribes of Berber customs\\". This ministerial decree of April 8, 1934, returned the criminal courts of the Berber's to their own control, effectively undoing Article 6 of the Berber Dahir. Reflections on the Berber Dahir  Peaceful demonstrations spread in some parts of the country through the appeal to the \\"latif,\\" and relayed by the Petition of August 28, 1930. These constituted the first organized nationalist backlash against the occupation and led to the withdrawal of France's Berber Dahir. This important historical episode strengthened the nationalist movement and was the beginning of the independence movement. It led to a new petition on January 11, 1944, called the \\"Manifesto of Independence\\". Further reading * Katherine E.

Its earliest inhabitants were Amerindians, followed by Europeans who brought slavery to exploit commercial interests. Early history Ancient relics date the island's first settlers, probably Ciboney Indians (a subgroup of Arawaks), back to 3,500 years ago. Then another group of Arawaks migrated from South America's Orinoco basin around 800 A.D. Because of St. Martin's salt-pans they called it \\"Soualiga,\\" or \\"Land of Salt.\\" Mainly a farming and fishing society, the Arawaks lived in villages of straw-roofed buildings which were strong enough to resist hurricanes. Their tranquil civilization valued artistic and spiritual pursuits. Their lives were turned upside-down, however, with the descent of the Carib Indians from the same region they had come from. A warrior nation, the Caribs killed the Arawak men and enslaved the women. When Europeans began to explore the Caribbean, Carib society had almost completely displaced the Arawaks. Colonial Era In 1493, on Christopher Columbus second voyages to the West Indies, upon first sighting the island he named it Isla de San Martín after Saint Martin of Tours because it was November 11, St. Martin Day. However, though he claimed it as a Spanish territory, Columbus never landed there, and Spain made the settlement of the island a low priority. The French and Dutch, on the other hand, both coveted the island. While the French wanted to colonize the islands between Trinidad and Bermuda, the Dutch found San Martín a convenient halfway point between their colonies in New Amsterdam (present day New York) and Brazil. With few people inhabiting the island, the Dutch easily founded a settlement there in 1631, erecting Fort Amsterdam as protection from invaders. Jan Claeszen Van Campen became its first governor, and soon thereafter the Dutch West India Company began their salt mining operations. French and British settlements sprang up on the island as well. Taking note of these successful colonies and wanting to maintain their control of the salt trade, the Spanish now found St. Martin much more appealing. The Eighty Years' War which had been raging between Spain and the Netherlands provided further incentive to attack. Spanish forces captured Saint Martin from the Dutch in 1633, seizing control and driving most or all of the colonists off the island. At Point Blanche, they built Old Spanish Fort to secure the territory. Although the Dutch retaliated in several attempts to win back St. Martin, they failed. Fifteen years after the Spanish conquered the island, the Eighty Years' War ended. Since they no longer needed a base in the Caribbean and St. Martin barely turned a profit, the Spanish lost their inclination to continue defending it. In 1648, they deserted the island. With St. Martin free again, both the Dutch and the French jumped at the chance to re-establish their settlements. Dutch colonists came from St. Eustatius, while the French came from St. Kitts. After some initial conflict, both sides realized that neither would yield easily. Preferring to avoid an all-out war, they signed the Treaty of Concordia in 1648, which divided the island in two. The treaty was signed by the two governors of the island, Robert de Longvilliers for France and Martin Thomas for the States General of the Netherlands. The French would keep the area they occupied and the coast facing Anguilla, while the Dutch would have the area of the fort and the land around it on the south coast. The inhabitants would share the natural resources of the island. A legend grew up around the division of the island. According to legend, in order to decide on their territorial boundaries, the two sides held a contest. It began with a Frenchman drinking wine and a Dutchman drinking jenever (Dutch gin). When both had sufficiently imbibed, they embarked from Oysterpond on the island's east coast. The Frenchman headed off along the coast to the north, while the Dutchman followed the coast south; wherever the two groups met was where they would draw the dividing line from Oysterpond. But as the Dutchman met a woman and stopped to sleep off the effects of the gin, the Frenchman was able to cover more distance, but apparently also cheated as he cut through the northeastern part of the island, and therefore ended up with more land. Though oft-repeated, the story is not historically accurate. During the treaty's negotiation, the French had a fleet of naval ships off shore, which they used as a threat to bargain more land for themselves. In spite of the treaty, relations between the two sides were not always cordial. Between 1648 and 1816, conflicts changed the border sixteen times. In the end, the French came out ahead with to the of the Dutch side. In 1651, the Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique sold the French part of the island to the Order of Saint John which was sovereign over Malta, at the time a vassal state of the Kingdom of Sicily. The Order's rule lasted for fourteen years, and in 1665 it was sold back to the French West India Company along with the Order's other possessions in the Caribbean. Although the Spanish had been the first to import slaves to the island, their numbers had been few. But with the new cultivation of cotton, tobacco, and sugar, mass numbers of slaves were imported to work on the plantations. The slave population quickly grew larger than that of the land owners. Subjected to cruel treatment, slaves staged rebellions, and their overwhelming numbers made them impossible to ignore. In 1848, the French abolished slavery in their colonies including the French side of St. Martin. Slaves on the Dutch side of the island protested and threatened to flee to the French side to seek asylum. The local Dutch authorities relented and emancipated the colonies' slaves. While this decree was respected locally, it was not until 1863 when the Dutch abolished slavery in all of their island colonies that the slaves became legally free. 20th century and beyond After abolition of slavery, plantation culture declined and the island's economy suffered. In 1939, St. Martin received a major boost when it was declared a duty-free port. The Dutch began focusing on tourism in the 1950s. It took the French another twenty years to start developing their tourism industry. Currently, tourism provides the backbone of the economy for both sides of the island.St. Maarten: Bits of history\\". St. Maarten Tourism Office. On September 5, 1995, Hurricane Luis severely pounded the islands causing numerous damages 35 years to the day after Hurricane Donna. In 1994, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls, which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called \\"risk flights\\". After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands, and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007. Though the treaty is now in force, its provisions are not yet implemented as the working group specified in the treaty is not yet installed. On September 6, 2017, Hurricane Irma, a Category 5+ storm with sustained winds of over 180 MPH, devastated the island, leaving severe damage. The Netherlands and France created different funds to restore the economy of the island. The Netherlands made available a fund of over 550 million euros which was managed by a recovery planning bureau also known are the NRPB.

It became the island's official centre in 1827.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 274, Zagreb (1999), The Town of Supetar includes Supetar itself and the three villages: Splitska, Škrip and Mirca. With a population of 3,213, it is the island's largest town. It is accessible by ferry (Jadrolinija, the ferry ride from the mainland city of Split takes 45 minutes) or via Brač Airport which is located 30 kilometres to the southeast. History Church of Saint Peter in Supetar Old Supetar was situated on the small peninsula where there is now a graveyard. The settlement came to an end during the early Christian era. In the late Middle Ages a new settlement started around the bay known as St. Peter's, from which the town derives its name. It originated from Sv. Petar during the Latin population of the town. \\"Sv\\" stands for \\"Sveti\\", meaning saint, therefore it takes its name from Saint Peter, which is the name's English equivalent translation. The present settlement of Supetar was founded in the 16th century when people living in Nerežišća, about inland, began to use it as their harbour. The town's main period of development occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries when Supetar took over from Nerežišća as the administrative centre of the island of Brač.Jane Foster, Footprint Croatia, pg. 237, Footprint Handbooks (2004), The town The Parish church of St. Peter (Sveti Petar) stands on the side of an old chapel which was restored in 1773 in a Baroque architectural style. At that time it also received a new aisle and bell tower. It was extended in 1887. In the church there are paintings by the local artist Feliks Tironi from the second half of the 18th century and a Baroque altarpiece by an unknown Venetian artist of the 18th century. In the old part of the church there are some gravestones with Croatian inscriptions and at the entrance to the church there is a font made of two large Gothic capitals. On the left of the church building there is a sundial and beneath it a sarcophagus with the date 1774 engraved. In the Sunday school classrooms there are paintings from the Venetian era (16th and 17th centuries). The well, decorated with reliefs, is the work of Johannes Mazzonius from 1734. Supetar graveyard beside the Chapel St. Nicholas (Sveti Nikola Putnik) there are two old Christian sarcophagi and several gravestones (Pieta), which are the work of Ivan Rendić of Supetar (1849–1932), and the mausoleum of the Petrinović family with portraits and sculptures, by the sculptor Toma Rosandić (1878–1958).

Life and career  Berbié was born Jeanne Bergougne, in Villefranche-de-Lauragais, Haute-Garonne, France, and as a child was entered in various local singing competitions, winning a case of champagne at one in Canet-Plage for her rendition of airs of Escamillo and Basilio. She studied piano and voice at the Music Conservatory in Toulouse. On French television she appeared on 'L'Ecole des vedettes' where she was praised by Elvira Popescu. She made her professional operatic debut at the Capitole de Toulouse in 1954, as Nicklause in Les contes d'Hoffmann. She sang throughout France in the standard mezzo roles of the French repertory, such as Siébel in Faust, Urbain in Les Huguenots, the title role in Mignon and Carmen, etc. She made her debut at the Paris Opéra in 1959, as Concepción in L'Heure espagnole, and the same year at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, as the sorceress in Dido and Aeneas. Other roles included several in L'Enfant et les Sortilèges (under Maazel in 1961 and Ozawa in 1979 at the Opéra de Paris), Gontran in Une éducation manquée (1965), Roméo et Juliette, Ascanio in Benvenuto Cellini, and many opérettes.

She sang Maffio Orsini at Carnegie Hall in New York, in the famous 1965 concert version of Lucrezia Borgia, opposite Montserrat Caballé as Lucrezia, and countryman Alain Vanzo as Gennaro. Berbié was especially appreciated in Mozart roles, such as Cherubino in Nozze di Figaro, Zerlina in Don Giovanni, both Dorabella and Despina in Cosi fan tutte. She also won considerable acclaim in Rossini roles, singing Isabella in L'Italiana in Algeri, Rosina in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Angelina in La Cenerentola, and Malcolm in La Donna del Lago. However, she was happy to play ensemble roles as well, such as a flower maiden in Parsifal or a Rhine maiden, citing the musical value of participating in these and the demands of the smallest part. Berbié was also active as a teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1983, where her pupils included Sophie Koch, and continued to sing actively into the 1990s. Her recordings include works such as La Dame Blanche (under Soustrot), L'Enfrance Du Christ (Martinon), Benvenuto Cellini (Davis), L'Heure Espagnole (Maazel), Fra Diavolo (Soustrot), Così fan tutte (Solti), Le Nozze di Figaro (von Karajan) and Carmen (Prêtre, Solti).

It is found widely along coastlines in the Indo-Pacific, preferring reefs, sandy flats, and seagrass beds from very shallow water to a depth of . With a cylindrical body and a broad, flattened head, the tawny nurse shark is quite similar in appearance to the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) of the Atlantic and East Pacific, from which it can be distinguished by its pointed- tipped dorsal fins and narrow, sickle-shaped pectoral fins. The maximum recorded length of the tawny nurse shark is . Nocturnal in habits, the tawny nurse shark tends to spend the day resting in piles of two dozen or more individuals inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos. Compared to the nurse shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid disposition and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and is known for its habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated. Taxonomy and phylogeny Early illustration of a tawny nurse shark from Fauna of British India (1889). The tawny nurse shark was first described by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson as Scyllium ferrugineum, based on a long specimen from New Guinea. His short account was published in 1831 in Voyage au tour du monde, sur la corvette La Coquille. A more detailed description, along with an illustration, was published by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1837 as Nebrius concolor, based on a specimen from the Red Sea. Both names were retained, often in separate genera (Ginglymostoma and Nebrius respectively), until they were synonymized by Leonard Compagno in 1984. Compagno recognized that the tooth shape differences used to separate these species were the result of differences in age, with N. concolor representing younger individuals. The genus name Nebrius is derived from the Greek word nebris or nebridos, meaning the skin of a fawn. The specific epithet ferrugineus is Latin for \\"rust- colored\\".Bester, C. Biological Profiles: Tawny Nurse Shark. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on June 7, 2009. Other common names for this species include giant sleepy shark, Madame X (a name coined by the shark fisherman Norman Caldwell in the 1930s for the then- unidentified Australian specimens), nurse shark, rusty catshark, rusty shark, sleepy shark, spitting shark, and tawny shark. Based on morphological similarities, Nebrius is believed to be the sister genus of Ginglymostoma, with both being placed in a clade that also contains the short-tail nurse shark (Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum), the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum). Distribution and habitat The tawny nurse shark is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa northward to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and India, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Chagos Archipelago, the Seychelles, and the Maldives. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan and the coast of China to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to as far south as the northern coast of Australia. In the central Pacific, it has been reported from off New Caledonia, Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the Pirabas Formation of northern Brazil, dating back to the Lower Miocene (23-16 Ma). The presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the tawny nurse shark once extended to the tropical Atlantic Ocean, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. An inshore species, the tawny nurse shark inhabits continental and insular shelves over sandy flats or beds of seagrass, as well as along the outer edges of coral or rocky reefs. This shark may be found from the surf zone, often in water barely deep enough to cover its body, to a maximum depth of on coral reefs; it is most common at a depth of . Young sharks are generally found in the shallow areas of lagoons, while adults may be encountered across a variety of habitats. Description The sickle-shaped pectoral fins of the tawny nurse shark are one of its characteristic traits. The tawny nurse shark grows to a maximum length of . It has a robust, cylindrical body with a broadly rounded and flattened head. The eyes are small and face laterally, with prominent ridges over them and smaller spiracles behind. There are a pair of long, slender barbels in front of the nostrils. The mouth is small, with the lower lip divided into three lobes. There are 29-33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 26-28 tooth rows in the lower jaw, arranged in an imbricate (overlapping) pattern with the outermost 2-4 functional rows separated from the rest by a narrow space. Each tooth resembles a fan, with a broad base rising to a small, sharp central point flanked by 3 or more smaller cusps on both sides. As the shark ages, the teeth become relatively taller and thicker. The fourth and fifth pairs of gill slits are placed much closer together than the others. The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, with the first dorsal fin larger than the second. The pectoral fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with the origin of the pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising about a quarter of the total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 4-5 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids. Many tawny nurse sharks found off the coasts of Japan, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands lack a second dorsal fin. This physical abnormality has been speculated to result from pregnant females being exposed to water of unusually high salinity and/or temperature, possibly from human activity. In 1986, a long adult male with both a missing dorsal fin and partial albinism (in the form of white body color with gray-brown eyes) was captured off Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. This anomalous individual is the largest albino shark known to date, having survived for a long time in the wild despite its lack of camouflage. Biology and ecology Tawny nurse sharks often rest piled together during the day. With a more streamlined form than other nurse sharks, the tawny nurse shark is believed to be a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day. The tawny nurse shark has few natural predators; attacks on this species have been reported from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related nurse shark has been known to fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine. Feeding The tawny nurse shark may be one of the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, crustaceans (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting tawny nurse sharks swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth. Life history Mating in the tawny nurse shark is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one functional ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non- viable egg capsules, which has led to erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The tawny nurse shark is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Various authors have reported the length at birth anywhere from , with the discrepancy possibly reflecting geographic variation. Although females release up to four fertilized eggs into each uterus, the very large size of the newborns suggest that the litter size may be as few as one or two. In one examined female that had two embryos sharing a single uterus, one embryo was much smaller and thinner than the other, implying that competition may eliminate the additional siblings. Males attain sexual maturity at a length of , and females at a length of . Human interactions The tawny nurse shark is prized by recreational anglers off Queensland. Encounters with tawny nurse sharks underwater indicate a more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers are able to approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed. An Australian woman was bitten while hand feeding them in 2018. The tawny nurse shark is taken by commercial fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver is a source of oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the tawny nurse shark is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable worldwide, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit the ability of over-exploited populations to recover. Furthermore, this shark's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices (e.g. poisons and explosives, especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines), and human harassment. Localized declines or extirpations of the tawny nurse shark have been documented off India and Thailand. Off Australia, this species has been assessed as of Least Concern, as there it is not targeted by fisheries.

The band was scheduled to play for the Queen of England in London's 2012 New Year's Parade, but was unable to do so due to economic issues. The band has captured many USSBA and MAC titles including the 2005 New England and National Group 5 Open title with their show \\"Dimensions of Time\\" taken from an original composition by John Meehan. They won the New England and National Championship for group 5 Open with their show \\"Snapshots\\". In 2007 the band received 3rd place at Championships in Group 5 Open with their show \\"Frida\\". In 2008 although the band was a Group 4 Open size, they were allowed to compete in 5 Open that year with their show \\"C2 Code\\" capturing second place at USSBA Championships. In 2009 the band went undefeated in 3 Open with their show \\"Bugging Out\\" and won the 3 Open Northern States championship. The current band director is John L. Kuhner.

Carver says his model is the only systematic theory of boards. He is an adjunct professor of nonprofit organizations in the Institute for Nonprofit Organizations at the University of Georgia School of Social Work.MNPO Handbook Development of model Early in his career, Carver searched for a reliable guide to managing the work of a board. His research turned up little on the proper role of the board of directors. Carver noticed that board members often wonder what the board's job is and where the line lies that distinguishes the board's job from that of the chief executive officer. Carver's model clarifies the separation by having the board explicitly state the board's and CEO's jobs in a set of written policies (hence the name Policy Governance). This set of policies is divided into four types. One is the organization's goals (or Ends), and three are about the means the board and CEO employ to attain those ends. It is a common misunderstanding that in Policy Governance the board's job is to decide the goals and the chief executive officer's job to determine the means to achieve the board's ends. Both board and CEO decide goals (Ends) and means, but the board's written policies explicitly state where the CEO's room for interpretation of the boards' Ends statements begins. Carver developed the Policy Governance model and registered its trademark. He permits others to employ the term but he stops any efforts to redefine the term or to ignore its methods and systems. Each application of the Policy Governance model is specific to the organization being governed. The Policy Governance model has universal meaning, and can be adopted in very different company settings, profit and nonprofit, although complex local legislation can make it difficult to recognize the underlying logic of the model. In every true application of Policy Governance, the board represents the ownership of the organization as it defines the good that the organization is to provide for the recipients and at what cost. Ownership and recipients can be the same group of people (as is the case with most associations), but more often they are different groups. Dr. John Carver and his wife, Miriam Carver, have trained several hundred consultants at his Policy Governance Academy. Works Carver has written several books, including Boards That Make a Difference, probably the best known of his works. His book Reinventing Your Board, published in a new edition in 2006, is probably the easiest for a beginner to understand. It contains model board policies that can be modified to fit a range of organizations.

Plot Jenny Greenley is a high school junior who lives in the small town of Clayton, Indiana. She is secretly the school newspaper's advice columnist Ask Annie, a job she got a new life due to her ability to keep others' secrets and help people with their problems- something she been doing her entire life. Teen film star and heartthrob Luke Striker is making a movie about high school, but having grown up on television, he knows nothing about real teens and their lifestyles. When he decides to go undercover at Clayton High School to research his role, the principal assigns Luke as Jen's responsibility; she is expected to show him around the school, help him integrate, and most importantly, keep his true identity secret from her fellow students. During his time at Clayton, Luke is appalled by the vicious hierarchy of high school and tells Jen that she should start taking a stand for the people who can't speak for themselves, rather than just consoling them and letting it happen again and again. After Luke's true identity is revealed at a school car wash, Jen realizes that she has the power to do so, and starts making serious changes in the lives of others and herself as well, morphing from \\"nice little Jenny Greenley, everybody's best friend\\" to Jen, effector of social change. She quits show choir, foils the \\"cruel\\" senior prank, and befriends unpopular outcast Cara. When she confronts her best friend Trina about her poor treatment of her boyfriend, Trina begins to get angry. Compounded by the discovery that Jen is going to the school's annual Spring Fling with Luke (who asked her as an apology for the trouble he caused), she is furious, and refuses to talk to her for several days. However, despite the newfound media exposure surrounding Clayton, Jen's feelings for Luke remain platonic. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Scott, a fellow junior and editor of the school newspaper. Trina eventually realizes that she has overreacted, and makes up with Jen. At the Spring Fling, after Luke and Jen are crowned king and queen, Luke reveals that he is going out with Geri Lynn- a senior and friend of Jen's- and also tells Jen that he knows she is Annie, much to her surprise. He encourages Jen to follow her own advice and confess her true feelings for Scott, who is Geri's ex. Jen, Trina, and several classmates leave the dance and head over to a friend's anti-Spring Fling party where Scott is. Nervously, Jen agrees to take a walk with him, during which, after a heated discussion, he reveals that the only reason he has not told Jen about his true feelings sooner is because he thought she was in love with Luke. Scott and Jen finally admit their feelings for one another and share a kiss. The novel ends with Luke and Geri together in LA, and Scott and Jen in a relationship as well. Jen, aided by Trina and Cara, is running for student body president next year, but half-jokingly notes that she \\"might be aiming a little too low. I'm thinking, a girl with my people skills? Well... why not the White House?\\" Characters Jenny \\"Jen\\" Greenley is a high school junior who is well liked by everyone, and tries to smooth things over all the time. She may be good at solving others' problems, but still needs help with solving her own. She also writes \\"Ask Annie\\", the school newspaper's advice column. In the story, it notes that Jen, including Scott, like \\"geeky\\" books. She eventually becomes Scott's girlfriend at an anti-spring fling party. Scott Bennett is the editor of the school newspaper and a friend of Jenny's who moved away in fifth grade, but returned last summer. Jenny mentions that he is a great cook, and he shares her passion for science fiction. He starts the novel in a relationship with Geri Lynn, but eventually becomes Jenny's boyfriend. Luke Striker (alias Lucas Smith) is a hugely famous teen star who comes to Jenny's Indiana high school to research a role for his next film, while hiding his identity. He soon learns how vicious high school can be, and is the one who encourages Jenny to shake things up. He goes to the Spring Fling with her, but is later revealed to be in a relationship with Geri Lynn. Catrina Larssen is Jen's best friend. A drama queen in all respects of the word, Catrina does not answer to her birth name and prefers to be called 'Trina' by her peers. She is a superfan of Luke, which makes it harder for Jenny to keep his secret. She hints throughout the book that Jen and Scott are made for each other, a theory which turns out to be correct. She is also Steve's girlfriend. Geri Lynn Packard is the only other senior girl on the paper, Scott's ex-girlfriend, and later Luke's new girlfriend. She is passionate about journalism and the rights of the media, and goes on to attend UCLA. Strangely, she only likes to drink flat soda. Steve McKnight is Trina's boyfriend. He is madly in love with Trina and will do pretty much anything for her, including auditioning for school plays. He breaks up with her because of her obsession with Luke and her constantly taking advantage of him, but they later make up. Cara Schlosberg is a tragically envious girl who wants nothing more than to be a member of the popular group at Clayton High. Often called 'Cara Cow' because of her slight obesity and the many \\"moo's\\" she gets when she walks by in the cafeteria, she is later reformed by Jen and eventually loses all desire to be popular. She also becomes Kwang's girlfriend. Betty-Ann Mulvaney is a doll owned by Jen's Latin teacher, Mrs. Mulvaney. She is stolen by popular jock Kurt Schraeder, who swipes her from Mrs. Mulvaney's desk as the senior prank. Throughout the book, Jen makes several attempts to retrieve the doll, but doesn't succeed until she and Scott coerce Kurt's little sister Vicky into giving them the doll with a threat of blackmail.

History  A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the Brighton Main Line in South London, showing surrounding lines, including the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway. The branch line had a chequered history, linked to the Crystal Palace's own precarious financial position, with two periods of closure. Wartime economies led to the line closing from 1917 to 1919. After this first closure, trains from Holborn Viaduct railway station in the City were not reinstated. However, the branch was electrified, as part of a Southern Railway scheme, on 12 July 1925. After electrification all trains operated to Blackfriars and Holborn Viaduct. Following the destruction of the Crystal Palace by fire in 1936, the line lost most of its original function of carrying visitors to events in the Palace. Manpower shortages led to a second closure from 1944 to 1946. When services were reintroduced they were very lightly used, and the line finally closed on 20 September 1954. The track was lifted in 1956. Lordship Lane station was the subject of one of Camille Pissarro's small-scale pictures. Although much of the route of the railway has now been lost to residential development, it can be traced in places. Architectural features remain such as the ornamental portal of the Paxton Tunnel just north of the terminus. Part of the route adjacent to the Horniman Museum and Gardens is now a 'Railway Nature Trail', maintained for the museum by the Trust for Urban Ecology. The section between Cox's Walk footbridge and northern entrance to the Crescent Wood tunnel is managed by the London Wildlife Trust as the Sydenham Hill Wood nature reserve. Two tunnel entrances remain at Hillcrest Wood and are known hibernation roosts for the Brown long- eared bat.http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online- record.php?ID=LEW023 In the early 1990s, a local amenity group, Friends of the Great North Wood, produced a walking leaflet entitled From the Nun's Head to the Screaming Alice describing a route that closely follows the line. ('Screaming Alice' was Cockney rhyming slang for Crystal Palace.) The walk continues from the site of Crystal Palace High Level past the Crystal Palace Museum to the remaining Crystal Palace railway station (formerly Crystal Palace Low Level).  Stations  The line served the following stations: * Nunhead * Honor Oak (closed) * Lordship Lane (closed) * Upper Sydenham (closed) * Crystal Palace High Level (closed) Crystal Palace High Level was in competition with Crystal Palace Low Level station for passenger traffic to the Crystal Palace.

It can be used in the concerto, symphony or solo sonata. It's a multi-movement structure. In Music Theory In the field of music theory, the term Sonata Cycle refers to the layout of a multi-movement work where the movements are recognizably in the forms of the tradition of classical music. It differs from the term cyclic form in that there is no unifying motive or theme used in all the movements. The standard sonata cycle has four movements, broken down as follows: First Movement The first movement is, by definition, written in sonata form, in a fast tempo (allegro), and in the home key of the overall piece. This movement can also be called the sonata-allegro. Second Movement The second movement is usually written in a slow tempo, in another key, and in one of a variety of forms such as theme and variations, compound ternary form, rondo, or sonata. Third Movement The third movement usually follows a dance- like form, such as Minuet [or Scherzo] and Trio form. It is commonly written in the home key. Fourth Movement The fourth movement is written in the home key, and may use rondo, sonata, or theme and variations form, among others. For more detail see Sonata. In Performance/Recording In reference to performance or recording, Sonata Cycle almost always means the complete traversal of a set of works by a single composer. For example, a \\"Beethoven sonata cycle\\" would refer to a performer playing all of Beethoven's piano sonatas.

It is located near the Teatro alla Scala, on Via Manzoni 12. The museum was originated in the 19th century as a private collection of Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli (1822–1879) and his mother, Rosa Trivulzio, of the family of the condottiero Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. Many of the rooms in the palace were redecorated starting in 1846, a commissions entrusted to Luigi Scrosati and Giuseppe Bertini. Individual rooms were often decorated and furnished to match the paintings hung on the walls. The architect Simone Cantoni (1736–1818) rebuilt the palazzo in its present Neoclassical style with an English-style interior garden. In 1850–1853, Poldi Pezzoli commissioned the architect Giuseppe Balzaretto to refurbish his apartment.Museum website. Pezzoli in his testament left the house and contents to the Brera Academy. Giuseppe Bertini, director of the Academy, opened the museum on 25 April 1881. During World War II, the palazzo suffered severe damage, but the artworks had been placed in safe storage.

A library consortium is any local, regional, or national cooperative association of libraries that provides for the systematic and effective coordination of the resources of school, public, academic, and special libraries and information centers, for improving services to the clientele of such libraries.See: U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Sect. 54.500. (October 2011) Consortia conduct their business to advance research and learning, share risk, provide easy access to information, provide high- quality content (electronic resources), enable continuous professional development, strengthen library leadership as education and information providers, and to shape the future. All library consortia, anywhere in the world, may be part of the ICOLC. There are no membership fees or barriers to participation. The ICOLC gathers its strength from sharing information and strategies about the benefits that its members bring to libraries and their users. These benefits can include: * Cost reduction through group purchasing; * Greater ability to advocate for library needs; * Improving expertise through professional development programs for library staff; * Encouraging resource sharing (content, technology, expertise, and funding); * Creating opportunities for joint advocacy, marketing, and fundraising for libraries; and * Undertaking special initiatives for the group, such as digitization, technology implementation, information sharing, or creation of a union catalog.

That is, consortial groups range from informal with no central office, a rotating leadership, and volunteer service; the most formal may be legally incorporated, have an organized office in a larger government agency or NGO, with large permanent staff. Consortia may adjust and change over time: a hallmark of cooperative work. Consortia can come in many different shapes and sizes—comprising dozens even to hundreds of libraries down to groups of a handful. Some have broad programs that bring libraries together, while many are mainly brought together to license electronic resources for common use. Consortia not only vary in size, but they are also very diverse. Consortia vary in terms of mission, scope, funding sources, total funding, staffing, and more. ICOLC's member consortia may be confined to specific library types (e.g., special libraries, academic libraries, public libraries) or government agencies, or can comprise multi-type libraries, which may be regional or cover broad regions, nation, or more. Many libraries belong to more than one, to achieve different purposes. ICOLC Operations The ICOLC serves participating organizations by facilitating discussion among consortia on issues of common interest. It conducts meetings that rotate in locations around the world. The closed session/invitational meetings happen twice a year (North American venue in spring; European venue in fall) to keep consortia informed about new e-resources, pricing practices of information providers and vendors, and other issues of importance to directors, governing boards, and library members. During these meetings, ICOLC may meet with selected information providers, to discuss their offerings and to engage in dialog about issues of mutual concern. But the primary purpose of the meetings is information exchange and discussion across the consortia. In particular, the ICOLC has distinguished itself with important public statements about key common issues, meant for wide distribution in order to advance discussion with partners, suppliers, and publishers—and to communicate expertise. Of special significance and impact have been the 2004 ICOLC Statement of Current Perspective and its widely disseminated and discussed successor statements of January 2009See: and June 2010 . These received wide play in the media and were the topics of a great deal of conversation throughout the consortial and scholarly communications industries. Proposals for statements ICOLC may issue come from within the ICOLC membership (in meetings, via e-mail); they gather support from members and take shape when a small working group is assigned to draft a statement. All ICOLC members are invited to review the drafts online and suggest changes, with iterated revision by a stated deadline. After there is a consensus via endorsements, the Statement is posted on the ICOLC web site and disseminated through a variety of media. All library consortia anywhere in the world are welcome to participate in the activities of ICOLC and identify themselves as participating consortia. Interested consortia, as they so choose, submit profiles for the ICOLC web site, join a common e-mail list, send representatives to meetings, participate in the meeting programs, and avail themselves of the common expertise of the organization. History Library cooperation in the United States has been around for more than a century, and a number of useful writings exist, documenting this type of cooperative activity and history.Perry, Katherine, \\"Where are library consortia going? Results of a 2009 survey,\\" Serials: http://uksg.metapress.com/content/ujht042258673441/fulltext.html. See also: Weber, D C, \\"A Century of Cooperative Programs among Academic Libraries,\\" College & Research Libraries, May 1976, 38(206), 205–221; and Alexander, A W, \\"Toward ‘The Perfection of Work:' Library Consortia in the Digital Age,\\" Journal of Library Administration, 1999, 28(2), 1–14. For example, since the 1930s, intentional, cooperative sharing of collections was pursued among the \\"Triangle\\" Universities in North Carolina (Duke University, North Carolina State University, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill).See: Shared cataloging through OCLC and RLG brought libraries together in the 1960s and 1970s, while the 1980s saw movement to fast delivery for books and articles.RLG's founding history, through its merger with OCLC, is available at: http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership/history.html. A significant new impetus, however, came in the mid-1990s with the large-scale licensing of electronic resources, launched by publishers such as Encyclopædia Britannica and Academic Press. Explosive growth followed and with it awareness of a need for coordinating the work of consortia themselves. The ICOLC began in 1996; by 2000 the then-Web site (hosted at Yale University Library [since migrated to a Lyrasis host]) recorded 135 member groups; and by fall 2011, 236 had contributed their profiles. In 2000, 2/3 member consortia were located in the US; by 2012, North American consortia represented only 60%, with member consortia from 44 other countries.Perry, Katherine, \\"VIVA’s Approach to Library Collection and Access Issues,\\" presented at the Society for Scholarly Publishing, Baltimore, Md, June 1, 2000, and Perry, Katherine, \\"Why Library Consortia matter; The VIVA Experience,\\" presented at The Congress of Academic Library Directors of Maryland Annual Meeting, April 27, 2012. In summer 2012, the ICOLC web site moved to its current location and members were asked to revise and re-contribute descriptions to the site.See: . As of the end of April 2013, 150 (from 43 countries) had done so. ICOLC's organization is entirely informal. It is not a legal organization, there are no dues, there are no elected officials, there are no bylaws, or other rules of engagement. Committees are established as necessary; there is some continuity in the meeting planning committees (both in North America and in Europe), and other task forces are established ad hoc to address specific statements or issues before the group. While the ICOLC leadership is entirely voluntary there are consortia and consortial staff that provide ongoing, continuous and long standing planning, support, and leadership. The ICOLC leadership is organic and evolutionary from within the community. Consortia – Contemporary Activities Consortia pursue many cooperative topics and host many projects, for example: resource sharing and inter-library lending; rationalizing and sharing print collections; building shared integrated library management systems; training; digitization programs; and advocacy, to name some. Electronic resources licensing is one of today's high visibility consortial foci. Many factors motivate consortial licensing. For some, government support and funding for electronic access for students, citizens and researchers is a strong driver—often for groups of institutions as large as an entire nation's collection of libraries. In all cases, negotiating with multiple institutions at once can save publishers and information providers and libraries time and money. Also, significant benefits arise when a group working together discusses and analyzes terms of use that are found in provider licenses, where the goal on all sides is to maximize access while ensuring a financially stable publishing model. The ICOLC actively supports and facilitates consortial content licensing, along with emerging possibilities for cross- consortial and cross-country arrangements.

The painting was originally kept in Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence. It is now in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli of Milan. The painting is one of two versions of The Lamentation by Botticelli. The other, circa 1492, is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.  Description  The painting depicts the lamentation (expression of great sorrow or deep sadness) http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lamentation over Christ's death. The Virgin Mary sits vertically with the dead Christ on her lap, his body appearing extremely small. The positioning of the two bodies creates the Pieta, which means pity in Italian and is a representation of The Virgin Mary mourning dead Christ. The Three Maries are circling the inner group expressing despair. Mary Magdalen is positioned at the feet of Christ in turmoil. St.John sits above The Virgin Mary and cradles her head in an attempt to soothe her. Joseph of Arimathea stands above the group holding the crown of thorns and three nails. Botticelli paints the figures in contorted and distorted poses. He does not apply the rules of naturalism to the painting. Instead, he focuses on his own personal preference of geometry. This very style of geometry had an influence on third generation renaissance painters to come.  About the Artist  Sandro Botticelli was a second generation renaissance painter born Allesandro di Mariano Filipepi in 1445. His nickname was Botticelli meaning little barrel.http://www.all-art.org/early_renaissance/botticelli1.html The renaissance began in fourteenth century Italy. Dramatic changes in art, architecture, and sculpture took place during this time. Botticelli has been noted as one of the most powerful painters of the lyrical current. In his later works, Botticelli developed a more personal style, particularly in his religious themed art. He is believed to have been influenced by Girolamo Savonarola. His range of work included religious pieces, mythical themes, portraits, alter pieces and Madonna (art). Additional famous works by Botticelli include Birth of Venus (Botticelli), Primavera (painting) and The Mystical Nativity.

On that basis, a constitution was drafted and agreed together with two further Treaties of Alliance and Guarantee in Zürich on 11 February 1959. Cyprus was accordingly proclaimed an independent state on 16 August 1960. After the failure of the Agreement in 1963 and the de facto military partition of Cyprus into Greek- Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot regions, the larger Greek-Cypriot Region, controlled by the Cypriot government, claims that the 1960 Constitution basically remains in force, but the Turkish-Cypriot region claims to have seceded by the Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983.  Constitutional provisions  The constitution, provided for under the agreements, divided the Cypriot people into two communities, based on ethnic origin. The President was to be a Greek-Cypriot, elected by the Greek-Cypriots, and the Vice-President a Turkish-Cypriot, elected by the Turkish-Cypriots. The Vice-President was granted the right of a final veto on laws passed by the House of Representatives and on decisions of the Council of Ministers, which was composed of ten ministers, three of whom were to be Turkish-Cypriots, nominated by the Vice-President. In the House of Representatives, Turkish Cypriots were elected separately by their own community. The House had no power to modify the basic articles of the Constitution in any respect, and any other modification required separate majorities of two thirds of both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot members. Any modification of the Electoral Law and the adoption of any law relating to municipalities or any fiscal laws required separate simple majorities of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot members of the House. It was thus impossible for only representatives of one community to pass such a bill.  Aftermath  The United Nations Mediator on Cyprus, Dr. Galo Plaza,para. 163 of Report to the U.N. Secretary-General in March 1965 described the 1960 Constitution created by the Zürich and London Agreements as \\"a constitutional oddity\\" and that difficulties in implementing the treaties signed on the basis of those agreements had begun almost immediately after independence.paragraph 129, ibid. Within three years, the functioning of the legislature started to fail, and, in 1963, when the fiscal laws under Article 78 of the constitution expired, the House of Representatives split along pure communal lines and failed to renew the income tax upon which public finances depended. In November 1963, the (Greek-Cypriot) President of the Republic, Archbishop Makarios III, suggested amendments to the Constitution \\"to resolve constitutional deadlocks\\". The Turkish-Cypriot leadership, following the Turkish government, called them were unacceptable. The Vice President publicly declared that the Republic of Cyprus had ceased to exist and, along with the three Turkish-Cypriot Ministers, the Turkish-Cypriot members of the House withdrew, as did Turkish-Cypriot civil servants. Makarios refused all suggestions that would have resulted in the partition of Cyprus, and negotiations over the problem have still failed to succeed. De facto, Cyprus has remained partitioned for over 50 years.  Treaties of Guarantee and of Alliance  Together with the Zürich and London Agreements, two other treaties were also agreed upon in Zürich. The Treaty of Guarantee was designed to preserve bi-communal consociationalism and independent state of the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus and the guarantor powers (the United Kingdom, Turkey and Greece) promised to prohibit the promotion of \\"either the union of the Republic of Cyprus with any other State, or the partition of the Island\\". Article Four of the Treaty of Guarantee provided, \\"In so far as common or concerted action may not prove possible, each of the three guaranteeing Powers reserves the right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs [i.e. bi-communal consociational state] created by the present Treaty\\".Treaty of Guarantee of Republic of Cyprus In July 1974, there was briefly a Greek-backed coup d'état in Cyprus. Turkey claimed under the Treaty of Guarantee to intervene militarily. The legality of the invasion depends on whether common or concerted action between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey had proved impossible and whether the outcome of the invasion safeguarded the bi-communal consociational, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. In 1983, Turkish Cypriots issued the Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but it has been recognised only by Turkey. The United Nations declared the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to be legally invalid and asked for its withdrawal. The UN Security Council has issued multiple resolutions that all states should refrain from recognising the protectorate of Turkey in Cyprus. Greece, Turkey and Cyprus also signed a Treaty of Alliance.

Another widely seen common name is serrets or serrettes. B. crassifolia) Byrsonima comprises over 135 species of trees, shrubs, and subshrubs found in the New World tropics and subtropics from southern Mexico, southeastern Florida, and the Caribbean to southeastern Brazil. The plants have entire leaves, yellow flowers, and fleshy, edible fruits called nance; B. crassifolia in particular is known by that name, as it is an underutilized crop of some commercial importance in Latin America. They are primarily pollinated by various oligolectic native bees (e.g., Centris, Epicharis, and Tetrapedia) that are specialized to collect floral oils, as the flowers do not offer the typical floral rewards. The fruits of serrette trees are important in the diets of certain wildlife, such as the golden conure (Guaruba guarouba), while the leaves of Byrsonima are food for some of the curious American moth-butterflies (Hedylidae). Plantings of B. crassifolia in the dry savannas of Oaxaca may even be suitable as substitute habitat for the Tehuantepec jackrabbit (Lepus flavigularis), an endangered species presently only found in three small relict populations.

It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the European herring gull (L. argentatus), but is now generally considered to be a separate species, although BirdLife International lumps it with the yellow-legged gull (L. michahellis). The Armenian gull is a fairly large gull species, though it is on average the smallest of the \\"herring gull\\" complex. It can range from , from across the wings, and weighs from . Among standard measurements, its wing chord is , its bill is and its tarsus is .Gulls of North America, Europe, and Asia by Klaus Malling Olsen & Hans Larsson. Princeton University Press (2004). . They are superficially similar to yellow- legged gulls but are slightly smaller with a slightly darker grey back and dark eyes. The area of black on the wingtips is more extensive with smaller white spots. The bill is short with a distinctive black band just before the tip. First-winter birds are mainly brown. They have a whitish rump, pale inner primary feathers, and a narrow, sharply-defined black band on the tail. Although their ranges do not overlap, with its darkish mantle, both black and red near the tip of its bill and a dark eye, the Armenian gull bears a remarkable resemblance to the California gull (L. californicus) of North America. The Armenian gull nests beside mountain lakes in Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, and western Iran. The largest colonies are at Lake Sevan and Lake Arpi in Armenia. It is a partial migrant, with many birds wintering on the coasts of Turkey, Lebanon, and Israel. Smaller numbers reach Cyprus, Egypt, and the Persian Gulf. The nest is a mound of vegetation built on the ground on an island or the lakeshore. Three eggs are laid, mainly in late April. The nesting colonies are very dense with nests close together and territorial conflicts are common.

The act is known as \\"kerb crawling\\" because the person will typically drive very slowly along the kerbside. Where prostitution is illegal, kerb crawlers are widely regarded as a public nuisance: they help keep street prostitutes in business in red-light districts and often solicit pedestrians who are not prostitutes for sex. As a result, kerb-crawling is illegal in many jurisdictions. Sting operations in which undercover police wait for kerb crawlers to proposition them are a common method for tackling kerb crawling. Kerb crawling is illegal in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Korea and India. Police may also collect licence-plate numbers of vehicles that appear to be kerb crawling and may contact their registered owners. Following the recommendations of the 1984 Criminal Law Revision Committee report Prostitution on the Street, the United Kingdom's Sexual Offences Act 1985 introduced an offence of kerb crawling to persistently solicit women for the purposes of prostitution. The Policing and Crime Act 2009 modified the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to redefine the offence and remove the requirement of \\"persistence\\". Offenders can be disqualified from driving and have their cars impounded. Kerb Crawler Rehabilitation Programmes (KCRP) have been introduced in some areas such as Leeds, however these programmes are criticised by some John schools A John school is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of prostitutes, who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a diversion program for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for soliciting the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation. Whether the John school is a diversion program or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within red light districts. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with prostitution, the sexually transmitted disease risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.\\"John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution\\" by Sharon Boddy, Peace and Environment News, November 1998.\\"School for Johns\\" by Aina Hunter, Village Voice, May 10, 2005.

It was founded in 1907 by Rev. Thomas B. Allworthy on behalf of the Church of England for the theological training of male students. The Hall was later licensed by the University of Manchester as an official hall of residence in 1954, extending the capacity of students from 70 to its current 130. The Hall remained an all- male institution until 2017 when female students were admitted for the first time. Prior to this, it was the last university-owned fraternal hall of residence in the UK. The Hall is formed of the Junior Common Room, made up of undergraduates, and the Senior Common Room, made up of the Tutors, the Warden, and university academics. Two former members of the Hall are Nobel Prize recipients. It was announced in August 2020 that the hall will be closed for the academic year 2020-2021. History Foundation The founder of St. Anselm Hall, Rev. Thomas B Allworthy St. Anselm Hall was founded by Rev. T.B. Allworthy as Saint Anselm’s Hostel in 1907. After the establishment of a theology department at Manchester University in 1903, Allworthy, with the encouragement of Edward Hudson of Rossall School, was prompted to consider the foundation of a place of residence for working-class men who were studying for holy orders.T.E.Lawrenson, Hall of Residence: St Anselm Hall In The University Of Manchester (The St Anselm Hall Association, Manchester, 2007, pg.3) The idea for the foundation was said to have occurred to Allworthy under a willow tree in Brookdale Park where he had been reading The Life of Saint Anselm with Hudson in the Summer of 1907.T.E.Lawrenson, Hall of Residence: St Anselm Hall In The University Of Manchester (The St Anselm Hall Association, Manchester, 2007, pg.4) An announcement was made in September 1907 of the opening of a hostel ‘for free training and preparation with maintenance, of candidates for Holy Orders’ at 105 Droylsden Road with places available for eight students. Allworthy served as the first Warden and St Anselm’s began to function as a place of theological study. As the Hostel grew, a new site at Kent House, the former home of physicist Arthur Schuster was secured for the students and Warden to move to in 1914 by Edmund Knox, Bishop of Manchester. This is where St. Anselm Hall remains. After its official re-opening on the 14th of November 1914, St. Anselm’s Hostel was renamed St. Anselm’s Hall (the apostrophe was finally removed in 1933). During the first decade at its new site at Kent House, the Hall merged with Gartness Hall, an institution associated with Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey which also provided accommodation for Anglican ordinands. 20th century to present St. Anselm Hall was funded by the Church of England’s Central Board of Finance until 1933 when the Hall became financially independent. The first half of the 20th century saw growing autonomy in the running of the Hall including the institution in 1922 of a formally-organised Junior Common Room committee. From 1928-1933 under the fifth Warden The Revd. Canon Duncan Armytage, later Canon of the Ninth Stall at Windsor Castle, St. Anselm Hall underwent a period of development including the institution of the Senior Common Room made up of academics from the University, the growth of the library, and establishment of a number of societies and events which still exist today. The Hall remained open during World War II and housed a number of men from the Armed Forces who were undertaking short training courses at the University.T.E.Lawrenson, Hall of Residence: St Anselm Hall In The University Of Manchester (The St Anselm Hall Association, Manchester, 2007, pg.41) Applications to the St. Anselm Hall fell immediately after the War and it was proposed that it should become an Anglican theological college. Instead of this, the decision was taken to transfer ownership to the university on the 1st of August 1956 under the eighth Warden The Revd. Canon Ronald Preston. Despite still maintaining strong links with the Church of England, this transferal was significant in reshaping the ethos of the Hall away from being a solely Anglican institution since the former statutory appointment of a cleric to the position of Warden was repealed. From 1956 onward Wardens have been both theologians and academics in other fields and the admissions process was broadened to accept residents from all academic fields. The still-functioning St. Anselm Hall Committee was from this point charged with the running of Hall. A major building project took place in 1961 which saw two new accommodation wings, Manor and Summerfield, being built next to Kent House and the 1927 Dewar Wing to form a quad, along with a dining hall and new chapel, all of which are still in use today. This expanded the Hall’s capacity to around 140 residents. A number of partnerships with nearby halls were formed in the latter half of the 20th century, namely with Ashburne Hall and St. Gabriel’s Hall which were both all-female institutions at the time. In 1992 a new self-catering hall Canterbury Court opened opposite St. Anselm Hall and the two halls have since maintained a close partnership. In 2016 decision was made to accept female students. By this point St. Anselm Hall was the last remaining all-male university-owned hall of residence in the United Kingdom. The first female residents arrived in September 2016 and almost half of the Hall’s residents are now female. Hall Grounds St Anselm Hall is situated on Kent Road East, and occupies the southern side of the road entirely with its buildings. These are the main building, the chapel, an onsite gym, and the Warden's lodge. The main building can, again, be subdivided into the dining hall, the on-site bar and the residential wings, each with individual names. Schuster (formerly known as Kent Hall) is the main part of the hall, and formerly the property of the exceptional mathematical physicist Arthur Schuster. As well as housing numerous students, it also contains the hall's own library and the Junior and Senior Common Rooms. The first extension to take place was the Dewar wing, named after the 4th Warden of the Hall Revd. Canon Dewar (1922-1927), which took place in 1927. Manor and Summerfield are the two newest wings, both being built as part of the extensions to the hall carried out by the university in the 1960s.T.E.Lawrenson, Hall of Residence: St Anselm Hall In The University Of Manchester (The St Anselm Hall Association, Manchester, 2007) The Chapel lies behind the Main building, and stands as a monument to the religious tradition at St Anselm Hall. Every year, one student is elected as a Sacristan in order to better integrate the Chaplaincy and the student body. The Warden's Lodge is a detached house in the hall grounds built for 8th Warden Revd. Canon Prof. Preston (1948-1963), though now it houses postgraduate students. Formal Hall The Dining Hall St Anselm Hall is one of the last remaining halls to partake in a formal dinner, otherwise known as Formal Hall, which takes place every weekday during term time. It is mandatory for all members of the hall to wear gowns to dinner, tutors and students alike. Proceedings start with all students entering the dining hall, after the doors have been opened by the catering staff. Once everyone is stood behind their seats, the JCR president makes any announcements and once completed, instructs the student closest to the entrance to bang the serving spoon, which is done three times. This signifies to the warden and tutors that they are to enter, which they do upon hearing this. They make their way to the top table, and the warden then gives the hall grace, and dinner may start. Upon finishing, the warden arises, at which point everyone else also stands, and leaves, thus signifying the end of dinner, meaning everyone may now leave. The usual hall grace given before formal hall is Benedictus benedicat (May the Blessed One give a blessing). After dinner the grace given is Benedicto benedicatur (Let praise be given to the Blessed One (if you believe Benedicto is dative); or Let a Blessing be given by the Blessed One (if you believe Benedicto is ablative)). After Christmas dinner Floreat Aula Sanctus Anselmi (May St. Anselm Hall flourish) is traditionally toasted, alongside \\"The Queen, the Duke of Lancaster\\". Cellar Club The Cellar Club is the onsite bar, and is the self-titled cheapest bar in Manchester. This is mostly due to the fact that the bar is one of the last student-run bars in Manchester, and the staff are residents within the hall who volunteer their time there. Originally located within the snooker room in the open Junior Common Room, it was relocated under the dining hall and expanded under Warden Smalley in the 1970s. The bar was renovated again in the 1990s to allow for a greater variety of socials. These socials are organised by an elected representative within the hall. The events range from bar crawls to in-house events. There is also a weekly pub quiz run by students. Wardens The Warden has responsibility over the welfare all of the residents in St Anselm Hall and is point of contact between students and the University.

As explained in the last book, \\"Sons of Destiny\\", the diary was supposedly transferred from Mr. Tall to the author. In the first book, Cirque Du Freak/Cirque Du Freak: A Living Nightmare, \\"Darren\\" says he used no real names in the books. These are just the names used by him in substitution of the real names of the key players in his life (he does this for their protection and in fear of being discovered for his true self). Darren became enamoured with Larten Crepsley's spider Madam Octa when he went to the Cirque du Freak, where he also learned vampires were real, Mr. Crepsley was one, and his best friend Steve Leonard wanted to become one. However, when Steve was bitten by Madam Octa, Darren was forced to seek the help of Mr. Crepsley, who agreed on the condition that Darren become his vampire assistant instead. Forced to leave his family, Darren died with his master's help, and joined Cirque du Freak. Many years later, he leaves for Vampire Mountain with his mentor, where he is forced to take part in the Trials of Initiation to prove his worth. He fails in the fourth trial, and decides to escape execution with help from his friend, pacifist and soon to be Prince Kurda Smahlt. As they flee, they come across a group of Vampaneze Kurda has smuggled into the mountain, intending to take it by force, in the hope his people would be spared from the rise of the Lord of the Vampaneze, who has finally appeared. Barely escaping alive, Darren is instrumental in foiling Kurda's plot, and made a Prince for his bravery. He learns after several years at war that he is one of three hunters with the power to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze before the vampires are eradicated. Near the beginning of the quest he is told by Lady Evanna that a Lord of the Shadows will rise at the end of the war between the two clans, and only his identity has yet to be determined - he will either be the Lord of the Vampaneze, or Darren himself. Several months later, the hunters are caught in an elaborate trap created by the Lord of the Vampaneze, resulting ultimately in Mr. Crepsley's death, and Darren learning that Steve Leonard is the Lord. The final confrontation comes two years later, with Darren killing Steve in their hometown. Here he and Steve learn that they were created and manipulated by Mr. Tiny their whole lives, so that the victor could throw the world into chaos. Defying his destiny, Darren drags himself and Steve into a river, where both drown and end up in the Lake of Souls. In the far future, Darren is reincarnated by Mr. Tiny as a Little Person like his friend Harkat, in a deal struck with Lady Evanna, who wishes to save Darren from a fate she does not believe he deserves. Darren is then sent back in time to the Cirque du Freak the night he went with Steve so that after the show, he scares off his past self when Steve is trying to make a deal with Larten Crepsley, so he never embarks on his dark path. Unbeknownst to Mr. Tiny, however, Evanna gives him one last weapon: the diary he has kept his whole life, updated to include his death and the extent of Mr. Tiny's evil. Darren gives his diary to Mr. Tall, instructing the latter to give it to his older, normal self, so that he will publish it as a fictional book (apparently the Darren Shan series itself) in hope one day the Vampire and Vampaneze clans would read it and uncover Des Tiny's scheme. In the end, Darren the boy gets to live a normal life, and the soul of the Vampire goes to Paradise. Darren is portrayed by Chris Massoglia in the 2009 movie adaptation. Larten Crepsley Larten Crepsley is the vampire that made Darren Shan his assistant after he saved Darren's friend, Steve (in exchange for Darren's pledge to become his assistant; there is a larger story attached to this, see Cirque Du Freak). He is over 6 ft tall with orange cropped hair (which was dyed when he was a child), is illiterate, and has one long scar running down his left cheek, but is shown with three in the movie. Evanna, a sorceress, caused the scar due to Larten's attempt at kissing her in his youth. He is suspected to be about 180–200 years old and was once a Vampire General. Larten abruptly resigned his position following his killing of his blood-brother Wester Flack, who had murdered a human Larten loved in order to drive the vampire clan into war with the vampaneze. While he remained highly respected within the clan, Larten chose to live a simple existence as a member of the Cirque du Freak, in self-imposed exile from the vampires until he came across Steve Leonard and Darren Shan. He was unknowingly influenced by Mr Tiny from afar into testing both children to become his assistants. He rejected Steve for his evil blood, but became interested in Darren when the boy stole his spider Madam Octa. Larten blackmailed Darren into becoming his half-vampire assistant when Steve was bitten by the spider, and helped Darren fake his death. He later acknowledged that his decision was a poor one, as he had deliberately isolated the child for no obvious purpose. Although Darren initially despised him, and Larten believed him to be far too human to be a good vampire, he was later touched by Darren's refusal to betray him to Murlough, even though it might have saved Evra Von's life. They remained constant companions for many years, so that by the time they embarked of the hunt for the Lord of the Vampanaze, their bond was that of a father and son. In the fourth book, Vampire Mountain, we discover that Larten was once Arra Sails' mate, and grieved deeply after she was killed in the sixth book, by one of the vampeneze that Kurda Smahlt helped sneak into Vampire Mountain. In Killers of the Dawn, Larten Crepsley was killed when he was pushed into a pit of stakes by Steve Leonard. He died believing he had killed the Lord of the Vampaneze, but in reality he had only killed an imposter; the real Lord was Steve himself. Larten is portrayed by John C. Reilly in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's assistant. Vancha March Previously known as Vancha Harst, Vancha was first blooded a Vampaneze with his brother, Gannen Harst. He was never able to stomach the killing that went with his blood and thus abandoned the Vampaneze. Some time later, having been unable to overcome his urges and resolving to commit suicide, he was found by Paris Skyle, who took the risk of turning him from a vampaneze into a vampire.(As Vampire blood is poisonous to Vampaneze and vice versa so they both could have died) After many years of training and serving as a General, he then became a Vampire Prince. His hair is dyed green and his skin is a dark shade of red, due to his constant battle with the sun (he thinks that the sun, like any other enemy of the creatures of the night, can be defeated). He adheres to the old ways of the Vampires, making his own clothes from animal hides and fashioning his throwing stars from metal and stones. He refuses to use close combat weapons in favour of his bare hands. He claims to be a lady's man, though Darren Shan perceives him as having very little success in this area, owing to his wild appearance, bad smell and very poor manners. (except perhaps with Truska, the bearded lady from the Cirque Du Freak). Prior to the outbreak of the War of the Scars, Vancha is absent from Vampire Mountain, in accordance with rules that one Prince should always be ready to assume control of the clan should Vampire Mountain fall into enemy hands. He serves on the frontline when the War begins, and is introduced as the last of the 3 hunters for the Vampaneze Lord, joining the band despite his personal disinterest in a war. He only fights to ensure the survival of his race, and is wary to the point of contempt of Desmond Tiny's meddling, even before Darren and Harkat discover the true extent of his power. He later comes to detest the Lord of the Vampaneze almost as much Darren, believing that the madman is defiling the code of honour the Vampaneze have followed for centuries. Following Mr Crepsley's death, Vancha pursues the Lord unsuccessfully for two years, before flitting to Darren's side when he is attacked by the Lord. He is wounded in the final confrontation by Gannen Harst, but survives his injuries, becoming the only hunter to live through the war. Lady Evanna chose to mate with him and Gannen Harst, thus having a baby from both a vampire and vampaneze to attempt to bring about lasting peace. Harkat Mulds/Lefty In the second book, Harkat Mulds was introduced as Lefty because he had a limp in his left leg. In Vampire Mountain, he reveals his real name, and the fact that he can speak. He went out of his way to protect Darren. In The Lake of Souls, it was found that Harkat used to be Kurda Smahlt and was sent by Mr. Tiny. Mr. Tiny created Harkat from the remains of Kurda- wanting to ensure Darren's safety by sending him an ally for crucial events, choosing Kurda as someone who had been close to Darren in life and would therefore fight harder to protect him as a Little Person-, and sent him back to the past, so that Darren wouldn't die in his fight with the bear while traveling to Vampire Mountain, or the two boars in his Trials of Initiation. The name Harkat Mulds is actually an anagram of the name Kurda Smahlt shown by the teeth of the panther, as revealed in The Lake of Souls. Harkat later finds out that they were in the future by looking at post cards dated years later. Also in the Lake of Souls, Harkat had three identical scars on his left cheek, just like Kurda. In the lake of souls, Darren and Harkat accidentally bring Kurda back to life. Mr. Tiny revealed that Harkat and Kurda could not live in the same timeline. Harkat was prepared to die but Kurda asked to be killed so Harkat could live, reasoning that this was Harkat's time. Mr. Tiny stabbed Kurda and guaranteed that his soul would enter paradise, leaving Harkat with the memories of both. Gavner Purl A good friend of Mr. Crepsley and Darren. In Oceans of Blood, the second novel in The Saga of Larten Crepsley, it is revealed that Larten had gotten on a ship with humans and killed and drank the blood of them all, except a baby whose mother is possibly already dead. Mr. Crepsley takes him with him to paris in Palace of the Damned where he raises the baby, who is later revealed to be Gavner Purl. He is later blooded by a vampire. Mr. Crepsley often teased him for his heavy breathing and snoring, also the fact that he could hear him coming from half a mile away. He is a vampire general and is later killed by Kurda Smahlt. His last words are \\"sorry if my snoring kept you awake..\\". Gavner's death is one of the main reasons Darren speaks of Kurda's treachery. Towards the end of book 6, it says they found Gavner's body stuffed between two cliffs near the tunnel he was killed in. In the story, An Affair of the Night, it shows that Gavner has a girlfriend named Liz Carr. At the end of the story, the couple break up and Gavner leaves for his trek to Vampire Mountain (book 4). Gavner Purl is portrayed by Willem Dafoe in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Seba Nile Mr. Crepsley's former teacher and Vampire Mountain's quartermaster. Seba Nile served as a big inspiration to Mr. Crepsley (while teaching Mr. Crepsley, before the series, he says he wishes to speak like Seba. Seba takes the matter further by plucking a hair from inside of Mr. Crepsley's nose whenever he said can't or won't or it's). Seba also dresses all in red, which is where Mr. Crepsley got the idea. He is the oldest living vampire by the end of the series, at over 700 years old. He fights in the battle that starts the War of Scars. His leg is hit with a sword and walks with a limp through the rest of the series. Kurda Smahlt A vampire General, invested to become a Prince. He was a pacifist and wished to unite the two clans of the vampires and vampaneze. When he heard that the Lord of the Vampaneze was soon to emerge, he took desperate measures. He planned for a group of vampaneze to infiltrate the mountain during his investiture, after he gained control of the Stone of Blood was killed and sentenced to death by the vampire princes as a traitor. He felt remorseful afterwards and agreed to become Harkat Mulds to make up for his wrongdoings. Paris Skyle A Vampire Prince and the oldest living vampire. At least 800 years old. Apparently knew William Shakespeare (he drank from him on his deathbed to preserve his spirit), sailed with Columbus and inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula. He is found dead under the body of a lifeless bear in book eight (due to their life-style, old Vampires often choose to fight a battle they know they possess no hope of winning rather than die peacefully). Mika Ver Leth The other Vampire Prince whom at first Darren despised. He dresses in all black, as that is his custom He has shiny, jet black hair [usually portrayed as long] and dark eagle-like eyes. He is stern and at first Darren was wary of him, but Darren warmed up to him. His features are sharp and raven-like. He was the youngest prince before Darren at a \\"mere\\" 270 years. He is very stern, gloomy and grumpy. He has many wrinkles on his forehead and sides of his mouth from always frowning. He rarely, if ever, smiles. Because of this he comes off as a very intimidating person. Like all Princes, he has huge muscles and is quite big [over 6 ']. He is very loyal to the Vampire Clan and prizes honor and good-standing above all else. In an appearance at a book signing in New Jersey Darren Shan said that Mika was Arra Sails' mentor and perhaps even a rival of Larten Crepsley's for her affection. This was confirmed in The Saga of Larten Creplsey. Arrow The most war-like of all the Princes, Arrow has killed more vampaneze than any other vampire. His hatred is a result of a vampaneze killing a human woman he loved. Having killed the culprit in revenge, he devoted all his energies to the clan from then on. Although like most Princes, his rank is testament to his combat prowess, Arrow is not unintelligent; it is he who suggests setting a challenge for Darren to clear Larten Crepsley's name. Later, following Kurda Smahlt's failed coup, Arrow also comes up with a way to pardon Darren for his failure in the Trials of Initiation, suggesting that he is made a Prince for facing execution to expose Kurda's treachery. In the battle against the vampaneze in Vampire Mountain, he demonstrates his skill with both swords and boomerangs. Arra Sails One of the few female vampires, but is considered the physical equal, or better, of the males. Darren won her respect after a fight on the bars, her respect is given by her shaking the hand of the chosen vampire of whom her respect is earned, which is hard to earn. Arra Sails prepared Darren for his third trial, the Hall of Flames. She is Larten Crepsley's love interest and ex-mate. She was killed in the battle that began the War of the Scars by the Vampaneze named Glalda Erefith. Larten had never been the same since her death. She asked Larten to make sure the Prince's spare Darren's life (he failed the trial and fled from his death sentence). After her death a picture of her is formed on the back of a frog, as a memory, at the cave of Lady Evanna, she gave the picture of her to Larten as a little gift when he, Darren and Vancha were travelling through. We learn in the prequel series, The Saga of Larten Crepsley, that Arra once was a servant/apprentice of Lady Evanna, but then left due to the fact that she wanted to become a vampire and then studied under the arm of Mika Ver Leth. Vanez Blane Vanez Blane is the Games Master in Vampire Mountain, and therefore the highest ranked tutor. He helped Darren train for three of his trials. He lost an eye fighting a lion many decades before the beginning of the series, then lost the other (book 6) when it was snagged with a knife during the battle that began the War of the Scars, though that didn't stop him tutoring he continued as a blind man, and still he won fights including a three on one fight against generals who were being rushed into war. Cyrus One of the few vampires blooded by Kurda. He was one of those who attacked Darren when he entered the Hall of Princes. Kurda tells him to stand down after saying too much blood has been shed. He then committed suicide. Darius Shan Son of Annie and Steve \\"Leopard\\" Leonard. Darius was conceived before Steve became a half-vampaneze. Steve left Annie for a time after learning the news. He later returned when it was too late for Annie to have an abortion, staying only long enough to tell her that he never loved her. As Darius grew up, Steve secretly visited him without his Annie's knowledge, and filled the boy's head with lies about how he is on crusade against vampires who are evil, as they kill when they drink blood. Steve implies that Darren Shan was the worst of all, though he does not mention that he is actually Darius's uncle. Steve bloods him as a half-vampaneze at some point before the Lord of the Shadows and teaches him how to use an arrow-gun. In the Lord of the Shadows, when the Cirque du Freak returns to Darren's hometown, Darius lures Darren into a trap at a football stadium, where his old friend Tom Jones is playing. Unknown to Darius, Steve's associates RV and Morgan James murder Tom Jones, and then lead Darren into a trap, where Darius shoots him with an arrow-gun. Darius then takes part in the raid of the Cirque du Freak in which Mr Tall is shot dead by Morgan James and Shancus Von is kidnapped. Darius is captured by Darren and Harkat when Morgan James is killed as they flee. Though Darren almost kills Darius in rage, Harkat persuades him to use the boy as bargaining chip to save Shancus. However, when he is taken to his father's base at the theatre where Darren and Steve first saw the Cirque du Freak, Darius sees Steve's cruelty when he kills Shancus, just to see whether Darren will be prepared to kill his son in retaliation. Just as Darren is about to murder Darius, Steve reveals the boy is his nephew. Knowing the truth, Darren does not take Darius's life, and sets him straight about the truth regarding the Vampaneze. Darius then leads Darren to his home, which was also Darren's before he became a half-vampire. At the house Darren meets his sister Annie, and after discussing both Darius's past and Darren's, Darren re- bloods Darius as a half-vampire. The two survive, but Darren and his allies are immediately forced to set off for the Cirque du Freak, which has been taken over by Vampaneze, and guarded by police. Darius and Annie are sent away for their own protection, with Darren suggesting they hook up with Vampires to train at Vampire Mountain at a later date.  Vampaneze  Steve \\"Leopard\\" Leonard Steve Leonard is one of the main characters of the Saga, appearing in the first book Cirque Du Freak as Darren's best friend. At times it was implied he was neglected as a child, and possibly took out his anger on his mother. When Steve attends the Cirque du Freak with Darren, he recognizes Larten Crepsley as a vampire from one of his vampire books. After the show, Steve begs Crepsley to turn him into a vampire and take him on as his assistant. Crepsley initially agrees, but changes his mind after tasting his blood, which he accuses of being evil. When Steve is poisoned as a result of Darren stealing Crepsley's spider Madame Octa, Darren agrees to become a half- vampire and Crepsley's assistant in exchange for the cure. Following Steve's recovery Darren fakes his death, but Steve is unconvinced that his friend is really dead. After he is exhumed, Darren is attacked by Steve who accuses him of conspiring with Crepsley against him. In the end, Steve cannot bring himself to kill his friend, but swears to become the world's greatest vampire hunter and return to kill both Darren and Larten Crepsley in the future. In book 8, Allies of the Night, the Hunters run into him in the city of Crepsley's childhood, where a group of Vampeneze are openly killing humans, just as Murlough was in the third book Tunnels of Blood. Although Darren, Harkat and Vancha trust Steve, Crepsley remains suspicious of him throughout the majority of the book. It is believed that Steve's actions are benevolent up until the climax of the book, when the vampires are ambushed by the vampaneze in the tunnel, where Steve takes Debbie hostage and reveals he is a half-vampaneze, having manipulated the Hunters the whole time. In the following battle, Debbie is taken by the vampaneze, but the Hunters manage to take Steve hostage. In the following book, Killers of the Dawn, Steve remains hostage of the Vampires briefly, but helps ensnare the Hunters into another trap, this time having them cornered and arrested by human police, who have been led to believe the hunters are the killers. He is knocked out before the Hunters are taken into custody, and is placed in a hospital. However, while Darren is questioned by police, he overhears police saying that Steve has escaped, killing several innocents along the way. Steve is not seen again until the end of the story, where he is with the vampaneze in the Cavern. Crepsley agrees to engage him, Gannen Harst and the apparent Lord of the Vampaneze in battle above a pit of flaming stakes. As the Vampaneze Lord is believed to be dead, the Hunters believe the War of the Scars to be over, until the final stages of the book where Steve reveals the truth to Darren: that he himself is in fact the true Lord of the Vampaneze, the half-vampaneze who was disguised as a servant in Hunters of the Dusk and potentially the Lord of the Shadows. Steve leaves with his fellow vampaneze, with Gannen Harst knocking Darren out before he can alert his allies. Steve does not appear in the following book, The Lake of Souls, except for a dream in which Darren is battling him and a dragon in a pre-apocylapse world. Steve returns again in the penultimate book, Lord of the Shadows, with R.V., Gannen Harst, Morgan James and a new assistant, Darius, who is revealed to be his son. In the closing stages of the book, Evra's son Shancus is taken hostage by the vampaneze and taken to the stage area which was the former theatre of the Cirque du Freak. Steve appears at the theatre, where the Hunters arrive with Steve's son Darius as their hostage. Steve initially agrees to swap Shancus for Darius, but before the swap is made, he snaps Shancus' neck, killing him. In revenge, Darren prepares to kill Darius, only to learn from Steve that Darius is not just his son, but Darren's nephew through his sister Annie. In Sons of Destiny it is revealed that during Darren's absence, Steve returned to Darren's hometown after leaving, and befriended Annie Shan, and started a romantic relationship with her, impregnating her with Darius, before revealing to Annie that he has no love for her and leaving Annie with the baby. Several years later Steve secretly met with Darius and converted him into a half- vampaneze, brainwashing him with propaganda. However, he lied to Darius, telling him that vampaneze do not kill. After Darren performs the dangerous process of reblooding Darius as half-vampire, Darren and Vancha find Steve and the vampaneze at the Cirque du Freak, where they engage Steve and Gannen in battle. Vancha is wounded during the battle by Gannen and unable to fight any longer. Shortly afterward, Gannen is knocked unconscious, leaving Steve and Darren alone to fight. At the end of the long, vicious battle, Steve gains the upper hand when Darren suffers the after-effects of the reblooding, but his gloating leaves Darren with the chance to strike a fatal wound to Steve's heart. Desmond Tiny, who watched the final duel, reveals that he fathered both Darren and Steve. Desmond Tiny states he made them so that the winner of their battle could bring destruction to the human race as the Lord of the Shadows. As Steve the loser, lies dying and despairing over his cruel manipulation, Darren takes advantage of Steve's belief Darren made a deal with Mr. Crepsley to take Steve's \\"rightful place\\" as a half-vampire, goading Steve into stabbing him again. Darren then drags Steve into the river by which they fought, and both succumb to their injuries and drown. When Darren is rescued from the Lake of Souls many centuries later in a possible future, after humanity has disappeared from Earth to be replaced by dragons, Evanna reveals that Steve's spirit is also trapped in the Lake of Souls. Evanna states that she has no intention of saving Steve, as Steve chose to do evil in his life, whereas Darren was merely manipulated as part of Desmond Tiny's plans. After Darren is sent back in time as a Little Person, he scares himself off so that he doesn't see Steve and Mr. Crepsley, cutting off the original chain of events that made Darren a vampire. It's unknown what happens to the Steve of said timeline, but he presumably lives a normal life and is still friends with Darren. Steve Leonard is portrayed by Josh Hutcherson in the movie. In The Vampire's Assistant movie, Steve became a Vampaneze much earlier than in the books. Murlough blooded him and Mr. Tiny assisted him to his destiny. He is not yet the Lord of the Vampaneze in the film but Mr. Tiny mentioned him leading his people or kind. Steve kidnapped Darren's family to lure him to a battle. Mr. Tiny wanted him to solve his differences with Darren later. Gannen Harst Vancha's brother - the two joined the Vampaneze together. Remained a Vampaneze when his brother was cast out. Gannen is the one who urges Steve to try the Coffin of Fire, which kills anyone who is not the Lord of the Vampaneze. When Steve emerged unscathed, Harst was elected as his personal protector, in the coming war against the Vampires, and remains at his master's side whenever possible. It is clear that Gannen strongly disagrees with many of his master's decisions, but remains loyal to him out of his devotion to the vampaneze. he is present at every confrontation between Steve and the Hunters until the final battle between himself, Steve, his brother Vancha and Darren Shan. During the battle, Gannen stabs and wounds Vancha, shortly before being attacked and knocked unconscious by R.V. Gannen survives the War of the Scars, and Evanna reveals that she bears twins from both Gannen and Vancha. RV (aka Reggie Veggie/Righteous Vampaneze) A former friend of Darren's who first appears in The Vampire's Assistant as an eco-warrior, who befriends Darren, Evra and Sam Grest as his troupe is near where the Cirque du Freak are performing. He is a vegetarian and sensitive about animal rights, and so when he visits the Cirque, he is appalled to see the Wolf Man locked up and goats being killed, and stays behind when his group leaves to keep an eye on the Cirque. After witnessing Darren kill an animal as food for the Little People, R.V. angrily vows to bring the Cirque down. Darren is forced to threaten him into fleeing with his Vampire powers. However, R.V. later returns to free the Wolf Man from his cage. As R.V. wrestles with the lock, he is distracted when Darren appears, and his hands are bitten off by the Wolf Man. After accusing Darren of being responsible for his loss, R.V. runs away, screaming insanely. In book 8 Allies of the Night, the crazed, hook-handed vampaneze responsible for the majority of murders in Mr Crepsley's home city is revealed at the climax to be R.V., who survived the encounter with the Wolf Man, and was taken in and blooded by the vampaneze, who replaced his hands with hooks. He claims to no longer be a vegetarian and relish meat, and has lost his peaceful views, obsessed with gaining revenge on Darren whom he still deems responsible for handicapping him. By the end of the book, R.V. has taken Debbie hostage and runs away. He returns in book 9 Killers of the Dawn, fighting in the Cavern along with his fellow vampaneze, battling Harkat, only to have his hooks removed by the Little Person. He survives the battle and leaves with the rest of the vampaneze. In book 11 Lord of the Shadows R.V., along with vampet Morgan James, attacks the Soccer game and kills Tommy Jones. He is chased by Darren, whom he leads to his superiors, Steve Leonard and Gannen Harst. After Steve wounds Darren, R.V. leaves with them. He later attacks the Cirque du Freak, taking Evra's son Shancus hostage and to the vampaneze hideout. However, he starts to show doubts about his loyalties when he shows strong reluctance at the prospect of killing the snake-boy, and when he believes that he no longer has to kill the child, he shows signs of relief. It is then that Darren realizes that R.V. is not genuinely evil like Steve, but insane and misled. After Steve murders Shancus, R.V. is shocked, and leaves looking horrified. In book 12 Sons of Destiny, it is revealed that Shancus' murder had a deep effect on R.V., who no longer knows whose side he's really on. When he has Debbie prisoner, although Steve instructs him to murder her, R.V. does not, and claims it was wrong of Steve to kill Shancus and that he thought his only real enemy was Darren. When the fighting begins, he lets Debbie go and flees. R.V. takes no part in the fighting, and tries to escape the chaos until he is attacked by Cormac Limbs. He initially backs away, but is provoked into chopping Cormac's head off. He begins to cry and says that he wanted to help people and never kill anyone, only to fall further into madness upon seeing Cormac grow two heads. He comes back later in the book, however, having ultimately switched sides, attacking Gannen in an attempt to save Vancha, accusing the vampaneze of being evil. He defeats Gannen, knocking him unconscious, only for Steve to stab him in the throat. In his dying moments, R.V. sees an imaginary pair of hands in place of his hooks, and dies happily. Murlough An insane and crazy Vampaneze who speaks in third person. Murlough terrorized Mr. Crepsley's home town until Darren and Mr. Crepsley stopped him. He abducted Evra, tortured him by cutting off some of his scales and tried to kill Darren's girlfriend; Debbie Hemlock. He was killed by Mr. Crepsley and after his death, his soul became trapped in the Lake of Souls. In the film, Murlough's name was changed to the spelling of Murlaugh. In the tenth book The lake of Souls, Darren and Harkat see Murlough's ghost. In the Saga of Larten Crepsley, Murlough killed Wester's family. He is portrayed by Ray Stevenson in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Glalda Erefith A friend of Kurda Smahlt.

Annie is portrayed by Morgan Saylor in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Dermot Shan Annie's father, and the man Darren believes to be his father. However, it is revealed in Sons of Destiny that Mr. Tiny is Darren's biological father. The circumstances of Darren's conception are not explained, but Mr. Tiny says that Darren's mother has no knowledge of his real parentage, indicating that she not have an affair with Mr. Tiny. In the eleventh book, Lord Of The Shadows, a woman tells Darren that Dermot has recently recovered from a mild heart attack. He is portrayed by Don McManus in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Angela Shan Mother of both Darren and Annie. She is portrayed by Colleen Camp in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Tommy Jones Tommy was one of Darren and Steve's best friends before they were blooded. He followed his childhood dream and became a professional footballer (British soccer player), playing as goalkeeper for a national team. His name is often referenced in the book to that of Welsh singer Tom Jones. He meets Darren 15 years after his supposed death when the Cirque du Freak returns to town. Darren tells his old friend a complex lie, in which he suffered from a terminal anti-aging disease, and faked his death so he could receive treatment from a travelling doctor. Tommy gives Darren a ticket to a football match he is playing in, but is brutally murdered by the insane half-vampaneze RV, to lure Darren into a trap. It is later suggested that he was likely aware of Steve's affair with Annie Shan, but did not have enough time to tell Darren.

He liked pickled onions and had a large family with lots of pets. Sadly, he was brutally killed and ripped to shreds by the wolf man, but Darren drank from him to preserve his soul. He was also the second person Darren ever drank from, which he only did to preserve Sam's memories. The first was Alan Morris. Although never touched in on the main story, he seemed to possess somewhat clairvoyant abilities (see short stories \\"Transylvania Trek, and Bride of Sam Grest\\"). He inadvertently predicted the manner in which he died, and the existence of the vampaneze Murlough when he was only nine years old. Sam appears in the manga version of the third book, Tunnels Of Blood, in which Darren summons Sam's ghost. However, Sam never made an appearance in the original novel. In the twelfth book, Sons Of Destiny, Sam's soul appears in Mr. Tiny's secret lair. Sam recognizes Darren and salutes him. Debbie Hemlock Darren's off and on girlfriend. Darren meets her when she is a young girl, about 13 years old. Later on, when she is an adult, she helps the vampires in the war of the scars and has the idea for human fighters for the vampires like the vampets for the vampaneze; she calls this new army the vampirites. She loves Darren but refuses to kiss him because he still is one of her students and he has aged only two years. She agrees to kiss him after the second purge because he will look more like an adult, this moment never arrives however because Darren dies before the end of the second purge. Debbie is described as being a pretty, kind-hearted, joyful girl with dark hair and skin. In the movie version, she is replaced by Rebecca, a girl around the same age as Darren. Rebecca and Darren, on the other hand, do kiss. Walter Blaws A school inspector who made Darren go to Mahler's where he met Debbie Hemlock as his teacher, when Darren returned to Mr Crepsley's city to stop the vampaneze killing innocent humans in a series of well-publicised attacks. When Darren is wrongly arrested and accused of the murders, Mr Blaws comes to the prison where Darren is held to confirm his identity. Tara Williams A sweet, shy girl in Darren's English class. She sat next to Darren in his English class. She was a student of Debbie's before being murdered. Darren was said to kill her but she was really killed by a vampaneze. Most likely by RV. Alice Burgess Police Chief Inspector of Larten Crepsley's birthplace. She later allied herself with the vampires and aids them in the War of Scars by recruiting an army of street people who can use modern weapons in the War of Scars, the vampirites. Spits Abrams A mad, cannibalistic sailor/pirate who Darren and Harkat meet in The Lake of Souls. Later, Harkat finds out that they weren't in the past but in the future. He was a cannibal and planned to fish out souls and eat them. Then as he tried to kill Darren and Harkat, he was killed by a dragon who blasted fire onto Spit's head, who jumped into the lake to extinguish it, drowning in the progress. It is possible that he is partially responsible for the death of Madame Truska's husband and daughter, who claimed her family was murdered by \\"ëvil fishermen\\" in the same book that Spits is introduced – and he introduces himself as being a fisherman. Darren Shan has confirmed that Spits Abrams is Daniel Abrams in The Saga of Larten Crepsley Book 2 - Ocean of Blood on Shanville Monthly March 2019. Oggy Bas Short for Augustine Bas. A minor character who at first sight is mistaken by Darren to be Annie's son. He is also Darius' friend. He helps Annie Shan with many jobs.

In the Lord of the Shadows, Darren is informed of her death, and it is suspected that Steve may have been involved. Jimmy Ovo Appears in The Vampire's Assistant and in Brothers to the Death. A pathologist. In the Vampire's Assistant, Darren and Mr Crepsley visit Jimmy, and Darren refuses to drink from a corpse in Jimmy's possession. Brothers to the Death reveals that Jimmy's father, James, was a Holocaust survivor who was rescued by Kurda Smahlt from Nazi death camps. Jimmy appears himself later in the novel, where he is with Gavner Purl to attend a performance of the Cirque's in 1960s New York City. It is revealed James' family worked as morticians before the Second World War, although it is commented that Jimmy is staying in a similar field of work to that of his family. Jesse and Donna Hemlock Debbie's mother and father, makes only one short appearance in the third book, they are used as bait to lure Murlough into a trap where he is killed by Mr. Crepsley.  Vampets  The vampets are humans recruited by the vampaneze for the War of the Scars. While vampaneze are not allowed to use projectile weapons, vampets can use them freely since they are not bound with any of the vampaneze laws. Vampets wear a brown shirt and black pants, and they are all shaven-headed and have a purple \\"V\\" tattooed above either ear. Morgan James Former police guard. He worked with Alice Burgess until He revealed he was a vampet whilst interrogating Darren in a jail cell. One of Steve's main body guards. Had half of his face blown off by a gunshot by Alice Burgess. Later his head is chopped off by Harkat. He also killed Mr Tall by shooting him in the abdomen in Lord of the Shadows. Mark Ryter A vampet in book 9 who was tortured and killed by Vancha March.  Vampirites  Vampirites are a bunch of street people recruited by Debbie Hemlock and Alice Burgess in order to help the vampires in the War of the Scars. The Vampirites are mostly homeless people, but they all strike back against society in the big battle of book 12. Vampirites are the Vampires' counterpart to vampets. They, like vampets, are allowed to use projectile weapons. Declan One of the street people that was recruited by Debbie Hemlock and Alice Burgess to help the vampires in the War of the Scars. He and his friend, Little Kenny, helped save Darren when he was wounded during his encounter with Steve \\"Leopard\\" Leonard in Darren's hometown. Little Kenny A friend of Declan's who helped him save Darren.  Cirque du Freak members  Evra Von Close friends with Darren, and also known as the snake-boy, or the snake-man as he grows older, is a performer at the Cirque Du Freak. He helped Mr. Crepsley and Darren defeat Murlough in the third book, but was injured permanently when Murlough ripped scales off of Evra's right shoulder. He became one of Darren's best friends, yet because Evra ages normally and Darren ages 1/5 the normal rate, their bond thins as time goes on. Near the end of the last book, as Darren watches the Cirque Du Freak once more, he comments that it would be too difficult to watch the snake-boy perform, reflecting on the pain that would later befall him. Evra was born to normal parents, but they were horrified when they saw him, and left him at an orphanage at the age of two (although in the movie he claimed Mr Tall found him in a dumpster when he was two days old), where he was picked on by the other children. When he was four, he was sold to a traveling circus where he was abused, locked in a glass tank, and forced to feel ugly, useless, and freakish. Seven years later, when he was eleven, he was rescued by Mr. Tall, joined the Cirque Du Freak, and stayed for the rest of his life. In book 12 he almost killed Steve himself for revenge for killing Shancus (his oldest son) but is stopped by Mr. Tiny. Evra speaks with an American accent and is shy, which Darren thinks is due to his abusive childhood. He is described as slender, with long yellow and green hair and is around 14–15 years old in books 1,2 and 3. After a time skip of several years, Darren returns to find that Evra has fallen in love with another freak named Merla who throws her ears like boomerangs and has three children, Shancus (who was named after Darren, was the oldest, and considered Darren his godfather even though he wasn't), Urcha (he always felt different because he was the only one without the snake skin) and Lilia (the smallest). Shancus performs with him at the Cirque until he died when Steve snapped his neck and hung him in a noose. He is portrayed by Patrick Fugit in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Merla Von Merla Von is Evra's wife and the mother of his three children. She can detach her ears and use them as kind of boomerangs. The means by which she became part of the Cirque Du Freak are never mentioned inside the book series. She often uses the threat of the Wolfman when her children misbehave, particularly when they're annoying Alexander Ribs, trying to mess around with his xylophone-like bones. Merla's described throughout the series as pretty and nice. She is also highly intelligent and lovable. Shancus Von The oldest child of Evra and Merla, Along with Lila, Shancus has scales like his father. He believes Darren is his godfather, because he was named after him. He is killed after Steve snaps his neck. Urcha Von Evra and Merla's middle child. He is the only one out of his siblings who does not have scales, and so is deeply upset. However, Darren gives Shancus a new snake for his birthday, and his old snake was passed down to Urcha. Lilia Von Evra and Merla's youngest child. She is the only girl out of her siblings, and like Shancus, she has scales. Rhamus Twobellies Rhamus, as the name implies, has two stomachs. He is said to be able to eat anything in a matter of minutes. Some of the things Rhamus has been said to have eaten include a full grown elephant, or a tank, and can wrap forks and spoons around a chain inside his stomach and pull it back out again. In fights, he belly flops people to death. He is portrayed by Frankie Faison in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Truska A woman who can grow an indestructible beard at will and then suck it back in. She was the one who gave Darren his pirate costume. It is often hinted that she is in a relationship with Vancha March in the books and Larten Crepsley in the movie. In Sons Of Destiny she fights her opponents using and controlling her beard like snakes. In the saga of Larten Crepsley Truska is mentioned as being a fish like creature covered in long hair called a skelk and is the bride of another skelk, Velap, in the book. Vancha brings her to the Cirque du Freak at the end of the saga of Larten Crepsley after her husband and daughter are killed. This is because, after they have been widowed, skelks have to live apart from the others for twenty or thirty years in mourning. In the saga of Darren Shan Truska mentions that her family were killed by evil fishermen. These fishermen were most likely sailors who thought the skelks were evil and hunted them. Skelks live in the Scottish seas where they have inspired the myths of mermaids, although some Scottish know them to be called Skelkies. They migrate to warmer climates during the Winter and return in the Spring. Truska is little creature also called fantasy. She is portrayed by Salma Hayek in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Gertha Teeth One of Cirque Du Freak's female performers. Her teeth are extremely strong, and her performances are often joined with Rhamus's. Played by Kirsten Schaal in the movie. Cormac Limbs When his limbs are removed (cut off), he can grow them back at will. Cormac Limbs discovered his powers when he accidentally cut off part of his nose when he was younger. Throughout Darren's first meeting with Cormac, he explains that he can regrow all of his body parts as far as he knows, although states he has never tried regrowing his head for the risk of death. However, when his head is cut off by R.V. in Sons of Destiny, he re- grows two heads (each slightly smaller than the original), driving R.V. insane. The two heads talk at the same time and they do things at the same time. He is portrayed by actress Jane Krakowski in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, as Corma Limbs. Hans Hands One of the Cirque's performers. He can walk and run on his hands faster than a normal man can run on his feet. He was introduced in the first book and claimed his father was born with no legs and learned to walk with his hands. He was killed in the sons of destiny. He is portrayed by Jonathan Nosan in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, in which he is very limber, agile, supple, swift and topsy-turvy. The Wolf Man A ferocious beast who is half human and half wolf. The mix of wolf and human blood has driven him mad. For that reason, he must be locked up or else he will kill all the time. He killed Darren's friend Sam Grest and bit off R.V.'s hands. For these reasons, Darren despises the wolf man. He is possibly a connection to the Demonata saga, as one of the main themes is lycanthrophy. However this was denied by Darren Shan, as a question asked by a fan at the Darren Shan message boards, Questions for Shan section. He is portrayed by Tom Woodruff, Jr. in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Alexander Ribs More of a comedy act than a scary one which was needed to calm down the audience after the terrifying start with the wolfman. The skinniest man that Darren has ever seen, he played the 'London Bridge is Falling Down', songs by the Beatles and TV theme tunes by opening his mouth and hitting his bony ribs with a drumstick. (Cirque Du Freak) He was killed in the last book, Sons Of Destiny Alexander Ribs is portrayed by Orlando Jones in the movie adaptation of this book Cirque Du Freak - The Vampires Assistant. Jekkus Flang A ticket man at the Cirque who later has his own act. He excels at throwing and juggling knives. At the end of Sons of Destiny he is seen young not yet has his own act and is in charge of the gifts also commands the little people. Sive and Seersa The Twisting twins, Sive and Seersa that are identical twins and were contortionists like Bradley Stretch. Their act involved twisting their bodies around each other so they looked like one person with two fronts instead of a back, or two upper bodies and no legs. They were skillful and interesting, but dull compared to the rest of the performers. Often used as a fake climax to the shows, only to be tricked by Evra Von's snake. Bradley Stretch A Cirque performer with the ability to stretch himself into all sorts of shapes. He went missing and was (apparently) eaten by the Little People some years before Darren joined the Cirque. It states Evra saw the bones and a bracelet (a gift from a Bradley Stretch fan) left over when cleaning the Little People's things. Evra fed Bradley's remains to the wolf-man, and when Darren and Evra contemplate this later, Evra says that he must have tasted rubbery - Darren and Evra burst out laughing.  Others  Desmond \\"Des Tiny\\" Tiny Desmond \\"Des Tiny\\" Tiny is known to the Vampires and the Cirque du Freak as a meddling trickster of immense magical power, having created Little People and the most sacred relics of the Vampires and Vampaneze, and a number of prophecies. He also fathered Lady Evanna. He has short white hair, thick glasses, and pudgy face, with a warm but mocking smile. He wore a shabby yellow suit and a pair of green wellington boots. He has six toes, webbed feet, carries a heart-shaped watch, and has six cat-like claws on each foot. He sometimes asks people to call him Des, which makes him Des Tiny, or Destiny. He is universally feared for his love of chaos and cruelty; he openly admits to eating children and enjoys the idea of thousands dying in natural disasters. He predicts the rise of the Lord of the Vampaneze and tells the Vampires they must destroy him before he comes of age, informing them that Darren Shan and Mr. Crepsley are two of the three who will get the four chances. The later books in the series elaborate on his powers further, revealing him as a time traveler capable of resurrecting the dead, and that Hibernius Tall was also his son and Evanna's twin. Desmond possesses many original objects designed by famous people such as the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. He collects many things from mankind except books due to his lack of interest in reading (mainly fiction). In Sons Of Destiny, Mr Tiny proclaims he is the father of Darren Shan and Steve (Leopard) Leonard, having engineered the war between the Vampires and Vampaneze simply to throw the human race back into the bloody chaos he loves, and pitted his own sons against each other just so one would become the Lord of the Shadows, a tyrant who would rule over the ruined world. Darren manages to destroy these schemes by letting a mortally injured Steve stab him to death. Having lost his dictator and his means of destroying the world temporarily, Desmond turns to his daughter Evanna to conceive a child who would pitch the Vampires and Vampaneze back into war. She agrees on the condition that Darren, an innocent victim of Tiny's meddling, is freed from the Lake of Souls, but she double-crosses her father by conceiving twins of both Vampire and Vampaneze, which will create a new species that can freely breed with both races, erasing any divisions between them. She also sends a reincarnated Darren into the past to plant his diaries in the hands of an author. These books are updated with the revelations about Tiny's meddling, and will eventually expose him and permanently wreck his efforts to stop humanity finding peace. He is portrayed by Michael Cerveris in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Hibernius Tall The leader of the Cirque Du Freak who was loved and highly respected by the performers, having offered sanctuary for unusual humans through the Cirque for many years. He has telepathic powers, precognition, and can move as fast as lightning. He is well acquainted with many vampires, his closest friend amongst them being Larten Crepsley. In Hunters of the Dusk he appears to be bound by similar universal laws to Lady Evanna, unable to intervene in the War of the Scars. In The Lord of the Shadows, he confirms Evanna's prophecy regarding the Lord of the Shadows to Darren's horror. The Cirque then comes under attack from Steve Leopard's subordinates, and Mr Tall abandons his neutrality by trying to save the life of Shancus Von, on the grounds that they have attacked his family. He is then brutally shot by Morgan James. As he lies dying, Mr Tiny and Evanna appear at the Cirque to bid him farewell, and it is revealed Mr Tall is Mr Tiny's son and Evanna's brother. He is portrayed by Ken Watanabe in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. Lady Evanna A \\"witch\\" with many powers (who takes great offense to anybody who calls her that). She normally wears ropes instead of clothing. She is Desmond Tiny's daughter, Hibernius Tall's sister and Darren's, and Steve's half sister. Evanna breeds frogs whose pigmentation can change, allowing her to create images with their backs. She makes a number vampire friends, and is the one responsible for Mr Creplsey's trademark scar. She was created when Desmond Tiny mixed vampire and wolf blood to create two children that were born to a wolf. She is the only entity who is able to carry a vampire/vampaneze child. Her other powers are similar to Mr Tiny's, but are considerably weaker, and she is always bound by her inability to directly interfere with the affairs of humanity. As such she always strives to be a neutral observer in the War of the Scars, despite the animosity and mistrust this creates amongst her friends, and the distress she causes Darren by pronouncing he will become the Lord of the Shadows and ruin mankind. At the climax of the War of the Scars, she learns that Darren Shan and Steve Leopard are her half-brothers, having been directly created by Mr Tiny to throw the human world into chaos. Shocked out of her neutrality, Evanna then seeks to upset Tiny's plans, while also trying to save Darren from his imprisonment in the Lake of Souls. When Mr Tiny offers to release Darren in exchange for her conceiving a child of either a vampire or a vampaneze, who could tip the clans back into war, she doublecrosses her father by conceiving twins of both races. Lord of the Shadows A destructive all powerful being first mentioned when Darren assists Evanna in treating Harkat's nightmares, and sees a shadowy figure in the Little Person's visions. Evanna explains that this figure will destroy the modern world and rule over the ruins of humanity for hundreds of years, and that only his identity is uncertain, being either the Lord of Vampaneze or Darren himself. Darren does not dwell on this until he and Harkat discover the latter's true identity in a strange primeval land, which they later conclude was the future. Harkat thinks this is only one of many paths the world could take, but a petrified Darren realises the destruction is certain, and he may well be its architect as the Lord of the Shadows. At the climax of the series, despite his fear, Darren becomes vengeful and vicious in his efforts to destroy his nemesis Steve Leopard, and although he learns he will kill his close friend Vancha March on his future destructive path, he is unable to give up his thirst for revenge. After Darren kills Steve, Mr Tiny explains he fathered both children just so he could create the terrible future through the Lord of the Shadows. However, Darren lets himself be stabbed by a dying Steve, sacrificing his life. After centuries of imprisonment in the Lake of Souls, Evanna rescues him and confirms his theory; with both dead, the Lord of the Shadows can never come into being. Lady Evanna's twins Lady Evanna's unborn, nameless twins. Following Darren's sacrifice after killing Steve, Mr. Tiny had nobody to end the War of the Scars and become the Lord of the Shadows. He therefore turned to Evanna, begging her to mate with either a vampire or a vampaneze, as that child could renew the war and bring about humanity' downfall. However, Evanna conceived twins of both a vampire and a vampaneze, making each of them one-third vampire, one-third vampaneze, and one-third Evanna. The fathers were both Vancha March and Gannen Harst, an example of intentional heteropaternal superfecundation. This was an attempt to unite the two clans, thus ending the War of the Scars. Guardians of Blood Humans who eat vampire organs in order to live longer (up to 160 years), they provide vampires with blood in exchange for dead vampire's organs. (As it says in Vampire Mountain, they save the brains and heart for important events such as weddings.) It is unknown whether or not they are the 'Kulashkas' which Darren and Harkat met in the future or whether they descended into the Kulashkas. Madam Octa Larten Crepsley's spider. Madam Octa is a telepathic spider, and can do many different tricks. She is highly intelligent and poisonous, she can even be trained to control how much poison she injects. She can live up to 30 years, according to the monk who gave it to Mr. Crepsley. In the first book, she bites Steve causing Darren to go to Mr. Crepsley to ask for an antidote, but the condition is Darren must become a half-vampire in order to save him. Later in the series, Darren releases Madam Octa into the cave of spiders inside Vampire Mountain, where she mates and produces offspring, which are named after Darren; The Ba'Shan's spiders. Ba'Halens' Spiders Spiders that live within Vampire Mountain. Are revealed in Book 5 Trials of Death. The cobwebs of these spiders have healing abilities and aid Darren quite a bit after his second trial. Seba Nile is supposedly the only person who knows of their existence and whereabouts. Ba'Shan's spiders Offsprings of Madam Octa and Ba'Halens spiders. They appear in the book The Lake of Souls the spiders are under the temple where Darren and Harkat were looking for the holy liquid. They have been altered because they were blind. Seba Nile named them after Darren. Streak A wolf that Darren encounters on his trek to vampire mountain. He was nicknamed by Darren after the design on his fur. Streak, along with the rest of his pack, travel to vampire mountain with Darren, Mr. Crepsley, and Gavner for some of the way before departing. Streak and his pack reappear in book 6 to help Darren survive after he falls into the river. Darren stays with the pack to recover from injury before going back to the mountain to warn the vampires of the threat Kurda poses. Magda A she wolf from Streak's pack. She was nicknamed by Darren after his Grandmother. She was one of the wolves Darren first encountered after being attacked by the mad bear. She helped Darren back up vampire mountain, and dies on the journey. Darren believed she knew she would die soon, and wanted to die honorably, much like vampires. Rudi A wolf cub in Streak's pack. He was the wolf who discovered Darren after he was washed to the base of vampire mountain. Rudi also means famous wolf. Rudi was first introduced to Darren as a cub in the fourth book (Vampire Mountain) Darren developed a unique fondness for the cub and was sad when Rudi departed, he next returns to Darren in the sixth book, as a young adult. He along with Streak and another she wolf nursed Darren back to health in his time of need. The Dark-Furred wolf A wolf in Streak's pack who Darren never nicknamed but he was identified by his darker fur. He disapproved of Darren staying with the pack, and often snarled angrily at him. Darren tried to stay away from him as much as possible. Eventually Streak and the dark-furred wolf got into a fight. Neither of them were seriously injured but afterward the dark-furred wolf  Other classmates in the first book  * Dave Morgan - Was on Darren's soccer team, but broke his leg. * Sam White - Was on Darren's soccer team, but family moved and went to another school. * Danny Curtin - Was on Darren's soccer team, but stopped playing to be with his girlfriend.

The company was founded in 1919. Unlike many of its rivals such as Toys \\"R\\" Us, Gamleys operated smaller shops in high streets and shopping centres rather than larger super stores. Because of this different approach to business it had managed to survive, unlike the former Children's World. The name Gamleys was thought up by the original proprietor, Bill Lord, who wanted to mix the names of the two most famous London stores, Gamages and Hamleys. Late in 2007 and through the first half of 2008 a number of Gamleys stores closed down and in August 2008 rival chain The Entertainer, operator of thetoyshop.com website, purchased the Maidstone and Brighton stores, leaving only the Bromley store which closed in September 2008. After almost 90 years of trading, Gamleys went out of business in 2008.

It shows three philosophers – one young, one middle-aged, and one old. The work was commissioned by the Venetian noble Taddeo Contarini, a Venetian merchant with an interest in the occult and alchemy. The Three Philosophers was finished one year before the painter died. One of Giorgione’s last paintings, it is now displayed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The painting was finished by Sebastiano del Piombo. Description The Three Philosophers was finished around 1509, and the current name of the work derives from a writing of Marcantonio Michiel, (1484–1552) who saw it just some years after in a Venetian villa.Marcantonio Michiel, Notizie d’opere di disegno, manuscript, Venice (see Zeleny) The three figures portrayed are allegorical: an old bearded man, possibly a Greek philosopher; a Persian or Arab philosopher; and a sitting young man, enclosed within a natural landscape. In the background is a village with some mountains, the latter marked by a blue area whose meaning is unknown. The young man is observing a cave on the left of the scene, and apparently measuring it with some instruments. Since the end of the 19th century scholars and critics rejected on various grounds the earlier view that it is a representation of the three Magi gathered before Jesus' grotto.Settis S.,(1990), Giorgione's Tempest: Interpreting the Hidden Subject, University Of Chicago Press Interpretations Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels. The painting shows rather faithfully the original painting as displayed in the dukes collection, high up left corner, by David Teniers the Younger, (c. 1650, in Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) Various interpretations about Giorgione's picture have been proposed. The Three Philosophers, the old man, the Arab figure and the young man, could be a depiction of transmission of knowledge, the Transmission of the Classics from the ancient Greeks philosophy through the Arab translations, that became actual again around the Italian Renaissance. The old man is representing a Greek philosopher, such as Plato or Aristotle, whose writings have been copied and transmitted through the Arab philosophers to the Italian Renaissance. The Arab philosopher is possibly representing the polyhistor Avicenna or Averroes, both Arab philosophers and Arab scientists from the Islamic Golden Age.www.britannica.com The young man could be seen as the new Renaissance science with roots in the past, looking into the empty darkness of the cave, symbolizing the yet undiscovered secrets. The cave might also symbolize the philosophic concept of Plato's Cave New hypotheses about the figures, their identities and the symbolism are still currently advanced. In a note about the picture G. C. Williamsom, early in the 20th century, stated that \\"It represents Evander and his son Pallas showing to Aeneas the future site of Rome\\".G. C. Williamson, ed.,(1903), The Anonimo.

Kilpatrick.by Neil K. MacLennan and Ross S. Kilpatrick, King Solomon & the Temple Builders: A Biblical Reading of Giorgione\`s Painting \\"The Three Philosophers\\" Heredom 9(2001) It has been suggested that the figure of the young man can be inscribed neatly in a right-angled triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem applies. Karin Zeleny, relying on a reading of Polydore VergilPolydore Vergil, De inventoribus rerum, libri tres, Venetia, 1499 has proposed that the philosophers are the teachers of Pythagoras – Pherecydes of Syros and Thales. Thales has been painted as a Jew, while Pherecydes was mistakenly believed to be a Syrian.Zeleny K., The Giorgione Code, Kunsthistorisches Museum Papers This interpretation was modified by Frank Keim who claimed that the older philosopher is in fact Aristarchus of SamosKeim F., Die Entdeckung der Jupitermonde 105 Jahre vor Galileo Galilei, 2009, Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang Verlag. Other scholars have asserted that the figures are typical representations for three stages of humanity (youth, middle and old age), three epochs of European civilization (Antiquity, Middle Age, Renaissance), the three Abrahamic religions or some combination of such general conceptions.see Settis S., MacLennan and Kilpatrick, 'op. cit' Augusto Gentili proposed that the picture illustrates the waiting for the Antichrist, based on conjunctionist astrology. On the sheet held by the oldest philosopher the word 'eclipsis' and an astronomical diagram can be seen. The great conjunction of 1503 and the eclipse the same year were believed to be signs announcing its coming.Gentili A., Giorgione, Giunti Editore (coll. Dossier d'art), 1999, (Googlebooks) Theatrum Pictorium This painting was documented in David Teniers the Younger's catalog Theatrum Pictorium of the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in 1659 and again in 1673,39 in Theatrum Pictorium, 1673 but the portrait had already found fame in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection: Tenier's copies that he made of the exhibits have long been recognised as a valuable historical resource.

While working on this picture, David Teniers the Younger made tiny separate copies of each and every picture as a study for the final big painting, depicting the duke's collection. In this small copy that measures 21.5 x 30.9 cm, he put a trident in the older man's hand, but that was not in the original painting nor depicted in the final painting, the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Gallery in Brussels.

She played indoor volleyball for a few years, playing at Orion Doetinchem, Sourcy Volleybalschool and Longa'59 Lichtenvoorde before she switched onto the beach. She had never played volleyball at the beach before but she was invited to it when she was a member of the Sourcy Volleybalschool. In 2003 and 2004 she played with several team mates, but mostly played with Angelique Remmers. They achieved some decent results and Wesselink felt a potential future in this sport. When teaming up with Marleen van Iersel in 2005 their skills improved fast, which resulted in a successful season. They started off in the Eredivisie of Beach volleyball in the Netherlands, which is the highest league in the country. In Callantsoog they became second and in Assen they reached the 3rd position. Their first World Tour event was in Gstaad finishing 57th among the World's best teams. In the Eredivisie they kept on playing in the top 3 finishing 3rd in Nesselande and Amstelveen, while they finished 2nd in Gouda and Groningen. They took part at the Dutch national championships under 20 in Almere which they won. After that they also won the Eredivisie tournament in Scheveningen, while in Monster they became 3rd. Next step was the European Championships under 20 in Israel where they were among the favourites. They reached the final, which they won and took their first international gold medal. A few weeks later at the World Championships under 19 in Saint-Quay-Portrieux they reached the 5th position. Later in 2005 they took part in the Dutch national senior championships, finishing 5th. Their final 2005 event was the World Championships under 21 held in Brazil where they finished 9th. Van Iersel/Wesselink received the award for Beach volleyball talents 2005. In 2006 both girls decided to concentrate on beach volleyball full-time, working on improving their skills more and more and also getting more experience. The first tournament of the season was an Eredivisie event in Kijkduin where they finished 2nd. On international level they started participating in higher quality tournaments like the European Championship Tour. In Hamburg they reached the 13th position. In the same weekend they travelled to Assen in their home country and in addition they won the TopTeams Cup Assen. In another 6 Eredivisie tournaments they reached one 1st place, four 2nd positions and a 3rd position, before heading to Marseille to play in a FIVB World Tour event. They reached the 41st position on the highest possible level. At the European Championship Tour event in Valencia they finished in 21st position. August 2006 turned out to be a good month for Van Iersel/Wesselink. First they travelled to South Korea to participate in an exhibition tournament where they finished 5th. A 4th position was reached a few days later in Austria during the European Championships under 23, while they had the ages of 18 and 19. The following weekend they took part in the Dutch national Championships in Scheveningen finishing 4th again, behind the three top Dutch teams for many years. With these results in mind they travelled to Poland to play the World Championships under 21 in Mysłowice. Again they faced opponents quite older than they were themselves, but this didn't seem to bother them much and they won the bronze medal. In the semi finals they lost from the eventual champions, while they had beaten the same team in the group stage earlier in the tournament. In addition they stayed in Poland to play the Warsaw FIVB World Tour event, finishing 33rd.

Retrieved on December 26, 2010. near Pendleton and about northeast of Indianapolis. Established in 1923, it was built to replace the Indiana State Reformatory located in Jeffersonville after a fire severely damaged the original property. The Pendleton facility currently offers maximum and minimum-security housing for adult males over 22 years old. The maximum-security portion is made up of surrounded by a concrete wall. It has an average daily population of approximately 1,650 inmates. Located on the grounds outside the enclosure, the minimum-security dormitory holds approximately 200 prisoners on a daily basis. History Entrance to the Indiana Reformatory, 1909 Indiana's first state prison was opened on January 9, 1821, in Jeffersonville. The prison, later called Indiana State Prison South, accepted inmates regardless of age, sex, offense, or sentence. In 1847, the prison buildings were in poor repair and the decision was made that it would be built a new in nearby Clarksville. Another prison opened in the northern part of the state in Michigan City, Indiana and the inmates were divided between the two. In 1897, due to the belief that young male offenders should not be housed with their older counterparts, inmates were divided by age between the South and North. The Indiana State Prison South became home to inmates age 16 to 30 and the prison was renamed the Indiana Reformatory. During the night of February 6, 1918, a fire severely damaged the majority of the buildings at Clarksville. The Governor's Commission decided to build a new prison in a more centrally located site. A plot of land south of the city of Pendleton was selected because Fall Creek provided a source of running water. The construction commenced at the new locale during March 1922. Herbert W. Folz was the architect in charge of designing the new prison. The facility is an \\"example of a 'radial plan' prison, in which the cell blocks fan out from a central point.\\"\\"Inmates Sentenced to Build Their Own Prison.\\" Michael Carter According to a report on the Reformatory, Folz \\"made a conscious effort to arrange the buildings within the enclosure in such a manner that a maximum of light and air and green grass would be in evidence.\\" The buildings were modeled after the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The original facilities included three cell houses, a dormitory, and the administration building. Construction on the prison continued until March 1924 when A. F. Miles, the General Superintendent, ended the contracts with the architect and other contractors. He proposed completing construction on the prison using inmates as the laborers. Miles organized the prisoners into groups, with each group concentrating on a specific aspect of the work. Each of these specialty groups was assigned to a professional in the field who would provide them guidance in learning the craft. Some of the tasks inmates participated in included bricklaying, plumbing, roofing, electrical work, and painting. By switching from free labor to inmate labor, Miles decreased the labor costs from $61,000 to $4,500 in a short amount of time. While inmate labor was an effective cost- cutting tool, it also gave the men an opportunity to learn a \\"useful trade.\\" Miles continued his cost-cutting ways by purchasing materials at a lower price than the plan had originally allotted. In June 1996, the Indiana General Assembly passed House Enrolled Act 1229 which changed the name of the Indiana Reformatory. Put into effect on July 1, 1996, the Indiana Reformatory was officially named the Pendleton Correctional Facility. In 2017, American filmmaker Madeleine Sackler created two films filmed entirely in Pendleton Correctional Facility. One is fictional drama titled O.G. and the second is a cinéma vérité-style documentary called It's a Hard Truth, Ain't It. This is the first time that a fiction and non-fiction film have been filmed entirely inside a Level 4 prison. Major Incidents Riot On February 1, 1985, a riot took place at the Pendleton Correctional Facility, then still known as the Indiana Reformatory. An inmate, Lincoln Love #5268 (still incarcerated),Indiana Offender Database Search was badly beaten by correctional officers after he refused to vacate his cell during a weapons check, also called a shakedown. Tear gas was used in large quantities in the cellblock, although eyewash was only offered to the officers. Inmates John Cole and Christopher Trotter rushed to the maximum restraint unit where the beating had taken place.\\"Prisons on trial with two inmates.\\" Indianapolis Star. 14 June 1987. The two proceeded to the infirmary where Love was located and attacked the officers in that area. They held staff hostage when they took over the J-Cellhouse. After the riot was over, inmates had stabbed seven correctional officers and held three employees hostage for 17 hours. 1988-2011 In 1988, the superintendent of the Indiana Reformatory, Edward L. Cohn, was reprimanded for shackling inmates in manners that violated current prison standards. Inmates were shackled in a position that allowed them neither to stand up nor lay straight.Smulevitz, Howard M. \\"State investigates shackling of prisoners.\\" Indianapolis Star. 19 May 1988. This position is achieved by placing handcuffs around an inmates wrists and connecting them to leg irons with a short chain. One prisoner was kept in a maximum-restraint unit in this position for seven days, not even being allowed to loosen his shackles to eat or to use the bathroom. On another occasion, seven inmates wearing only underwear were placed in a single room. After two of the inmates were removed, the remaining five were put in restraints consistent with those mentioned in the previous incidents for one day. These were not the only cases of illegal restraints being used on prisoners. As a result of these incidents, Superintendent Cohn was placed on paid leave for approximately three months. Cohn lost \\"30 days worth of pay and a merit raise.\\" His two assistants were suspended for a number days without pay, denied their merit raises, and required to undergo performance evaluations quarterly instead of annually. In later years Edward L. Cohn went on to become the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction. In 1990, Pendleton came under fire for allowing an unsafe environment for inmates after two prisoners were fatally stabbed within a two-week period. Jesus Rodriquez #856496Indiana Offender Database Search was killed while he was in the segregation unit and Samuel Miller #906085Indiana Offender Database Search was murdered the day after he was released from the same unit. Two separate incidents involving sexual misconduct between employees and inmates brought to light in 2001. The first occurred on December 8 of the previous year. An inmate and a female nurse were caught on camera engaging in a sexual act in a closet. The cameras were in place to record possible tobacco trafficking believed to have been occurring in the closet. Clips of the tape from the camera were shown often on the news during the scandal.Frederick, Diane. \\"Nurse, inmate filmed in closet.\\" Indianapolis Star. 5 Jan. 2001. In the second case, a female guard accused an inmate of inappropriately touching her. It was later revealed that she had consensual sex with an inmate in a hallway.Frederick, Diane. \\"Prison guard accused of sex with an inmate.\\" Indianapolis Star. 25 June 2001. On May 1, 2004, an unidentified caller phoned the Pendleton Correctional Facility about plans of assaults and escape attempts by the inmates. The phone call occurred at a time during which prisoners had set up an eight-step action plan. This plan asked inmates to \\"boycott recreation periods on some days, submit grievances about food portions, visitation privileges, and law library access, and pick days when everyone in a cell house would show up for breakfast, which is optional.\\" The phone call, in addition to increasing inmate on inmate violence, prompted the then-Superintendent Zettie Cotton to impose a lockdown on the prison. During the lockdown, brown bag lunches were served, classes were not allowed to meet, and visiting hours were cut down. The lockdown lasted a total of five months, one of the longest in recent years of any prison in Indiana.O'Neal, Kevin. \\"Pendleton Prison Lifts Restrictions.\\" Indianapolis Star. 15 Oct. 2004. On October 9, 2008, at 12:39 a.m. during a routine security check, convicted killerSimon Rios # 172761 was found hanging in his cell. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at 1:20 a.m. Rios was convicted in October 2007 for the murder of his three children and his wife in Fort Wayne, Indiana in December 2005. He also was convicted of raping and killing 10-year-old Alejandra Gutierrez. Rios was serving a total of 5 life-terms plus 50 years for the rape and molestation of Alejandra Gutierrez. On January 25, 2010 52-year-old offenderCharles L. Jackson #870140 was stabbed by another inmate shortly before 1:30 Saturday as offenders were being released to go to recreation. Jackson, who previously lived in Marion, was transported to the facility's emergency room, where he was pronounced dead about 45 minutes later. Jackson had been sentenced to 80 years for rape in Grant County. On May 28, 2011,Timothy Knapp #998067 was stabbed around 1:45 p.m. Saturday in a segregation unit. Officers rushed the victim to the in- house health care center where less than an hour later he was pronounced dead. Knapp had been serving a three-year sentence for an arson conviction in Marion County. On July 16, 2011,Daniel Dewitt #917509 was attacked by two offenders around 6:30 a.m. Saturday when the offenders, all housed in the facility's \\"H\\" cell house, were being released to the gym for recreation. The offenders stabbed Dewitt several times in an act of gang violence and he was pronounced dead at a local hospital hours later. Dewitt was six months into a 17-year sentence for dealing in a controlled substance and a ten-year sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Notable Inmates * John Dillinger, the notorious bank robber and one of the prison's most famous inmates, was sent to the Indiana State Reformatory at Pendleton in the mid-1920s. In September 1924, Dillinger and a friend robbed a grocery store in Mooresville, Indiana. While the grocer was not seriously hurt, Dillinger did beat him with an iron belt wrapped in cloth. His sentencing of 10–20 years was the maximum sentence one could receive for the crime. While at Pendleton, Dillinger worked in the shirt factory at the facility and often succeeded in doubling his quota. After his wife, Beryl, divorced him and he was denied parole in 1929, Dillinger requested and was granted a transfer to the State Prison at Michigan City, Indiana. After he was finally granted parole in May 1933, he continued his storied escapades around the Mid-West until he was shot and killed on July 22, 1934. * Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr References External links * Official web site Category:Prisons in Indiana Category:1923 establishments in Indiana Category:Buildings and structures in Madison County, Indiana ","title":"Pendleton Correctional Facility"},{"id":"6884099","text":"Anna Maria Mühe (born July 23, 1985) is a German actress.

The Big Blue Nation is a reference to both the signature color of UK athletics (blue) and the fact that when the Wildcats play at a neutral site and occasionally at an away game, the school's fans frequently make up a disproportionate majority of the crowd. For example, Pat Forde, a resident of Kentucky's largest city of Louisville and then a columnist with Yahoo Sports, remarked after the 2014–15 men's basketball team finished its regular season undefeated, > The Southeastern Conference tournament is in nearby Nashville, and you can > expect the seats to be 90 percent blue when the Cats play.

But when you make the commute > this easy, the Big Blue occupation will be overwhelming. Fans sometimes range beyond the borders of their nation, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the Wildcats men's basketball team once even drew a sizable horde of blue-clad supporters at an exhibition game in Japan. In The Winning Tradition: A History of Kentucky Wildcat Basketball, Bert Nelli wrote that many rival coaches consider Wildcat fans to be among the most knowledgeable in the country. Former Wildcat Jack \\"Goose\\" Givens, who later played for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, has said that UK fans are generally more interested and informed than the typical NBA fan.Nelli, p. 8 'Citizens' of the Big Blue Nation often go to extremes in showing their support. It is not uncommon to see fans with everything from blue wigs to bodies covered in blue paint. While known for being fiercely loyal, these fans are at times impatient and highly critical of their teams. Former coach Tubby Smith drew the ire of his fan base because of a perceived decline in the quality of both recruiting and on-court play. On July 2, 2015, Sports Dating Inc., a company based in UK's home city of Lexington, launched BBNMeetup.com, an online dating site devoted to UK fans, with users allowed to create profiles before the site went fully live on July 15. The site will offer most features of mainstream dating sites, with an additional metric of \\"fandom\\" (i.e., level of enthusiasm for the Wildcats). The site's Twitter feed alleged that the user demand for the site was high enough to cause a server crash, although ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan dismissed that claim as \\"clever marketing\\". Records The UK men's basketball team was first in the nation in home court attendance from 1978 to 1984 and again from 1996 to 2004. In the intervening period from 1985 to 1995, they were led only by Syracuse University. After again finishing number 2 to Syracuse in 2005, the Wildcats reclaimed the top spot in 2006 and have led every year since (up to 2011). When the Wildcats also played Michigan State University in 'The Basketbowl' at Detroit's Ford Field on December 13, 2003, the game set the all-time attendance record for a men's college basketball game at 78,129. The game was also a 79-74 victory for the Wildcats.

It is an open tournament typically composed of various national teams. History The tournament started in 1967 in Moscow in the Soviet Union. The first edition of the tournament was held in 1967, in honour of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. It was the only time when the tournament was held in different cities at one time, namely in Moscow, Leningrad, and Voskresensk. Six teams participated in that tournament; two USSR teams, two ČSSR teams, a Canada team, and a Poland team. Sweden and Germany declined the invitation. The tournament is played in December every year, with the exception of 1974 and 1975 when its matches were spread out during the season. In 1992, the tournament was played in Saint Petersburg and, , some of its matches have been played in other European countries of the participating teams.

The Manasquan Inlet is an inlet that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Manasquan River, dividing the counties of Ocean County and Monmouth County in the state of New Jersey. Passage to Bay Head Harbor and the Barnegat Bay is possible via the Point Pleasant Canal. The present Manasquan River Inlet was dug in the 1920s with the original inlet located at Stockton Lake.Belmar Website, Residents > Municipal Boards > Environmental Commission >Natural Resources, Zone 5, http://www.belmar.com/Default.asp?Section_ID=623 The present day inlet is the northern terminus of the Intracoastal Waterway. The inlet is home to the Squan US Coast Guard station.  History  On Sunday April 5, 1778 a contingent of about 135 British troops and loyalists entered the inlet to sack and destroy the Union salt works. The raiders burnt the salt works, broke the kettles and ransacked the surrounding homes before retreating and heading north to raid salt works in the Shark River. The Union salt works were repaired and again attacked on the night of April 21, 1780 by a detachment of provincial troops, under the command of Lieut. Col. Laurence who had sailed south from Sandy Hook. The restored Squan lifesaving station at Ocean & 2nd avenues The present day location of the inlet is several thousand yards south of its location in 1868, the inlet had been near the former Manasquan Coast Guard Station which was adjacent to Stockton lake. The Manasquan inlet historically had always been shallow, which made it difficult for large boats to navigate. When the Point Pleasant Canal was dug in 1926, the Manasquan river's water rapidly flowed through the man-made opening disrupting the natural flow of the river, and this caused the inlet to completely close with sand for several years. The inlet's closure was so complete that it was possible to walk from Manasquan to Point Pleasant beach on dry ground. From 1926 to 1931 several efforts were made to reopen the inlet, including the use of high pressure water by the National Guard and local firemen to erode a narrow channel through the sand. These efforts failed to keep the channel open and the inlet remained closed. In 1930 work began to reopen the inlet. The Army Corps of Engineers put up temporary piers and began building jetties. The jetties were constructed with rock excavation from the Second Avenue Subway in Manhattan. The project cost $600,000 with funds from local, state and federal government. The inlet was officially reopened on August 29, 1931, with a parade of boats and was attended by New Jersey Governor Morgan F. Larson.  Surfing  The Manasquan Inlet is widely known as one of the best surf spots along the East Coast. Its popularity among beach breaks throughout the East Coast stems from the inlet, which directs and often enlarges the waves as they come in to create a great right break. Many competitions are held at the Manasquan Inlet throughout the year. One of the most popular is the Manasquan Classic Longboard Contest which is held in September of every year. In 2011, the competition celebrated its 19th annual competition with a paddle out on September 11, commemorating the attacks on the World Trade Center a decade ago.http://thesurfersview.com/index.php?view=venueevents&id;=19%3AManasquan+Classic+Longboard+contest&option;=com_eventlist&Itemid;=125 Hurricane Bill, whose swell hit the shores of Manasquan in August 2009, brought many big-time professional surfers to the Manasquan Inlet including Andy Irons, Pete Mendia, Sam Hammer, and Mike Gleason.http://espn.go.com/action/surfing/blog?post=4420406  References  Category:Bodies of water of Ocean County, New Jersey Category:Bodies of water of Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:Inlets of New Jersey Category:Intracoastal Waterway Category:Manasquan, New Jersey ","title":"Manasquan Inlet"},{"id":"6884147","text":"London United is a bus company operating mostly in west and south-west Greater London.

As part of the resulting agreement, it was agreed that the RATP Group, which had a minority shareholding in Transdev, would take over ownership of some of Transdev's operations in lieu of cash payment. This resulted in London United transferring to the RATP Group, while London Sovereign remained with Transdev and become part of the merged Veolia Transdev group.French moves in London Bus & Coach Professional 6 May 2010 This agreement took effect in March 2011, and RATP Group renamed its newly acquired business London United. Livery London United had an all red livery with a light grey skirt. This was later changed to all red to comply with Transport for London requirements. Garages London United operates eight bus garages. Fulwell (FW) Alexander RH bodied Volvo Olympian on route 281 in Hounslow in original London United livery in September 1998 History When new, the site was described as one of the finest plants in the country and was the main depot of London United Tramways with 20 covered tracks. The garage is nowadays divided into two sections, one used by London United, with an entrance off Wellington Road, and the other by Abellio London with an entrance off Stanley Road. Fulwell was the first garage in London to receive trolleybuses in 1931, and together with Isleworth was the last to operate them until 1962. The last trams operated from the depot in 1935, although some of the tram tracks were, until recently, still visible in the cobbled surface of the Stanley Road entrance. The garage has never reached its capacity, even taking in much of the work from Twickenham when it closed in 1970, and in 2001 107 buses were allocated. In 1999 the garage housed 13 London Country buses after Arriva Croydon & North Surrey shut its Leatherhead garage. The buses on route 85 were operated from the forecourt with Arriva drivers. Hounslow (AV) As of April 2020, Hounslow garage operates routes 110, 111, 116, 203, 423, H22, H98 and N9. History Hounslow garage was opened by the London General Omnibus Company in 1913 on the former site of the District Railway's Hounslow Town station. The garage along with many others was requisitioned in the First World War. Hounslow was the subject of two firsts in 1925 and 1930 with the first pneumatic tyre buses and the original Dennis Dart allocated respectively. The garage had one problem though: the roof was too low and only open toppers and single deck vehicles could use the depot until the mid-1930s when the roof was raised. A London Transport survey in 1947 found that 92 vehicles were allocated to Hounslow, a garage with a capacity of 72. This was mainly achieved by parking buses on a plot of land behind the garage that was also used to stand vehicles terminating there on layover. The garage was rebuilt in the early 1950s and included a new bus station in front of the garage. The planned allocation was now up to 120 vehicles, although the allocation in 2002 was 127. Hounslow's first one-man operated double deckers were MCW Metrobuses delivered in 1982 for routes 111 and 202. With the allocation still high, Hounslow runs a number of night services on behalf of other London United garages to enable it to fit the buses into the garage. It was also the first garage in London to operate a low-floor bus with the arrival of Wright Pathfinder bodied Dennis Lance SLF in December 1993.LLW1-10: London United countrybus.org There were plans to relocate the garage away from the town centre, and allow the expansion of the adjoining bus station. In 2005 an unsuccessful planning application for a site in Hanworth Road was lodged. This was largely due to a campaign by residents overlooking the site. In late 2007 the bus station in front of the garage was closed for rebuilding. The overall roof was removed and the eight bus bays demolished. In their place have been built just two stands for routes 120 and route 281. The other seven routes that previously served the bus station now stand on the garage forecourt (the old bus station) but pick up passengers in the road outside. One exception was route 81, where buses ran out of service to and from the bus stand at Isleworth Fire Station. This has since been discontinued and buses again layover on the former bus station. Hounslow Heath (HH) Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF with route 285 branding at Heathrow Airport in June 2004 As at June 2020, Hounslow Heath garage operate routes 105, 216 and 698. History Hounslow Heath was the original operating base of Stanwell Buses, a company set up by London Buses just prior to deregulation. They traded as Westlink, hence the garage code WK, and initially operated routes 116, 117 and 203 which were all joint Transport for London/Surrey County Council contracts. In 1999 Westlink was taken over by London United and recoded internally as HH. London Buses still use the code WK. The depot has also been extended over the former Travellers Coaches yard next door. Park Royal (RP) As at January 2018, Park Royal garage operated routes 18, 220, 283, 398, 440, E11, H17 and N18. History Park Royal was opened by NCP Challenger on 26 May 2007, on the site of the former Metroline garage (HR) in Atlas Road, Park Royal, which had closed in 2005. The garage is actually located in a three places boundary, which are Park Royal, North Acton and Old Oak Common. Shepherd's Bush (S) As of June 2017, Shepherd's Bush garage operated routes 70, 72, 94, 148, 220 and C1. On 5 March 2016, route N97 was taken over by Tower Transit.\\"Two routes to change operators in March\\" Buses issue 726 September 2015 page 18 History Shepherd's Bush garage opened in 1906. Stamford Brook (V) Scania OmniDekka on route 27 in April 2006 with Transdev signwriting As at April 2020, Stamford Brook garage operated routes 9, 211, 272, 306, 391, E3, H91 and N9.. History Stamford Brook opened as a bus garage in 1980 after a two-year construction. Originally built as Chiswick Tram depot, it had latterly been used to operate the British European Airways bus service between Heathrow Airport and the West London Air Terminal on Cromwell Road. The original plan was to create a temporary home for the Riverside garage buses and staff whilst that garage was re-built with a view to taking on the workload from Mortlake and Turnham Green which were to close. However this idea was changed and the garage took on the work from Turnham Green which closed and also inherited the garage code V. Following service reductions, Mortlake and Riverside closed in 1983, with some of their work moving to Stamford Brook. In 1981 Stamford Brook took on Airbus routes A1 and A2 following the withdrawal of the existing British Airways services between Heathrow Airport and central London. These vehicles were transferred in 1994 to West Ramp (which became an outstation of V) leaving the garage with an allocation of MCW Metroriders, MCW Metrobuses, Leyland Olympians and Dennis Darts. The garage closed in 1996 and became a store for unlicensed buses held for possible future use. In 1999 it reopened to cater for increased demand in the area. In 2001 the allocation consisted entirely of Dennis Darts. When route 9 was converted from AEC Routemaster to one man operation in September 2004, it moved from Shepherds Bush, and East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodied Volvo B7TL double deckers appeared. Tolworth (TV) Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF on route K2 in Chessington in June 2008 with Transdev signwriting As at June 2020, Tolworth garage operates routes 71, 85, 265, 406, 418, 465, K1, K2, K4 and K5. History Tolworth is one of the newest London bus garages and was built on the site of a former coal yard behind Tolworth railway station. Tolworth was originally planned in the late 1990s following the closure of Kingston Garage and the announcement that the site was to be part sold off and part converted into the new bus station. A recruitment centre was opened on Tolworth Broadway long before building work ever started. The sale of the Kingston site was brought forward somewhat, and this appeared to catch out the operator as Tolworth Garage was not yet ready. Buses were temporarily parked in a car park in Kingston until the new 100 capacity bus garage opened in early 2002. Route K5 transferred to Tolworth from Quality Line on 25th January 2020. Routes 406, 418 and 465 transferred to Tolworth from Quality Line on 25th April 2020. Twickenham (NC) History Twickenham garage was opened by NCP Challenger on 12 November 2005.

It was used as short- and medium wave transmission site. For the medium wave transmissions, which took place on 1557 kHz with a transmission power of 600 kW, it had two guyed masts, insulated against ground, which were guyed with polymeric guyes. The short wave antennas were mounted on free-standing lattice towers. Direction was achieved by different slewing of the various antennae available. Originally, the medium wave antenna consisted of three masts, each 88 metres tall, but at one mast one (Parafil) guy melted as a result of the high electric field values halfway up from the anchor point. Unfortunately there was also a storm at this time, which resulted in mast collapse. This was later replaced. Delimara Transmitter was shut down in 1996. The site is now a nature reserve.

It was established in 1917, and by 1954 the entire factory area employed 10,000 workers. At one time it was the world's largest factory, when it employed 3,200 workers. Fort Dunlop, the main building of the former factory area, is next to the M6 motorway, near to junction 5. It is a Grade A locally listed building. It was designed by Sidney Stott and W. W. Gibbings in the 1920s. The building's use was the storage of tyres and was called Base stores. An almost identical building housing administrative and general offices was located on Wood Lane. Dunlop Tyres now occupies a small part of the building. History The Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd was set up in Birmingham in 1901 to manufacture Dunlop tyres, initially for bicycles and later for motor vehicles. The First World War initiated a huge expansion in the demand for solid tyres for lorries, and the Fort Dunlop factory was built in 1916 on a 120-hectare site on the east side of Birmingham. Post-war, the motor industry grew and Dunlop was well placed to supply the demand for tyres. In the 1970s it was still the largest tyre factory outside the United States, however, the increased number of foreign cars imported into Britain led to a decline in demand, the company was sold in the 1980s and large-scale tyre production ceased at Fort Dunlop.Hudson, Kenneth: Industrial history from the air, Cambridge University Press 1984 Dunlop Tyres continued to produce specialised vintage, motorcycle and motorsport tyres on the site. The factory was to close in September 2014, with production moving to Germany and France.Dunlop Motorsport Manufacturing Plant to Close - Sportscar365, 3 February 2014 Redevelopment The company Urban Splash acquired the building and the of land from English Partnerships in 1999 and started work developing proposals in conjunction with Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency who funded the reclamation of the land. Urban Splash possess the building by a 999-year lease from Advantage West Midlands. The Fort Dunlop building, derelict for twenty years (with the exterior used as advertising space), has been redeveloped into an office and retail space with an adjoining Travelodge hotel. Work on the redevelopment commenced in December 2004. It now has of office space within the main building as well as recreational leisure space. There are also 1,150 basement and surface car parking spaces. The developers were Urban Splash and the architects were Liverpool-based Hazel Rounding of shedkm. The landscape designer for the building's setting was Martha Schwartz Inc. By March 2005, all windows and poor quality extensions were removed to reveal the shell. The steel structure which would house the 100-bed Travelodge hotel began construction and the largest advertisement hoarding in the world at that time was constructed on the front of the building. The steel structure was completed in June 2005 along with the roof structure. The concrete was added to the steel structure two months later. They were manufactured offsite and transported to the building where they were fitted into place. They contained the circular holes on one side to allow for the circular windows. By the end of 2005, the windows were being added to the inside of the building. The outside structure was left as it was and the glass structure was built behind it. The assembly work had been completed to the adjacent structure and work had begun to paint it dark blue with a sign saying \\"FORT DUNLOP\\" added to the top of the structure by March 2006. The sign is illuminated at night The skyline signage, with its programmable, RGB LED illumination resulted in three separate industry awards for ASG, the company that designed, manufactured and installed the structures. By June 2006, the windows had been fitted to the Travelodge and the hotel opened to the public. Window work on the inside of the old building was being completed and the floor layouts were being defined. Fort Dunlop opened by a ceremony on 1 December 2006. The roof was covered by soil and grass, the largest such grass roof in the United Kingdom; it provides natural insulation and a wildlife reserve. In August 2006, Urban Splash announced that three retail companies were to move to Fort Dunlop; house accessory specialist Dwell, relocating from the Custard Factory, Snap Galleries and a Birmingham-based coffee outlet named The Daily Grind Coffee Company. Another company, Boxer, a design consultancy, was announced as the first tenant, relocating from their base in Coleshill. In 2015, Fort Dunlop had over 30 businesses in its office space, including: Trinity Mirror Midlands; Whistle PR; Ford Retail; Skills First; Nicol Thomas; and Overbury. In 2017, Trinity Mirror Midlands relocated back to Birmingham City Centre having occupied the entire 6th floor of the building – all 53,582 sq ft. At over one acre in area, it was the largest open plan office space in the country outside of London. During 2018, the 6th floor was refurbished offering the largest available floor plate in Birmingham at over 27,000 sq ft. https://www.fortdunlop.com/ Architecture The early structure is of concrete, clad to a steel frame. Upon redevelopment, it was found that the steel frame had moved no more than , a reflection of the quality of construction. The building is deep. The south side measures in height and in width. The extension housing the Travelodge hotel extends from the building, and has a width of . The northern facade is of slightly different architecture from the remainder of the building as it was damaged during World War II by bombing raids by the Luftwaffe. A circular light well was constructed from the roof to the atrium at the reception, allowing natural light to illuminate the middle of the building. At each floor, the light well is lined with steel to represent the industrial heritage of the building.

Its flagship store, at 228 East Main Street in downtown Rochester, also housed its headquarters and featured an elegant executive dining room on the top floor. History The Department Store Years Rufus Sibley, Alexander Lindsay, and John Curr were employees at the Hogg, Brown & Taylor dry-goods store in Boston. Wishing to go into business for themselves, they investigated potential sites and settled on the growing city of Rochester. Their first storefront, often called \\"the Boston store\\" by locals, opened in 1868. When the company opened a new 12-story, flagship store in the Granite Building, it was among the five largest department stores in the country at the time. The Sibley Building In 1905, after the disastrous 1904 \\"Sibley fire\\" gutted the Granite Building and much of Rochester's dry goods district, Sibley's moved to its final location, the Sibley Building at the northeast corner of East Main Street and Clinton Avenue. By 1939, Sibley's was the largest department store between New York City and Chicago. In 1962, competitors B. Forman Co. and McCurdy's collaborated to construct Midtown Plaza, right across Main Street from Sibley's. Sibley's was connected to the new mall by an enclosed third-floor walkway, part of the Rochester Skyway system. The company was acquired by the Associated Dry Goods Corporation in 1957, which, in turn, was acquired by May Department Stores in 1986. The Sibley's name was merged into May Company's Kaufmann's name in 1990. Most of its suburban locations, after converting to Kaufmann's, became part of Macy's by 2006.

In most cases this includes domesticated animals and not pets. Under early English common law, estrays were forfeited to the king or lord of the manor; under modern statutes, provision is made for taking up stray animals and acquiring either title to them or a lien for the expenses incurred in keeping them. A person taking up an estray has a qualified ownership in it, which becomes absolute if the owner fails to claim the animal within the statutory time limit. Whether the animal escaped through the owner's negligence or through the wrongful act of a third person is immaterial. If the owner reclaims the estray, he is liable for reasonable costs of its upkeep. The use of an estray during the period of qualified ownership, other than for its own preservation or for the benefit of the owner, is not authorized. Some statutes limit the right to take up estrays to certain classes of persons, to certain seasons or places, or to animals requiring care. When public officials, such as a county sheriff impound stray animals, they may sell them at auction to recover the costs of upkeep, with proceeds, if any, going into the public treasury. In some places, an uncastrated male livestock animal running at large may be neutered at the owner's expense. It is common in the US for there to be a required \\"Notice of Estray\\" sworn and filed in a local office. The process usually takes a prescribed time to permit the property owner to collect his property. Otherwise, the finder obtains title to the property.

The primary producers of kabuki theater signboards and other promotional materials, the Torii were among those whose work led to the development of ukiyo-e. Their style was one of the primary influences in the ukiyo-e depiction of actors and kabuki scenes for much of the 18th century. Still today, kabuki signboards are sometimes painted by members of the Torii family. History Torii Kiyonobu - Courtesan painting a screen The Torii style truly emerged with Torii Kiyonobu I, who came to Edo in 1687. The Torii family had already been active in the kabuki world, in Osaka, for several generations at this point. He studied under Yoshida Hanbei and Hishikawa Moronobu, and brought a kabuki sensibility to their artistic styles. Moronobu's work was already dramatic and energetic, but Kiyonobu added to this with a further emphasis on action, and on the types of poses (see mie) and aesthetics one would see on the kabuki stage. For many years, Kiyonobu and his actor father Torii Kiyomoto produced primarily theater signboards, book illustrations, and promotional materials for the theaters. It was not until 1700 that the Torii began to create full-size paintings and prints that could be interpreted as independent works of art. Of course, many still depicted actors and the kabuki world, and could therefore be construed as serving as promotional materials. But by this time Kiyonobu, and his successor Torii Kiyonobu II, were also producing paintings and prints of courtesans, erotic scenes, and sumo. Even as the Torii school expanded, and began to produce works in the increasingly popular form of paintings and prints, the core purpose of the clan remained the production of billboards, posters, and other theatrical works. As such, Kiyonobu, and the heads of the clan after him, worked primarily on these types of works, leaving relatively few paintings and prints. Torii Kiyomasu – Sanjo Kantaro Torii Kiyomasu, and his successors, would represent something of a departure from the theatrical and energetic core style of the Torii school. Taking Sugimura Jihei as a role model, rather than Moronobu, Kiyomasu produced works far softer, more delicate and graceful than those of many other Torii artists. Nevertheless, many works by these other artists, who produced more dramatic works in Kiyonobu's style, are signed \\"Kiyomasu\\". Even as other schools and styles emerged over the course of the 18th century, the Torii style remained at the core of ukiyo-e. It was something every artist had to either embrace and elaborate on, or to reject entirely. The Torii style, even in paintings and prints, continued to be derived directly from the clan's work for the kabuki theaters. Their style was bombastic, dramatic, and somewhat idealized. One of the primary elements of their particular style was the use of bold, thick lines, attracting the eye of the viewer, and giving the composition an overall boldness. This element was embraced by a number of artists, particularly the Kaigetsudō school. Torii Kiyomasu II - Ichikawa Ebizō aitsutome moshi soro Torii Kiyonobu II and Kiyomasu II, the second generation of the school, saw it to its climax. Both artists were active from the 1720s to the 1760s, and consolidated the bolder style of Kiyonobu with the more graceful, delicate style of Kiyomasu. They helped develop the Torii style away from the early, primitive forms of Moronobu and into something that formed a key part of the mainstream style of ukiyo-e. They also, however, experimented with the use of urushi-e, using lacquer for deeper, bolder lines, and brass or other metal dust to add a sparkle to their works. Torii school artists used a color called \\"tan-e\\", a lead-based orange color, to achieve tones for clothing and body tones. However, Kiyonobu II used color contrasts like pink-green, rather than the yellow-orange contrast used by his masters. The works of Torii Kiyohiro, Kiyomitsu, and Kiyotsune, all active in the 1750s to 1770s, continued the tradition of their forebears. By this point, the school more or less defined the core of mainstream ukiyo-e style. These artists' figures are more graceful and delicate, and less bold, than those of their predecessors. But they were also some of the first to experiment with benizuri-e, or \\"rose prints\\"; at this time, printers began to use color on the woodblocks, coloring the prints directly during production, instead of by hand afterwards. Up to five different colors could be used in one print, but the overall effect was still far simpler than the nishiki-e (multicolored \\"brocade\\" prints) which would emerge later. The artistic developments and adaptions by Kiyomitsu, allowed for a specific style of the Torii School, which was called \\"Ie-No-Ho.\\" With students learning directly from their masters, knowledge was passed down from master to student in the manner of \\"Ie-No-Ho\\". While there was a set \\"style\\", each head artist of the school had their own personal approach and subtle changes. For example, Kiyonobu II printed rather than painted like his predecessors, because of the new medium of the woodblock print. Katsukawa Shunshō and Sharaku, two of the greatest artists to reject the Torii style, pioneered attempts to represent the theater, and actors, realistically. They continued to instill a great degree of drama and bombast into their works, but showed actors as actors, not as the roles which they played. Most crucially, they depicted artists as individuals, representing facial features and actors' personalities such that each individual actor could be identified despite their role, and the makeup and costume that went with it. Though these artists were extremely successful, and eclipsed the Torii artists to some extent, the Torii remained influential and successful as well. In the 1770s, Torii Kiyonaga emerged as the new great artist of his time, bringing the Torii school back to the forefront, but presenting his own unique stylistic adaptations. Kiyonaga would come to be regarded as one of the greatest of all ukiyo-e artists, but also the last of the great Torii artists. He retained much of the core of the Torii style, the drama, energy, and theatrical sensibility, but sought a degree of realism and individuality in his depictions of actors even beyond what Sharaku and Shunshō attained. He depicted the urban culture of Edo with a realism previously unseen, and is widely credited with perfecting or mastering many other elements of the ukiyo-e genre. However, he too retired from the world of prints to focus on the theater signboards which were the true work of the Torii school. Though Kiyonaga is generally regarded as the final great master of the Torii school, the school continued to produce theater materials, paintings and prints; more importantly, Kiyonaga's style, and that of his predecessors, continued to influence the next wave of ukiyo-e artists.

The facility contains sections of three levels of security. The average daily population in September 2006 was approximately 3,100. At Westville, 49% of the inmate population are people of color, slightly higher than the average of 42% for the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC) as a whole.  History  Westville's history actually begins not with the opening of a new state prison but with the opening of a twenty- million dollar mental facility named the Northern Indiana Hospital (now the Logansport State Hospital). Created by the Indiana General Assembly in 1945, the facility admitted both mental patients and the criminally insane from Alaska and Indiana. Two years later, the hospital was renamed after Dr. Norman M. Beatty, a pioneer in hospital sanitation and a leading activist for improving mental health facilities. The hospital housed roughly 1750 patients in the civil section and around 500 patients in the maximum-security portion. Patients ages six and up were admitted into the hospital. Contained within the facility was an accredited school, bowling alley, beauty and barber shop, power plant, sewage disposal plant, fire department and security force. The hospital also helped students from the surrounding community benefit from internships in psychology, music, occupational, vocational and recreational therapy and nursing programs.Document on history of Westville Correctional Facility. Contact the prison's public telephone number at (219)785 2511 to request a copy. In 1977, legislation was passed that transformed the Norman Beatty Mental Hospital from a mental facility into a prison, the Westville Correctional Facility. In addition to the change in the type of residents at the facility, there was also a change in the type of care provided. This change was significant for the facility due to the vast difference between the two types of institutions. Through the two-year period between 1977 and 1979, the proportion of inmates increased and the number of mental patients decreased until, in June 1979, only inmates remained.Document on time line of events at Westville Correctional Facility. Contact the prison's public telephone number at (219) 785 2511 to request a copy. Following the final transition into a prison came the construction of education and industrial complexes, gymnasium, multi-purpose building and chapel. In addition, a fence, extra lighting and watch towers were added for security reasons. Soon, what was originally intended to be a medium-security prison housing 1,200 inmates became a prison with inmates ranging from trustee offenders to maximum security and a population of over 3,000.  Programs  Westville offers a wide variety of programs to help rehabilitate inmates and give back to the community. Perhaps the most important program is the prison's educational program, Reintegration into Society through Education (RISE). The inmates have the opportunity to take programs on ELS, general literacy, GED, and vocational programs in auto body, building trades, culinary arts, electronics and many others. One of the prison's stated philosophies is that the best way for a prisoner to reenter society is through education. Another program offered by Westville is Thinking for a Change, a course that attempts to teach inmates \\"an objective systematic approach to identifying thinking, beliefs, attitudes and values.\\" However, at most, the inmates will usually only attend these \\"education opportunities\\" once a week. So, as far as the value of the education, that remains a separate issue.Virtual Tour of Westville Correctional Facility. This course is an elective through a life changing program called Therapeutic Community at Westville Correctional Facility. \\"TC\\" is an intensive, peer driven, highly structured program that enforces cognitive thinking changes along with addiction education. This program aims to teach inmates positive social skills and to change the core thinking to more constructive and beneficial behaviors. In addition to these programs, other courses on substance abuse, transitioning from prison life back into society and many others are offered. Since the DOC began giving time cuts for inmates that complete certain educational programs, many have obtained earlier releases. The facility focuses on keeping fathers connected with their children while in prison through programs such as Inside Out Dads, a program developed for prisons by the National Fatherhood Initiative (http://www.fatherhood.org/) which tries to help offenders develop better parenting and fatherhood skills in order to become more involved with their children. The prison has a children's library for the fathers to use while visiting with their children. TC also has a new program aimed at helping offenders learn to manage money, become debt free, and to save and spend wisely. Dave Ramsey's nationally known program, Financial Peace University is now being taught within the Therapeutic Community. FPU is a biblically based curriculum that teaches offenders how to handle money God's ways. A new program introduced by the prison is Mixed Up Mutts, which allows inmates to work with stray dogs and teach them basic obedience skills. The prison hopes that this program gives the inmates a very satisfying interaction with animals and that it has a general positive effect on them. Sadly, the funding dried up and the program was cancelled. The prison also has many different industrial programs such as the Lions Club Eyeglass Recycling Program, Compost Recycling Program and Prison Enterprise Network (PEN). The Lions Club Program has inmates sort through and clean donated glasses which are then sorted by prescription. So far the program has processed over two million pairs of glasses. The Compost Program allows inmates to develop skills for using machinery from \\"shovels and rakes to operation of heavy equipment\\" while processing the compost in the surrounding area of the prison. The PEN program offers inmates the opportunity to make a range of different products that are sold both within the prison and commercially.  Lawsuits  For Westville's relatively short history, it has had several prominent legal battles. In 1988, the prison was ordered to move 130 female inmates to other state facilities in order to comply with a lawsuit filed claiming that women received unfair treatment at the prison. According to several inmates, the women at Westville were not allowed options such as work opportunities outside the facility, General Equivalency Diploma program and literacy program.Morrison, Patrick T. \\"130 Female Inmates to Move from Westville.\\" Indystar, 2 February 1988. As recently as 2004, Westville faced two legal battles, both pertaining to violations of freedoms. The first dealt with an officer assigned to the vehicle trap, Nancy Spiegla, who began to notice suspicious activity by two officers outside the gates of the prison. Spiegla witnessed two officers transferring large bags from cars. When the officers attempted to enter the facility, Speigla demanded that she be allowed to search their car, which was a routine duty of hers. However, the officers argued that law enforcement vehicles were exempt from this rule and rejected the car search. Later, Speigla decided to inform the assistant superintendent about the incident but was surprised when nothing was done about the matter and she was demoted to a lower-ranking position with a pay cut. Speigla pursued her complaint in court, which ultimately ruled in her favor. However, she was never given back her original position.Patterson, James. \\"Court Decks DOC, Strikes Blow for Free Speech.\\" Indystar 19 June 2004. This story brought attention to a major problem at Westville: drug trafficking by staff.Patterson, James. \\"Still Suffering in Prison Despite Doubts About Guilt.\\" Indystar 28 June 2004. The second case involved Robert Badelle #7130 , an inmate at Westville, and a letter he wrote to the superintendent. In 1977, Badelle had been charged with murder and sentenced to a prison term of thirty years, even though Badelle and two Indiana police officers maintain that he is innocent. Upset one night about his imprisonment, Badelle decided to write the superintendent a letter in which he explained his discontent and his thoughts of escaping. On reading the letter, the superintendent alerted the DOC and five extra years were added onto Badelle's sentence. \\"The DOC claimed that mentioning one's intent to flee is the same as trying to escape…\\" Badelle filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and won, and the added sentence was removed. In addition to this, the court ruled that Badelle should indeed be transferred to another prison. According to Badelle's lawyer, Westville is a very dangerous \\"hellhole\\" and is only meant for \\"short-termers\\" and younger men. The most controversial lawsuit involved inmate Donald W. Holtz #863446 . In August 1986, Holtz was committed to the \\"Psychiatric Unit\\" of Westville because of an alleged suicide threat. Once there, he was put on several medications; however, no doctor examination was administered before or after he began taking the medication. After almost 17 months of taking the medication, Holtz one day refused to take his medications. He was then placed in a four-way restraint and given medication through a series of shots, all while remaining in seclusion for three days. He then filed suit over the inhumane conditions at the facility including overcrowding, beds placed fewer than 18 inches part and, worst of all, staff who failed to intervene in fights or sexual assaults.Donald W. Holtz, Jr. Statements about Westville On April 29, 2009, Westville Correctional Facility was sued by a former correctional officer, Nathan M. Smith, who was dismissed in January 2009 when he told an Internal Affairs officer that he requested a lawyer be present before being questioned about an undisclosed incident. In his lawsuit , Smith alleges Westville and its public information officer John Schrader violated Indiana's Access to Public Records Act (\\"APRA\\") when Schrader failed to disclose certain records relating to his dismissal and other alleged incidents that occurred while Smith was employed at Westville.Nathan M. Smith vs Westville Correctional Facility et al, Case #46D03-0904-MI-198, LaPorte County Superior Court  Incidents  In May 2007, Officer Ashley S. Porter was injured on the job while performing her duties. Westville failed to grant her workers compensation and a suit was filed against the company for wrongful termination, harassment and medical bills accrued during her treatment for the work-related injury. The case is currently open. In April 2000, an inmate from Westville, Phillip Woods #885529 , entered an industrial dishwasher and according to his mother, came out looking like a \\"skinned squirrel\\".Higgins, Will. \\"For Burned Inmate, Death Was Merciful; Now the Lawsuit?\\" Associated Press 12 July 2002. Normally, the dishwasher is set to a temperature of around 150 degrees Fahrenheit but it had recently been moved up to 180 degrees on the recommendation of a recent health department visit. After Woods woke from his coma, he blamed the Aryan Brotherhood, a group of inmates at the prison, for his injuries. The DOC maintains that Woods had in the past gone into the dishwasher voluntary to win bets and that this occasion was no different. Woods died in the hospital in July 2002, two years after he was released, from complications from burns received during the incident. Drug trafficking by staff was a problem at the facility in 1996. The Indiana State Police were observed frequently at the gates used by staff to enter the facility to conduct K-9 drug checks of vehicles and staff entering the facility. The water was turned off twice within the years 2013-2015. The first was caused by the water tower on grounds malfunctioning. The second was a pipe burst behind the educational complex. Westville had to bring in outside contractors to fix the problem. Offenders were given bottled water, at the staffs' leisure, and were still able to use toilets during the incident, at most twice a day. The offenders who used plastic bags to replace the toilet were not instructed to, since water was shut off and staff refused inmates basic human necessity to relieve themselves, and instead instructed the inmates to use the non-functioning toilets. This caused the inmates to use bags provided with their sack lunches, which are months old and keep on the freezer, to defecate into. Once visitors saw what was happening the prison quickly turned the water on.

In October 2020, the Isle of Man Cricket Association planned to establish its first ever women's team. History 2018-Present In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Isle of Man and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 are full T20I. Isle of Man played their first official T20I on 21 August 2020 against Guernsey. International competition Since joining the ICC in 2004 the Isle of Man have the following record in official tournaments: *2005: European Division Three – 8th place *2007: European Division Three – 3rd place *2009: European Division Three – 2nd place *2011: European Division Two – 3rd place *2012: European Division Two – Winners *2013: European Division One – 9th place *2014: European Division Two – 5th place *2018: T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier Group B – 6th place  Four Islands tournament The Island participated in the Four Islands Tournament with Guernsey, Isle of Wight & Jersey in 2000, 2002 and 2004. Their most successful of which was in 2000 when they beat Jersey and finished as runners up to Guernsey in the final. *2000 – 2nd *2002 – 3rd *2004 – 2nd Early ICC Era The Manx cricket team, based in the Isle of Man, joined the ICC in 2004, playing their first ICC affiliated competitions in 2005. Previously the national sides had played fixtures against the MCC, on tour in the UK and against touring sides to the Isle of Man. The first international engagement for the Isle of Man came in 2005 at the European Affiliates Championship. The side was captained by Rob Webber, with the management team of Dougie Hind and Colin Jones. They finished in eighth place in this tournament, which originally meant a demotion to Division Four in the newly expanded five division European Championship. However, when the divisions were announced, the Isle of Man had a place in Division Three for 2007. As they had a year without competitive international cricket in 2006, the Isle of Man arranged two one-day friendly matches against Spain played at La Manga Club Ground at the end of September/beginning of October, both of which they won. In 2007 under Webber, Jones and coach Harvey Anderson, they finished third in the European Division Three, defeating Belgium, Malta (twice) & Cyprus. They were beaten by Spain in the semi-final by fewer wickets lost after a tie on runs. In the 3/4th play-off they recorded a 7 wicket win over Malta. Details on European Division Three 2007 in Belgium can be found in the European Cricket Tournaments archive – Gareth Dawson Era In 2008, The Isle of Man cricket association appointed Gareth Dawson, brother of former test spinner Richard, as head coach of the Isle of Man cricket team.

The novel tells the story of Wilma, who wishes to be the most popular girl at her school, Claverford, forgetting that she will graduate in three weeks and move to a new school. Plot synopsis Middle schooler Wilma Sturtz is alone. Her childhood friends have moved away, and her efforts to make new ones have failed. Wilma's fortunes change when she offers an old lady her seat on the subway. The woman offers to grant Wilma one wish, exactly as Wilma wishes it. Flustered, Wilma wishes to be the most popular person at Claverford, her middle school. The wish is granted to Wilma's surprise. She befriends a group of popular girls, along with a budding friendship with a boy named Jared. However, a loophole is revealed; Wilma's wish was granted exactly as she wished for it, so she is not popular to students outside of Claverford, or to students from other schools. Even worse, her wish will expire the day they graduate from the school. Wilma attempts to embrace her wish and find the old lady. The wish wears off as soon as Wilma goes back to her house with her friends--by this time, they have all graduated. She reveals what she wished to her \\"friends,\\" but realizes that if she wishes to remain friends with them or even to have her wish renewed, she'd be forcing them to do something against their will; without the wish, they wouldn't have befriended Wilma willingly. After telling Jared this, he says that she wasted a wish and could have wished for something better--such as a pet porpoise. Wilma finds the old lady again, but is not given another wish again because her previous one was fulfilled. Wilma tells a kid boarding the bus to help the old lady on the bus, because \\"it will be worth it.\\" Background Gail Carson Levine wanted to get as much material for this book as possible, as she had skipped eighth grade herself. To make up for missing personal experiences, she interviewed a group of eighth graders about school, friends, and relationships. Reception The Wish was a 2001 International Reading Association (IRA)/Children's Book Council (CBC) Children's Choice and a 2002 IRA Young Adult's Choice. The Wish also appeared on the NYT Extended Children's Bestseller list. Publishers Weekly said of The Wish in a May 2000 review, \\"Levine turns from fairy godmothers in the Brothers Grimm era to modern-day magic in this provocative meditation on what it means to be popular.\\" A USA Today review also praised the book saying, \\"Levine, the author of Newbery Honor Book Ella Enchanted, writes with great sympathy and humor about the elusive nature of popularity. And middle school readers from every spot in the pecking order will sympathize with Wilma's efforts to be comfortable in her own skin.\\" References External links *Gail Carson Levine's official website *The Wish at HarperCollins Category:2000 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels set in schools Category:2000 children's books ","title":"The Wish (novel)"},{"id":"6884324","text":"Gerald Harvey Humphries (8 December 1908 – 3 February 1983) was an English first-class cricketer who played two matches for Worcestershire in the 1930s.

Waterloo Street (Chinese: 滑铁卢街) is a two-way street in downtown Singapore stretching from Rochor Road to Bras Basah Road. It passes through the planning areas of Rochor and Museum Planning Area. The street was constructed in 1837 and was initially named Church Street after Thomas Church, who became a resident councillor that same year. A survey of this street was done by J.T. Thomson, and it is very likely that he used Church's name for the street due to the close working relationship between the two of them. The street name was renamed to its present name by the Municipal Council in 1858 to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory over the French in 1815, the Battle of Waterloo. Formerly a one-way street, the street has been converted to a two- way street and the northern end of the street has been converted into a pedestrian mall to ease the problem of traffic jams, as well as the crowd at Kwan Im Thong Hood Co Temple, which was most packed during the weekends and public holidays. The street, which previously extended to Stamford Road, has been shortened after the construction of the Singapore Management University's city campus and the MRT station. There are several well-known landmarks, including the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple, Maghain Aboth Synagogue, Sculpture Square, and Sri Krishnan Temple. The Maghain Aboth Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Singapore and was built by the local Jewish community in 1878. The Tamils call the street krishmen kovil sadakku or \\"Street of the Krishnan Temple\\", where the Sri Krishnan Temple is located next to the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple. The street is known as mang ku lu chai tng koi in Hokkien, which means the street in Bencoolen where the vegetarian hall is. Waterloo Street is parallel to North Bridge Road, Victoria Street, and Queen Street (in sequence); these were previously the major roads to the city. As the road names were too difficult to pronounce for the locals, they simply called them Toa Beh Lo, Tzee Beh Lo, and Sa Beh Lo which means \\"the big (first) road\\", \\"the second road\\", \\"the third road\\". The Hokkiens and Teochews call Waterloo Street si beh lo which simply means \\"the fourth road\\".

Founded in 1901, the company was acquired by May Department Stores in 1994, but as a result of an antitrust settlement due to both McCurdy's and May's Kaufmann's stores being the predominant anchors in the area shopping malls, its stores were divested to The Bon-Ton Department store chain. History McCurdy's was started as McCurdy and Norwell Co. in 1901 by John Cooke McCurdy, who came to Rochester by way of Philadelphia and Ireland. The store was located at the corner of Main and Elm streets. This location would later would form the basis of a mall at the location when Gilbert McCurdy, along with fellow department store owner Maurice Forman of B. Forman Co., helped found Rochester's Midtown Plaza, where its flagship store would be incorporated in and become the main anchor of the mall.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/rocroots/2014/11/21/whatever- happened-mccurdys/19372903/ Other locations would later be in Pittsford, New York, Greece, New York in Long Ridge Mall and Northgate Plaza, Irondequoit, New York in Irondequoit mall, Henrietta, New York in The Marketplace Mall, Geneva, New York in Town and Country Plaza, and Victor, New York in Eastview Mall. The Northgate store made McCurdy's the first Rochester department store to open in the suburbs when it opened in 1953. McCurdy's was a medium to high priced establishment, in direct competition with Sibley, Lindsay and Curr (later just Sibley's). To make themselves accessible to all, the Midtown, Long Ridge (now Greece Ridge), and Eastview Malls had \\"budget stores\\" which ran seconds, closeouts, and special merchandise at prices just above the discount houses, but with McCurdy's service and cachet. The midtown location also contained a bakery and restaurant. McCurdy’s bought fellow Rochester-based department store B. Forman’s in 1968. The purchase gave McCurdy’s sole control of Midtown; previously control of the mall had been divided between the two. McCurdy's continued to operate both stores until 1994.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/02/06/whatever- happened-forman-co/79897404/ The 1989 Acquisition of Elmira, NY based Iszard's would later offer expansion into Elmira and Ithaca areas. McCurdy & Co. borrowed $4.5 million in January 1994 from the City of Rochester, citing a need for working capital, and giving a mortgage on the McCurdy Midtown building as security.Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, 1/29/1994 In July 1994, McCurdy's and B. Forman Co. closed. It was announced that four McCurdy locations would be sold to the May Company, and all B. Forman Co. stores would be closed.Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, 7/6/1994 The going-out-of-business sale at McCurdy's and B. Forman started a few days later.Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, 7/10/1994 The Midtown Plaza location (McCurdy's main store) and Sibley's main store were directly across the street from each other on East Main Street in downtown Rochester, although McCurdy's was a bit more conservative in merchandising. Midtown's most striking feature was the mechanical \\"Clock of Nations\\" in the main floor atrium. Rising two stories, the clock featured mechanical dolls that would circle the main clock on the hour with a country highlighted each hour. The dolls were housed in capsules featuring a door that would open and close to reveal the dolls. The highlighted country's capsule would be illuminated, and a melody appropriate to the country would play. Generations of children (and adults) sat in the atrium in eager anticipation each hour. When Midtown's patronage dwindled, stores were closing, and the future was obvious, the clock became a cause celebré all across the region. The clock was moved to the Greater Rochester International Airport terminal in 2008. References * Folklore and Legends of Rochester: The Mystery of Hoodoo Corner and Other Tales - Michael T.

Burgett (April 5, 1925 – March 23, 2017) was a writer and a former World War II paratrooper. He was among the Airborne troopers who landed in Normandy early on the morning of D-Day. He was a member of the 101st Airborne Division, (\\"The Screaming Eagles\\"), and the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Burgett served in Company A, 1st Battalion, 506th PIR as both a rifleman and a machine-gunner. Life Burgett was born in Detroit, Michigan and grew up on the west side of Detroit. In the opening paragraph of Currahee!, he stated that his older brother Elmer had joined the Paratroops in 1942, and that he, Donald, was determined to follow his older brother. Burgett volunteered to be called up as soon as he turned 18 the following year. On May 3, 1943 he reported to the Induction Center where he officially volunteered for the Paratroops, signing the statement \\"I do hereby volunteer to jump from a plane, while in flight and land on the ground via parachute.\\" In Kansas he went through Basic Combat Training, and then reported to Fort Benning, Georgia for Airborne training. After completion of his training at Fort Benning, he joined the 101st at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana.

After just a few weeks' rest, he was again sent into combat, this time at the Battle of the Bulge, where the 101st, along with Combat Command B of the U.S. 10th Armored Division and the all African-American 969th Artillery Battalion (Cld)(155mm How Trac-D) successfully held out against nine German armored divisions during the siege of Bastogne. Burgett went on to fight through Operation Nordwind, on into Germany to the Ruhr Valley, the Rhineland, and Bavaria, where he helped capture Hitler's mountain retreat in southern Germany. While in action with the 101st, Burgett was wounded three times and had his M1 rifle shot out of his hands at least twice. He was one of only eleven men out of the original 200 in his company to survive from D-Day in Normandy to the war's end. Burgett lived in Howell, Michigan. In addition to writing four books, he has also done a number of History Channel specials on World War II. Burgett died on March 23, 2017.

It is one of the six tribal development blocks of Churachandpur district in Manipur state. Parbung is the sub- divisional block headquarters. Tipaimukh is the 55th Assembly Constituency of Manipur. The present sitting Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) is Chaltawnlien Amo. The total geographic area of the sub-division block is 789.48 km², having 55 villages with the total population of 23,995 approx. The total number of voters is 18,848. The total distance from the Parbung to the district headquarters town of Churachandpur is 247 km through the Tipaimukh Road, also known as NH 150.  Meaning of name  The indigenous name of Tipaimukh is Ruonglevaisuo. \\"Tipaimukh\\" is a combintion of \\"Tipai\\", a corrupted version of the name of the Tuivai River, and mukh, which means \\"mouth\\" in Bengali. \\"Ruonglevaisuo\\" (ruong-le-vai-suo) is a combination of \\"Ruong\\" (from \\"Ruongnau\\", le, meaning \\"and\\"; Vai, taken from the name of the Tuivai River; and suo, meaning \\"confluence\\". Hence, both \\"Tipaimukh\\" and \\"Ruonglevaisuo\\" refer to the confluence of the Tuivai and Ruongnau rivers at this location.  People  The majority of the people inhabiting Tipaimukh are the indigenous Hmar people who are spread in large numbers in neighbouring Indian states of Mizoram, Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya. The Hmars are one of the recognised Scheduled Tribes of India since the 1950s. The Hmars were the first to settle in this region since the 18th century. Other tribals inhabiting this region, but who are found in small numbers, are the kindred tribes of the Hmar viz., Zou, Gangte, Paite, Vaiphei, etc.  Situation  Tipaimukh was one of the most neglected regions in the state of Manipur due to its remote location. A few years back due to insurgency problems there was near complete absence of state government establishment, no proper educational facilities, no hospitals, doctors or public health centres (PHC), no proper Public Distribution System (PDS), no electrification and no proper communication system such as roadways, mobile or telephone connectivity. The people’s only reliable means of communication with those outside their region was through radio. The region had been deprived of any development works for more than a decade or so. However, with the improvement in the law and order situation, a gradual increase in development has been initiated by the state government such as employment generation via MGNREGs, and infrastructural development through various other schemes such as MsDP, BRGF, IAY, IWMP etc., implemented and monitored by the Sub-Divisional Officer and Block Development Officer but these is less effective mainly due to the ever skyrocking corruption. The Sub-Division, has a motorable road connectivity on par with most roads within the district however the fare or charge for passenger is one of the highest in the world. Nevertheless, there are still much to be done, especially in the energy sector viz. Electricity which has yet to reach 90% of the population. Politics Tipaimukh A/C is part of Outer Manipur (Lok Sabha constituency).

Iersel teamed up with Marloes Wesselink in 2005 playing in the Eredivisie of beach volleyball in the Netherlands (the highest league in the country). Their first World Tour event was in Gstaad finishing 57th. The pair won the Dutch Under-20 national championships in Almere. Iersel entered the Under-20s European Championships in Israel eventually winning the event and taking her first international gold medal. A few weeks later at the Under-19s World Championships under 19 in Saint-Quay-Portrieux she finished in 5th position. Her final 2005 event was the Under-21s World Championships in Brazil where she finished 9th. Along with Wesselink she received the award for Beach Volleyball Talents 2005. In 2006 Iersel travelled to Marseille to play in a FIVB World Tour event for the first time, finishing 41st. At the European Championship Tour event in Valencia she finished in 21st position. Later that year she played in the Under-21s World Championships in Mysłowice winning the bronze medal. She stayed in Poland to play the Warsaw FIVB World Tour event, finishing 33rd.

The Sibiu Crucifixion An early work appearing to be influenced by the Flemish school, the Sibiu Crucifixion was formerly attributed to an unknown 14th century German painter. A symbolic view of Messina is depicted in the background, probably an allusion to Jerusalem as requested by the unknown client, in a typical fashion of the time. The Antwerp Crucifixion The Antwerp Crucifixion represents Christ crucified between two evil-doers, with Mary and John the Evangelist seated on the ground. The work shows a landscape typical of the Flemish school in the lower part; the well devised spatial disposition of the crosses in the upper half demonstrates a full knowledge of the innovative method of perspective known to Italian art of the period. The Italian scholar Roberto Longhi asserted that the upper part was added several years later. At the bottom left the painter wrote his name on a scroll and the date: 1475.

Strabo (\\"squinter\\") was a word by the Romans for anyone whose eyes were distorted or crooked. (died 481) was a Gothic chieftain who was involved in the politics of the Byzantine Empire during the reigns of Byzantine Emperors Leo I, Zeno and Basiliscus. He was a rival for the leadership of the Ostrogoths with his kinsman Theoderic the Great, who would ultimately supplant him.  Background  Theodoric called Strabo, son of Triarius, was a chieftain of the Thracian Goths (Thervingi, Bastarnae and Roxolane in Getea and Peuce island in the Danube delta); he had two brothers. The wife of the Alan general Aspar was his sister.Wolfram 1990:32 Strabo had a wife, Sigilda, and a son called Recitach. He was a contemporary of the more famous Theodoric the Amal, who was a Moesian Goth of the royal Amal family, and who would become known as Theoderic the Great.According to John of Antioch (214,3), Theodoric the Amal was the cousin of Recitach (Bury). Though Origo Gothica, maintaining Theodoric as nucleus of the Goth tradition, denies the hostile Theodoric membership among the Amali, modern scholars, such as Wolfram (1990:32, 247f), confirm a relationship between the two. Around 459, he is attested as in friendly relationship with the Byzantine Empire, possibly one of the foederati, and receiving an annual subsidy from the Byzantines.Martindale.  Under Leo I  In 471, the Alan Aspar, at the time magister militum of Emperor Leo I, was murdered by order of the emperor himself. Strabo, who was at the command of his people in Thrace, revolted to avenge his relative, but was defeated by the Byzantine generals Zeno and Basiliscus, who were both later emperors. However, Strabo was able to set three conditions to end his unrest: receiving the properties left as legacy by Aspar, being allowed to settle his Goths in Thrace, and being raised to the rank of magister militum. Since Leo had rejected the requests, offering the rank of magister militum only in exchange of an oath of loyalty, Strabo started a military campaign against the cities of Thrace. Part of the Gothic army attacked Philippi (or Philippopolis), while he led the remaining men to attack and occupy Arcadiopolis. When the Goths ran out of supplies, Theodoric signed a peace with Leo (473); according to its terms the Byzantines were to pay an annual tribute of 2000 pounds of gold to the Goths, whose independence was recognized, and Strabo was to obtain the rank of magister militum.  Under Zeno  Solidus of Emperor Basiliscus. Theodoric Strabo played a role in the overthrowing of Emperor Zeno in 475, and in the rise to power of Basiliscus. The new emperor kept Theodoric on his side as magister militum, but Strabo was soon upset by some decisions made by Basiliscus, and is not reported to have defended Constantinople the following year, when Zeno returned to take back his throne. At the death of Leo (January 474), Strabo rebelled against the newly appointed Emperor Zeno. He killed Heraclius, the magister militum per Thracias, despite the payment of a ransom, probably because Heraclius was involved in the murder of Aspar. The support of Theodoric was fundamental for the overthrowing of Zeno and the rise of Basiliscus to the Byzantine throne (475), so Basiliscus confirmed him magister militum and gave him other honours. However, Theodoric was very upset when Basiliscus appointed his nephew Armatus magister militum praesentialis, because he despised him. When Zeno returned to Constantinople in 476 and defeated Basiliscus, Strabo is not reported to defend the city.Zeno had become allied in this occasion with Theodoric Amal, whose Goths had moved to attack the Byzantine Empire. It has been suggested that Constantinople was defenseless during Zeno's siege because the magister militum Strabo had moved to the north to counter this menace. See In 476/477, Zeno allied himself with Strabo's rival, Theodoric the Amal, and ordered him to attack Strabo. The leader of the Thracian Goths sent an embassy to the Byzantine emperor, offering peace and blaming the Moesian Theodoric. Zeno understood that this offering was hiding further conspiracies, and obtained that the Byzantine senate and army declare Strabo a public enemy. The plan of Zeno was to have the two Theoderics attack each other. He sent the Amal against Strabo, with the promise of a huge Roman force as renforcement (478). When Theoderic the Amal arrived through the mountains at Mount Soundis, he did not find the Roman renforcement army he expected, but Theoderic Strabo's army instead, in a strongly fortified camp. Strabo provoked the Amal, running in front of the Moesian Gothic camp and claiming that the leadership of the Amal had reduced the Goths to fighting each other, and only for the Roman gain, to have none of the wealth for which they had moved from their territories. With this speech recalling the common interest of the Goths, Strabo forced the Amal to ask for peace. The two Theodorics agreed to put forward a joint request to the Roman Emperor, in order to extend to the south the settlement territory of the Goths in Moesia.Wolfram. Emperor Zeno, here depicted on one of his coins, tried to pit the two Theodorics against each other, but Strabo settled a peace with the Amali and defeated the Bulgars, who had been sent against him by Zeno. Zeno tried to divide the two Theodorics, bribing Amal, who refused to misally. The imperial army obtained some initial successes, however Zeno did not capitalize upon his victory, and allowed the Amal to move westward in Thrace, plundering the territories as he went. With the Amal far away, Strabo accepted an agreement with Zeno: Strabo was to be given back his wealth, money to pay 13,000 soldiers, the command of two palatinae units, and the title once more of magister militum. However, the army of Theodoric Strabo, 30,000-men strong was still a menace for Zeno, who convinced the Bulgars to attack the Thracian Goths in their own base. Strabo defeated the Bulgars in 480/481, and moved towards Constantinople, but he had to deal with problems with his own men, so he could not capitalize upon his victory and was forced to return to Greece. On his way back, during an encampment at Stabulum Diomedis, near Philippi in Thrace, he was trying to break in an unruly horse, when he fell onto a spear hung before a tent or hanging from a wagon and died.Marcellinus Comes, 481.1.  In fiction  In the novel Raptor by Gary Jennings, Strabo is a major character. In the book, the fictional Strabo has his limbs amputated by the main character, Thorn, who was at the time marshal of Theoderic the Great. Some years later, Strabo dies before an imminent battle with Theoderic the Great, when the litter carrying him spills him on the tip of a soldier's spear. Though Strabo did actually die at the speartip of his own soldier, the specific manner of his amputations and death were inventions of the author.

Recorded in autumn 1985, it was first released on their third studio album The Queen Is Dead in June 1986. It was also released as a single in Germany. Background As with every original recording by the Smiths, the music of \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" was composed by Johnny Marr and the lyrics were written by Morrissey. The recording was given a distinctive intro by engineer Stephen Street, who increased the reverb on the drums, faded the track in then out again, and took the reverb back off when reintroducing the song: \\"A bit like opening a door, closing it, then opening it again and walking in\\". The lyric paraphrases Johnny Tillotson's 1962 single \\"Send Me the Pillow That You Dream On\\", and broadly references the 1964 comedy Carry On Cleo (\\"Oooh, I say\\"). Reception In the mainstream British music press, \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" was mentioned in the context of The Queen Is Dead. In the NME, Adrian Thrills wrote, \\"As an album with humour never far from its surface, it is fitting that The Queen Is Dead should conclude with the clipped, undulating frivolity of 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others', a hypnotic musical travelogue that verges on the transcendental [...] Again, the Morrissey muse and Marr's musical setting collide marvellously, the track illuminated by some lovely slide guitar from the latter. It would have made another classic Smiths single\\". Andy Strickland in Record Mirror said, \\"Morrissey and Marr still can't quite get it together all the time, 'Never Had No One Ever' and 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others' bearing all the hallmarks of the familiar Smiths filler, where music and words hardly embrace,\\" while Nick Kent wrote, \\"'Vicar In a Tutu' and 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others', sensibly restrained arrangement-wise, may well be lesser songs but, constructed within their rightful limitations, sound absolutely stunning\\". In Simon Goddard's track-by-track book Songs That Saved Your Life, Johnny Marr describes the song as \\"a beautiful piece of music\\", while the author writes, \\"Possessing one of his most alluring guitar melodies [...] if Marr's tune was heaven-sent, then it seemed very nearly blasphemous of Morrissey to christen it 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others' and bestow it with its notoriously frivolous lyric\\". Live version \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" was performed live only once: at the final concert by the Smiths, at Brixton Academy, London, on 12 December 1986. The performance, which included a verse (\\"On the shop floor, there's a calendar, as obvious as snow, as if we didn't know\\") not used in the studio version, was recorded and later featured as a B-side on the 12\\" and cassette edition of the \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\" single in November 1987.

This reaction was the basis of Dorothy Wrinch's cyclol model of proteins. The cyclol hypothesis is the first structural model of a folded, globular protein. It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions. Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. Such \\"closed cyclol\\" molecules have not been observed either. Although later data demonstrated that this original model for the structure of globular proteins needed to be amended, several elements of the cyclol model were verified, such as the cyclol reaction itself and the hypothesis that hydrophobic interactions are chiefly responsible for protein folding. The cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry, and was a precursor of the more accurate models hypothesized for the DNA double helix and protein secondary structure. The proposal and testing of the cyclol model also provides an excellent illustration of empirical falsifiability acting as part of the scientific method. Historical context By the mid-1930s, analytical ultracentrifugation studies by Theodor Svedberg had shown that proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules. The same studies appeared to show that the molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well-defined classes related by integers, such as Mw = 2p3q Da, where p and q are nonnegative integers. However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein. Svedberg had also shown that a change in solution conditions could cause a protein to disassemble into small subunits, now known as a change in quaternary structure. The chemical structure of proteins was still under debate at that time. The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides, i.e., unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. However, a typical protein is remarkably long—hundreds of amino-acid residues—and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear macromolecules could be stable in solution. Further doubts about the polypeptide nature of proteins arose because some enzymes were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides, whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins. Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful, mainly due to the chirality of amino acids; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left-handed amino acids. Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of Emil Abderhalden. However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis. As clarified by Linderstrøm-Lang, these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides. The process of protein denaturation (as distinguished from coagulation) had been discovered in 1910 by Harriette Chick and Charles Martin, but its nature was still mysterious. Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky had shown that denaturation was a reversible, two-state process that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions, including cleavage by enzymes. In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding, a purely conformational change that resulted in the exposure of amino-acid side chains to the solvent. Preliminary reports were presented before the XIIIth International Congress of Physiology at Boston (19–24 August 1929) and in the October 1929 issue of the American Journal of Physiology. Wu's hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by Mirsky and Linus Pauling. Nevertheless, protein scientists could not exclude the possibility that denaturation corresponded to a chemical change in the protein structure, a hypothesis that was considered a (distant) possibility until the 1950s. X-ray crystallography had just begun as a discipline in 1911, and had advanced relatively rapidly from simple salt crystals to crystals of complex molecules such as cholesterol. However, even the smallest proteins have over 1000 atoms, which makes determining their structure far more complex. In 1934, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin had taken crystallographic data on the structure of the small protein, insulin, although the structure of that and other proteins were not solved until the late 1960s. However, pioneering X-ray fiber diffraction data had been collected in the early 1930s for many natural fibrous proteins such as wool and hair by William Astbury, who proposed rudimentary models of secondary structure elements such as the alpha helix and the beta sheet. Since protein structure was so poorly understood in the 1930s, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown. Astbury hypothesized that the structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in β-sheets. The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932, and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling. At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the fibrous protein α-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above. The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5 Å, whereas they are separated by ~3 Å in a typical hydrogen bond. The idea intrigued J. D. Bernal, who suggested it to the mathematician Dorothy Wrinch as possibly useful in understanding protein structure. Basic theory Figure 2: The alanine cyclol-6 molecule proposed by Dorothy Wrinch is a cyclic hexapeptide in which three peptide groups are fused by cyclol reactions into a central ring. The three outer (unfused) peptide groups are not planar, but have dihedral angle ω=60°. The three red atoms in the central ring represent the hydroxyl groups formed by the cyclol reactions, whereas the three outer red atoms represent the oxygens of carbonyl groups. The inner oxygen atoms are separated by only 2.45 Å, which is extremely close even for hydrogen-bonded atoms. This hypothetical molecule has not been observed in nature. Wrinch developed this suggestion into a full-fledged model of protein structure. The basic cyclol model was laid out in her first paper (1936). She noted the possibility that polypeptides might cyclize to form closed rings (true) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare). Assuming that the cyclol form of the peptide bond could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic peptides would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as cyclol 6, Figure 2). Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the chemical bonds were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5 Å; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42 Å and 1.54 Å, respectively. These rings can be extended indefinitely to form a cyclol fabric (Figure 3). Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely. Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their amino-acid side chains point axially upwards from only one face; the opposite face has no side chains. Thus, one face is completely independent of the primary sequence of the peptide, which Wrinch conjectured might account for sequence-independent properties of proteins. In her initial article, Wrinch stated clearly that the cyclol model was merely a working hypothesis, a potentially valid model of proteins that would have to be checked. Her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally. In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins. Stabilizing energies Figure 3: Stick model of the alanine cyclol fabric proposed by Dorothy Wrinch. The cyclol fabric is conceptually similar to a beta sheet, but more uniform and laterally denser. The fabric has large \\"lacunae\\" arranged in a hexagonal pattern, in which three Cβ atoms (shown in green) and three Hα atoms (shown in white) converge on a (relatively) empty spot in the fabric. The two sides of the fabric are not equivalent; all the Cβ atoms emerge from the same side, which is the \\"upper\\" side here. The red atoms represent hydroxyl groups (not carbonyl groups) and emerge (in sets of three) from both sides of the fabric; the blue atoms represent nitrogen. This hypothetical structure has not been observed in nature. In two tandem Letters to the Editor (1936), Wrinch and Frank addressed the question of whether the cyclol form of the peptide group was indeed more stable than the amide form. A relatively simple calculation showed that the cyclol form is significantly less stable than the amide form. Therefore, the cyclol model would have to be abandoned unless a compensating source of energy could be identified. Initially, Frank proposed that the cyclol form might be stabilized by better interactions with the surrounding solvent; later, Wrinch and Irving Langmuir hypothesized that hydrophobic association of nonpolar sidechains provides stabilizing energy to overcome the energetic cost of the cyclol reactions. The lability of the cyclol bond was seen as an advantage of the model, since it provided a natural explanation for the properties of denaturation; reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up the structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by proteases, consistent with experiment. Early studies showed that proteins denatured by pressure are often in a different state than the same proteins denatured by high temperature, which was interpreted as possibly supporting the cyclol model of denaturation. The Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis of hydrophobic stabilization shared in the downfall of the cyclol model, owing mainly to the influence of Linus Pauling, who favored the hypothesis that protein structure was stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Another twenty years had to pass before hydrophobic interactions were recognized as the chief driving force in protein folding. Steric complementarity In her third paper on cyclols (1936), Wrinch noted that many \\"physiologically active\\" substances such as steroids are composed of fused hexagonal rings of carbon atoms and, thus, might be sterically complementary to the face of cyclol molecules without the amino-acid side chains. Wrinch proposed that steric complementarity was one of chief factors in determining whether a small molecule would bind to a protein. Wrinch speculated that proteins are responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules. Noting that cells digest their proteins only under extreme starvation conditions, Wrinch further speculated that life could not exist without proteins. Hybrid models From the beginning, the cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of the hydrogen bond. Therefore, it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds. This was the subject of Wrinch's fourth paper on the cyclol model (1936), written together with Dorothy Jordan Lloyd, who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds. A follow-up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins, such as Maurice Loyal Huggins and Linus Pauling. Wrinch also wrote a paper with William Astbury, noting the possibility of a keto-enol isomerization of the >CαHα and an amide carbonyl group >C=O, producing a crosslink >Cα-C(OHα)< and again converting the oxygen to a hydroxyl group. Such reactions could yield five-membered rings, whereas the classic cyclol hypothesis produces six-membered rings. This keto-enol crosslink hypothesis was not developed much further. Space-enclosing fabrics Figure 4: Stick model of the cyclol C1 protein structure proposed by Dorothy Wrinch. The molecule is a truncated tetrahedron composed of four planar cyclol fabrics, each surrounding one lacuna (48 residues), and joined together pairwise by four residues along each edge (two residues at each corner). Thus, this molecule has 72 amino-acid residues altogether. It is viewed here \\"face-on\\", i.e., looking into the lacuna of one cyclol fabric. The side chains (taken here as alanine) all point into the interior of this \\"cage-like\\" structure. This hypothetical structure has not been observed in nature. In her fifth paper on cyclols (1937), Wrinch identified the conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles. She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar \\"median hexagon\\"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds. This \\"median hexagon\\" representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the dihedral angle between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle δ = arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°. A large variety of closed polyhedra meeting this criterion can be constructed, of which the simplest are the truncated tetrahedron, the truncated octahedron, and the octahedron, which are Platonic solids or semiregular polyhedra. Considering the first series of \\"closed cyclols\\" (those modeled on the truncated tetrahedron), Wrinch showed that their number of amino acids increased quadratically as 72n2, where n is the index of the closed cyclol Cn. Thus, the C1 cyclol has 72 residues, the C2 cyclol has 288 residues, etc. Preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from Max Bergmann and Carl Niemann, whose amino-acid analyses suggested that proteins were composed of integer multiples of 288 amino-acid residues (n=2). More generally, the cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for the early analytical ultracentrifugation results of Theodor Svedberg, which suggested that the molecular weights of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers. The cyclol model was consistent with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins. (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4 g/mL) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply regular packing. (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association. (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple chemical explanation of denaturation and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the Watson-Francis Crick concept of DNA templating its own replication. Given that many biological molecules such as sugars and sterols have a hexagonal structure, it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure. Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles. Predicted protein structures Having proposed a model of globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it was consistent with the available structural data. She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a C1 closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that the digestive enzyme pepsin was a C2 closed cyclol of 288 residues. These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical methods. Wrinch also predicted that insulin was a C2 closed cyclol consisting of 288 residues. Limited X-ray crystallographic data were available for insulin which Wrinch interpreted as \\"confirming\\" her model. However, this interpretation drew rather severe criticism for being premature. Careful studies of the Patterson diagrams of insulin taken by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin showed that they were roughly consistent with the cyclol model; however, the agreement was not good enough to claim that the cyclol model was confirmed. Implausibility of the model Figure 5: Spacefilling diagram of the alanine cyclol fabric, as seen from the side where none of the Cβ atoms emerge. This Figure shows the threefold symmetry of the fabric and also its extraordinary density; for example, in the \\"lacunae\\"—where three Cβ atoms (shown in green) and three Hα atoms (shown as white triangles) converge—the carbons and hydrogens are separated by only 1.68 Å. The larger green spheres represent the Cβ atoms; the Cα atoms are generally not visible, except as little triangles next to the blue nitrogen atoms. As before, the red atoms represent hydroxyl groups, not carbonyl oxygen atoms. The cyclol fabric was shown to be implausible for several reasons. Hans Neurath and Henry Bull showed that the dense packing of side chains in the cyclol fabric was inconsistent with the experimental density observed in protein films. Maurice Huggins calculated that several non-bonded atoms of the cyclol fabric would approach more closely than allowed by their van der Waals radii; for example, the inner Hα and Cα atoms of the lacunae would be separated by only 1.68 Å (Figure 5). Haurowitz showed chemically that the outside of proteins could not have a large number of hydroxyl groups, a key prediction of the cyclol model, whereas Meyer and Hohenemser showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state. More general chemical arguments against the cyclol model were given by Bergmann and Niemann and by Neuberger. Infrared spectroscopic data showed that the number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis, and that intact, folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups; both observations contradict the cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins. Finally, proteins were known to contain proline in significant quantities (typically 5%); since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds, proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric. An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann. Moreover, a supporting piece of evidence—the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 amino-acid residues—was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939. Wrinch replied to the steric-clash, free-energy, chemical and residue-number criticisms of the cyclol model. On steric clashes, she noted that small deformations of the bond angles and bond lengths would allow these steric clashes to be relieved, or at least reduced to a reasonable level. She noted that distances between non-bonded groups within a single molecule can be shorter than expected from their van der Waals radii, e.g., the 2.93 Å distance between methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene. Regarding the free-energy penalty for the cyclol reaction, Wrinch disagreed with Pauling's calculations and stated that too little was known of intramolecular energies to rule out the cyclol model on that basis alone. In reply to the chemical criticisms, Wrinch suggested that the model compounds and simple bimolecular reactions studied need not pertain to the cyclol model, and that steric hindrance may have prevented the surface hydroxyl groups from reacting. On the residue-number criticism, Wrinch extended her model to allow for other numbers of residues. In particular, she produced a \\"minimal\\" closed cyclol of only 48 residues, and, on that (incorrect) basis, may have been the first to suggest that the insulin monomer had a molecular weight of roughly 6000 Da. Therefore, she maintained that the cyclol model of globular proteins was still potentially viable and even proposed the cyclol fabric as a component of the cytoskeleton. However, most protein scientists ceased to believe in it and Wrinch turned her scientific attention to mathematical problems in X-ray crystallography, to which she contributed significantly. One exception was physicist Gladys Anslow, Wrinch's colleague at Smith College, who studied the ultraviolet absorption spectra of proteins and peptides in the 1940s and allowed for the possibility of cyclols in interpreting her results. As the sequence of insulin began to be determined by Frederick Sanger, Anslow published a three-dimensional cyclol model with sidechains, based on the backbone of Wrinch's 1948 \\"minimal cyclol\\" model. Partial redemption bislactam macrocycle form (blue). The amide groups of the bislactam form are crosslinked in the cyclol form; these two tautomers have similar stability, giving an equilibrium constant of ~1. However, the open form (black) is unstable, and not observed. The downfall of the overall cyclol model generally led to a rejection of its elements; one notable exception was J. D. Bernal's short-lived acceptance of the Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis that protein folding is driven by hydrophobic association. Nevertheless, cyclol bonds were identified in small, naturally occurring cyclic peptides in the 1950s. Clarification of the modern terminology is appropriate. The classic cyclol reaction is the addition of the NH amine of a peptide group to the C=O carbonyl group of another; the resulting compound is now called an azacyclol. By analogy, an oxacyclol is formed when an OH hydroxyl group is added to a peptidyl carbonyl group. Likewise, a thiacyclol is formed by adding an SH thiol moiety to a peptidyl carbonyl group.Wieland T and Bodanszky M, The World of Peptides, Springer Verlag, pp.193–198. The oxacyclol alkaloid ergotamine from the fungus Claviceps purpurea was the first identified cyclol. The cyclic depsipeptide serratamolide is also formed by an oxacyclol reaction. Chemically analogous cyclic thiacyclols have also been obtained. Classic azacyclols have been observed in small molecules and tripeptides.

Wieland T and Urbach H. (1958) \\"Weitere Di-Aminoacylimide und ihre intramolekulare Umlagerung\\", Liebigs Ann. Chem., 613, 84–95. a key prediction of the cyclol model. Hundreds of cyclol molecules have now been identified, despite Linus Pauling's calculation that such molecules should not exist because of their unfavorably high energy. After a long hiatus during which she worked mainly on the mathematics of X-ray crystallography, Wrinch responded to these discoveries with renewed enthusiasm for the cyclol model and its relevance in biochemistry. She also published two books describing the cyclol theory and small peptides in general. Illustration of the scientific method The cyclol model of protein structure is an example of empirical falsifiability acting as part of the scientific method. An original hypothesis is made that accounts for unexplained experimental observations; the consequences of this hypothesis are worked out, leading to predictions that are tested by experiment. In this case, the key hypothesis was that the cyclol form of the peptide group could be favored over the amide form. This hypothesis led to the predictions of the cyclol-6 molecule and the cyclol fabric, which in turn suggested the model of semi-regular polyhedra for globular proteins. A key testable prediction was that a folded protein's carbonyl groups should be largely converted to hydroxyl groups; however, spectroscopic and chemical experiments showed that this prediction was incorrect. The cyclol model also predicts a high lateral density of amino acids in folded proteins and in films that does not agree with experiment. Hence, the cyclol model could be rejected and the search begun for new hypotheses of protein structure, such as the models of the alpha helix proposed in the 1940s and 1950s. It is sometimes argued that the cyclol hypothesis should never have been advanced, because of its a priori flaws, e.g., its steric clashes, its inability to accommodate proline, and the high free energy disfavoring the cyclol reaction itself. Although such flaws rendered the cyclol hypothesis implausible, they did not make it impossible. The cyclol model was the first well-defined structure proposed for globular proteins, and too little was then known of intramolecular forces and protein structure to reject it immediately. It neatly explained several general properties of proteins and accounted for then-anomalous experimental observations. Although generally incorrect, some elements of the cyclol theory were eventually verified, such as the cyclol reactions and the role of hydrophobic interactions in protein folding. A useful comparison is the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, which was considered implausible from its inception, even by its creator, yet led the way to the ultimately correct theory of quantum mechanics. Similarly, Linus Pauling proposed a well-defined model of DNA that was likewise implausible yet thought-provoking to other investigators. Conversely, the cyclol model is an example of an incorrect scientific theory of great symmetry and beauty, two qualities that can be regarded as signs of \\"obviously true\\" scientific theories. For example, the Watson-Crick double helix model of DNA is sometimes said to be \\"obvious\\" because of its plausible hydrogen bonding and symmetry; nevertheless, other, less symmetrical structures of DNA are favored under different conditions. Similarly, the beautiful theory of general relativity was considered by Albert Einstein as not needing experimental verification; yet even this theory will require revision for consistency with quantum field theory.

In the 1930s, she was one of the first union leaders to advocate for the rights of Chicanos and blacks as factory and field workers. During the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, Healey was one of the leading public figures of the Communist Party in the state of California. An opponent of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and at odds with the orthodox pro-Soviet leadership of Gus Hall, Healey subsequently left the Communist Party to join the New American Movement, which merged to become part of the Democratic Socialists of America in 1982. Early life Healey was born Dorothy Harriet Rosenblum in Denver to Hungarian Jewish immigrants.Dorothy Healey and Maurice Isserman, California Red: A Life in the American Communist Party. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993, pg. pg. 15. Her father's family, the Rosenblums, were proud of their Hungarian background and considered themselves Austro- Hungarians rather than Jews.Dorothy Healey and Maurice Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers: A Life in the American Communist Party, New York: Oxford University Press, 1990; pp. 16, 19, 22, 36. Her mother's family, on the other hand, were Orthodox Jews, with her maternal grandfather serving as a shokhet, a supervisor of the ritual slaughter of animals to ensure that they were kosher. Healey was a so-called \\"red diaper baby,\\" and her mother was won over to socialism as a teenager after hearing a lecture on the subject delivered by J. Stitt Wilson in 1900 and later took part in helping to establish the Communist Party of America. Her father was an apolitical traveling salesman, peddling foodstuffs to grocery stores. Her mother bore six children, one dying at birth and another dying in early childhood. She also performed multiple abortions upon herself, nearly dying of blood poisoning on one occasion, as a result of the procedure when Dorothy was a young girl. When Dorothy was six, the family relocated to Los Angeles, where she would eventually become known as the \\"Red Queen of Los Angeles.\\" As her father moved about the West, his family moved with him, and she attended 19 schools before dropping out of high school. At 14, she joined the youth section of the Workers (Communist) Party, the Young Workers League, and the adult Communist Party itself in 1932, at 18. At the behest of the YCL she took a job in a peach processing factory, making 12 cents an hour and hiding when government labor inspectors came looking for underage workers. It was there where she gained her first experience as an organizer. Leader in party Her convictions about social justice and issues of race, class, unions and labor fueled her activism. From the moment that she joined the CPUSA, she was a true believer. \\"We knew with absolute conviction that we were part of a vanguard that was destined to lead an American working class to a socialist revolution\\", she once said. Healey became a successful labor organizer and rose to become the chair of the CPUSA in Southern California. Eventually, she joined the national Party leadership. She mentored many young communists and labor activists. In the 1950s, she and 14 other Californians were convicted under the Smith Act of conspiring to advocate the forceful overthrow of the government. She faced five years in prison and a $10,000 fine before the Supreme Court overturned the conviction.Healey and Isserman, California Red, pp. 133–49. In the 1960s, she again faced imprisonment and a hefty fine under a piece of McCarthy-era legislation known as the McCarran Act, when she and others refused to register as agents of a foreign government (the logic being that the CPUSA was under the control of the Soviet Union). In 1965, the Supreme Court reconsidered an earlier decision and found the registration provision to be in violation of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination.Healey and Isserman, California Red, pp. 188–194. Break with party A critical moment for her came in 1956, after the reading of Nikita Khrushchev's speech, \\"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences,\\" which revealed the crimes that Joseph Stalin committed under the USSR's one-party system. \\"The speech went on for four hours, and I was reduced to tears after about 30 minutes,\\" she said. \\"Fact after fact of monstrous things had happened. It was a relentless account. But I believed it. There was no questioning its authenticity.\\" From that point, she was outspoken in her insistence for the American Communist Party to support democracy and reduce its ties with the Soviets.Healey and Isserman, California Red, pp. 150-171. Although many others like novelist Howard Fast left the CPUSA after the revelations of Stalin's crimes, Healey tried to reform it from within. Her story is told in a book she wrote with historian Maurice Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers: A Life in the American Communist Party (1990), in which she revealed \\"the aspirations, commitment, illusions -- and, ultimately, disillusionment -- of a generation of young Communists\\" who joined the movement before and during the Great Depression. She and they had to deal with and \\"the Party [being] reduced to a remnant of its former strength through the battering it received in the McCarthy era and through its own sectarian mistakes.\\" She resigned from her leadership post in 1968, after Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev ordered Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops to crush the democratic socialist movement in Czechoslovakia. She stayed in the party until 1973, when she resigned in a dispute with CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall over issues of orthodoxy, to which she could no longer conform. The end came when she could no longer hold her tongue and publicly criticized the Party.Healey and Isserman, California Red, pp. 222-244. Later life In 1974, Healey joined the New American Movement, and in 1975, she became a member of its national interim committee. Later, she supported the merger of NAM with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee in 1982, to form the Democratic Socialists of America. Through her involvement with NAM and the Democratic Socialists, she provided an important link between the activists of the 1930s and the younger generation inspired by the popular movement against the Vietnam War. She mentored hundreds of young activists, who later made contributions to the labor movement and community organizations in the Los Angeles area. Healey moved to Washington, D.C., in 1983 to live with her son, Richard Healey, to help raise her grandchildren. She had been broadcasting on Pacifica Radio in Los Angeles since 1959, and in Washington, she and Richard co-hosted \\"Dialogue,\\" an hour-long public affairs show on WPFW on Wednesday mornings.Healey and Isserman, California Red, pp. 245-50. Dorothy Ray Healey was married to, in her own words, \\"three good men\\": Lon Sherman, Don Healey and Phillip Connelly. All three marriages ended in divorce. She once wrote: \\"My hatred of capitalism, which degrades and debases humans, is as intense now as it was when I joined the Young Communist League in 1928. I remain a communist, as I have been all my life, albeit without a party.\\" Death Healey died of respiratory failure and pneumonia at age 91 at the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington in Rockville, Maryland. Legacy Healey's extensive collection of papers and other material on the CPUSA is archived at the California State University, Long Beach library. Healey is featured in two documentaries, Seeing Red (1983) and Dorothy Healey: An American Red (1984).

The kramat (shrine) of Sheikh Yusuf (Tuanta Salamaka) of the Sultanate of Gowa, in present-day Makassar in Indonesia, is a holy place to South Africa's Muslim community. The Sheikh, who was exiled by the Dutch in 1694, came to the Strand area and made it his final resting place; although his followers, who were mainly fishermen, found the sea of Macassar rather uninviting and moved further along the coast to Strand’s Mosterds Bay. After Yusuf died, his followers named the area after his birthplace, spelling it with \\"c\\" in place of \\"k\\". The Macassar Dunes Conservation Area forms part of the vital coastal dune system, one of the biodiversity hotspots of the Western Cape.

He is also updating the study New Heritage of Horror, currently on its fourth reprint.  Critique of David Pirie's Work from Screen Online  Below is a study of David Pirie's work by Tise Vahimagi excerpted with permission from the British Film Institute site Screen Online: 'His first television film, Rainy Day Women (BBC, tx. 10 April 1984), directed by Ben Bolt for producer Michael Wearing, was set in rural England during the early days of the Second World War. Here, a detachment of the local Home Guard are at war with a forceful farm widow and her land girls, the latter group suspected of being German sympathisers or lesbians, or even of witchcraft. The imaginative effect to which Pirie put his script in establishing an atmosphere of strangeness – suppressed hate and passion, parochial paranoia – remains the most striking thing about the film. When Pirie (with director Bolt) returned with the three-part Never Come Back (BBC, 1990), an adaptation of an obscure wartime thriller by author John Mair, his love of the film noir atmosphere of 1940s cinema was brought across to remarkable effect. The sharpened air of menace was always left unexplained, suggested but never explicit. However, Ashenden (BBC, 1991), a four-part adaptation of Somerset Maugham's spy stories, was an oddly static affair. Concerning a young writer who is recruited by wartime intelligence into a world of moral ambiguity, the mechanical narrative of the original material allowed few of the side-tracking excitements of action. Having worked with producer Michael Wearing on both Rainy Day Women and Ashenden, Pirie's 1992 conspiracy thriller Natural Lies (BBC) became something of a return to the form of the producer's acclaimed Edge of Darkness (BBC, 1985). At the centre of the plot was the then-current subject of BSE, or 'Mad Cow Disease', spreading to humans with lethal consequences. Like Edge of Darkness, with its subject matter of nuclear waste cover-up, Natural Lies took its alarming theme and cleverly enveloped it within a thriller; resulting in a suspenseful story capable of standing up to the Hitchcock comparisons that it occasionally invited. Continuing his exploration of serious issues about society, Pirie researched Eastern Europe's Black Triangle for the Screen Two presentation Black Easter (BBC, tx. 4 June 1995). Although the drama was set in a near future world, in an immigrant exclusion zone guarded by advanced electronics, the real-life background was that Polish landscape which adjoins the eastern border of Germany and the EU, populated by a mass of refugees and dislocated people. The dark thriller focused on an investigation of an apparent race murder, leading to a disturbing underworld of would-be immigrants, border police, corruption and cover-ups. While Pirie's film noir-influenced works may be among the most satisfying of television's occasional excursions into that cinema style, it is with his Gothic screenplays that he excels as a genre writer. His screenplay for \\"The Woman in White\\" (BBC, 1997) of Wilkie Collins' novel The Woman in White, as a two-part Victorian fever dream about frantic obsessions and desires, not only confirmed the period detective story and psychological mystery as a potent television form but also served as an appetiser for Pirie's following work, Murder Rooms. In offering a rare glimpse into the genesis of Sherlock Holmes through an imaginative weaving of the early years of Arthur Conan Doyle as a student at the University of Edinburgh and his relationship with forensic science pioneer Dr Joseph Bell, Pirie crafted perhaps one of the television genre's finest crime and mystery presentations. Beginning with a two-part, introductory story, Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes (BBC, 2000), Pirie developed a remarkable series of feature-length mysteries for the BBC during 2001. The series, suggesting an expert blend of early Hammer Films and 1940s American film noir, interlinked the Doyle-Bell investigations with the published Doyle- Holmes mysteries to superb effect. Seen also during this period was his two- part The Wyvern Mystery (BBC, 2000), an adaptation of Sheridan Le Fanu's gothic horror-piece concerning, once again, women of the purest white, menacing men in dark old houses, and sudden appearances of 'mad women' from out of the shadows. While perhaps not the best of Le Fanu's work, its actual presentation seemed like a splendid small-screen tribute to the moody-gloomy Gainsborough melodramas of the 1940s. Apart from the conventional 'Sad Cypress' episode (ITV, tx. 26 December 2003) of the Agatha Christie's Poirot (ITV, 1989–) series, Pirie's work suggests that the extraordinary, the nightmarish, is simply one step further on from the everyday, and it is this deliciously uncanny feeling that is effectively evoked throughout his work.'

She was one of the founding members of the popular group SexBomb Girls. In 2007, she repackaged herself as a short-term rap and hip-hop artist under the name RoC. Biography Rochelle \\"Riray\\" Pangilinan was born in Malabon City, Philippines, and is one of three siblings. Her family was very poor, and her father, Rodolfo Pangilinan, was an alcoholic wife-beater. Her parents separated but reunited in 2000 after her father stopped drinking, but he died on November 11, 2007, of emphysema. Career Dancing career Pangilinan entered dancing contests at a young age, and at age 14 was offered a job at Eat Bulaga!, a popular daytime variety show. She was only 14 when she first appeared on Eat Bulaga!. A group of dancers including Pangilinan were formed in November 1999 as the Chicken Sandwich Dancers, an offshoot of the Danz Focus (the resident dancers of Eat Bulaga!). At first, there were four (Cheryl, Debra, Janine, and Rochelle). The group expanded to six with the addition of Jopay and Aira, then eventually expanded to 8, 12, and then 13 (during their first FHM Philippines appearance) to an all-time high of 22. In 2000, the Tom Jones song, \\"Sexbomb\\", was a hit in the Philippines, and the group was named the SexBomb Dancers by their manager, Joy Cancio. Singing career In 2002, the singing group SexBomb Girls was formed, with members Jopay Paguia, Evette Pabalan, Weng Ibarra, Monic Icban, Izzy Trazona, and Pangilinan herself. In that same year, they released their debut album Unang Putok, with the hit single \\"Bakit Papa\\". They went on to later release three more albums. Acting career She started her acting career in ABS-CBN in Esperanza as Eliza starring Judy Ann Santos, Wowie de Guzman, Piolo Pascual, Angelika de la Cruz, Jericho Rosales, Marvin Agustin, Jolina Magdangal and Carmina Villarroel. In 2002, the SexBomb Girls starred in their first movie, Bakit Papa, with co-stars Allan K., Wendell Ramos, Epi Quizon, Chynna Ortaleza and Richard Gutierrez. In that same year, Pangilinan starred (without her group) in the movie Bertud ng Putik, where she was the leading lady of Bong Revilla, and rival to the character played by Regine Tolentino. She was also a regular on Daboy en Da Girl, a show on GMA KiliTV. In 2003, the SexBomb Girls starred in Daisy Siete, a long-running, top-rating afternoon drama series on GMA Network, with Pangilinan playing a main character. In 2004, Pangilinan appeared on Home Along Da Airport with co-star Dolphy, a show on ABS-CBN, GMA's rival network. After her appearance in the rival network, there were rumors that she would switch channels but she stated that she will not be leaving GMA. In 2005, she appeared on the TV show Darna as a mermaid named Corella, Darna's ally. In early 2010, Pangilinan portrayed one of the main villains, Deborah/Babaeng Manananggal in Darna. Recently, Pangilinan appeared as one of the lead characters, Marikit, on the Philippine historical drama Amaya. Rochelle as RoC Pangilinan stated on showbiz talk show S Files in March 2007 that she will be leaving the SexBomb Girls' roster for a short period of time and will not appear in the group's long-awaited return on Eat Bulaga!. During her leave of abscense, she co-wrote and recorded songs along with established rap artists Michael V., Gloc-9, and fellow SexBomb Girls Evette Pabalan and Jovel Palomo, resulting in her debut rap album. She later returned to Eat Bulaga! as part of the dancing roster. On June 3, 2007, Pangilinan introduced herself as RoC and launched her debut album Roc-A-Holic (released on June 8, 2007, by Panacea Music) on a weekly variety show, SOP Rules. The album consists of catchy rap, hip hop-flavored, and Latin-inspired songs, with the carrier single \\"Baile\\". Personal Life Pangilinan married actor Arthur Solinap on August 8, 2017.. She gave birth to their first child Shiloh Jayne on February 24, 2019.

Weiss. Dr. Weiss' work was inspired by the work of Albert Endres at IBM Germany. GQM defines a measurement model on three levels: ; Conceptual level (Goal) : A goal is defined for an object, for a variety of reasons, with respect to various models of quality, from various points of view and relative to a particular environment. ; Operational level (Question) : A set of questions is used to define models of the object of study and then focuses on that object to characterize the assessment or achievement of a specific goal. ; Quantitative level (Metric) : A set of metrics, based on the models, is associated with every question in order to answer it in a measurable way. The open literature typically describes GQM in terms of a six-step process where the first three steps are about using business goals to drive the identification of the right metrics and the last three steps are about gathering the measurement data and making effective use of the measurement results to drive decision making and improvements. Basili described his six- step GQM process as follows: # Develop a set of corporate, division and project business goals and associated measurement goals for productivity and quality. # Generate questions (based on models) that define those goals as completely as possible in a quantifiable way. # Specify the measures needed to be collected to answer those questions and track process and product conformance to the goals. # Develop mechanisms for data collection. # Collect, validate and analyze the data in real time to provide feedback to projects for corrective action. # Analyze the data in a post mortem fashion to assess conformance to the goals and to make recommendations for future improvements. GQM templates are a structured way of specifying goals. A GQM template contains the following fields: {  - ! field ! examples -  object of study  pair programming, static analysis tool -  purpose  characterize, understand, evaluate, predict, improve -  focus  programmer effort, program reliability -  stakeholder  developer, customer, manager -  context factors  (other important factors that may affect outcomes) - } Here is an example of applying the GQM template to express the goal of a software engineering study: The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of pair programming on programmer effort and program quality from the point of view of software managers in the context of a small web-development company. Recent developments Although GQM has served the software industry well for several decades, it never provided explicit support for integrating its software measurement model with elements of the larger organization, such as higher-level business goals and strategies. The GQM+Strategies approach was developed by Victor Basili and a group of researchers from the Fraunhofer Society. It is based on the Goal Question Metric paradigm and adds the capability to create measurement programs that ensure alignment between business goals and strategies, software-specific goals, and measurement goals.

It runs in the manner of a county commission. It has six seats held by elected officials called \\"County Commissioners\\", each commissioner in charge of their own District, led by a separate mayor of Orange County. Current Board Mayor The current mayor of Orange County is Jerry Demings (D). County commissioners #District 1 Betsy VanderLey (R) #District 2 Christine Moore (R) #District 3 Mayra Uribe (D) #District 4 Maribel Gomez Cordero (D) #District 5 Emily Bonilla (D) #District 6 Victoria Siplin (D) 2006 board election The mayor and commissioners each hold four-year terms, and are limited to two full terms each. The mayor and the commissioners of the even-numbered districts are up for election during mid-term election cycles, while the commissioners of the odd-numbered districts are up for election during presidential election cycles. Elections are non-partisan, but partisan politics do tend to play a role in the elections. The elections are contested during the September primary election. If a single candidate fails to get a simple majority of votes for their seat, then the top two candidates will face each other in a run-off election during the November general election. An election was held on September 5, 2006. Richard Crotty took over the position of Mayor of Orange County during Mel Martinez's 1998 term (Martinez was selected as George W. Bush's secretary of housing and urban development), so he is still eligible for re-election in 2006. Both Bob Sindler and Homer Hartage were term-limited out, with Hartage running for Democratic nomination to Florida's 8th congressional district, which he lost to Charlie Stuart. Sindler, also a Democrat, was running for the 38th District of the Florida House of Representatives, but was disqualified from campaigning for the seat due to failure to adhere to resign to run rules. Not coincidentally, the man that won District 2 in the primary, Fred Brummer, a Republican, was term-limited out of the same seat Sindler considered running for, and so essentially ran as an incumbent. Richard Crotty won the election for Mayor of Orange County, with 69.69% of the vote. Sally Baptiste was his only opponent. Fred Brummer, previously representing the overlapping 38th District in the Florida House of Representatives, won District 2 with 53.61% of the vote. Lawrence Kolin was second, with 20.23% of the vote. Two others ran for the seat. Linda Stewart successfully defended her seat, winning a second term for District 4 with 51.46% of the vote. Jennifer Thompson was second, with 31.45% of the vote. Two others ran for the seat. The race for District 6 was hotly contested, and ended in a virtual dead heat in the primary, with Tiffany Moore and Bruce Antone getting 37.92% and 37.46% of the vote, respectively. E.Juan Lynum, the son of Orlando city commissioner Daisy Lynum, was third in a field of five. Tiffany Moore ultimately won the election at the General Election, defeating Bruce Antone by a 53%-47% margin. 2008 board elections In District 1, where Teresa Jacobs could not run again due to term limits, S. Scott Boyd and Sharon Gravitte finished in a near dead heat, 35.31% to 33.81% respectively, in the 2008-08-26, primary election. In a runoff held during the general election on November 4, Boyd won the election with 55% of the vote. In District 3, Mildred Fernandez successfully defended her seat in a one-on-one election between her and challenger John Kelly Harris in the general election on November 4. She received 56.75% of the vote. In District 5, Bill Segal ran unopposed, and retained his seat 2014 board elections In District 2, incumbent commissioner Fred Brummer of Apopka was term-limited out of office. State representative Bryan Nelson came with one percent of the vote to avoid a November runoff election as he finished first in the six-way primary with 49% of the vote. Eatonville vice-mayor finished in second place and advanced to the runoff with 18% of the vote, finishing a few hundred votes ahead of corrections officer Patricia Rumph, who finished third. Two other candidates, Prince Brown and Greg Jackson finished with a combined 15% of the vote. In District 4, incumbent Jennifer Thompson ran for re- election with opposition from union representative Euri Cerrud and homemaker Maribel Cordero. She easily beat out both, winning outright with 65% of the vote. In District 6, incumbent commissioner Tiffany Moore Russell was term- limited and entered the race for the Orange County clerk of courts. Businessman Derrick \\"Shine\\" Wallace and lawyer and husband of Gary Siplin, Victoria Siplin emerged from the primary with 21% and 28% of the vote respectively. They will both take part in the November runoff. Other candidates receiving votes were former Moore Russell aide Roberta Walton, Virginia Whittington, former Orange County commissioner Homer Hartage and community activist Luwanna Gelzer.

He was abbot of Bursfelde, 1968–1971. He was born in Dresden and spent his formative years in Jerusalem, where between 1910 and 1918 his father, Friedrich Jeremias (1868–1945), worked as Provost of the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer. He studied Lutheran theology and Oriental languages at the universities of Tübingen and Leipzig. In Leipzig he obtained both a \\"Doctor philosophiae (Dr.phil.)\\" (1922) and a \\"Doctor theologiae (Dr.theol.)\\" (1923) degree (PhD and ThD in English), followed by his Habilitation (1925). His mentor was the renowned Gustaf Dalman. After other teaching assignments, Jeremias was appointed in 1935 to the chair of New Testament studies at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, where he taught until his retirement in 1968. In 1976, Jeremias moved from Göttingen to Tübingen, where he died in 1979. Academic work His research and publications covered a wide field, ranging from historical and archaeological to literary and philosophical studies. They concentrate on the Hebrew Bible and Rabbinic texts relevant for a critical analysis of the New Testament in order to reconstruct the historical environment of Jesus in all its complexity, to provide a deeper understanding of his life and teachings. His achievements found national and international acknowledgment, recognized by the admission into the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in 1948 and the award of honorary doctorates from the universities of Leipzig, St Andrews (Britain), Uppsala (Sweden), and Oxford (Britain). He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. He was elected a corresponding fellow of the British Academy in 1973. Finally, in 1970 he was made an honorary fellow of the Deutsche Verein zur Erforschung Palästinas (German association for research on Palestine). Jeremias on the New Testament Apocrypha He worked with Wilhelm Schneemelcher in revisions of the Hennecke-Schneemelcher collection of New Testament Apocrypha. Jeremias on Jesus in the Talmud Jeremias took a stand on the passages generally regarded as relating to Jesus in the Talmud which supported medieval rabbinical defences that the Yeshu the deceiver mentioned in the Talmud was a different Jesus from the Jesus of Christianity. Related to this he also supported David Flusser's suggestion that the name Yeshu itself was in no way abusive, but 'almost certainly' a Galilean dialect form of Yeshua.New Testament theology Joachim Jeremias - 1977 \\"... deliberate truncation made for anti-Christian motives; rather, it is 'almost certainly' (Flusser, Jesus, 13) the Galilean pronunciation of the name; the swallowing of the 'ayin was typical of the Galilean dialect (Billerbeck I 156f.

She is the second character to use the identity of the White Tiger, the first being Hector Ayala. Fictional character biography When the High Evolutionary mutated a wolf into a powerful creature called the Man- Beast, his creation turned evil, and escaped. High Evolutionary created a second altered animal to catch his rogue wolf. He mutated a white Bengal tigress into a woman, whom he named the White Tiger. White Tiger's bestial origins gave her cat-like speed and reflexes, and she was highly skilled in martial arts. On her quest to find Man-Beast, White Tiger joined a team of villains called the U-Foes, and fell in love with their leader, Vector. When the U-Foes attacked a supervillain prison, White Tiger left the team, and searching for heroes to help her, found Iron Fist. She was intrigued by him, and joined his team Heroes for Hire. White Tiger tried to keep her origins a secret, but during a training session with Iron Fist, he defeated her several times in mock combat. Her anger overwhelmed her, and she lost control and reverted to her tiger form. She feared that the others would shun her for her animal-nature, but they accepted her as part of the team. White Tiger is returned to her natural form White Tiger found herself becoming attracted to Iron Fist, as she thought he was a \\"fine hunter\\", and was impressed with his skills and stealth. However, she learned that Iron Fist was in love with Misty Knight. White Tiger tried to chase Misty away from Iron Fist, even trying to attack Misty in her tiger form, in a show of dominance (like tigers do in the wild). When Misty told White Tiger that humans don't use dominance to fall in love, it broke White Tiger's heart. When White Tiger finally captured Man- Beast, she begged the High Evolutionary to turn her back into a tiger, to remove her humanity, as she couldn't deal with the pain of human emotions. He turned her back into a tiger, and promised to return her to the rainforests where he found her.Heroes for Hire #1-19 In the X-Men: Endangered Species storyline, it was revealed that the White Tiger had a sister who was altered into a humanoid white tiger called Snow Queen. When Snow Queen threatened to kill some explorers attempting to enter Wundagore, Beast says that White Tiger would have bitten off her own tongue before threatening unarmed innocents. Powers and abilities White Tiger is an expert martial artist who has cat- like speed and reflexes. Her gloves are equipped with razor-sharp claws. If angered, White Tiger can return to her tiger form, and in this form, she has deadly talons, superhuman strength, and enhanced senses.

While few of the tracks were self-penned, it features tracks from many of the band's favourite writers including Huw Williams, Ralph McTell and Julie Matthews. History The album was recorded in two stages. Initially a few tracks were partially recorded with recording engineer Tim Matyear. Matyear's departure from Dave Pegg's Woodworm Studio led to producer-engineer Mark Tucker being hired to continue with recording the remaining material. At a very late stage in the production, producer Gus Dudgeon made a contribution to the mixing of the songs \\"Jewel In The Crown\\", \\"The Naked Highwayman\\", \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"Red Tide\\". Some subtractive edits were made to \\"The Naked Highwayman\\" as Dudgeon felt the song was too long. Overall it is generally considered one of the most satisfying of Fairport's releases since Nine. It was also the last studio album recorded by the Nicol, Pegg, Mattacks, Allcock and Sanders line- up.

She has written several plays for stage, radio and television, some of which have even gained international repute. She is the recipient of the Pride of Performance award for her services to the performing arts in Pakistan. She wrote Pakistan's first original script 'Kiran Kahani' aired in the early-1970s. Before this PTV relied on novel-based scripts for dramas. She is considered to be the best playwright and dramatist Pakistan has ever witnessed. Some of the most popular dramas she wrote that gained international repute include Ankahi, Tanhaiyaan, Kiran Kahani, Dhoop Kinaray, Aahat, Uncle Urfi, Shehzori, Kohar, Des Pardes, Pal Do Pal, Aansoo, Kasak, Parchaiyan (1976) and Parosi. Other notable works include Mere Dard ko Jo Zuban Milay, Kaisa Yeh Junoon, Dhundle Raaste, Shayad ke Bahar Aaye, Mohim Joo, Tum Se Mil Kar, Bandish and Zer Zabar Paish. It appears strange that with such a success following even greater success on the TV screen, Moin didn't branch out into other literary forms like novels or short stories which are such a popular genre among Urdu fiction writers. Early life A native of Kanpur, the most populous city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Haseena Moin received her early education in her ancestral region and, after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, migrated with her family to Pakistan. She lived for a number of years in Rawalpindi, then moved to Lahore and, in the 1950s, settled in Karachi, where she graduated from the Government College for Women in 1960 and earned Master of Arts in History from Karachi University in 1963. Her yearn for writing was visible right from the time she was in final years of her schooling, as from 7th standard, beside other school activities she got selected to write weekly column by the title of BHAI JAN for a local journal. Her fame started laying its foundation when she regularly wrote some memorable plays for Radio Pakistan Karachi's all-time popular \\"Studio Number 9. Professionally, she took up the educational pursuits and start teaching. She rose to the level of Principal. It was in 1969 that Iftikhar Arif, Head of the Script Dept. at PTV- Karachi Centre, called Hasina and offered her to write a play for the then- forthcoming EID. Initially Hasina was nervous, but took courage to pen down a play. The cast was also decided by her with Kunwar Aftab Ahmed as the director. Hence came Eid Ka Jorra with Neelofer Aleem and Talat Hussain in lead, supported by Khalid Nizami and Ishrat Hashmi. Career Pakistan television She has penned down many successful and most famous plays of PTV like Shehzori, Zeir Zabr Peish, Uncle Urfi, Ankahi, Tanhaiyaan, Parchaieyen, Bandish, Dhund, Dhoop Kinarey, Aahat, Kasak, Pal Do Pal and Tere Ajane Se. Her play Gurya which was directed by Shirin Khan with cast members Manzoor Qureshi, Shahla Ahmad Bina of Uncle Urfi, Azra Sherwani and Raju Jamil, won an award at the Global TV Plays Festival in Tokyo for best script and direction. She was the writer of the first coloured drama of Pakistan, aired on PTV called Parchaiyan, which had a huge star cast and was directed by Mohsin Ali. She has also written Pakistan's first original script 'Kiran Kahani' aired in the early-1970s. Before this PTV used to rely on novel based scripts. Most of the people at that time were not confident with the experiment but it was Mohsin Ali who encouraged her to write and finally when the play was on air, it was a huge success and is remembered to date. It starred Roohi Bano in the lead with Manzoor Qureshi, Begum Khursheed Mirza, Qazi Wajid and many more. Indian television Her drama serial Dhoop Kinare, which aired in 1987 and was famous in Pakistan as well as India. A loosely based remake of it was later made in India by the name of Kuch Toh Log Kahenge and it aired between 2011–2013. It was re-written by popular Indian writer Kamlesh Pandey, who stated that by remaking this play he has paid tribute to Hasina Moin. Even Tanhaiyan was quite popular. These shows are still remembered amongst the Indian masses. She wrote a play for India called Tanha, which become widely popular during its run. She also wrote a play for Doordarshan called 'Kash-m- kash', Arshad Mahmood composed and Tina Sani sang the title song of the play. Films Lollywood Moin wrote the script for the 1978 film Yahan Se Wahan Tak, starring Waheed Murad. The film was produced and directed by Syed Kamal. She also wrote the dialogues for the 1986 film Nazdekiyan which was directed by Usman Peerzada, starring Samina Peerzada and Usman Peerzada. The film was acclaimed and won prestigious national awards. In 1998, Moin wrote Kahin Pyar Na Ho Jaye. The film was directed by Javed Sheikh and the cast included Resham, Shaan and Saleem Sheikh. Before release, the film was heavily hyped and was expected to be a success but eventually could not perform well at the box office. Bollywood Moin was the first Pakistani writer to write for a Bollywood film. Raj Kapoor wanted her to write the dialogues for his dream project Henna, which was released in 1991. He also wanted to cast Shehnaz Sheikh in the title role of the film but after she refused, Haseena Moin recommended Zeba Bakhtiar as the leading lady, thus Zeba was cast in the title role of Henna. The film was a box office success and was also chosen as India's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. Initially she was hesitant to write for a Bollywood film. During the pre production stages Raj Kapoor died, and the project was taken over by his son Randhir Kapoor. But when the film was about to release the Babri Mosque incident broke out and Moin wrote a letter to Randhir Kapoor in which she requested that her name should not be used to promote the film neither her name should be mentioned in the credits as it may hurt her fans in Pakistan, thus her name was not mentioned in the credits nor the film was promoted using her name but she was acknowledged at the end of the film. Although this incident brought a lot of loss to her but she stated in an interview that she can do any thing for her country and sacrificing a film was very little thing for her she could also give her life for her country. Genres She has written every type of drama. From comedies like Shehzori, Uncle Urfi, Tanhaiyaan with best comic characters in her plays, like Mamoo, Timmy and Moby in Ankahi. Qabacha, Bukrad and Aapa Begum in Tanhaiyan, Gazi Apa in Uncle Urfi to tragedies like Parchaiyaan. From romantic dramas like Dhoop Kinaray, Ankahi,Kohar to family dramas like Aansoo. She has also written several plays based on social issues like the super hit Aahat, it was based on family planning and was directed by Sahira Kazmi, her play Des Pardes was based on the lives of people living Scotland and the problems they have to face. Chup Darya a telefilm starring Sania Saeed was based on Karachi's conditions and Shayad ke Bahar Aye was based on Women rights. She has also written historic plays like Tansen, Meray Dard ko jo Zuban Mile and the recent Anjaane Nagar. Her other plays include Parosi, Pal do Pal, Kasak based on the life of a single parent, Dhundle Raaste and many more. Recurring collaborators Directors Many of Haseena's plays have been directed by (late) Mohsin Ali. Starting from Hasina's first play Shehzori to Mohsin's last play Ik Naye Morr Pe, they have worked together in more than 10 plays. Other directors with whom Haseena has repeatedly work include Shoaib Mansoor (his debut play Ankahi and the long play Dhundle Raaste), Sahira Kazmi (she directed Hasina's two blockbuster plays Dhoop Kinare and Aahat and she directed her first play Choti Choti Baatein which was also written by Hasina, Sahira also acted in Haseena's Parchaiyan, M Zaheer Khan (he directed several episodes of Zer Zabar Pesh, he also directed Kohar, Aania and the remake of Kiran Kahani, Shirin Khan directed some early plays of Haseena which include the all-time famous Uncle Urfi, Zer Zabar Pesh, Kiran Kahani and Gurya, Raana Sheikh (she directed Parosi, Shayad ke Bahar Aye and Kaisa Yeh Junoon), Ali Rizvi (he directed the famous Aansoo and Des Pardes as well as Meray Dard Ko Jo Zuban Mile).

One of the very senior actresses of both radio and television who brought life to many fiery characters like Ladli Begum in Zer-Zabar-Pesh and Mali Khala in Shehzori was Arsh-e-Munir. No one talks about her but she is worth paying tribute to as artists like Begum Khusheed Mirza and Arsh-e-Munir brought culture and particularly the delivery of old Urdu proverbs and idioms (kahawatain; Mahaware) by means of dialogue in such a beautiful manner that people got the exact picture of what old ladies used to be like in the early 20th century.

She was very disappointed so she asked the producers to remove her name from the serial but due to copyright issues her name could not be removed. But she has said she had nothing to do with Naye Silsilay and was very disappointed by the outcome. A serial titled Anjaane Nagar started airing on TV ONE from May 2013.

TERA-10 was ranked 142nd on the TOP500 list in 2010. By 2015 it had dropped off the bottom of the list. It runs at 52.84 teraFLOPs (52.84 trillion floating point calculations per second) using nearly 10,000 processor cores (in about 4800 dual-core processors). It runs the Linux operating system, with an SMP kernel specially modified to handle very large symmetric clusters currently cadenced by an 8-processors central system. Its main application is the simulation of atomic experiences and the maintenance of the French nuclear defence force, using the results of true nuclear tests (between 1956 and 1995, most of them in the French Nuclear Test Plant in the Pacific) and the new results obtained from the LMJ(Laser Mega-Joule) built in continental France. Evolution This is the end of a second generation of evolutions, the next generation will reach about 100 TeraFLOPS (expected in 2009) using processors with more internal cores and a new central scheduling system allowing asymmetric operation on a variable number of processors, for easier upgrades, lower maintenance cost, and more experiences requiring different computing scales, without having to rebuild the whole cluster. This new system should be renamed Tera-100.

APA-52 was the second US Navy vessel named Sumter. The ship was laid down on 3 April 1942 as Iberville by Gulf Shipbuilding of Chickasaw, Alabama, for the Waterman Steamship Company; launched on 4 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. J. F. McRae; and acquired by the Navy on 30 April 1943 as AP-97. She was converted into an attack transport (APA-52) by the Maryland Drydock Company of Baltimore, Maryland, and commissioned on 1 September 1943, Capt. A. D. Blackledge in command. World War II Sumter sailed to Virginia and completed fitting out at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She then loaded a complement of 31 landing craft and a Beach Party unit before sailing to the West Coast where she became the flagship of Transport Division (TransDiv) 26. She spent most of December 1943 conducting landing exercises off San Clemente, California, with elements of the 25th Regimental Combat Team, 4th Marine Division. Invasion of Marshall Islands Sumter stood out of San Diego on 13 January 1944 en route to Lahaina Roads, Hawaii, to rendezvous with other units of Task Force (TF) 53, the Northern Attack Force for the Marshall Islands operation. She arrived there on 21 January and the force sortied the next day. Sumter and three other transports landed three battalion landing teams of the 25th Marines on the atolls of Ennumennet and Ennubirr on 31 January to establish field artillery positions in support of the main landings at Roi and Namur. Sumter completed landing all of her troops by 3 February and sailed the next day for the South Pacific for amphibious training. After exercises in New Caledonia and the Ellice and Solomon Islands, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 April. Invasion of Saipan As a component of Task Group (TG) 54.4, Admiral R. K. Turner's Northern Attack Force for the invasion of Saipan and Tinian, the transport again loaded elements of the 4th Marine Division and sailed on 29 May. The attack force refueled at Eniwetok and was off the landing beaches at Saipan before daybreak on 15 June. Covered by an intensive air-sea bombardment, and receiving incoming fire from enemy artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons, the assault wave of marines landed at 0843. The transport remained off the beaches until the 24th when she sailed to Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. Before leaving Saipan, she had sent more supplies and equipment to Blue Beach One, treated wounded direct from the beaches and, prior to sailing, received on board an additional 85 battle casualties from LST-218. Invasion of Palaus Sumter arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 July and trained there until 12 August when she was routed to Guadalcanal for additional amphibious exercises with the 81st Infantry Division. She sailed from Lunga Point, on 8 September, with the troops embarked to participate in the invasion of the Palau Islands. After landing advance assault troops and a Beach Party at Anguar on the 15th, she stood off the island as the floating reserve for the 1st Marine Division's attack on Peleliu Island. The transport landed troops of the 81st Division on Anguar on 17 September and remained as a casualty evacuation ship until sailing to Manus, Admiralty Islands, on the 23d. Invasion of the Philippines Sumter was routed from there to Finschhafen, New Guinea, where she embarked men of the 10th Army Corps and sailed with Reinforcement Group 1 for the Philippine Islands. The troops were landed at San Pedro Bay on 2 October, two days after the initial assault. The ship steamed to Guam, loaded elements of the 77th army Division and disembarked them at Leyte on 23 November. She next steamed south to New Guinea and Sansapor. At the latter port, she loaded troops of the 6th Army Division and sailed with the San Fabian Attack Force on 30 December 1944 for the Lingayen Gulf area of the Philippines. Invasion of Lingayen On 8 January 1945 a kamikaze plane crashed into approximately 600 yards ahead of Sumter, and Sumter took over as formation guide. The next morning the assault troops, including those from Callaway, were landed on the Lingayen beaches. She steamed back to San Pedro three days later and made a turn around voyage back to Lingayen with reinforcements which were landed on the 27th. She sailed for Seeadler Harbor and voyage repairs, thence to the Solomon Islands. Invasion of Okinawa Sumter arrived at Guadalcanal on 19 February 1945 and began amphibious exercises with the 22d Regimental Combat Team of the 6th Marine Division in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. She stood out of the Guadalcanal area on 14 March for Ulithi, Caroline Islands, where final staging was completed. The invasion force sortied on the 27th, and Sumter arrived off the beaches near Yontan Airfield in the early morning of 1 April. After landing 1,352 marines of the assault waves, the transport remained off the beach until sailing for the United States, via the Mariana Islands and Pearl Harbor, on 5 April. Sumter arrived at San Pedro, California, on 30 April for overhaul. Following repairs, she trained in the San Diego area until 21 July when she sailed for the Phillppine Islands loaded with army troops. After calling at the Marshall and Caroline Islands, the ship arrived in San Pedro Bay on 15 August, as hostilities with Japan ceased. After hostilities The transport embarked a contingent of the Army 33rd Infantry Division and departed for Japan on 9 September. The troops were landed at Wakayama, Honshū, on 25 September; and Sumter headed back to the Philippines for more Army occupation troops which were disembarked at Matsuyama, Japan. She returned to Subic Bay on 1 November and embarked Navy veterans for transportation to the United States. Sumter arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 22 November 1945 and remained there until 25 January 1946 when she moved to San Pedro, California, to unload her landing craft. Five days later, she sailed from there for the East Coast, via the Panama Canal. The ship arrived at New Orleans on 15 February but left there the following month for Mobile, Alabama. Decommission Sumter was decommissioned on 19 March in the yard of the Gulf Shipbuilding Corp., Chickasaw, Alabama, and struck from the Navy List on 17 April 1946. She was returned to custody of the War Shipping Administration on 1 August 1946 for disposal. Decorations Sumter received six battle stars for World War II service. Commercial service After being sold by the Navy, Sumter was converted into the first container ship, the SS Gateway Cityhttp://www.navsource.org/archives/10/03/03052.htm at Mobile SR Inc., of Chickasaw, Alabama in September 1957.

Boxing career Canizales turned professional in 1984 and was undefeated in twelve fights (one fight was a draw) before meeting the 1984 Olympic gold medalist Paul Gonzales in 1986. Gonzales defeated him over twelve rounds. Canizales rebounded from that defeat, however, and on July 9, 1988, he won the IBF bantamweight title by knocking out defending titlist Kelvin Seabrooks in the fifteenth round. He tied the division record for consecutive title defences at 15 set by Manuel Ortiz. His victims included old foe Gonzales, former flyweight champion Rolando Bohol, British champion Billy Hardy, and future champion Clarence \\"Bones\\" Adams. Many people incorrectly state that Orlando Canizales made 16 consecutive defences. This is due to many of them counting a no contest with Derrick Whiteboy as a title defence. No contests are not title defences however as the champion can't defend his title in a match that isn't considered to be a proper boxing contest. In January 1995, Canizales attempted to win a title in the junior featherweight division. World Boxing Association champion Wilfredo Vazquez prevented him from doing so, winning a twelve-round split decision. He continued fighting until 1999, when future champion Frank Toledo defeated him via ten-round split decision. He retired after that loss. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame on July 14, 2009. With his parents watching, an emotional Canizales approached the podium and delivered a heartfelt speech. \\"Boxing has taught me a lot in life -- that dedication, discipline and determination will pay off in the long run and not to be easily swayed by obstacles and bumps in the road.\\" Personal He was born in Laredo, the seat of Webb County in South Texas. There he began training at the age of ten at the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. He is the younger brother of fellow bantamweight world champion Gaby Canizales.

He was grandson of Uruguayan politician and patriot Luis María Lamas. During the Lamas administration the city grew considerably in population (by more than one third between the 1900 and 1906 censuses) and gained infrastructure and luxury. New streets were opened and older ones were paved. In 1900 Lamas authorized the construction of the Parque de la Independencia, a large urban park designed by famed landscape architect Carlos Thays, which was inaugurated two years later. Also in 1902, the foundation stone of the modern port of Rosario was laid, as works were initiated to clean up the ravine of the Paraná River and to build a new coastal avenue. Lamas also dictated the beginning of the works for the Central Market, and created the first commission that proposed to build a National Flag Memorial. In 1900, the municipal administration dictated regulations that allowed for legal prostitution, mandating the inscription of sex workers in a recording office, with the requirements of being 18 or older, working only in authorized facilities, having two medical examinations per week, and keeping an updated sanitary card with a picture, as well as forbidding public exhibition. In 1902 a new regulation included the waitresses in certain types of bars, to avoid clandestine unrecorded prostitution. References * Municipality of Rosario.

The band was started by Paul Mac and Tristan Mason and an early lineup included two bass players. The name came about when one of them was listening to an Eric B and Rakim album which had the vocal line in it: \\"Back to the lab\\" which, according to Mason: \\"described our after gig practices, as in lets go back to The Lab, which was where me, Paul and Yolanda all lived.\\" They formed in the late 1980s and initially recorded on the rooArt label. Their first release was the track \\"Heaven\\" which was included on rooArt's 1990 Young Blood 3 new artists sampler. The Lab's early work was characterised by a dense, darkwave-industrial sensibility mixed with techno and synthpop elements with vocals provided by Factor and the operatically- trained Podolski. Their early sound displayed influences as varied as Cocteau Twins to Tackhead (whom they supported at a 1989 Sydney show) and New Order. Their sound was also influenced by the classical training of Mac and the operatically trained alto singer Podolski. Tom Ellard from Severed Heads helped produce an album during this era that was never released, and only a smattering of the darker material made its way on to the Ultra and Terminal EPs released in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The Lab's live performances, mostly at Sydney inner-city venues, were noteworthy for their use of multimedia, beyond any other small live bands of the time. Live performances made use of multiple film and/or video projectors, displaying surreal footage and stills synchronised with each part of each song they were playing . While The Lab enjoyed good airplay rotation on the youth radio station Triple J, they never achieved high-level commercial success. The Lab took a recording hiatus during the mid-1990s as Paul Mac found moderate pop success with his other, more commercially oriented project, Itch-E and Scratch-E. Two singles \\"Beautiful Sadness\\" (1996) and \\"I Will Find You\\" (1997) were released in advance of the debut album proper, 1997's Labyrinth. By this time their sound had evolved into a more ambient-pop-oriented direction, but the singles had little chart impact. Labyrinth turned out to also be their last album and the group disbanded in the late 1990s as the members pursued solo projects.

It has three main areas of attraction: collections of small exotic animals, farm animals and birds; landscaped gardens and woodlands; and children's play areas. In 1956, Beale Park was formed by Gilbert Beale who decided to give the Thames-side park land to ‘the people’ by converting it from private farmland into a non-profit making, charitable trust. In those days it was little more than a track and a couple of ponds. Attractions Over recent years, the park has expanded to accommodate a wide variety of visitors, especially the youngest ones. The park has recently built a Roplay area, a pets area, sand pits, paddling pools, Little Tikes Play Area, and the Beale Railway, a section of narrow gauge railway on which is run a diesel locomotive, \\"Sir Humphrey Davy\\"; and previously a steam locomotive, \\"John Remmy\\", each capable of pulling 5 carriages and 50 people.Beale Park - Attractions - Train Thirteen people were injured when a steam train crashed on the Beale Railway on Saturday, 27 June 2009.Steam train crash on mini railway, BBC News, Saturday, 27 June 2009 For older visitors, there are the gardens, lakes, and the model boat exhibition. There is also a gift shop, education centre, and restaurant on site. Birds One of the White-faced whistling ducks the lemurs live with Beale Park's aviaries are home to a wide variety of bird species that are threatened with extinction. Most notable are the green peafowl, the mountain peacock pheasant, and the Bali starling. There is also successful breeding programme and several birds have been released back to the wild. There are many themed aviaries around the park including: Regional aviaries (home to African, Asian and Australian birds), the walkthrough aviary, the owlery, Madagascan aviary, and the flamingos. Changes Over recent years, the park has expanded greatly to a more zoological collection, the park now houses lemurs, owls, and in 2007, meerkats, prairie dogs, and tamarins arrived. 2008 saw the arrival of various new exhibits and attractions including a New Zealand exhibit with wallabies and Arapawa goats and a small African mammals enclosure purpose built for yellow mongoose and bat-eared foxes with a raised walkway for improved viewing and also a new pair of capybaras.

It is a hardwood that is used for furniture, flooring, and decoration. Its hard fruit pods have edible dry pulp surrounding the seeds. Its sap, called animé, is used for incense, perfume, and varnish. Names Hymenaea courbaril is commonly known as the \\"courbaril\\", \\"West Indian locust\\", \\"Brazilian copal\\", and \\"amami-gum\\", and \\"Jatoba\\". Although it is sometimes denominated \\"Brazilian cherry\\" and \\"South American cherry\\", it is not a cherry tree but a legume of the family Fabaceae. It is also known as \\"stinking toe\\", \\"old man's toe\\", and \\"stinktoe\\"Mesoamerican Copal Resins from Brian Stross at the University of Texas at Austin because of the unpleasant odor of the edible pulp of its seed pods.Worldwide weird: Bite into a stinking toe from BBC TravelStinking Toe from StJohnBeachGuide.com Fruit Its fruit, also known as locust, was a major food for indigenous peoples. Those who eat it do not consider the odor unpleasant. The pulp, in spite of its somewhat disagreeable odor, has a sweet taste; is consumed raw; may be dried and transformed into powder to be incorporated into cookies, crackers, and soups; and may be mixed with water to prepare a drink called \\"atole\\". The pulp inside the hard shells appears like miniature soluble fibers that dissolve easily in water or milk, which it thickens. Some add sugar to it for more sweetness. If consumed raw it tends to stick inside the mouth like dry dust. It is one of the richest vegetable foods known because of its high concentrations of starches and proteins. It is further an excellent concentrated feed for animals. Animé The tree produces an orange, soft, sticky resin or gum, denominated \\"animé\\" (French for \\"animated\\", in reference to its insect-infested natural state). The resin has a specific gravity varying from 1.054 to 1.057. It melts readily over fire, and softens even with the heat of the mouth. It diffuses white fumes and a very pleasant odor. Insects are generally entrapped in it in large numbers. It is insoluble in water, and nearly so in cold alcohol. It is similar to copal in its nature and appearance, and a copal from Zanzibar is sometimes given this name. The production of animé may be encouraged by wounding the bark. The resin collects between the principal roots. It can be obtained from other species of Hymenaea growing in tropical South America. Brazilians use it internally to treat diseases of the lungs. It was formerly an ingredient of ointments and plasters, but at present its only use is for incense and varnish. Wood The wood is very hard, measuring 5.6 on the Brinell scale and on the Janka scale, approximate measurements of hardness. For comparison, Douglas fir measures , white oak , and Brazilian walnut on the Janka scale. It features a tan to salmon color with black accent stripes that over time turn to a deep and vibrant red.

Meadows was converted to Christianity at Perth, Scotland. He later lived at Barnsley, Yorkshire. Meadows and his wife, Martha, sailed for China aboard the Challenger on 8 January 1862 and arrived at Shanghai on 24 May. They were at first unconnected to any organized mission agency, as Hudson Taylor's first recruits for the \\"Ningbo Mission\\" which three years later became the China Inland Mission. Their first field of work was in Ningbo maintaining the missionary work with missionary John Jones and Edward Clemens Lord at the Bridge Street premises, while awaiting reinforcements from England. Martha died suddenly at Ningbo in 1863, and Meadows later proposed marriage by letter to her friend, Elizabeth Rose. Upon Miss Rose's arrival with the Lammermuir Party at Shanghai on 30 September 1866, the couple were married in October 1866 in Ningbo. Elizabeth Meadows died on 3 November 1890.

World War II The 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment was activated at Camp Toccoa, Georgia on 15 November 1942. The 501st was part of the 101st Airborne Division during World War II and the Vietnam War. Camp Toccoa, GA, c. 1942 The famous test platoon, the prime ancestor of all American parachute units, provided the nucleus of the 1st Parachute Battalion, which in turn provided part of the cadre, the unit number, the genealogical lineage and the heraldic background of the 501st Parachute Regiment. Its initial group of officers were hand picked by its first commander, Colonel Howard R. Johnson. Colonel Howard R. Johnson. The first commander of the 501st PIR Known by his peers as \\"Skeets\\", he was very much in the swashbuckling mold of most of the original parachute regimental commanders, of whom the popular saying was \\"To command a parachute unit, you don't have to be nuts, but it helps!\\" Johnson attended the Naval Academy for two years; he boxed while a midshipman. He had transferred to the Army after leaving Annapolis and had most recently been at the tank destroyer center before volunteering for parachute duty. To say that he took to parachuting is a gross understatement: he ate, slept, and breathed it, and jumped whenever he possibly could, often jumping many times in a single day. His nickname among his men became \\"Jumping Johnson.\\" He was a zealot on physical conditioning, for himself and everyone in his regiment, and personally led calisthenics, running and all other physical activities. He set a record for running up Currahee Mountain (which loomed over Camp Toccoa) and challenged anyone in the regiment to beat his time. A heavy punching bag hung outside his quarters, and when not punching that, Johnson could often be seen throwing his huge knife at hanging plywood replicas of Hitler and Hirohito. All members of the regiment were parachute volunteers, but only a minor fraction were actually qualified jumpers during training at Camp Toccoa, GA. So, when that very arduous training was over in March 1943, the unit marched to Atlanta, GA, a distance of . They then moved to Fort Benning, GA, to jump train all members not previously qualified. With jump training over, the regiment was assigned to the Airborne Command at Camp MacKall, NC. This was its home base during prolonged maneuvers in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Louisiana, and until January 1944, when the regiment deployed to England, by way of Camp Myles Standish, MA. Once in England the 501st became a permanent attachment of the 101st Airborne Division and was a vital part of that famous unit for the duration of World War II. In England, training was hard, realistic and became increasingly oriented toward an airborne assault into German-held Europe. Although none of the soldiers knew this initially, the regiment was training for Operation Overlord, the secret allied plan for the combined air, naval, amphibious, and airborne operations to breach Hitler's \\"Atlantic Wall.\\" As D-Day drew closer, a few key commanders and staff were briefed on the part the 101st would play in Operation Overlord. Then with D-Day just days away, the 501st with the rest of the division was sequestered in well guarded marshaling camps where every man finally learned his own mission and the overall mission of the 501st and the 101st Airborne Division. These very extensive and intensive briefings were to later prove vital during actual operations. The 501st (less 3rd Battalion) took off from Merryfield Airport at 2245, 5 June 1944, while the 3rd Battalion departed at the same time from Welford. All units flew across the English Channel and were set to drop into Normandy, five hours prior to the seaborne landing. The 501st drop zones were north and east of Carentan. Two battalions were to seize key canal locks at La Barquette and destroy bridges over the Douve River, while the third battalion was in division reserve. The troop aircraft formations were widely scattered due to a combination of low clouds, poor visibility and enemy anti-aircraft fire. This caused highly scattered drops and units were widely dispersed across the battlefront. The ensuing action bore little resemblance to their briefing, but because the soldiers were well prepared, the regiment and the division accomplished its multiple missions, but none of them as rehearsed. The success was credited to the initiative, stamina, and daring of individual parachutists, who decided how best to accomplish some part of the overall mission. The capture of a key causeway from Utah Beach at Pouppeville by a scratch force of about 100 officers and men, formed around a nucleus from the 3rd Battalion (division reserve) of the 501st, was typical. Members of this ad hoc force included both General Maxwell Taylor and Assistant Division Commander Gerald Higgins. General Taylor later quipped that, \\"Never were so few led by so many.\\" Shoulder sleeve insignia of the 101st Airborne Division. The 501st was assigned to 101st Airborne during World War II and Vietnam. Fierce fighting in Normandy by no means ended with D-Day, but continued with important results in assisting the amphibious landings and joining the beach at Utah to that at Omaha. The efforts of the 501st came at high cost: the regiment lost 898 men killed, wounded, missing, or captured. The 501st returned to its base in England in mid-July, slowly regaining its pre-D-Day capabilities with many replacements and another round of intensive training. They received a presidential citation for their action in Normandy. They were briefed on several planned air assaults into France, each aborted when the allies overran planned objectives. In the early fall of 1944 they began preparing for an airborne assault into the occupied Netherlands. Code-named \\"Market Garden,\\" it combined a deep airborne thrust through the west of the Netherlands by the 1st Allied Airborne Army, with an overland drive by the British 2nd Army. The plan visualized airborne forces seizing key bridges over rivers and canals so 2nd Army could move very deep and fast over a distance of more than , past the Rhine River, the last major water obstacle short of Berlin. This airborne assault would be made in daylight. The 101st Airborne Division was assigned the southernmost bridges at Eindhoven, Son, Sint Oedenrode and Veghel, with the 501st assigned the Veghel Bridges. The airborne assault went as scheduled on 17 September 1944, with an improved performance by troop carrier units. Most drop zones were hit with good drop patterns. Klondike' in Veghel. The insignia of the 101st Airborne Division can still be seen on the top of the facadeKlondike - Headquarters 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (101st Airborne Division), TracesofWar.com, \\"The former house of Doctor Kersemakers was used as a headquarters during operation Market Garden in September 1944 by the 501ste Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. The commander of the 501st, colonel Howard Johnson, who pointed his order from this house.\\" 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, however, was dropped some east of its planned drop zone. In spite of this, the four bridges in Veghel were captured intact. Then began the really difficult part of the operation, keeping open the highway over which 2nd Army must pass to reach the British 1st Airborne Division, which was fighting for its life at the northern end of the airborne corridor. The fatal flaw in the plan became more evident each day as the forces proved too few to both keep open the key highway and also fight on to a linkup with the British Airborne across the Rhine. The 1st Airborne Division paid the full price for this flaw as they went down fighting against overwhelming odds; less than two thousand men escaped death or capture. The 501st, with the rest of the division, moved from initial objective areas to positions on \\"the island\\" between the Waal and Rhine Rivers; it became clear that they would not be withdrawn from the Netherlands after a few days, as they had been told; their combat skills were too much needed by the British. The prolonged fighting on \\"the island\\" was anything but the way to use an airborne unit. After the initial hard fighting it became a static war of patrolling and attrition, principally by artillery and mortars. One such mortar attack, near Heteren, on 8 October 1944, fatally wounded Colonel Johnson.COL Howard Johnson As he was being evacuated, his last words to LTC Ewell were, \\"Take care of my boys.\\" Colonel Johnson was the best-known loss, but with him they lost 661 other fine soldiers. LTC Julian Ewell, a taciturn West Pointer, succeeded COL Johnson. Much less an extrovert than Johnson, he more than made up for any lack of \\"flash and dash\\" with a keen mind, tactical prescience and all around professional competence. After 72 days of combat in the Netherlands the division returned to a new staging area in Mourmelon, France, for what everyone thought would be a long, well-deserved rest. Accordingly, many men were on leave or pass, the Division Commander was in the United States, the Assistant Division Commander was in England (leaving the Artillery Commander, General McAuliffe, in command), and there still were major shortages of equipment and supplies that had not been replaced after the Netherlands. The division was ill-prepared for the word they received in the late evening of 17 December. The Germans had launched a major offensive at dawn on 16 December through the Ardennes in the lightly held sector of VII Corps. At that time SHAEF's Reserve consisted of the 101st and the 82nd. The 101st was ordered to move \\"truckborne\\" to Bastogne, the hub town of a major radial road net, to stem the oncoming Germans. General McAuliffe ordered the move by regimental combat teams without waiting for any absentees. The 501st was the lead combat team in the division move, and after a grueling truck ride, reached Bastogne at about 2230 hrs. Thus, by midnight, the 501st was the only regiment combat team ready for action. Ewell asked McAuliffe for a definite assignment and was ordered to move out on the eastern road through Longvilly and seize and hold a key road junction beyond Longvilly. The 501st was the first to fight at Bastogne when one of its battalions ran into the enemy near Neffe, a few kilometers out of Bastogne. Thus began the defense of Bastogne in which the 501st gave up not one foot of ground, and in which the division, and its comrades in arms, stopped cold everything the Germans could throw at them, ruined Hitler's offensive time table and eventually won the 101st the first presidential unit citation ever awarded to a full division. Once again, the 501st paid a dear price of 580 killed, wounded or captured. One casualty was Colonel Ewell, who was badly wounded and relinquished command to LTC Robert Ballard, who had commanded 2nd Battalion from the beginning. Bob Ballard was a quiet Floridian who was not a professional soldier like Johnson or Ewell, but a fine officer who had learned how to command quietly and effectively while winning the admiration and respect of his men. Ballard continued in command of the 501st until the end of World War II. Operations after Bastogne would have been anticlimactic under most any circumstances, except for the light skirmishing in Alsace, and the drive into Germany's last redoubt, Bavaria, truly seemed like a cakewalk. The living in Germany after V-Day was good indeed, but rudely interrupted by orders to move back to billets in Joigny and Auxerre, France. Troops were advised not to take any captured cars or loot with them. Once in France the 501st began training for an invasion of Japan. On 20 August 1945, the 501st was disbanded, ahead of the inactivation of the 101st Division in November 1945. Cold War The 501st was reconstituted on 1 August 1946 at Fort Benning, GA, as the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion but was inactivated there on 23 November 1948.http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0501in001bn.htm Between 1951 and 1956 the 501st served with the 101st as a Regular Army non- Airborne training unit on two occasions, once at Camp Breckinridge, KY., and once at Fort Jackson, SC. In the spring of 1956, the 501st and the 101st moved (less personnel and equipment) to Fort Campbell, KY, where they were activated as a provisional organization to test the \\"Pentomic concept. The word pentomic referred to the five battle groups, which were in lieu of regiments and to the division's organic atomic weapon capability. One of the five battle groups was the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry. Its first commander was COL Harry Kinnard, who had been a member of the World War II regiment and also G-3 of the division from the Netherlands. As to matters on lineage, on 25 April 1957, the 501st Regiment ceased to exist as a tactical unit and was re- designated as the 501st Infantry, a parent regiment under the combat arms regimental system. Simultaneously, on the same date, Company A, 501PIR was reorganized and re-designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements were concurrently constituted and activated). An element of the 501st actually served with the 82nd Airborne Division when the 82nd reconfigured in the pentomic format. On 1 September 1957, Company B, 501PIR was reorganized and re-designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry as an organic element of the 82nd Airborne Division, and activated at Fort Bragg, NC (concurrently, organic elements constituted and activated at Fort Bragg). When the pentatonic concept gave way to the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD), with brigades and battalions instead of battle groups, the 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry was reorganized and re-designated as the 2nd Battalion, 501st Infantry. On 1 February 1964, its colors were relieved from assignment to the 82nd and assigned to the 101st at Fort Campbell, KY. The 101st was also reorganized as a ROAD airborne division, and the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry became the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry, of the 101st. Vietnam When the 101st deployed to South Vietnam in 1967, it included the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 501st. The division participated in twelve campaigns and was decorated by the Republic of Vietnam on three occasions. The 2nd Battalion, 501st, while attached to the 3rd Brigade, 101st received a Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969; the unit's battle streamer is embroidered Dong Ap Bia Mountain. The 2nd Battalion, 501st participated in Operation Texas Star, which culminated in the Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord in July 1970. The entire 101st participated in Operation Dewey Canyon II, in support of the ARVN attack on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos in February–March 1971. In May 1968 the 101st's jump status was terminated and it was reorganized as an Airmobile division. Post Vietnam As part of the post-Vietnam reorganization, the 2nd Bn, 501st Infantry was inactivated on 31 July 1972, and in the restructuring to the U.S. Army regimental system, the 1st Bn, 501st Infantry was inactivated at Fort Campbell on 5 June 1984. In October 1989 the 501st Regiment was reorganized under the U.S. Army Regimental System with headquarters at Fort Richardson, Alaska. Simultaneously, 1st Bn (Abn), 501st Infantry was assigned to the 6th Infantry Division and activated at Fort Richardson. The 6th, formed when the 172nd Infantry Brigade was expanded to a division, was inactivated during the post-Cold War draw down and reverted again to the 172nd Infantry Brigade (United States). The 1st Bn (Abn), 501st Inf was made a separate battalion combat team for a short period of time, around which the 4th Brigade (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division was constructed, where it serves to this day. Of the three original parachute regiments organic or attached to the 101st Airborne Division in World War II, the 501st remains as the only unit on jump status. Operation Enduring Freedom FOB Salerno. A forward operating base near the city of Khowst, Afghanistan. OEF IV-V: JTF 1–501 deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan from October 2003 until August 2004 under the direct command of CJTF-180 and 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Its first mission was to open the 'Khowst-Gardez Pass', also known as 'Ambush Alley' during the Russian/Soviet occupation.°https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khost-Gardez_Pass After a successful and (almost) uncontested Ground Assault Convoy (GAC) through Ambush Alley, the 501st based itself just outside the city of Khowst, helping to build what became known as FOB Salerno°https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Operating_Base_Salerno (Forward Operating Base Salerno), near the eastern border with Pakistan. The 501st played a significant role in disrupting enemy communications and infiltrations across the border in their Area of Operation. Commanded by LTC Harry C. Glenn, the 501st conducted coordinated searches and patrolled the mountains during Operations Avalanche, Blizzard, and Storm, in which its mission was to root out Taliban and Al Qaeda loyalists in the Khowst Province and Paktia Province. The natives of the region, mainly the Pashtun, were—more often than not—both enemies and allies to the 501st, making the mission that much more difficult. However, in comparison to the prior Soviet occupation, within just a few visits and 'elder tea meetings', the 501st quickly earned the trust of the local people and militia/warlords. As a result of the unit's time in-country, few enemies were killed, yet many were detained and captured when necessary (using an incredibly strict system that often resulted in capturing and re- capturing individuals, until it was proved that they were definitely 'enemy combatants'). Local Pashtun shepherds would even inform the 501st when non- local 'Arabs' planted IEDs (improvised explosive devices)/bombs on roads and trade routes, such that the 501st could help protect the local people. In addition, the 501st collected/confiscated tons upon tons of ammunition and weapons, which were destroyed, in the attempt to make the region safer for everyone (as referenced by direct US military reports in Wikileaks).°https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks During the occupation, the 501st conducted countless cordon and searches while confronting enemy combatants in direct battles. Furthermore, the 501st secured the Afghani border, organized the first known meeting between Afghani/Pakistani Officials since the Durand Line°https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line was established, created inter and intra-state commerce, advised on (and helped build) civil-security, conducted 'tail-gate' medicine to help with local health and prosperity issues, and even provided security for male and female children schools (often the target of radical Islam terrorist operations), with the overall intent to secure the entire region for local Democratic elections and allow for mutual peace and mutual prosperity of the Afghani/Pakistani region. The 1-501 was supported by an Air Force Special Operations Team (TACP), commanded by Captain A. Rodell Severson.Guardian Angels, The Air Force Times: Christian Lowe, 26APR2004 http://www.airforcetimes.com/legacy/new/0-AIRPAPER-2817838.php. The TACP went on all missions, providing Battlespace Control for the Geronimos and were an integral part of the Joint Task Force. Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF VI- VIII: The 501st deployed as part of its parent brigade in September 2006 till October 2007, and the final elements returned in December 2007 as part of a 14-month tour in north Babil Province, Iraq, south of Baghdad. The unit was the tenant organization at FOB Iskandariyah and conducted full-spectrum operations in the area's major population centers: Bahbahani, Jurf as Sakhr, Musayyib and Tahrir. Scouts from 1–501st Infantry Regiment (Airborne) conducting amphibious operations from FOB Iskandariyah in 2007. The 501st was also responsible for support to operations in the city and province of Karbala and provided paratroopers for additional contingency operations in Al Anbar Governorate, An Najaf and Hillah. For six months, the 501st with attachments was also responsible for the cities of Iskandariyah and Haswah as well as surrounding rural communities. Paratroopers from 1–501st Infantry Regiment (Airborne) conduct an air insertion as part of Operation Gecko north of Jurf as Sakhr, Iraq in 2007. Through the combined use of ground, air and amphibious operations, the unit was credited with the capture or neutralization of multiple ranking insurgents and bringing a strong measure of security to the area, as well as bolstering the capabilities of Iraqi security and defense forces. The 501st served under the divisional control of both the 1st Cavalry Division as part of Multi-National Division-Baghdad and the 3rd Infantry Division as a component of Multi-National Division-Central. The unit was awarded the Valorous Unit Award, the second highest unit award in the US Army, for its efforts during the 2006–2007 deployment. Operation Enduring Freedom OEF IX-X: In February 2009, just 14 months after returning from its 15-month deployment to Iraq, the 501st deployed for the second time to eastern Afghanistan as a part of Regional Command East, International Security Assistance Force. The battalion’s area of combat operations included Khost and Paktika provinces, all on the border with Pakistan; brigade headquarters was at Forward Operating Base Salerno in Khost. Known as Task Force Yukon. 1–501 IN BN (ABN) was called Task Force 1 Geronimo and conducted counterinsurgency operations for 12 months in partnership with Afghan National Security Forces and supervised governance, development, and agriculture projects in coordination with the Afghan government. The battalion redeployed to Fort Richardson in March 2010. The welcome home ceremony was held on 25 March 2010 at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage with Alaska Governor Sean Parnell in attendance. Seven soldiers were killed in action during the deployment; they are honored with a large stone memorial located in front of the battalion headquarters at Fort Richardson. For its efforts in Afghanistan in 2009–2010, the battalion was, once again, awarded the Valorous Unit Award for their actions. OEF XII-XIII: After 18 months of dwell time at their home station Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, 1–501 IN (ABN) deployed once again to Operation Enduring Freedom XII-XIII in December 2011. As one of the three maneuver battalions of 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division – Task Force Spartan – 1–501 IN (ABN), known operationally as Task Force Blue Geronimo, assumed authority of central and eastern Khost province. Task Force Spartan, with a higher headquarters at Regional Command East, International Security Assistance Force, was arrayed across Khost and Paktia Provinces to combat Taliban and Haqqani Network elements. Both the battalion and brigade headquarters were located at Forward Operating Base Salerno in Khost city. For ten months, through October 2012, the 501st aggressively countered Taliban and Haqqani Network infiltrations into and through Khost province. At the same time, the task force trained two battalions of Afghan National Army, two zones of Afghan Border Police, and the entire contingent of Afghan Uniformed Police (Khost) to conduct security operations with lessening dependence on ISAF assistance. Elements of the task force were sent into Paktia and Paktika provinces on various week-long operations to supplement 3rd Battalion, 509th Infantry Regiment (Airborne) and 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment (Airborne) from 4/25 ABCT as well as 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment from 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. Eight soldiers of Task Force Blue Geronimo were killed in action in Khost province; they are memorialized on a stone monument in front of battalion headquarters at Fort Richardson, where their names are transplanted among other fallen paratroopers of the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment (Airborne). Operation Freedom's Sentinel In September 2017 the 501st deployed to Afghanistan again as part of Operation Freedom's Sentinel. As Task Force 1 Geronimo, the battalion was arrayed throughout eastern Afghanistan performing advise and assist tasks. The task force was headquartered in Operating Base Fenty in Jalalabad. There were no soldiers killed in action on this 8-month deployment. Motto Geronimo; The basis for the unit's motto and slogan. The unit's motto is \\"Geronimo,\\" a phrase that has become synonymous with paratroopers and parachutists in general. The motto dates from 1940 and the lead up to World War II. The night before their first attempt to prove the feasibility of a mass jump, some U.S. paratroopers at Fort Benning watched the film Geronimo (1939). While drinking with fellow paratroopers after the show, Private Aubrey Eberhardt announced he would shout the name \\"Geronimo\\" when he jumped to prove he was not scared. He followed through with his promise and the practice soon caught on within the unit, becoming its unofficial motto. When the 501st was created the name was confirmed as the unit's official motto with the permission of the real Geronimo's family.Geronimo at B-Westerns, retrieved 4 June 2007The Straight Dope Why do parachutists yell \\"Geronimo!\\" when jumping from an airplane?\\", retrieved 4 June 2007 The Black Diamonds The modern cloth diamonds of the 501st sewn to the Army Combat Uniform helmet cover, as seen in Iraq. An additional patch is sewn to the opposing side out of view. During World War II, the 101st Airborne Division undertook steps to identify paratroopers from each divisional element visually. As a result, a suit from a deck of cards was painted on the helmets of the division's four infantry regiments. The helmets of the members of 501st were therefore emblazoned with a white diamond and each respective battalion was indicated with a white tick mark. During the Vietnam War the Diamond as well as the Spade, Heart and Club were used on the helmet by units of the 101st Airborne Division but instead of white it was black and most of the time a black permanent marker was the only thing needed to apply it. Post Vietnam the tradition carried on through the late 1970s. The modern day members of the 501st resurrected the tradition in 2003 prior to deployment to Afghanistan with two black cloth patches sewn to each side of their helmet covers. The tradition was carried over after the switch to the Army Combat Uniform as part of the Rapid Fielding Initiative in 2006 and again worn in Iraq. The emblem has entered common usage among members of the current battalion outside of helmet insignia, appearing on unit clothing, challenge coins and other souvenirs. A similar insignia has been recently appropriated for use by the current 101st Aviation Brigade to match that of other elements within the 101st Airborne Division which chose to use their original World War II regimental helmet markings. Despite their use of the diamond patches, there is no historical connection between the use of the insignia in World War II and the 101st Aviation Brigade. The brigade links their current use with the use of color-coded diamonds on UH-1s by the unit during Vietnam, when it carried the designation of 101st Aviation Battalion. Although helmet markings are commonly worn by units throughout the Army, The Institute of Heraldry has confirmed they are not authorized by the Army's uniform regulations.

It is a G-protein, and facilitates the selection and binding of an aa-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome. As a reflection of its crucial role in translation, EF-Tu is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins in prokaryotes. It is found in eukaryotic mitochrondria as TUFM. As a family of elongation factors, EF-Tu also includes its eukaryotic and archaeal homolog, the alpha subunit of eEF-1 (EF-1A).  Background  Elongation factors are part of the mechanism that synthesizes new proteins through translation in the ribosome. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) carry the individual amino acids that become integrated into a protein sequence, and have an anticodon for the specific amino acid that they are charged with. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information that encodes the primary structure of a protein, and contains codons that code for each amino acid. The ribosome creates the protein chain by following the mRNA code and integrating the amino acid of an aminoacyl-tRNA (also known as a charged tRNA) to the growing polypeptide chain. There are three sites on the ribosome for tRNA binding. These are the aminoacyl/acceptor site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P), and the exit site (abbreviated E). The P-site holds the tRNA connected to the polypeptide chain being synthesized, and the A-site is the binding site for a charged tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon associated with the site. After binding of a charged tRNA to the A-site, a peptide bond is formed between the growing polypeptide chain on the P-site tRNA and the amino acid of the A-site tRNA, and the entire polypeptide is transferred from the P-site tRNA to the A-site tRNA. Then, in a process catalyzed by the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-G (historically known as translocase), the coordinated translocation of the tRNAs and mRNA occurs, with the P-site tRNA moving to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome, and the A-site tRNA moves to take its place in the P-site.  Biological functions  300x300px  Protein synthesis  EF-Tu participates in the polypeptide elongation process of protein synthesis. In prokaryotes, the primary function of EF-Tu is to transport the correct aa-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome. As a G-protein, it uses GTP to facilitate its function. Outside of the ribosome, EF-Tu complexed with GTP (EF-Tu • GTP) complexes with aa-tRNA to form a stable EF-Tu • GTP • aa-tRNA ternary complex. EF-Tu • GTP binds all correctly-charged aa-tRNAs with approximately identical affinity, except those charged with initiation residues and selenocysteine. This can be accomplished because although different amino acid residues have varying side-chain properties, the tRNAs associated with those residues have varying structures to compensate for differences in side-chain binding affinities. The binding of an aa-tRNA to EF-Tu • GTP allows for the ternary complex to be translocated to the A-site of an active ribosome, in which the anticodon of the tRNA binds to the codon of the mRNA. If the correct anticodon binds to the mRNA codon, the ribosome changes configuration and alters the geometry of the GTPase domain of EF-Tu, resulting in the hydrolysis of the GTP associated with the EF-Tu to GDP and Pi. As such, the ribosome functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for EF-Tu. Upon GTP hydrolysis, the conformation of EF-Tu changes drastically and dissociates from the aa-tRNA and ribosome complex. The aa-tRNA then fully enters the A-site, where its amino acid is brought near the P-site's polypeptide and the ribosome catalyzes the covalent transfer of the polypeptide onto the amino acid. In the cytoplasm, the deactivated EF-Tu • GDP is acted on by the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-Ts, which causes EF-Tu to release its bound GDP. Upon dissociation of EF-Ts, EF-Tu is able to complex with a GTP due to the 5– to 10–fold higher concentration of GTP than GDP in the cytoplasm, resulting in reactivated EF-Tu • GTP, which can then associate with another aa-tRNA.  Maintaining translational accuracy  EF-Tu contributes to translational accuracy in three ways. In translation, a fundamental problem is that near-cognate anticodons have similar binding affinity to a codon as cognate anticodons, such that anticodon-codon binding in the ribosome alone is not sufficient to maintain high translational fidelity. This is addressed by the ribosome not activating the GTPase activity of EF-Tu if the tRNA in the ribosome's A-site does not match the mRNA codon, thus preferentially increasing the likelihood for the incorrect tRNA to leave the ribosome. Additionally, regardless of tRNA matching, EF-Tu also induces a delay after freeing itself from the aa-tRNA, before the aa-tRNA fully enters the A-site (a process called accommodation). This delay period is a second opportunity for incorrectly charged aa-tRNAs to move out of the A-site before the incorrect amino acid is irreversibly added to the polypeptide chain. A third mechanism is the less well understood function of EF-Tu to crudely check aa-tRNA associations and reject complexes where the amino acid is not bound to the correct tRNA coding for it.  Other functions  EF-Tu has been found in large quantities in the cytoskeletons of bacteria, co-localizing underneath the cell membrane with MreB, a cytoskeletal element that maintains cell shape. Defects in EF-Tu have been shown to result in defects in bacterial morphology. Additionally, EF-Tu has displayed some chaperone-like characteristics, with some experimental evidence suggesting that it promotes the refolding of a number of denatured proteins in vitro.  Structure  EF-Tu bound to GDP (yellow) and GDPNP (red), a GTP-like molecule. The GTPase domain (domain I) of EF-Tu is depicted in dark blue, while the oligonucleotide-binding domains II and III are depicted in light blue. Structures are from PDBs 1EFT and 1TUI, for GDP- and GDPNP-bound EF-Tu, respectively. EF-Tu is a monomeric protein with molecular weight around 43 kDa in Escherichia coli. The protein consists of three structural domains: a GTP-binding domain and two oligonucleotide- binding domains, often referred to as domain 2 and domain 3. The N-terminal domain I of EF-Tu is the GTP-binding domain. It consists of a six beta-strand core flanked by six alpha-helices. Domains II and III of EF-Tu, the oligonucleotide-binding domains, both adopt beta-barrel structures. The GTP- binding domain I undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis to GDP, allowing EF-Tu to dissociate from aa-tRNA and leave the ribosome. Reactivation of EF-Tu is achieved by GTP binding in the cytoplasm, which leads to a significant conformational change that reactivates the tRNA- binding site of EF-Tu. In particular, GTP binding to EF-Tu results in a ~90° rotation of domain I relative to domains II and III, exposing the residues of the tRNA-binding active site. Domain 2 adopts a beta-barrel structure, and is involved in binding to charged tRNA. This domain is structurally related to the C-terminal domain of EF2, to which it displays weak sequence similarity. This domain is also found in other proteins such as translation initiation factor IF-2 and tetracycline-resistance proteins. Domain 3 represents the C-terminal domain, which adopts a beta-barrel structure, and is involved in binding to both charged tRNA and to EF1B (or EF-Ts).  Evolution  The GTP-binding domain is conserved in both EF-1alpha/EF-Tu and also in EF-2/EF-G and thus seems typical for GTP-dependent proteins which bind non-initiator tRNAs to the ribosome. The GTP-binding protein synthesis factor family also includes the eukaryotic peptide chain release factor GTP-binding subunits and prokaryotic peptide chain release factor 3 (RF-3); the prokaryotic GTP-binding protein lepA and its homologue in yeast (GUF1) and Caenorhabditis elegans (ZK1236.1); yeast HBS1; rat statin S1; and the prokaryotic selenocysteine- specific elongation factor selB.  Disease relevance  Along with the ribosome, EF-Tu is one of the most important targets for antibiotic-mediated inhibition of translation. Antibiotics targeting EF-Tu can be categorized into one of two groups, depending on the mechanism of action, and one of four structural families. The first group includes the antibiotics pulvomycin and GE2270A, and inhibits the formation of the ternary complex. The second group includes the antibiotics kirromycin and enacyloxin, and prevents the release of EF-Tu from the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis.

Between 2002 and 2018, he was presenter for BBC Radio 1Xtra's weekly hip-hop show. Biography Due to complications from lymphangioma at the age of 16, DJ Semtex had an arm amputated. He did not confirm this until his 2016 autobiography and previously refused to answer questions on the subject. He began his career by promoting parties in Manchester while playing at the city's music venues such as The Haçienda. In 2002, DJ Semtex began hosting a Friday night show (21:00 to 23:00) on BBC Radio 1Xtra. He was Dizzee Rascal's official tour DJ in 2008, a role in which he also performed video DJing and scratching with his mouth. As an interviewer, he interviewed J. Cole shortly before the release of his debut album in 2010, DJ Khaled at his L.A. home in 2017, and conducted the only UK interview with Skepta upon the release of his album Konnichiwa. In 2009, Drake's first UK interview was with DJ Semtex; Drake had a follow-up interview with DJ Semtex that went viral and was covered by Rolling Stone, Billboard and The New Yorker. When Drake launched his ‘More Life’ project in London in early 2017, he discussed it with DJ Semtex. His debut as an author, Hip Hop Raised Me (2016), was well received, with co-signs from Drake, Chance the Rapper, Ghostface Killah, and Redman. It has been translated into French, German and Italian. In 2018, DJ Semtex announced he was leaving 1Xtra after 15 years working for the station and took his Friday night hip hop show to Capital XTRA.

At Berkeley  Arnold attended the University of California, Berkeley, after having worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory computer labs for a year, receiving his A.B. in computer science in 1985. At Berkeley, he was president of the Berkeley Computer Club and of the Computer Science Undergraduates Association, and made many contributions to the 2BSD and 4BSD Berkeley Unix distributions, including: * curses and termcap: a hardware-independent library for controlling cursor movement, screen editing, and window creation on ASCII display terminals, based on termcap (based on Bill Joy's vi screen control code). Curses was a landmark display library that made it possible for a vast number of new applications to create full-screen user interfaces that were portable between different brands of display terminal. * Rogue: Arnold, Michael Toy, and Glenn Wichman co-wrote Rogue, a full-screen role-playing video game that presented a then-novel view of the \\"dungeon\\" from above (rather than via textual description as in the older Zork and Adventure). It spawned an entire genre of \\"roguelike\\" games.Note: it was a different Ken Arnold (\\"Ken W. Arnold\\") who contributed' to the Ultima game series (see Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness#Development_and_release). * fortune: a fortune cookie program. Although Arnold's quote-displaying program was not the first in history, as the BSD standard it became by far the most widely used, and its database of quotes was voluminous. It also standardized a plain-text file format that was philosophically aligned with Unix and thus became widely used both for other fortune programs as well as non-fortune purposes. * Other BSD Unix games: Cribbage, Hangman, Hunt, Mille Bornes, Monopoly, robots. * Ctags: a very early special-purpose hypertext link generator that essentially turned the vi editor into an IDE. It indexed program objects (such as functions) so that a user of vi (or a clone such as vim) could navigate to an object or function definition from any instance of the object's name elsewhere in the source code. Additionally, Arnold served as both a member of the student senate and as its president.  Later work  Arnold was part of the Hewlett-Packard team that designed CORBA. He also worked for Apollo Computer; as a molecular graphics programmer in the Computer Graphics Lab at U.C. San Francisco; and as a member of the UNIX Review Software Review Board.  At Sun Microsystems  Arnold worked as a senior engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, in the areas of object-oriented design and implementation, C, C++, Java, and distributed computing. He was one of the architects of the Jini technology, the main implementer of Sun's JavaSpaces technology (which implemented tuple spaces on the Java platform), and worked with Jim Waldo on Remote Method Invocation and object serialization.

He was a member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch, gang, operating out of the Hole-in-the-Wall Pass in Johnson County, Wyoming. Lay was Cassidy's best friend and assisted Cassidy in leading the Wild Bunch gang.William Ellsworth Lay at www.butchandsundance.com Early life Lay was born in Mount Pleasant, Ohio, the son of James Landon Lay and Mary Jane Bellew. He had a brother Encil Lay and a sister Maggie Lay Sprigg. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to northeastern Colorado. At the age of 18, Lay left home looking for adventure with his childhood friend William McGinnis. McGinnis soon returned home, claiming he was homesick. Later, Lay used the name \\"McGinnis\\" as an alias when working as a ranch hand. Outlaw life In the autumn of 1889, Lay met outlaw Butch Cassidy while in Utah. The two became close friends, and Lay began dating Josie Bassett, the daughter of a rancher that often sold beef and horses to the outlaws, while Cassidy began dating her sister, 15‑year-old future female western outlaw Ann Bassett. He worked briefly on the ranch of cattleman Matt Warner, and it was Warner who gave Lay his first tip for a robbery. From Warner, Lay learned that a shopkeeper nearby had a large sum of cash. Warner, his nephew Lew McCarty, and Lay robbed the man and split the money. Lay then opened up a gambling house in Vernal, Utah. For a time, it was profitable, until it was shut down by Uintah County Sheriff John T. Pope. Following his business being closed, Lay moved back to Matt Warner's ranch, where he renewed his relationship with Josie Bassett. He remained there until Butch Cassidy was released from an eighteen-month prison sentence he had been serving. During that time, Lay became involved with another girl, Maude Davis, whose brother Albert Davis was a smalltime outlaw. Outlaw Ben Kilpatrick began dating Cassidy's girlfriend Ann Bassett during that time. Cassidy and Lay, after Cassidy's prison release, obtained their own cabin on the Green River. Ann Bassett ended her relationship with Kilpatrick, and returned to her involvement with Cassidy. In August, 1896, Matt Warner killed two prospectors named Dick Staunton and Dave Milton, during a shootout near Vernal. Warner had been employed by E.B. Coleman to intimidate Staunton and Milton away from a mining claim. The intimidation turned into a gun battle. Warner, Coleman, and hired gunman Bill Wall were arrested, and eventually transported to Ogden, Utah, where they were held in jail. In a plea for help to Butch Cassidy, Warner said he needed a lawyer. Cassidy and Lay then robbed a bank in Montpelier, Idaho, using the funds to secure an attorney for Warner. Warner and Wall were convicted of manslaughter, and received a five-year sentence, while Coleman was found not guilty. The Wild Bunch gang Cassidy and Lay began hiding out at what was called \\"Robbers Roost\\", in Utah. Girlfriends Maude Davis and Ann Bassett joined them there, Lay having ended his relationship with Ann's sister, Josie, who by that time was involved in a relationship with Lay's outlaw friend Will \\"News\\" Carver. In April 1897, the two women were sent home, while Cassidy and Lay began planning the robbery of a payroll shipment in Castle Gate, Utah. In a recent September 26, 2006 History Channel documentary on the Old West, this robbery is described as Cassidy's boldest. On April 21, 1897, the payroll arrived, and Cassidy and his gang members simply walked out in broad daylight and took it at gunpoint. In the robbery they took $7,000. A gang member named Joe Walker is alleged to have disabled the telegraph lines to prevent word of the robbery being put out to nearby law enforcement. By this time, Maude and Elzy had married and Maude was pregnant with Lay's child. After the birth of their daughter, Marvel, Maude insisted he leave the outlaw life and settle down. He refused. Cassidy and Lay traveled to New Mexico, and by this time were calling their gang the \\"Wild Bunch\\". There, they worked for a short time on the \\"WS Ranch\\", before heading north to Wyoming. They committed their most famous robbery on June 2, 1899, by robbing a Union Pacific train near Wilcox, Wyoming. Following the robbery, they fled to the Hole-in-the-Wall, successfully evading posses that were in pursuit. Kid Curry, who was by this time a member of the gang, killed Converse County Sheriff Josiah Hazen during that pursuit. The gang split up in different directions for a time, which was a common action following any of their robberies. Killing of Sheriff Farr, Deputy Kearney and Deputy Love Cassidy, Lay, Kid Curry, and other gang members Sam Ketchum and Bill Carver headed to New Mexico. On July 11, 1899, without Cassidy, Lay led Curry, Ketchum and Carver in the robbery of a train near Folsom, New Mexico. The robbery was successful, but a well led posse under the direction of Huerfano County (Colorado) Sheriff Ed Farr soon cornered them near an area known as Turkey Creek. In the first gun battle that followed, Doña Ana County Deputy Kent Kearney was shot, dying the next day. Another deputy was wounded and outlaw Sam Ketchum was badly wounded. The gang escaped this immediate threat, but Ketchum's bad wounds held them up, and again they were cornered in the same area on July 16, 1899. They engaged Sheriff Farr and Colfax County Deputy Henry Love in a gun battle, resulting in Sheriff Farr being killed and Love dying a few days later from his wounds. Lay was also wounded, but escaped (as did Curry and Carver). Ketchum however, was captured and died in custody from his wounds. Captured, convicted and pardoned On August 16, 1899, while gathering supplies, Lay was cornered in Carlsbad, New Mexico and captured. He was subsequently charged and convicted of the killings and the robbery. He received a life sentence which he served in the New Mexico State Penitentiary. Maude divorced Elzy. Lay spent seven years in prison, where he became a trustee to the warden. In this role, he once accompanied the warden to Sante Fe. Upon their return, they found that the inmates had taken the warden's wife and daughter hostage inside the prison. Lay was able to convince the prisoners to release the women, and for this act he was pardoned by Governor Miguel Antonio Otero on January 10, 1906.William Ellsworth Lay (p.2) at www.butchandsundance.com Retirement from crime Upon his release he found his way to Baggs, Wyoming, a small ranch town just north of the Colorado border. There he worked as an oil explorer and saloon owner without much success. There he met and married Mary Calvert. He and Mary then moved to Southern California where he supervised the building of the All American Canal system in Riverside and Imperial Valley just north of the border with Mexico. He and Mary raised two children, a son and a daughter. The end of the Wild Bunch When Lay was captured, Cassidy, Kid Curry, and Bill Carver all left New Mexico. The loss of Lay deeply affected Cassidy, who for a time made attempts at getting amnesty from the Governor of Utah. Several killings committed by Kid Curry and other robberies committed by the gang made this impossible. No objective proof exists that Lay had contact with Wild Bunch members after his release, but there is suggestive testimony. Josie Bassett on separate occasions told her cousin, her neighbor, and local historians she had been visited by Butch Cassidy and Elza Lay \\"in 1930 in Baggs, Wyoming\\"Dick & Daun DeJournette, One Hundred Years of Brown's Park and Diamond Mountain, 1996, pp. 330 - 331. Before that Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had gone to South America, where they were alleged to have been killed while committing a robbery in Bolivia. During Lay's imprisonment, Kid Curry was killed during a shootout with lawmen in Colorado. Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion were captured in St. Louis, Missouri, and George \\"Flat Nosed\\" Curry was killed by lawmen in Utah. Several other members of other gangs that had been a part of the Hole in the Wall Gang were also by that time either dead or in prison. Lay died on November 10, 1934 in Los Angeles. He is buried at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California, near Los Angeles.

This species of spider resides in South America, Central America, Southern California, Florida, Arizona, Texas, and the Caribbean, amongst other arid and warm environments. The A. argentata creates stabilimenta and a unique zig zag in its web design, and utilizes its UV-silk to attract pollinating species as its prey. Like other Argiope, its venom is not a danger to humans, however it can be employed to immobilize its prey. The A. argentata engages in sexual cannibalism either mid- or post-copulation. One aspect of particular interest in this species is their extinction patterns, which notably have minimal correlation with their population size but rather occur sporadically for this species. This Wikipedia article will serve as an in depth look at all aspects of the Argiope argentata - from behavioral patterns to web design.  Description  The A. argentata belongs to the Argiope genus, and as with all Argiope, the difference in size between the two sexes is drastic and distinct, with the male being much smaller than the female. The average size of the female A. argentata is 12 millimeters, which is three times the average size of the male, which is 4 millimeters. UV-light reflects off of the top surface of the A. argentata’s body. This UV-reflectance may serve the same purpose as the UV-silk used to spin their webs, which is to attract pollinating prey by presenting with the same characteristics as flowers. The under-area of the A. argentata has a dark-brown coloring, with a yellow stripe going across it. The A. argentata has two sets of eyes, a primary set, and a secondary set. Habitat & Distribution The Argiope argentata is a spider native to the areas of Southern California. As its name might imply, it is also found in Argentina and occasionally in the neighboring country of Chile. As a spider that is evidently attracted to dry and humid environments, it thrives on the prickly-pear plants of Southern California. This spider is not typically found in Europe, or in places with seasons that involve cooler temperatures. This spider is relatively abundant in its specified areas and can oftentimes be found with little effort. Argiope Argentata are commonly seen and photographed by hikers in Southern California and the Andes Mountains alike.  Hunting & Diet   Hunting:  The A. argentata follows a distinct sequence of steps when capturing, killing, and ultimately eating its prey. The first step is localization of the prey, for which the spider’s vibration receptors are critical. The second step is immobilization of the prey which involves two steps: wrapping and biting, the second of which takes on either a long or short biting form dependent on the prey. The third step is transportation, which involves carrying the prey back to where the spider was alarmed of its presence. In the fourth and final step before feeding, the spider manipulates the orientation of the prey so that it is in the proper positioning for the spider to feast. The determination of whether the long bite or short bite is necessary is achieved by the momentary contact touch that the spider has with the prey right before the decision has to be made. This contact allows the spider to determine in some manner what the prey is, and what its immobilization will entail.  Diet:  The A. argentata eats butterflies and moths, both of which require a long bite upon first encounter, which is contrary to the rest of the insects which the A. argentata immediately and firstly wraps in silk. The A. argentata incorporates UV-reflecting silks into its web design which serve as an attractor to their prey. These patterns have been hypothesized to specifically attract prey that engage in pollination, because flowers too, incorporate UV-reflecting patterns to ensure their pollination by insects. The webs of A. argentata have been shown to capture a significant amount of Trigona spinipes, a species of bees, which further justifies that the use of UV-reflecting silk draws in pollinating species.  Reproduction   Sexual Cannibalism:  The A. argentata spider engages in sexual cannibalism, during or after copulation, without fail. The act of sexual cannibalism amongst A. argentata has been looked at more closely in the laboratory with virgin females. Upon the first attempt at mating, the female spider thrusts the male spider off of her, which results in his death more than two-thirds of the time. Males that survive, bravely try again, this time with success, only to be met with immediate cannibalism after the act of insemination is completed.  Plugging:  Due to the behavior of sexual cannibalism, the males of this species only have one chance at a successful mating. For this reason, the male A. argentata has developed certain tactics to ensure that the female is fertilized with only their insemination. This tactic is known as plugging and is defined as the male breaking off his copulatory organ as to secure it into the female, so that no future inseminations can occur. This is evolutionarily advantageous for the male considering he will be devoured post-copulation regardless, and therefore have no future possibilities of producing offspring.  Enemies   Predators:  One significant predator of the A. argentata spider, is lizards, which is evident due to the so-called lizard effect. In other words, there is a negative correlation between the number of lizard inhabitants and the number of A. argentata inhabitants on a given island. Other predators of the A. argentata spider include wasps, and birds. Webs and Silk  Webs:  Like other members of Argiope, silver argiopes often spin stabilimenta into their webs. These often take the form of zigzag lines, and frequently there are four of them forming a centerless \\"X\\" shape near the center of the web; the spider then rests in the very middle, with four pairs of legs each drawn together and splayed out in an \\"X\\" shape more or less aligned with the stabilimentum \\"X\\". There are multiple hypotheses regarding the reasoning behind the A. argentata web decorations. Evidence shows that in part this web- decoration is utilized to attract prey, however despite hypotheses that it is also used in part as a defense measure against predators, evidence shows that in reality the decorations also attract predators rather than protect against them. This is supported by the statistical analysis of degree of web decoration in association with survival rate. High degrees of decoration correlate to a lower survival rate than moderate to minimal degrees. Silver argiopes' webs are often also home to dewdrop spiders (Argyrodes). These are small kleptoparasitic or commensal spiders which feed on insects trapped by their host's web. Female silver argiope (bottom-left), with dewdrop spider (top-right, also with silver abdomen) living in its web, in California  Silks:  The A. argentata is in the family Araneidae, otherwise known as orb-weavers. Like other orb-weavers, the A. argentata has seven distinct silks, five of which are fibrous. These silks differ in a laundry list of ways including the silk gland they are ejected from, their mechanical properties, and their protein composition. Four of the fibrous silks, aciniform, major ampullate, minor ampullate, and tubiliform, are considered dry silks, and the remaining fibrous silk, capture spiral, is considered a wet silk.  Bites  The A. argentata exhibits two different forms of biting to its prey, which are differentiated by the duration of the bite: the short bite versus the long bite. For Lepidoptera, i.e. moths and butterflies, the A. argentata performs a long bite, in contrast to the short bite given to other insects. Another juxtaposition between these two methods of predation, is that the long bite is executed before the prey is wrapped in silk, whereas the short bite is executed after. One hypothesis for the difference in bite duration is that the long bite utilizes the spiders venom to immobilize the prey, whereas the short bite has no need for this because the prey has already been immobilized by the silk wrapping. Since the short bite is given after the prey has been immobilized by the silk wrapping, a separate hypothesis for its purpose has been proposed. For starters, the venomous content in this bite is likely to be slim to none, because the prey is already immobilized and dead and therefore any venom would be essentially a waste because of its absence of predatorial gain for the A. argentata. Rather, this short bite may serve as a quote-on- quote taste-tester for the spider, to give the A. argentata sufficient information on the prey it has caught to determine whether or not it is consumable.  Extinction Patterns  The A. argentata lacks a strong relationship between population size and persistence rates, which results in its high likelihood of sudden extinction regardless of its current population size. The four month long developmental time for the A. argentata spiderlings opens the species up to a higher risk of deviation from or disturbance in its normal population size. One hypothesis provided for these rampant cycles of extinction and regeneration, is that this constant fluctuation in population size leads to an inevitable outcome of at some point hitting zero.  Behavior   Grooming:  The A. argentata engages in grooming behavior post prey capture. The duration and intensity of this grooming behavior has a specific connection to the type of prey that was captured. The spider deliberately grooms the tarsal region on each of its eight legs, which is hypothesized to be due to the ability of these structures to respond to chemical changes using chemosensory organs. There is no evidence that the A. argentata extends this grooming behavior to the rest of its body.  Defecating:  The act of defecation occurs most frequently after biting the prey or feeding on it, and is a very calculated process. The A. argentata consciously widens the space between its abdomen and its web before defecating, to ensure that the web itself isn’t soiled. The A. argentata’s anus is positioned away from the web, so that the defecation itself will be excreted away from the web as well.  Drinking:  The A. argentata is found to receive its water supply from the web’s surface. The web is able to capture and hold droplets of water for the A. argentata to drink. It appears that this is the supplier of water for the spider, regardless of the presence and degree of other environmental conditions ability to supply water for the spider, for example the humidity of the air or the water content of the prey.

Etymology Pronounced /'hɛə'loɴ/ and phonetically spelt khay-lone', the name is derived from the Hebrew: He, Lamed, Nun Sofit. Fragment from Codex Gigas (the Giant Book, or Devil's Bible); circa 13th century - approximately 300 years before the King James Bible; Old Testament, Genesis 46:14; enumerating the children of Zebulon. Fragment from Codex Gigas (the Giant Book, or Devil's Bible); circa 13th century - approximately 300 years before the King James Bible; Old Testament, Numbers 26:26; enumerating the children of Zebulon. Transliterated as: Chelon, Chêlôn, Khay-lone', האֵלן ,הלן, or האֵלנ in Hebrew; Gehlen, Gelen, Gelin, or Гелен in Russian; Gelon, or Гелон in Ukrainian; Gelon, or Γέλων in Greek; Helan in Czech; Helon in English and Latin. Common spelling in the Polish language (since the 15th century) is Helon, but the name can also be rendered as Chelon; the 'C' being silent. Spelling of the name Helon is often confused with and rendered Helen, Helin, or Elon. The progenitor of the name was Helon, the second son of Zebulon ben (of) Jacob, Prince of the Tribe of Zebulon. In keeping with the seafaring occupation and inherent traditions of the Tribe of Zebulon, the name Helon, its usages and derivatives are synonymous with traits indicative of water. {  align=\\"center\\" - Name Zebulon Helon Eliab (C)Helonian Helonias - Aquatic Trait Sea Sand Ship Turtle Swamp Lily } The earliest known written references to the name Helon as rendered in its current and correct Latin form are contained in various Latin Codexes, including the Codex Gigas (the Great Book, or Devil's Bible); the world's largest and most complete bible manuscript which predates the King James Bible by approximately 300 years and the Gutenberg Bible by approximately 150 years. Since publication of the King James Bible of 1611, the name Helon as it appears in historical and contemporary bibles, concordances and biblical commentaries has been perpetually corrupted and rendered as Elon (phonetically spelt ay-lone'). Elon (sometimes Elom, as referenced in the Gutenberg Bible, or Helom) was the name of the Hittite father of Basemath (who was also called Adah), the second wife of Esau ben Isaac. Dr James Strong (1890) who based his Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible on the King James (KJV) rendering, defined Elon (transliterated as ay-lone', ay-lone', ay-lone', or אֵילוֹן in Hebrew) as an oak-grove, terebinth, or mighty - derived from the Hebrew 'ayil, or איל; strength, an oak, strong tree, or anything strong - meanings which are inconsistent with the characteristic traits of the seafaring occupation of the Tribe of Zebulon which are indicative of water. Elsewhere unknown as a Zebulonite name by definition, the misnomer Elon has continually been applied erroneously by subsequent biblical and theologian commentators and included as a matter of course into those bibles published post 1611; where in its place should be the correct rendering Helon. According to McNair (2012): :During the time of the Hebrew Patriarchs, it was customary to always name an individual with an appellation commensurate with another person, event or feature of significance. There are hardly any examples in the Hebrew Scriptures of an individual receiving a name without some importance attached to it. Clan Helon ben Zebulon motif as appearing on the headstone of Z.A. Helon: Toowoomba; features the rendering of the name in its traditional Hebrew form. In his treatise The Wisdom of the Hebrew Alphabet, Rabbi Munk imparts the sacred Kabbalistic meanings of the letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Beis as embraced in the name הלן (Helon): {  align=\\"center\\" - Hebrew Letter English Letter Standard Israeli Pronunciation Sacred Meaning (Gematria) Numerical Value - ה H he divinity, gentility and specificity 5 - ל L 'lamed teaching and purpose 30 - ן N nun sofit faithfullness, soul and emergence 50 } Said Rabbi Munk of the missing letter ה (He), the symbol of divinity, gentility and specificity: :One missing letter is a painful outcry for the lost glory of the First Temple! According to the Talmudist Rabbi Louis Ginzberg (1873–1953): :Corresponding to the occupation of the tribe of Zebulun (\\"who shall settle at the shore of the sea; he shall be a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sī'don\\", Gen 49:13) its prince was called Eliab, “the ship,” son of Helon, “the sand,” for this tribe spent its life on ships, seeking “treasures hidden in the sand.” In the Polish language, it means ‘żołw’, a turtle of the order Chelonians. The British Methodist Theologian and Commentator Dr Adam Clark (circa 1760-1832) verbalized during his sermon “The Doctrine of Endless Misery not Taught in the Bible” that: :The word hell comes from the Anglo-Saxon helon, to cover or hide; hence the tiling or slating of a house is called, in some parts of England, heling, to this day; and the covers of books (in Lancashire) by the same name. Cyrus Alvin Potts (1922) defined Helon: :Valde strenus – Very persevering, or brave; strong. Past Worshipful Master and Masonic historian Harry Mendoza (1989) designated Helon to mean: :God is father. Strong. George K. Barr (1990) citing Numbers 1:9 and 2:7 delineates Helon to mean: :Their army, fortress. Helon in the Bible Helon ben akhar ben (a direct descendant of) Zebulon judged Israel for 10 years (circa 1083–1073 B.C.). Fragment from Historical Chronology of the Deeds of all Patriarchs, Leaders, Judges, Kings, and Priests of the Hebrew People: Rome; 1751; p. 318. The first century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus wrote: :‘Zabulon had with him three sons – Sarad, Helon, Jalel.’ Helon was the second son of Zebulon, ben (or son of) Jacob: Genesis 46:14 and Numbers 26:26. Also a Prince, and the father of Eliab who assisted Moses and Aaron in numbering the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai (circa 1461 B.C.): Numbers 1:9, 2:7, 7:24–29, 10:16. Helon ben akhar ben (a direct descendant of) Zebulon judged Israel for 10 years (circa 1083–1073 B.C.) during the lawless period of Israel's history between the invasion of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy: Judges 12:11–12. Kettel (1847), Willson (1860), Willis (1867) and Davis (1903) have proposed that Helon was the name of the leper cleansed in Capernaum by Jesus as narrated by the Evangelists Matthew 8:1–4, Mark 1:40–45 and Luke 5:12–16. Bradley (1908) wrote of a Rabbi Helon who was the procurer of the ass that Jesus rode during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

Then Helon the Zebulunite died, and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun } Noncanonical Biblical texts In his book Helon's Pilgrimage to Jerusalem: A Picture of Judaism in the Century which Preceded the Advent of Our Saviour (1824), the German novelist and Judaic writer Gerhard 'Friedrich' Abraham Strauss (1786–1863) wrote: :Joppa is where the keeper of the genealogical register of the (Helon family) dwelt. but he was gone to Ziklag. Arriving in Ziklag the genealogist showed the pedigree of his family to Helon. Helon had been found to be of pure descent. Kettel (1847) describes Helon as a Rabbi of high birth and a Member of the Sanhedrin who was present at the questioning of a man who calls himself Christ. Helon became a leper. He had a wife named Sarai (p. 251), a son Benaiah the younger (p. 349) and a daughter Miriam (pp. 353–354). In an allegory penned in 1863, the author I.E.P. alludes to the leper Helon, then resident in a pleasant village in one of the western counties of England, as being a captive and wandering jew. English novelist and Judaic writer Grace Aguilar wrote in her short composition Helon: A Fragment of Jewish History (1902) describing Helon as a Jewish minstrel living near the Rhine river at the start of Spring, close to the end of the eleventh century. In Jesus of Nazareth: A Life (Bradley, 1908), Helon is described as: :A Rabbi and Zealot from Babylonia. He was a Scribe in his own country, one of the very few of his class who had anywhere joined the Zealots; and with all the trained subtlety and acumen of the accomplished lawyer that he was, he presented to Jesus the claims of the Zealots. Helon had procured an ass and foal, and had them at the turn of the road where Jerusalem in all its glory first comes in view; the ass that Jesus would ride on Palm Sunday. In the chapter Mary and Helon, Helon is characterised as: :Artful and .. with little faith in Jesus, (Helon) would glady have discarded him altogether. Helon tried to manipulate Mary of Magdala to bribe Jesus to initiate a physical uprising.

Helon is also the name of a Ukrainian beer brewed in Poltava by the PAT Firm Poltavpivo (ПАТ Фірма Полтавпиво). The Helon branded beer features, most significantly, a golden Scythian stag couchant which is consistent with the assertion of the American professor of history, political science, and Chair of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Toronto Paul Magocsi, et al. that Helons were Scythians: :The Scythians themselves also established fortified centers to coordinate their trade. [One of the] largest of these [was] Helon/Bil'sk. Vasyl Yakovych Schevchuk, Doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor, President of the International Dnipro (Black Sea) Fund, and Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources of Ukraine (et al.) wrote in 2005 that: :On the territory of Belske, in an ancient town (Poltava Oblast), which was the location of the legendary capital of the forest-steppe Scythian Helon tribes depicted by Herodotus, some relics have been found - an antique ring made by an Ionian craftsman, as well Phoenician perfumes (sic) phials. The Gelonians (or Geloni), also known as Helonians (or Heloni), whom could plausibly be the (Lat.) Helonitarum (Helonites) of Numbers 26:26, are mentioned as a nation in northwestern Scythia by Herodotus who stated that: :The Gelonians are actually Greek in their origins, descended from Hellenes who moved from their trading posts and settled among the Boudinoi. Their language is part Scythian, part Greek. There is a city among them called Gelonos (Her. IV, 108). According to Schevchuk, et al.: :The lands along the Dnipro are saturated with the spirit of numerous civilisations that succeeded one another from the East as well as the West. Contemporary factual research will be of primary importance in determining the spiritual identity of the Indo-European cultural settlements, as well as the mysterious relationship between the Slavonic, Hindu, and Greek cultures. It will solve the riddle of the Scythian Hellenes, the mystery of the Helons of the Dnipro lands and their Dionysian cult, as well as other manifestations of Greek myths and rituals of unknown origin. The timber-walled Scythian city of Helon is currently being reconstructed at (Більське городище) Belskoye (Belsk/Bil'sk), Kotelva district, Poltava, Ukraine (latitude 50° 05'N X longitude 34°38'E). Helon is also the name of a town in Bhamo District, Momauk, Kachin State, Burma (latitude 24° 20' 0\\"N X longitude 97° 17' 0\\"E.) at altitude 102 metres (337 feet) above sea level. Botany Swamp Pink Lilly, or Bog Candle; genus Helonias Bullata Linnaeus In keeping with traits indicative of water, the name Helon has been used as the derivation of some botanical genera including the hardy perennial Helonias bullata Linnaeus (the swamp pink lily, or bog candle), of the family Liliaceae, and the perennial Heloniopsis Orientalis (the oriental swamp pink lily herb) of the family Liliaceae-Melanthiaceae. *Helonias; from the Greek word helos, swamp, the natural habitat of the plant. *Heloniopsis; from Helonias and Greek opsis, resemblance.

The album was the definitive effort of primary Coil musician Peter Christopherson, who compiled material from 1993 to 2004 to reassemble and rework it into a coherent final album. It was produced and released following the death of co-lead artist and lead vocalist John Balance, who died on November 13, 2004. The title of the album was originally intended to be Fire of the Mind. Background and composition The Ape of Naples is composed of reworked material that Coil had created in varying forms since the inception of Backwards, their aborted Nothing Records album (created during a period that Christopherson dubbed \\"the New Orleans era\\"), as well as songs that were previously only played live in improvisational form on the mini-tours Coil undertook in the early 2000s. \\"The Last Amethyst Deceiver\\" is the \\"final version\\" of \\"Amethyst Deceivers\\", which began when it was originally released on Autumn Equinox: Amethyst Deceivers, \\"It's In My Blood\\" was performed under the original name of \\"A.Y.O.R.\\", and \\"Going Up\\", the last song on the album, samples Balance's vocals spoken on stage live from Coil's final performance at the Dublin Electronic Arts Festival in 2004: Christopherson remarked that Coil's performance of Going Up at the festival was \\"the one and only time John thought of and sang those words... His own epitaph if you like.\\" Christopherson created the album with awareness of his own grief after Balance's death in November 2004; with the material he reworked taking on new meanings that he saw throughout the album's production, he felt he didn't \\"think [he] could have done it any better, so in that sense [he felt] fulfilled, and [was] sure John would feel so, too.\\" > Songs from the New Orleans era which HAD not seemed to have \\"found their > time\\" suddenly took on a completely new aspect, because of John's death. > Miraculously, they changed, morphed, in front of my eyes, and I had numerous > \\"oh my god—THAT's what that's about\\" revelatory moments. I imagine everyone > does, listening to the album knowing what happened, in a way. Reception The Ape of Naples was well-received by music critics. Pitchfork reviewer Matthew Murphy gave the album a rating of 7.9/10 and described it as \\"a remarkably unified work, its every meditative gesture alloyed with a looming, unmistakable sense of impending loss and/or transition\\". AllMusic reviewer James Mason described it as \\"one of Coil's best albums and one of the best albums of 2005\\" and described listening to the album as \\"a bittersweet experience\\".

Founded in 1861, the school is a day school, having had a boarding school attached to it for many years. It follows in the tradition of the Irish Sisters of Mercy, and caters for over 1,550 girls from Years five to 12. The school was the first permanent home of the Sisters of Mercy in Queensland, and is the oldest surviving secondary school in Brisbane. All Hallows' is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia, the Australasian Mercy Secondary Schools Association, and the Catholic Secondary Schoolgirls' Sports Association. The school's motto is in French, Dieu et Devoir (English: \\"God and Duty\\"). This motto was formulated in 1911, 50 years after the school opened. The French language was chosen for the motto on the basis of the strong French influence in the school's early years. Many of the All Hallows' School Buildings have been listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. In the 2017 NAPLAN Year 9 test, All Hallows' was ranked in the top 10 Queensland secondary schools. History  19th century  c. 1860 The story of the foundation of All Hallows' School must be set against the rudimentary \\"pioneer\\" education system and bitter sectarian disputes in Queensland education during the 1850s and early 1860s. According to Johnston,Johnston (1982), p. 104 until 1860 \\"secondary education tended to receive a fairly low priority in state thinking – which was not surprising since the provision of a primary level was so difficult, too difficult to manage\\". He continues: \\"There were no state initiatives to provide its own system until 1912. Secondary education, seen as a perquisite of middle-class life, suitable for the children of business and professional men and established pastoralists, was allowed to be offered by private and church bodies.\\" Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald points out that until well into the twentieth century \\"the majority of (Queensland Catholics) ... belonged to lower socio-economic groups\\".Fitzgerald (1984), p. 12  First Catholic secondary school in Queensland  Mother Vincent Whitty, founder of All Hallows' School Contrary to the development of most schools, All Hallows' School, as the first Catholic secondary school in Queensland, sought to serve those less fortunate in colonial society while operating under the same legislative framework as the more affluent grammar schools. Serving poorer, often Irish, Roman Catholic, immigrant women in the area of Fortitude Valley, the school did not raise the required subscription for government aid and, in a time of bitter sectarianism within Queensland, the school maintained fierce independence in curriculum from what was seen by many within the Catholic community as attempts by a hostile secular government at interference.  Relocation to Duncan's Hill  c. 1889 In 1863, with pupils and sisters growing in numbers, it was soon realised that a suitable place for a convent must be found. It was envisaged that a small House of Mercy would be established on the site of what would become All Hallows' School. 1 November 1863 saw the transfer of the party from a small structure adjacent to what is now Saint Stephen's Cathedral to 'Adderton House' overlooking the Brisbane River from high upon Duncan's Hill. > The Bishop has lately purchased the finest house and situation in Brisbane > for a convent. The purchase money is 6,000 – where it is to come from I know > not – but I trust God will send it. As soon as we get into it, we are to > commence a House of Mercy ... The constant influx of Emigrants renders a > House of Mercy desirable but it will not be a big one.M. Vincent Whitty on > 18 August 1863 in Mercy Women Making History, 2001, pp. 61–62 Mother Vincent Whitty marvelled at the position of the new house in a way that many visitors to the school have done since 1863. Writing to Ireland with news of the move to Duncan's Hill she stated: > I wish I could give you an idea of the beauty of the situation of this > house. The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance > the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of > the River, it certainly is very beautiful.M. Vincent Whitty on 19 October > 1863 in Mercy Women Making History, 2001, pp. 71–72  Adderton House  Adderton House was constructed in 1858 by John Petrie for George Fullerton (Mahoney, 1985 p. 6). St Ann's Industrial School St Stephen's Cathedral, c. 1910 A 1914 image of St Ann's Industrial School (part of All Hallows' School). Road level of Ann Street, Brisbane, has been lowered on numerous occasions since 1861 and this has affected the proportions of the current gate. St Ann's Industrial School was opened on 15 July 1894 by the Governor of Queensland Henry Wylie Norman. Its purpose was to provide a home and education to neglected or delinquent girls. It was designed by architect F. D. G. Stanley. In the 1940s it was partially converted to a boarding house for young women working in the Brisbane central business district or studying at the University of Queensland. In 1964 it was remodelled as classrooms for the All Hallows' School.  House system  All Hallows' has a mixed age house structure. Every student and staff member belongs to one of the eight houses which are named after people or places within the history of the school. Each house is given a color. * Adderton – green, named after Adderton House, the first building on the school grounds. * Coolock – blue, named after the house in Ireland where Catherine McAuley lived. * Gorry – gold, named after Queensland born Mercy Sister Jane Gorry. * Loretto – pink, named after long serving school principal Sister M. Loretto Flynn. Principal: 1916, 1933–1959. * McAuley – silver, named after the founder of the Mercy Sisters, Catherine McAuley. * Mercedes – orange, pronounced as per the Spanish word for 'Mercy'. * Tighe – purple, named after the first enrolled student at AHS, Annie Tighe. * Whitty – red, named after the first principal of AHS, Mother Vincent Whitty.

The highway leaves the river at Beauval Forks and near Beauval, Saskatchewan it receives the outflow of Lac la Plonge from the east. It continues northward east of the south arm of the lake and enters Lac Île-à-la-Crosse across the lake from the village of Île-à-la-Crosse. Tributaries Alberta: Amisk River (west, large), Sand River (Alberta) (north, large), Mooselake River (south), Manatokan Creek (north), Jackfish Creek (north), Marie Creek (north) Saskatchewan: Makwa River (southwest) Meadow River (south), {great bend} outlet of Green Lake, Waterhen River (Saskatchewan) (west, large), Doré River (east), outlet of Lac La Plonge (east) Also: Fork Creek, Columbine Creek, (Muriel Creek, Reita Creek south of Cold Lake(?)), Redspring Creek Exploration and fur trade Green Lake at the Highway 155 bridge crossing (looking downstream) The river, or parts of it, is described as poor canoe country. Crews had to drag their canoes over the shallow parts and there was little game. The mouth of the Beaver River is on the main axis of the fur trade. The upper Beaver is about north of the North Saskatchewan. From at least 1795 buffalo pemmican was brought north to feed the voyageurs on their way to the Athabasca Country. One route led south to the great bend of the Beaver, through Green Lake, Saskatchewan, and over an Indian track to Fort Carlton. In 1875–76 this was replaced by a cart road at about the time steamboats appeared on the Saskatchewan. Another route went further up the Beaver to Moose Lake (Alberta) and by some route to Fort George. The first European to reach the Beaver may have Louis Primeau in 1767. About 1768 William Pink was on the river. He went northwest from the lower Saskatchewan followed the Beaver west and returned to the Saskatchewan near Edmonton. In 1776 Primeau working for Thomas Frobisher built a post on Lac Île-à-la-Crosse. In 1781 Montreal traders built Cold Lake House near Beaver Crossing, Alberta. In perhaps 1782 the Northwest Company built a post on Green Lake. In 1798 David Thompson used the Beaver to reach Lac La Biche. In 1799 the Hudson's Bay Company decided to push west up the Churchill from Frog Portage. In that year they built rival posts on Lac Île-à-la-Crosse and Green Lake. They also built a post above the great bend at Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, that only lasted two years. There was a great deal of conflict between the two companies until the merger in 1821. Conservation and development Beaver River flows through a predominantly flat area with rolling and undulating hills, and many lakes are drained through meandering streams into the river; among the larger ones are: Pinehurst Lake, Cold Lake and Primrose Lake. Lakeland Provincial Park, Moose Lake Provincial Park and Cold Lake Provincial Park all lie in the river basin on the Alberta side, while the Meadow Lake Provincial Park protects a large area in Saskatchewan. The Cold Lake Area Weapons Range occupies much of the northern area of the river basin. Fish species The fish species include walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, lake whitefish, cisco, white sucker, longnose sucker and burbot.

Early life and career Nawabzada Mirza Jamiluddin Ahmad Khan was born to a literary family in Delhi, India on 20 January 1925. His father Amiruddin Ahmed Khan was Nawab of Loharu and his mother Syeda Jamila Baigum was a direct descendant of Khwaja Mir Dard and was the fourth wife of Amiruddin Khan. Aali earned a BA in Economics from Anglo Arabic College, Delhi in 1944. In 1947 after the partition of India, Aali migrated to Karachi, Pakistan on 13 August 1947 with his family and started his career as an assistant in the Ministry of Commerce. In 1951, he passed the CSS (civil service of Pakistan) examination and joined the Pakistan Taxation Service. He was also the Officer on Special Duty at President House from 1959 to 1963. Aali joined the National Bank of Pakistan in 1967 and remained its vice president until his retirement in 1988. In 1971, he obtained an FEL and LLB (law) degrees from University of Karachi. Jamiluddin Aali was also a former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party and was compelled to contest the 1977 National Assembly elections from NA-191, but lost to Munawwar Hasan of Jamaat-e-Islami. In 1997, Aali was elected as the member of the Senate for a six-year term with support of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement. Jamiluddin Aali was never very clear or comfortable with answering the question as to why he drifted briefly into politics. Was it due to his impulsive behavior for fame and recognition? He would usually evade this question. Aali started composing poetry at an early age and wrote many books as well as songs. He wrote the song \\"Jeevay Jeevay Pakistan\\" during the 1965 Indo-Pak war which became highly popular. The song was sung by Shahnaz Begum with music arranged by Sohail Rana and was originally released on 14 August 1971 by PTV. During International Women's Year (1976), Aali wrote the song \\"Hum Maain, Hum Behnain, Hum Baitiyan\\". He wrote the song \\"Jo Nam Wohi Pehchan, Pakistan\\" at the request of former Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1986. He also wrote the song \\"Mera Inam Pakistan\\" by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Personal life Jamiluddin Aali was married in 1944 to Tayyba Bano. He had three sons and two daughters. Death Aali was suffering from diabetes and respiratory illness and was admitted to a hospital in Karachi. He died of a heart attack on 23 November 2015 in Karachi. His Namaz-I-Janazah was held in the mosque \\"Tooba\\" in DHA, Karachi. He was laid to rest in an army graveyard Bizerta Lines, Karachi on 23 November 2015. Literary work and activities Jamiluddin Aali took over as honorary secretary of the Anjuman-i Taraqqi-i Urdu (Association for the Promotion of Urdu Language) in 1962 after the death of Baba-e-Urdu Maulvi Abdul Haq and played a key role there for many years, along with Farman Fatehpuri, to ensure that the association survives and grows. Aali could also be given credit for playing a major role at the Urdu Lughat Board (Urdu Dictionary Board) when this 22-volume Urdu dictionary was being developed in Pakistan.

Thai dance, like many forms of traditional Asian dance, can be divided into two major categories that correspond roughly to the high art (classical dance) and low art (folk dance) distinction.  Overview  The Thai terms for dance, รำ ram and ระบำ rabam, derive from the Old Khmer words រាំ \\"raṃ\\" and របាំ \\"rapaṃ\\" respectively. The multitude of Khmer words relating to dance, music and performance and similarities between the gestures of Thai dance depictions of dancers in ancient Khmer sculpture and bas reliefs suggests extended influence of ancient Khmer forms on Thai classical dance and performance. According to Surapone Virulrak, Thai performance art took shape during the Ayutthaya period, where Chak nak Dukdamban, a \\"ceremony depicting the churning of the ocean to create the immortal spirit, was performed on special occasions.\\" This ceremony drew the Indian epic of the Mahābhārata. Virulrak states that \\"These performing arts were gradually developed into Khon (masked play), Lakon nok (public dance drama) and Lakon nai (court dance drama) during the Late Ayutthaya Period (1456-1767), adding that \\"This period also enjoyed various imported performing arts from neighbouring countries.\\" According to Paul Cravath, this ceremony was also depicted in bas reliefs at Angkor Wat and could have been the forefather of Khon. Although the traditional Thai performing arts are not as vibrant as they once were, suffering inroads from Western entertainment and generally changing tastes, Thai dance drama is not extinct. What survives displays the elegance of an art form refined over centuries and supported by regal patronage. Aside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Indian-influenced manohra dance, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are Khon and Lakhon nai. In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, likay, evolved as a diversion for common folk who had no access to royal performances.  Classical dance drama  Khon performance in Frankfurt, Germany. Thai dance, 1965 Thai classical dance drama include khon, lakhon, and fon Thai. The first detailed European record of khon and other Thai classical dances was made during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The tradition and styles employed are almost identical to the Thai traditions we still see today. Historical evidence establishes that the Thai art of stage plays were already perfected by the 17th century. Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, had a formal diplomatic relation with Ayutthaya's King Narai. In 1687, France sent the diplomat Simon de la Loubère to record all that he saw in the Siamese Kingdom and its traditions. In his famous account Du Royaume de Siam, La Loubère carefully observed the classic 17th century theatre of Siam, including an epic battle scene from a Khon performance, and recorded what he saw in great detail: > The Siamese have three sorts of Stage Plays: That which they call Cone > [Khon] is a figure dance, to the sound of the violin and some other > instruments. The dancers are masked and armed, and represent rather a combat > than a dance. And though every one runs into high motions, and extravagant > postures, they cease not continually to intermix some word. Most of their > masks are hideous, and represent either monstrous Beasts, or kinds of > Devils. The Show which they call Lacone is a poem intermix with Epic and > Dramatic, which lasts three days, from eight in the morning till seven at > night. They are histories in verse, serious, and sung by several actors > always present, and which do only sing reciprocally.... The Rabam is a > double dance of men and women, which is not martial, but gallant ... they > can perform it without much tyring themselves, because their way of dancing > is a simple march round, very slow, and without any high motion; but with a > great many slow contortions of the body and arms. Of the attires of Siamese Khon dancers, La Loubère recorded that: \\"[T]hose that dance in Rabam, and Cone, have gilded high and pointed, it was introduced by persian lombok hat in King Naraya reign. but which hang down at the sides below their ears, which are adorned with counterfeit stones, and with two pendants of gilded wood.\\" La Loubère also observed the existence of muay Thai and muay Lao, noting that they looked similar (i.e., using both fists and elbows to fight), but the hand-wrapping techniques were different. The accomplishment and influence of Thai art and culture, developed during the Ayutthaya Period, on neighboring countries was evident in the observation of Captain James Low, a British scholar of Southeast Asia, during the early Rattanakosin Era: Khon Khon is the most stylized form of Thai dance. It is performed by troupes of non-speaking dancers, the story being told by a chorus at the side of the stage. Choreography follows traditional models rather than attempting to innovate. Most Khon performances feature episodes from the Ramakien. Costumes are dictated by tradition, with angels, both good and bad, wearing coloured masks. Lakhon A Lakhon Chatri dance excerpt from the story of Manohara Lakhon features a wider range of stories than Khon, including folk tales and Jataka stories. Dancers are usually female who play both male and female roles and perform as a group rather than representing individual characters. Lakhon draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien (Thai adaptation of Hindi epic Ramayana). Percussion instruments and Piphat, a type of woodwind accompany the dance.http://www.esamskriti.com/essay- chapters/Historical-Ties-India-and-Thailand-1.aspx Thai literature and drama draws great inspiration from Indian arts and legend. Fon Fon (; ) is a form of folk dance accompanied by the folk music of the region. The first fon originated in the northern region of Thailand. It was designed and taught by Chao Dararasami of Chiang Mai. Since then, a variety of fon came into practice, featuring the music and style of each province, such as the fon lep (; ) fingernail dance from Chiang Mai, fon ngiew from Chiang Rai with the influence of Burmese music and costume. Fon Thai is divided into three types: * Fon lep (fingernail dance): A northern Thai dance style. Each dancer wears six inch long brass fingernails. The long fingernails accentuate the finger movement of each dancer. Dancers wear their hair in a chignon-style with a yellow jasmine flower tiara. * Fon tian (candle dance): A performance consists of eight dancers, each carrying candles. Dancers are in pairs, one pair to each side. They wear full-length sarongs and jackets with a matching shoulder cloth. This dance is always held at night. * Fon ngiew (scarf dance): A dance performed at a happy event. The dance is similar to the fon lep but the dance is faster and more fun. Each dancer wears a yellow flower tiara, jong kra bane, and sabai. The influence of Thai classical dance in neighbouring countries Thai classical arts exercised a strong influence on neighboring countries, especially Burma and Cambodia. The two golden periods of Burmese literature were the direct consequences of the Thai literary influence. The first transmission happened during the two-decade period (1564–83) in which the Toungoo Dynasty briefly managed to subject Siam as its vassal state. This conquest incorporated many Thai elements into Burmese literature. Most evident ones were the yadu or yatu (), an emotional and philosophic verse and the yagan () genre. The next transmission of Thai literary influence to Burma happened in the aftermath of the fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. After a second conquest of Ayutthaya (Thailand), many Siamese royal dancers and poets were brought back to the court of Konbaung. Ramakien, the Thai version of Ramayana () was introduced and was adapted in Burmese where it is now called Yama Zatdaw. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modelled after the Ramayana, and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court. The early Rattanakosin Kingdom and its sphere political as well as cultural hegemony (1809) Cambodia had fallen into the control of Siamese hegemony around the reign of King Naresuan. But it was during the Thonburi Kingdom that the high cultures of the Rattanakosin kingdom were systematically transmitted to the Cambodian court who absorbed them voraciously. As Fédéric Maurel, a French historian, notes: It was during this period of Siamization that Thai literary influence had a wholesale impact on the Khmer literature. The Nirat or Siamese tradition of parting poetry was emulated by Khmer poets; and many Thai stories, such as Ka Kee, were translated from the Siamese source into the Khmer language. One study on comparative literature found that Cambodia’s current version of Ramayana (Reamker) was translated directly from the Thai source, almost stanza by stanza. The Cambodian royal court used to stage Thai lakhon dramas in Thai language during King Narodom's reign. Folk dance Folk dance forms include dance theater forms like likay, numerous regional dances (ram), the ritual dance ram muay, and homage to the teacher, wai khru. Both ram muay and wai khru take place before all traditional muay Thai matches. The wai is also an annual ceremony performed by Thai classical dance groups to honor their artistic ancestors. * Ramwong (; ) is a type of partner dance in a circle. * Ram Muay () is the ritualized dance that takes place before Southeast Asian kickboxing matches such as muay Thai. * Wai Khru () Wai khru ram muay is a ritualized form of dance meant to pay respect to or homage to the khru or teacher. It is performed annually by Thai classical dance institutions as well as before muay Thai matches. Regional dances Central Thailand  Central Thailand *Sri-Nuan is a typical dance of central Thailand. Its great popularity is due to the choreography and the sweetness of the music that accompanies it. The lyrics and music evoke the sweet nature of Thai girls. The dance is also an expression of the yearning of a young man won over by such great charm. *Teut-teung (drum dance) The teut-teung drum, an instrument used in Thai folk music, is played throughout the country to accompany the parades held at traditional festivals. It is said that the modern style of the teut-teung dance was created by some music teachers. *Farmers Dance (rice growers dance) This is a modern dance created by the Thai Ministry of Culture. The dancers wear the rice growers traditional costume and the dance itself enacts the daily activities of these workers who are the backbone of the nation. The ballet opens with the farmers as they come to plow and sow the fields. When they are sure that the rice is growing well, they gather together to pray to Mae Po Sop, the goddess who protects rice-growing. Lastly, the harvest is celebrated with songs and dancing. *Krabi Krabong or Combat with Short and Long Sticks and with Swords These dances are inspired by types of combat that were typical of Thailand, in which either sticks or swords are used. The skillful use of the short stick depends on the agility of the fighter, who must attack and always remain close to his opponent, while the combatant who takes up the long stick must maintain a critical distance from his rival to use his weapon effectively. The art of sword fighting has been practiced in Thailand since the beginning of time, and, traditionally, a ceremonial dance is performed prior to combat.

Usually, the word \\"serng\\" is added to the name of the domestic object used on stage by the dancers. In the case of the Serng Kratip, the dancers carry typical rice baskets, known as \\"kratip\\". Their movements imitate those of the women who bring food to the men working in the fields. The choreography is accompanied by music with a lively rhythm. The instruments used are a long drum, \\"charb\\" (cymbals), \\"grab\\" (a kind of castanet), \\"mong\\" (gong), and the \\"kahen\\" (like an old-fashioned syringe). *Serng Isan This folk dance is generally performed at traditional festivals. The choreography is entrusted to the dancers who wear brightly colored costumes, and expresses all the joy of the celebration. *Fon Phu Thai This dance is part of a propitiatory ceremony performed by the Phu Thai tribe, who live in the northeast. The music that accompanies it is played on typical instruments like the \\"gong ching\\" (a tribal drum), along with other drums and pipes. The gong ching plays a fundamental part because it sets the rhythm for the dance. *Serng Krapo (Coconut Dance) \\"Krapo\\" is the word for coconut in the Isan language. The dance illustrates the activities of a group of nubile girls from the southern part of the region, known as Isan. The dancers hold two coconut shells, with which they execute complex choreographic movements, shaking them, tossing them, or tapping them lightly. This dance is often accompanied by the sound of the pong lang, a kind of upright xylophone, made of strips of wood arranged according to the musical scale. *Isan Bantheong (the happiness of Isan) This is a series of folk dances usually performed on festive occasions. The swift, harmonious movements are accompanied by folk songs associated with the northeast region. Image:2013 Yasothon Rocket Festival 13.jpgDancers at a Yasothon festival Image:Yasothondancers01.JPGA folk dance in the Rocket Festival parade in Yasothon  Northern Thailand Northern Thailand *Fon Sao Mai (Silk Weaving Dance) Fon is a type of dance in northern and northeastern Thailand. It is performed in groups and has very slow, graceful, and almost meditative movements. Fon Sao Mai depicts a traditional profession of northern Thai women in silk weaving. The dance imitates different processes of silk-weaving. For generations, silk production is one of the top home industries in northern and northeastern Thailand and Laos. *Dance of the Nantha-Peri and Pu-Cha Drums The nantha-peri is a drum characteristic of northern Thailand, which is used for two purposes: to spur on warriors prior to battle and to pay homage to the Buddha in religious ceremonies. The pu-che, on the other hand, is a type of drum used by the tribes that live in the north: the Tay Yai, the Tai Lue and the Tay yan. It is used to accompany various dances including the sword dance, and the kai lai and king ka lai dances. *Sword Dance This dance is inspired by an ancient martial art that requires tremendous courage and strength, and excellent reflexes. The dancers balance a number of swords on different parts of their bodies while fighting off their rival with a sword sheath. *Ka-Lai Dance Beginners learn to execute graceful and balanced movements through the choreography of this dance. *King-Ka-La Dance The hand movements and steps of the female dancers, who wear spectacular fan-shaped costumes, evoke the movements of a bird. *The Sounds of the Mountains The music that accompanies this dance is played on wind instruments characteristic of three tribes in north Thailand: the pi hom (a gourd pipe) of the Tai Lue, the pi joom of the Tay Yuan and the kan nam tao (a gourd flute) of the Li Saw. *Candle Dance Typical of the Thai Kheun tribe, this dance is performed in honor of the Buddha. The female dancers pay homage to the divinities that protect the eight cardinal points of the Earth, asking them to pass through the candlelight in homage to the Buddha. *Khan Dok Dance The striking choreography of this dance of blessing expresses the calm, serene temperament of the northern peoples. *Choeng Tua Auk-son Dance This dance, performed in the Buddha's honor, is characterized by a complex choreography inspired by the calligraphy of the ancient alphabets of the northern regions and by the movements used in martial arts. *The Sounds of Lanna, the Ancient Kingdom of the North This music is played on two instruments typical of this region. The phin-phia is a stringed instrument whose body is made from a coconut shell. When he plays it, the musician rests the shell on his bare chest, then moves it or presses it to achieve the desired tonality. In the past, the phin-phia was the instrument used by youths to court the maidens of their village. Few musicians still play it. The sueng is a stringed instrument, made of teak or hardwood. It is played by plucking the two metal or brass strings with a horn plectrum. Image:Thai dancer Chiang Mai 2005 045.jpgA dancer in Chiang Mai.

Southern Thailand  Southern Thailand *The Nora The Nora is a traditional dance of southern Thailand (in southern Thai language called the \\"Chatri\\"), whose origins lie in various legends of which there are different versions. The choreography of the Nora dance varies from region to region, but is generally composed of 12 positions and 17 movements. *Nora Tua Oon This very refined version of the nora requires great interpretive skills and experience. To learn this nora it must be studied from a very young age so that the body can achieve the flexibility necessary to execute the complicated movements. The female dancers, in fact, follow a demanding exercise regime and a strict discipline. *Ram taeng Kae This is another elaborate Nora dance that requires great interpretative gifts. On the stage the protagonist launches a harpoon at the crocodile, whose back, lit by candles, is made from the trunk of a banyan tree. The female dancer moves around the writhing crocodile, poised to pierce its head at the right moment. *Ram Nora Son Ram This is a basic posture, which is executed by concentrating on hand arm and shoulder movements, and on the equilibrium and movement of various parts of the body, and is accompanied by rather long lyrics. *Ram Kien Pral - Yieb Louk Manao - Ram Ko Soet This advanced level of the nora dance is usually performed during a competition between two groups of dancers. To intimidate the rival group, a male dancer strikes an effigy. In the version known as Yleb Louk Manao, the female protagonist stamps on three lemons symbolizing the hearts of the rivals. The dance is performed as a sign of victory. In the next dance the female protagonist asks the pran, the comical hunter, to give her a headdress as a symbol of her victory. This is a ceremonial ritual carried out to dishonor rivals and to encourage the members of the group, and is characterized by a certain sacredness, as can be seen from the style of the dance. *Ram Nora Bot Pratom This choreography uses another basic posture, in which hand, arm and shoulder movements are synchronized with those of the head. *Ram Ooak Pran In the company that performs a nora, the \\"pran\\" or hunter plays the part of the fool. He usually wears a hunter's mask or headdress. His movements are often amusing and designed to make the audience laugh. Each position is in harmony with the dynamic rhythm of the music. *Ram Nora Klong Hong This advanced level of nora is performed only on important occasions. The female protagonist plays the role of Hong or kinnaree, a legendary creature who is half woman and half bird. According to a celebrated nora teacher, this episode is partly based on the legend of Prasuton-Manora. The seven kinnaree are playing in the lake in the middle of a wood. Struck by their beauty and lightheartedness, Pran Boon, the hunter, chases the maidens in an attempt to catch the youngest. The lively harmonious movements perfectly evoke Pran Boon's pursuit of the kinnaree as she tries to escape. *Ram Nora Tam Bot - Ram Ooak Pran In this dance the hand movements evoke the beautiful scenery of Songkhla Province in south Thailand. The verses of the song are accompanied by a very lively rhythm. *Rabam Srivichai - Rabam Sevichai is one of the so- called \\"Thai archaeological dances\\". It is a reinvented dance to represent the kingdom of Srivijaya, an 8th to 13th century Buddhist maritime empire that encompassed present day Indonesia, Malaysia, and south Thailand. The choreography and dance costume are based on images carved as bas relief on the great stupa of Borobudur in central Java, and other artifact of the Srivijaya period. The musical melody was also composed in Javanese style. The colors, black, red, and green are characteristic of southern Thailand. The head-dress is called a Krabang Naa. Some of the dance movements, poses and stances are based upon classical Javanese and Balinese dance tradition. Image:Nong Nooch-14.JPGManora Dance.

It refers to the idea that humans are born innately equipped with a mental faculty that forms the basis of language. It is this language faculty that allows children to effortlessly acquire language. As a process, bootstrapping can be divided into different domains, according to whether it involves semantic bootstrapping, syntactic bootstrapping, prosodic bootstrapping, or pragmatic bootstrapping. Background  Origin of the term \\"bootstrapping\\"  In literal terms, a bootstrap is the small strap on a boot that is used to help pull on the entire boot. Similarly in computer science, booting refers to the startup of an operation system by means of first initiating a smaller program. Therefore, bootstrapping refers to the leveraging of a small action into a more powerful and significant operation. Bootstrapping in linguistics was first introduced by Steven Pinker as a metaphor for the idea that children are innately equipped with mental processes that help initiate language acquisition. Bootstrapping attempts to identify the language learning processes that enable children to learn about the structure of the target language. Connectionism Bootstrapping has a strong link to connectionist theories which model human cognition as a system of simple, interconnected networks. In this respect, connectionist approaches view human cognition as a computational algorithm. On this view, in terms of learning, humans have statistical learning capabilities that allow them to problem solve. Proponents of statistical learning believe that it is the basis for higher level learning, and that humans use the statistical information to create a database which allows them to learn higher-order generalizations and concepts. For a child acquiring language, the challenge is to parse out discrete segments from a continuous speech stream. Research demonstrates that, when exposed to streams of nonsense speech, children use statistical learning to determine word boundaries. In every human language, there are certain sounds that are more likely to occur with each other: for example, in English, the sequence [st] is attested (stop), but the sequence *[gb] is not. It appears that children can detect the statistical probability of certain sounds occurring with one another, and use this to parse out word boundaries. Utilizing these statistical abilities, children appear to be able to form mental representations, or neural networks, of relevant pieces of information. Pieces of relevant information include word classes, which in connectionist theory, are seen as each having an internal representation and transitional links between concepts. Neighbouring words provide concepts and links for children to bootstrap new representations on the basis of their previous knowledge.  Innateness  The innateness hypothesis was originally coined by Noam Chomsky as a means to explain the universality in language acquisition. All typically-developing children with adequate exposure to a language will learn to speak and comprehend the language fluently. It is also proposed that despite the supposed variation in languages, they all fall into a very restricted subset of the potential grammars that could be infinitely conceived. Chomsky argued that since all grammars universally deviate very little from the same general structure and children seamlessly acquire language, humans must have some intrinsic language learning capability that allows us to learn language. This intrinsic capability was hypothesized to be embedded in the brain, earning the title of language acquisition device (LAD). According to this hypothesis, the child is equipped with knowledge of grammatical and ungrammatical types, which they then apply to the stream of speech they hear in order to determine the grammar this stream is compatible with. The processes underlying this LAD relates to bootstrapping in that once a child has identified the subset of the grammar they are learning, they can then apply their knowledge of grammatical types in order to learn the language-specific aspects of the word. This relates to the Principles and Parameters theory of linguistics, in that languages universally consist of basic, unbroken principles and vary by specific parameters. Semantic bootstrapping Semantic bootstrapping is a linguistic theory of language acquisition which proposes that children can acquire the syntax of a language by first learning and recognizing semantic elements and building upon, or bootstrapping from, that knowledge. According to Pinker,Pinker, Steven (1984). The Semantic Bootstrapping Hypothesis. semantic bootstrapping requires two critical assumptions to hold true: # A child must be able to perceive meaning from utterances. That is, the child must associate utterances with, for example, objects and actions in the real world. # A child must also be able to realize that there are strong correspondences between semantic and syntactic categories. The child can then use the knowledge of these correspondences to create, test, and refine internal grammar rules iteratively as the child gains more knowledge of their language.  Acquiring the state/event contrast  When discussing the acquisition of temporal contrasts, the child must first have a concept of time outside of semantics. In other words, the child must be able to have some mental grasp on the concept of events, memory, and general progression of time before attempting to conceive it semantically. Semantics, especially with regard to events and memory concepts, appears to be far more language-general, with meanings being more universal concepts rather than the individual segments being used to represent them. For this reason, semantics requires far more cognition than external stimuli in acquiring it, and relies much on the innate capability of the child to develop such abstraction; the child must first have a mental representation of the concept, before attempting to link a word to that meaning. In order to actually learn time events, several processes must occur: # The child must have a grasp on temporal concepts # They must learn which concepts are represented in their own language # They must learn how their experiences are representative of certain event types that are present in the language # They must learn the different morphological and syntactic representations of these events (Data in list cited from ) Using these basic stepping stones, the child is able to map their internal concept of the meaning of time onto explicit linguistic segments. This bootstrapping allows them to have hierarchical, segmental steps, in which they are able to build upon their previous knowledge to aid future learning. Tomasello argues that in learning linguistic symbols, the child does not need to have explicit external linguistic contrasts, and rather, will learn about these concepts via social context and their surroundings. This can be demonstrated with semantic bootstrapping in that the child does not explicitly receive information on the semantic meaning of temporal events, but learns to apply their internal knowledge of time to the linguistic segments that they are being exposed to.  Acquiring the count/mass contrast  With regard to mapping the semantic relationships for count, it follows previous bootstrapping methods. Since the context in which children are presented with number quantities usually have visual aid to accompany them, the child has a relatively easy way to map these number concepts. {  -  1. Look at the three boys! } Count nouns are nouns which are viewed as being discrete entities or individuals. For nouns which denote discrete entities, granted that the child already has the mental concept for BOY and THREE in place, they will see the set of animate, young, human males (i.e. boys) and confirm that the set has a cardinality of three. For mass nouns which denote non-discrete substances, in order to count, they act to demonstrate the relationship between atoms of the word and substance. However, mass nouns can vary with regard to the sharpness or narrowness that they refer to an entity. For example, a grain of rice has a much narrower quantity definition than a bag of rice. \\"Of\\" is a word that children are thought to learn the definition of as being something that transforms a substance into a set of atoms. For example, when one says: {  -  2. I have three gallons for sale. } {  -  3. I have three gallons of water. } The word of is used in (3) to mark the mass noun water is partitioned into gallons. The initial substance now denotes a set. The child again uses visual cues to grasp what this relationship is. Syntactic bootstrapping Syntactic bootstrapping is a theory about the process of how children identify word meanings based on their syntactic categories. In other words, how knowledge of grammatical structure, including how syntactic categories (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.) combine into phrases and constituents in order to form sentences, \\"bootstraps\\" the acquisition of word meaning. The main challenge this theory tackles is the lack of specific information extralinguistic-information context provides on mapping word meaning and making inferences. It accounts for this problem by suggesting that children do not need to rely solely on environmental context to understand meaning or have the words explained to them. Instead, the children infer word meanings from their observations about syntax, and use these observations to infer word meaning and comprehend future utterances they hear. This in-depth analysis of Syntactic bootstrapping provides background on the research and evidence; describing how children acquire lexical and functional categories, challenges to the theory as well as cross-linguistic applications. Prosodic bootstrapping Even before infants can comprehend word meaning, prosodic details assist them in discovering syntactic boundaries. Prosodic bootstrapping or phonological bootstrapping investigates how prosodic information—which includes stress, rhythm, intonation, pitch, pausing, as well as dialectal features—can assist a child in discovering the grammatical structure of the language that they are acquiring. In general, prosody introduces features that reflect either attributes of the speaker or the utterance type. Speaker attributes include emotional state, as well as the presence of irony or sarcasm. Utterance-level attributes are used to mark questions, statements and commands, and they can also be used to mark contrast. * Prosodic features associated with the speaker: emotional state, irony, sarcasm * Prosodic features associate with utterance type: question, statement, command, contrast Similarly, in sign language, prosody includes facial expression, mouthing, and the rhythm, length and tension of gestures and signs. In language, words are not only categorized into phrases, clauses, and sentences. Words are also organized into prosodic envelopes. The idea of a prosodic envelope is that words that go together syntactically also form a similar intonation pattern. This explains how children discover syllable and word boundaries through prosodic cues. Overall, prosodic bootstrapping explores determining grammatical groupings in a speech stream rather than learning word meaning. One of the key components of the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis is that prosodic cues may aid infants in identifying lexical and syntactical properties. From this, three key elements of prosodic bootstrapping can be proposed: # The syntax of language is correlated with acoustic properties. # Infants can detect and are sensitive to these acoustic properties. # These acoustic properties can be used by infants when processing speech. There is evidence that the acquisition of language-specific prosodic qualities starts even before an infant is born. This is seen in neonate crying patterns, which have qualities that are similar to the prosody of the language that they are acquiring. The only way that an infant could be born with this ability is if the prosodic patterns of the target language are learned in utero. Further evidence of young infants using prosodic cues is their ability to discriminate the acoustic property of pitch change by 1–2 months old. Prosodic cues for syntactic structure Infants and young children receive much of their language input in the form of infant-directed speech (IDS) and child-directed speech (CDS), which are characterized as having exaggerated prosody and simplification of words and grammar structure. When interacting with infants and children, adults often raise and widen their pitch, and reduce their speech rate. However, these cues vary across cultures and across languages. There are several ways in which infant- and child-directed speech can facilitate language acquisition. In recent studies, it is shown that IDS and CDS contain prosodic information that may help infants and children distinguish between paralinguistic expressions (e.g. gasps, laughs, expressions) and informative speech. In Western cultures, mothers speak to their children using exaggerated intonation and pauses, which offer insight about syntactic groupings such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases. This means that the linguistic input infants and children receive include some prosodic bracketing around syntactically relevant chunks. (1) Look the boy is patting the dog with his hand. (2) *Look the boy ... is ... patting the ... dog with his ... hand. (3) Look … [DP The boy] ... [VP is patting the dog] ... [PP with his hand]. A sentence like (1) will not typically be produced with the pauses indicated in (2), where the pauses \\"interrupt\\" syntactic constituents. For example, pausing between the and dog would interrupt the determiner phrase (DP) constituent, as would pausing between his and hand. Most often, pauses are placed so as to group the utterance into chunks that correspond to the beginnings and ends of constituents such as determiner phrases (DPs), verb phrases (VPs), and prepositional phrases (PPs). As a result, sentences like (3), where the pauses correspond to syntactic constituents, are much more natural. Moreover, within these phrases are distinct patterns of stress, which helps to differentiate individual elements within the phrase, such as a noun from an article. Typically, articles and other unbound morphemes are unstressed and are relatively short in duration in contrast to the pronunciation of nouns. Furthermore, in verb phrases, auxiliary verbs are less stressed than main verbs. This can be seen in (4). 4\\\\. They are RUNning. Prosodic bootstrapping states that these naturally occurring intonation packages help infants and children to bracket linguistic input into syntactic groupings. Currently, there is not enough evidence to suggest that prosodic cues in IDS and CDS facilitate in the acquisition of more complex syntax. However IDS and CDS are richer linguistic inputs for infants and children. Prosodic cues for clauses and phrases There is continued research into whether infants use prosodic cues – in particular, pauses – when processing clauses and phrases. Clauses are the largest constituent structure in a phrase and are often produced in isolation in conversation; for example, \\"Did you walk the dog?\\". Consequently, phrases are smaller components of clauses. For example, \\"the tall man\\" or \\"walks his dog\\". Peter Jusczyk argued that infants use prosody to parse speech into smaller units for analysis. He, along with colleagues, reported that 4.5 month old infants illustrated a preference for artificial pauses at clause boundaries in comparison to pauses at other places in a sentence; preferring pauses at clause boundaries illustrates infants' abilities to discriminate clauses in a passage. This reveals that while infants do not understand word meaning, they are in the process of learning about their native language and grammatical structure. In a separate study, Jusczyk reported that 9 month old infants preferred passages with pauses occurring between subject-noun phrases and verb phrases. These results are further evidence of infant sensitivity for syntactic boundaries. In a follow up study by LouAnn Gerken et al., researchers compared sentences such as (1) and (2). The prosodic boundaries are indicated by parentheses. 5\\\\. (Joe)(kissed the dog). 6\\\\. (He kissed)(the dog). In (1), there is a pause before the verb . This is also the location of the subject-verb phrase boundary. Comparably in (2), which contains a weak pronoun, speakers either do not produce a salient prosodic boundary or place the boundary after the verb {{angbrkissed}. When tested, 9 month old infants illustrated a preference for pauses located before the verb, such as in (1). However, when passages with pronoun subjects were used, such as in (2), infants did not show a preference for where the pause occurs. While these results again illustrate that infants are sensitive to prosodic cues in speech, they introduce evidence that infants prefer prosodic boundaries that occur naturally in speech. Although the use of prosody in infant speech processing is generally viewed as assisting infants in speech parsing, it has not yet been established how this speech segmentation enriches the acquisition of syntax. Criticism Critics of prosodic bootstrapping have argued that the reliability of prosodic cues has been overestimated and that prosodic boundaries do not always match up with syntactic boundaries. It is argued instead that while prosody does provide infants and children useful clues about a language, it does not explain how children learn to combine clauses, phrases, and sentences, nor word meaning. As a result, a comprehensive account of how children learn language must combine prosodic bootstrapping with other types of bootstrapping as well as more general learning mechanisms. Pragmatic bootstrapping Pragmatic bootstrapping refers to how pragmatic cues and their use in social context assist in language acquisition, and more specifically, word learning. Pragmatic cues are illustrated both verbally and through nonlinguistic cues. They include hand gestures, eye movement, a speaker's focus of attention, intentionality, and linguistic context. Similarly, the parsimonious model proposes that a child learns word meaning by relating language input to their immediate environment. An example of Pragmatic Bootstrapping would be a teacher saying the word while gesturing to a dog in the presence of a child. Gaze following YouTube Video - Word Learning – Gaze Direction Children are able to associate words with actions or objects by following the gaze of their communication partner. Often, this occurs when an adult labels an action or object while looking at it. * Baldwin carried out experiments where 18-month-olds were shown two novel objects and then concealed them in separate containers. The experimenters would then peek into one of the containers and say, \\"There's a modi in here\\"; and then remove both objects from the container and give them to the child. When asked for the \\"modi\\", the child would hold up the object that the experimenter had been looking at when they labelled the object. This illustrates how children use eye gaze and labelling to learn the name of novel objects. * Tomasello and Akhtar applied a “Show Me Widget” test where a novel and nameless action was performed with a novel and nameless object. The experimenter would perform the action with the object and then pass the object to the child and instruct the child to \\"widget\\". The experimenter's behavior before they passed the child the object was manipulated between two conditions: Action Highlighted Condition: The experimenter would prepare an object that the child would use to perform a specific action by correctly orientating the object. The experimenter would then hold out the object and say, \\"Widget, Jason! Your turn!\\". Object Highlighted Condition: The experimenter would not prepare the object for the child and would simply hold out the object to the child and say, \\"Widget, Jason! Your turn!\\". The results from the experiment illustrated that children in the Action Highlighted Condition associated the novel word with the novel action, whereas the children in the Object Highlighted Condition assumed the novel word referred to the novel object. To understand that the novel word referred to the novel action, children had to learn from the experimenter's nonverbal behavior that they were requesting the action of the object. This illustrates how non-linguistic context influences novel word learning. Observing adult behavior Children also look at adults' faces when learning new words, which can often lead to better understanding of what words mean. In everyday speech, mistakes are often made. So, why don't children end up learning the wrong words for the targeted things? This may be because children are able to see whether the word was right or wrong for the intended meaning by seeing the adult's facial expressions and behaviour. * Tomasello and Barton performed multiple studies to see if infants could understand whether an action was intentional or accidental, and if they could learn and understand a new verb based on emotional cues. Verb: Plunk ...\\"I'm going to plunk Big Bird!\\" The adult said this sentence without previously explaining what the verb \\"plunk\\" would mean. Afterwards, the adult would do one of two things. Action 1 She then performed the target action intentionally, saying \\"There!\\", followed immediately by another action on the same apparatus performed \\"accidentally\\", in an awkward fashion saying \\"Whoops!\\" Action 2 Same as Action 1, however, reversed. Afterwards, the children were asked to do the same to another apparatus, and see if the children would perform the targeted action. Verb: Plunk \\"Can you go plunk Mickey Mouse?\\" The results were that the children were able to understand the intended action for the new word in which they just heard, and performed the action when asked. By watching the adult's behavior and facial expressions, they were able to understand what the verb \\"plunk\\" meant and figure out whether it was the targeted action or the accidental action. * Akhtar, Carpenter and Tomasello conducted a similar experiment that focused on the behaviors of adults and word learning, but this time, for nouns. In this experiment, two experimenters and a guardian of the child were inside a room, playing with 3 objects. Each object was played with for an equal amount of time, with equal excitement. Afterwards, one experimenter and the guardian would leave, and the experimenter left behind would present a new toy and play with it with the same excitement as the other objects for about the same length of time. Afterwards, the other experimenter and the guardian came back, and so began the experiment and the two ways in which the experiment would be carried out, which was labelled the \\"Language\\" and \\"No-Language\\" condition. These simply mean that in the Language condition, the new toy had a term for itself, while in the No-Language condition, the term was not used. Language \\"Look, I see a gazzer! A gazzer!\\" No-Language \\"Look, I see a toy! A toy!\\" Afterwards, the adults would leave then ask the child to bring the new object over. In the Language condition, the child would correctly bring the targeted object over. In the No-Language condition, the child would just randomly bring an object over. This presents the discovery of two things... # The child was aware of which object was new for the adults that left the room. # The child knew that the adult was excited because the object was new, and that is why they would use this new term that they had never heard before. ...and the child was able to understand this based on the emotional behaviors of the adult.

Francisco Garden (; ) is a floral garden on Rua de Santa Clara in Sé, Macau, China. History The S. Francisco Garden is the oldest garden in Macau. The history of the garden goes back nearly four centuries. In 1580, a convent stood at the site now occupied by the garden. The convent was built by Castilian friars of the Franciscan order. The builders of the convent were supplanted by Portuguese friars five years later. But the name of the Castilian friars remains closely associated with the place even today: The garden continues to be referred to by its Cantonese name 'Ka-Si-Lán-Fa-Yun', meaning 'Garden of the Castilians'. Changes The garden has undergone some changes down the years. The most significant of the changes took place in the 1920s, when the wave of modernization also impacted the garden. A new road, the Rua de Sta Clara, was built right through the garden, bisecting it. The garden iconic bandstand was demolished. The garden, however, still managed to salvage its character. One of the oldest features of the garden that still survive are the old arches near the Quartel de S. Francisco wall. The ancient giant trees still stand. The Garden Today There is an octagonal pavilion of Chinese architecture on the lower level of the garden. Amazingly, this small building is one of Macau's busiest libraries. The garden also retains most of the beautiful balustrade that goes around it. The balusters also serve as support for the railing of the stairs that join the lower level of the garden to the upper level. On this level the garden features a tower built by the Portuguese military to honour World War I war heroes.

When applied deliberately, the intention is usually to increase rather than decrease the impedance. IEEE Standard 100 Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition, IEEE Press, 2000 page 123 Generally, any technique where part of the output of a system is used at startup is described as bootstrapping. In the domain of MOSFET circuits, bootstrapping is commonly used to mean pulling up the operating point of a transistor above the power supply rail. The same term has been used somewhat more generally for dynamically altering the operating point of an operational amplifier (by shifting both its positive and negative supply rail) in order to increase its output voltage swing (relative to the ground). In the sense used in this paragraph, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means \\"using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies\\". A more sophisticated use of this rail bootstrapping technique is to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic of the inputs of a JFET op-amp in order to decrease its distortion. Input impedance Bootstrap capacitors C1 and C2 in a BJT emitter follower circuit In analog circuit designs, a bootstrap circuit is an arrangement of components deliberately intended to alter the input impedance of a circuit. Usually it is intended to increase the impedance, by using a small amount of positive feedback, usually over two stages. This was often necessary in the early days of bipolar transistors, which inherently have quite a low input impedance. Because the feedback is positive, such circuits can suffer from poor stability and noise performance compared to ones that don't bootstrap. Negative feedback may alternatively be used to bootstrap an input impedance, causing the apparent impedance to be reduced. This is seldom done deliberately, however, and is normally an unwanted result of a particular circuit design. A well-known example of this is the Miller effect, in which an unavoidable feedback capacitance appears increased (i.e. its impedance appears reduced) by negative feedback. One popular case where this is done deliberately is the Miller compensation technique for providing a low- frequency pole inside an integrated circuit. To minimize the size of the necessary capacitor, it is placed between the input and an output which swings in the opposite direction. This bootstrapping makes it act like a larger capacitor to ground. Driving MOS transistors A N-MOSFET/IGBT needs a significantly positive charge (VGS > Vth) applied to the gate in order to turn on. Using only N-channel MOSFET/IGBT devices is a common cost reduction method due largely to die size reduction (there are other benefits as well). However, using nMOS devices in place of pMOS devices means that a voltage higher than the power rail supply (V+) is needed in order to bias the transistor into linear operation (minimal current limiting) and thus avoid significant heat loss. A bootstrap capacitor is connected from the supply rail (V+) to the output voltage. Usually the source terminal of the N-MOSFET is connected to the cathode of a recirculation diode allowing for efficient management of stored energy in the typically inductive load (See Flyback diode). Due to the charge storage characteristics of a capacitor, the bootstrap voltage will rise above (V+) providing the needed gate drive voltage. A bootstrap circuit often used in each half-bridge of an all-N-MOSFET H-bridge. When the low-side N-FET is on, current from the power rail (V+) flows through the bootstrap diode and charges the bootstrap capacitor through that low-side N-FET. When the low-side N-FET turns off, the low side of the bootstrap capacitor remains connected to the source of the high-side N-FET, and the capacitor discharges some of its energy driving the gate of the high-side N-FET to a voltage sufficiently above V+ to turn the high-side N-FET fully on; while the bootstrap diode blocks that above-V+ voltage from leaking back to the power rail V+. Mamadou Diallo from Texas Instruments. [http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slua887/slua887.pdf \\"Bootstrap Circuitry Selection for Half-Bridge Configurations\\". 2018\\\\. A MOSFET/IGBT is a voltage-controlled device which, in theory, will not have any gate current. This makes it possible to utilize the charge inside the capacitor for control purposes. However, eventually the capacitor will lose its charge due to parasitic gate current and non-ideal (i.e. finite) internal resistance, so this scheme is only used where there is a steady pulse present. This is because the pulsing action allows for the capacitor to discharge (at least partially if not completely). Most control schemes that use a bootstrap capacitor force the high side driver (N-MOSFET) off for a minimum time to allow for the capacitor to refill. This means that the duty cycle will always need to be less than 100% to accommodate for the parasitic discharge unless the leakage is accommodated for in another manner. Switch-mode power supplies In switch-mode power supplies, the regulation circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance can be used to trickle-charge the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit. Raymond A. Mack Demystifying switching power supplies Newnes, 2005 , page 121 Output swing AC amplifiers can use bootstrapping to increase output swing. A capacitor (usually referred as bootstrap capacitor) is connected from the output of the amplifier to the bias circuit, providing bias voltages that exceed the power supply voltage. Emitter followers can provide rail-to-rail output in this way, which is a common technique in class AB audio amplifiers. Digital integrated circuits Within an integrated circuit a bootstrap method is used to allow internal address and clock distribution lines to have an increased voltage swing. The bootstrap circuit uses a coupling capacitor, formed from the gate/source capacitance of a transistor, to drive a signal line to slightly greater than the supply voltage. William J. Dally, John W.

Bootstrapping assigns measures of accuracy (bias, variance, confidence intervals, prediction error, etc.) to sample estimates. software Second Thoughts on the Bootstrap – Bradley Efron, 2003 This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Bootstrap Methods.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BootstrapMethods.html Bootstrapping estimates the properties of an estimator (such as its variance) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. One standard choice for an approximating distribution is the empirical distribution function of the observed data. In the case where a set of observations can be assumed to be from an independent and identically distributed population, this can be implemented by constructing a number of resamples with replacement, of the observed data set (and of equal size to the observed data set). It may also be used for constructing hypothesis tests. It is often used as an alternative to statistical inference based on the assumption of a parametric model when that assumption is in doubt, or where parametric inference is impossible or requires complicated formulas for the calculation of standard errors.

Biometrika 79 231–245  Approach  The basic idea of bootstrapping is that inference about a population from sample data (sample → population) can be modelled by resampling the sample data and performing inference about a sample from resampled data (resampled → sample). As the population is unknown, the true error in a sample statistic against its population value is unknown. In bootstrap-resamples, the 'population' is in fact the sample, and this is known; hence the quality of inference of the 'true' sample from resampled data (resampled → sample) is measurable. More formally, the bootstrap works by treating inference of the true probability distribution J, given the original data, as being analogous to inference of the empirical distribution Ĵ, given the resampled data. The accuracy of inferences regarding Ĵ using the resampled data can be assessed because we know Ĵ. If Ĵ is a reasonable approximation to J, then the quality of inference on J can in turn be inferred. As an example, assume we are interested in the average (or mean) height of people worldwide. We cannot measure all the people in the global population, so instead we sample only a tiny part of it, and measure that. Assume the sample is of size N; that is, we measure the heights of N individuals. From that single sample, only one estimate of the mean can be obtained. In order to reason about the population, we need some sense of the variability of the mean that we have computed. The simplest bootstrap method involves taking the original data set of heights, and, using a computer, sampling from it to form a new sample (called a 'resample' or bootstrap sample) that is also of size N. The bootstrap sample is taken from the original by using sampling with replacement (e.g. we might 'resample' 5 times from [1,2,3,4,5] and get [2,5,4,4,1]), so, assuming N is sufficiently large, for all practical purposes there is virtually zero probability that it will be identical to the original \\"real\\" sample. This process is repeated a large number of times (typically 1,000 or 10,000 times), and for each of these bootstrap samples we compute its mean (each of these are called bootstrap estimates). We now can create a histogram of bootstrap means. This histogram provides an estimate of the shape of the distribution of the sample mean from which we can answer questions about how much the mean varies across samples. (The method here, described for the mean, can be applied to almost any other statistic or estimator.)  Discussion   Advantages  A great advantage of bootstrap is its simplicity. It is a straightforward way to derive estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals for complex estimators of the distribution, such as percentile points, proportions, odds ratio, and correlation coefficients. Bootstrap is also an appropriate way to control and check the stability of the results. Although for most problems it is impossible to know the true confidence interval, bootstrap is asymptotically more accurate than the standard intervals obtained using sample variance and assumptions of normality.DiCiccio TJ, Efron B (1996) Bootstrap confidence intervals (with Discussion). Statistical Science 11: 189–228 The bootstrapping also is a convenient method that avoids the cost of repeating the experiment to get other groups of sample data.  Disadvantages  Although bootstrapping is (under some conditions) asymptotically consistent, it does not provide general finite-sample guarantees. The result may depend on the representative sample. The apparent simplicity may conceal the fact that important assumptions are being made when undertaking the bootstrap analysis (e.g. independence of samples) where these would be more formally stated in other approaches. Also, the bootstrapping can be time-consuming.  Recommendations  The number of bootstrap samples recommended in literature has increased as available computing power has increased. If the results may have substantial real-world consequences, then one should use as many samples as is reasonable, given available computing power and time. Increasing the number of samples cannot increase the amount of information in the original data; it can only reduce the effects of random sampling errors which can arise from a bootstrap procedure itself. Moreover, there is evidence that numbers of samples greater than 100 lead to negligible improvements in the estimation of standard errors.Goodhue, D.L., Lewis, W., & Thompson, R. (2012). Does PLS have advantages for small sample size or non-normal data? MIS Quarterly, 36(3), 981–1001. In fact, according to the original developer of the bootstrapping method, even setting the number of samples at 50 is likely to lead to fairly good standard error estimates.Efron, B., Rogosa, D., & Tibshirani, R. (2004). Resampling methods of estimation. In N.J. Smelser, & P.B. Baltes (Eds.). International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (pp. 13216–13220). New York, NY: Elsevier. Adèr et al. recommend the bootstrap procedure for the following situations: :*When the theoretical distribution of a statistic of interest is complicated or unknown. Since the bootstrapping procedure is distribution-independent it provides an indirect method to assess the properties of the distribution underlying the sample and the parameters of interest that are derived from this distribution. :*When the sample size is insufficient for straightforward statistical inference. If the underlying distribution is well-known, bootstrapping provides a way to account for the distortions caused by the specific sample that may not be fully representative of the population. :* When power calculations have to be performed, and a small pilot sample is available. Most power and sample size calculations are heavily dependent on the standard deviation of the statistic of interest. If the estimate used is incorrect, the required sample size will also be wrong. One method to get an impression of the variation of the statistic is to use a small pilot sample and perform bootstrapping on it to get impression of the variance. However, Athreya has shownBootstrap of the mean in the infinite variance case Athreya, K.B. Ann Stats vol 15 (2) 1987 724–731 that if one performs a naive bootstrap on the sample mean when the underlying population lacks a finite variance (for example, a power law distribution), then the bootstrap distribution will not converge to the same limit as the sample mean. As a result, confidence intervals on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation of the bootstrap could be misleading. Athreya states that \\"Unless one is reasonably sure that the underlying distribution is not heavy tailed, one should hesitate to use the naive bootstrap\\".  Types of bootstrap scheme  In univariate problems, it is usually acceptable to resample the individual observations with replacement (\\"case resampling\\" below) unlike subsampling, in which resampling is without replacement and is valid under much weaker conditions compared to the bootstrap. In small samples, a parametric bootstrap approach might be preferred. For other problems, a smooth bootstrap will likely be preferred. For regression problems, various other alternatives are available.Efron B., R. J. Tibshirani, An introduction to the bootstrap, Chapman & Hall/CRC 1998  Case resampling  Bootstrap is generally useful for estimating the distribution of a statistic (e.g. mean, variance) without using normal theory (e.g. z-statistic, t-statistic). Bootstrap comes in handy when there is no analytical form or normal theory to help estimate the distribution of the statistics of interest, since bootstrap methods can apply to most random quantities, e.g., the ratio of variance and mean. There are at least two ways of performing case resampling. # The Monte Carlo algorithm for case resampling is quite simple. First, we resample the data with replacement, and the size of the resample must be equal to the size of the original data set. Then the statistic of interest is computed from the resample from the first step. We repeat this routine many times to get a more precise estimate of the Bootstrap distribution of the statistic. # The 'exact' version for case resampling is similar, but we exhaustively enumerate every possible resample of the data set. This can be computationally expensive as there are a total of \\\\binom {2n-1}n = \\\\frac{(2n-1)!}{n! (n-1)!} different resamples, where n is the size of the data set. Thus for n = 5, 10, 20, 30 there are 126, 92378, 6.89 x 10^10 and 5.91 x 10^16 different resamples respectively.How many different bootstrap samples are there? Statweb.stanford.edu  Estimating the distribution of sample mean  Consider a coin-flipping experiment. We flip the coin and record whether it lands heads or tails. Let be 10 observations from the experiment. if the i th flip lands heads, and 0 otherwise. From normal theory, we can use t-statistic to estimate the distribution of the sample mean, : \\\\bar{x} = \\\\frac{1}{10} (x_1 + x_2 + \\\\cdots + x_{10}). Instead, we use bootstrap, specifically case resampling, to derive the distribution of \\\\bar{x}. We first resample the data to obtain a bootstrap resample. An example of the first resample might look like this . There are some duplicates since a bootstrap resample comes from sampling with replacement from the data. Also the number of data points in a bootstrap resample is equal to the number of data points in our original observations. Then we compute the mean of this resample and obtain the first bootstrap mean: μ1*. We repeat this process to obtain the second resample X2* and compute the second bootstrap mean μ2*. If we repeat this 100 times, then we have μ1*, μ2*, ..., μ100*. This represents an empirical bootstrap distribution of sample mean. From this empirical distribution, one can derive a bootstrap confidence interval for the purpose of hypothesis testing.  Regression  In regression problems, case resampling refers to the simple scheme of resampling individual cases – often rows of a data set. For regression problems, as long as the data set is fairly large, this simple scheme is often acceptable. However, the method is open to criticism. In regression problems, the explanatory variables are often fixed, or at least observed with more control than the response variable. Also, the range of the explanatory variables defines the information available from them. Therefore, to resample cases means that each bootstrap sample will lose some information. As such, alternative bootstrap procedures should be considered.  Bayesian bootstrap  Bootstrapping can be interpreted in a Bayesian framework using a scheme that creates new data sets through reweighting the initial data. Given a set of N data points, the weighting assigned to data point i in a new data set \\\\mathcal{D}^J is w^J_i = x^J_i - x^J_{i-1}, where \\\\mathbf{x}^J is a low-to-high ordered list of N-1 uniformly distributed random numbers on [0,1], preceded by 0 and succeeded by 1. The distributions of a parameter inferred from considering many such data sets \\\\mathcal{D}^J are then interpretable as posterior distributions on that parameter.Rubin, D. B. (1981). \\"The Bayesian bootstrap\\". Annals of Statistics, 9, 130.  Smooth bootstrap  Under this scheme, a small amount of (usually normally distributed) zero-centered random noise is added onto each resampled observation. This is equivalent to sampling from a kernel density estimate of the data. Assume K to be a symmetric kernel density function with unit variance. The standard kernel estimator \\\\hat{f\\\\,}_h(x) of f(x) is \\\\hat{f\\\\,}_h(x)={1\\\\over nh}\\\\sum_{i=1}^nK\\\\Big({x-X_i\\\\over h}\\\\Big), where h is the smoothing parameter. And the corresponding distribution function estimator \\\\hat{F\\\\,}_h(x) is \\\\hat{F\\\\,}_h(x)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{x} \\\\hat f_h(t)dt.  Parametric bootstrap  Based on the assumption that original data set is realization of a random sample from a distribution of a specific parametric type, in this case a parametric model is fitted by parameter θ, often by maximum likelihood, and samples of random numbers are drawn from this fitted model. Usually the sample drawn has the same sample size as the original data. Then the estimate of original function F can be written as \\\\hat{F}=F_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}. This sampling process is repeated many times as for other bootstrap methods. Considering the centered sample mean in this case, the random sample original distribution function F_{\\\\theta} is replaced by a bootstrap random sample with function F_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}, and the probability distribution of \\\\bar{X_{n}}-\\\\mu_{\\\\theta} is approximated by that of \\\\bar{X}_n^*-\\\\mu^*, where \\\\mu^*=\\\\mu_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}, which is the expectation corresponding to F_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}. The use of a parametric model at the sampling stage of the bootstrap methodology leads to procedures which are different from those obtained by applying basic statistical theory to inference for the same model. Often the parametric bootstrap approximation is better than the empirical bootstrap approximation.  Resampling residuals  Another approach to bootstrapping in regression problems is to resample residuals. The method proceeds as follows. # Fit the model and retain the fitted values \\\\widehat{y\\\\,}_i and the residuals \\\\widehat{\\\\varepsilon\\\\,}_i = y_i - \\\\widehat{y\\\\,}_i, (i = 1,\\\\dots, n). # For each pair, (xi, yi), in which xi is the (possibly multivariate) explanatory variable, add a randomly resampled residual, \\\\widehat{\\\\varepsilon\\\\,}_j, to the fitted value \\\\widehat{y\\\\,}_i. In other words, create synthetic response variables y^*_i = \\\\widehat{y\\\\,}_i + \\\\widehat{\\\\varepsilon\\\\,}_j where j is selected randomly from the list (1, ..., n) for every i. # Refit the model using the fictitious response variables y^*_i, and retain the quantities of interest (often the parameters, \\\\widehat\\\\mu^*_i, estimated from the synthetic y^*_i). # Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times. This scheme has the advantage that it retains the information in the explanatory variables. However, a question arises as to which residuals to resample. Raw residuals are one option; another is studentized residuals (in linear regression). Although there are arguments in favour of using studentized residuals; in practice, it often makes little difference, and it is easy to compare the results of both schemes.  Gaussian process regression bootstrap  When data are temporally correlated, straightforward bootstrapping destroys the inherent correlations. This method uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fit a probabilistic model from which replicates may then be drawn. GPR is a Bayesian non-linear regression method. A Gaussian process (GP) is a collection of random variables, and any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian (normal) distribution. A GP is defined by a mean function and a covariance function, which specify the mean vectors and covariance matrices for each finite collection of the random variables. Regression model: y(x)=f(x)+\\\\epsilon,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\epsilon\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,\\\\sigma^2), \\\\epsilon is a noise term. Gaussian process prior: For any finite collection of variables, x1,...,xn, the function outputs f(x1),...,f(xn) are jointly distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian with mean m=[m(x_1),...,m(x_n)]^\\\\intercal and covariance matrix (K)_{ij}=k(x_i,x_j) . Assume f(x)\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{GP}(m,k) , then y(x)\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{GP}(m,l) , where l(x_i,x_j)=k(x_i,x_j)+\\\\sigma^2\\\\delta(x_i,x_j) , and \\\\delta(x_i,x_j) is the standard Kronecker delta function. Gaussian process posterior: According to GP prior, we can get [y(x_1),...,y(x_r)]\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(m_0,K_0) , where m_0=[m(x_1),...,m(x_r)]^\\\\intercal and (K_0)_{ij}=k(x_i,x_j)+\\\\sigma^2\\\\delta(x_i,x_j) . Let x1*,...,xs* be another finite collection of variables, it's obvious that [y(x_1),...,y(x_r),f(x_1^*),...f(x_s^*)]^\\\\intercal\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\binom{m_0}{m_*}\\\\begin{pmatrix} K_0 & K_* \\\\\\\\\\\\ K_*^\\\\intercal & K_{**} \\\\end{pmatrix}) , where m_*=[m(x_1^*),...,m(x_s^*)]^\\\\intercal , (K_{**})_{ij}=k(x_i^*,x_j^*) , (K_*)_{ij}=k(x_i,x_j^*) . According to the equations above, the outputs y are also jointly distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian. Thus, [f(x_1^*),...f(x_s^*)]^\\\\intercal\\\\mid([y(x)]^\\\\intercal=y)\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(m_{post},K_{post}) , where y=[y_1,...,y_r]^\\\\intercal , m_{post}=m_*+K_*^\\\\intercal(K_O+\\\\sigma^2I_r)^{-1}(y-m_0) , K_{post}=K_{**}-K_*^\\\\intercal(K_O+\\\\sigma^2I_r)^{-1}K_* , and I_r is r\\\\times r identity matrix.  Wild bootstrap  The wild bootstrap, proposed originally by Wu (1986), is suited when the model exhibits heteroskedasticity. The idea is, like the residual bootstrap, to leave the regressors at their sample value, but to resample the response variable based on the residuals values. That is, for each replicate, one computes a new y based on :y^*_i = \\\\widehat{y\\\\,}_i + \\\\widehat{\\\\varepsilon\\\\,}_i v_i so the residuals are randomly multiplied by a random variable v_i with mean 0 and variance 1. For most distributions of v_i (but not Mammen's), this method assumes that the 'true' residual distribution is symmetric and can offer advantages over simple residual sampling for smaller sample sizes. Different forms are used for the random variable v_i, such as :*The standard normal distribution :*A distribution suggested by Mammen (1993). ::: v_i = \\\\begin{cases} -(\\\\sqrt{5} -1)/2 & \\\\text{with probability } (\\\\sqrt{5} +1)/(2\\\\sqrt{5}), \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\sqrt{5} +1)/2 & \\\\text{with probability } (\\\\sqrt{5} -1)/(2\\\\sqrt{5}) \\\\end{cases} ::Approximately, Mammen's distribution is: ::: v_i = \\\\begin{cases} -0.6180\\\\quad\\\\text{(with a 0 in the units' place)} & \\\\text{with probability } 0.7236, \\\\\\\\\\\\ +1.6180\\\\quad\\\\text{(with a 1 in the units' place)} & \\\\text{with probability } 0.2764. \\\\end{cases} :*Or the simpler distribution, linked to the Rademacher distribution: ::: v_i =\\\\begin{cases} -1 & \\\\text{with probability } 1/2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ +1 & \\\\text{with probability } 1/2. \\\\end{cases}  Block bootstrap  The block bootstrap is used when the data, or the errors in a model, are correlated. In this case, a simple case or residual resampling will fail, as it is not able to replicate the correlation in the data. The block bootstrap tries to replicate the correlation by resampling instead blocks of data. The block bootstrap has been used mainly with data correlated in time (i.e. time series) but can also be used with data correlated in space, or among groups (so-called cluster data).  Time series: Simple block bootstrap  In the (simple) block bootstrap, the variable of interest is split into non- overlapping blocks.  Time series: Moving block bootstrap  In the moving block bootstrap, introduced by Künsch (1989), data is split into n − b + 1 overlapping blocks of length b: Observation 1 to b will be block 1, observation 2 to b + 1 will be block 2, etc. Then from these n − b + 1 blocks, n/b blocks will be drawn at random with replacement. Then aligning these n/b blocks in the order they were picked, will give the bootstrap observations. This bootstrap works with dependent data, however, the bootstrapped observations will not be stationary anymore by construction. But, it was shown that varying randomly the block length can avoid this problem. This method is known as the stationary bootstrap. Other related modifications of the moving block bootstrap are the Markovian bootstrap and a stationary bootstrap method that matches subsequent blocks based on standard deviation matching.  Time series: Maximum entropy bootstrap  Vinod (2006), presents a method that bootstraps time series data using maximum entropy principles satisfying the Ergodic theorem with mean-preserving and mass-preserving constraints. There is an R package, meboot, that utilizes the method, which has applications in econometrics and computer science.  Cluster data: block bootstrap  Cluster data describes data where many observations per unit are observed. This could be observing many firms in many states, or observing students in many classes. In such cases, the correlation structure is simplified, and one does usually make the assumption that data is correlated within a group/cluster, but independent between groups/clusters. The structure of the block bootstrap is easily obtained (where the block just corresponds to the group), and usually only the groups are resampled, while the observations within the groups are left unchanged. Cameron et al. (2008) discusses this for clustered errors in linear regression.  Methods for improving computational efficiency  The bootstrap is a powerful technique although may require substantial computing resources in both time and memory. Some techniques have been developed to reduce this burden. They can generally be combined with many of the different types of Bootstrap schemes and various choices of statistic.  Poisson bootstrap  Graph showing the convergence of the Binomial Distribution to the Poisson as the Binomial parameters are n*p=1 and n grows The ordinary bootstrap requires the random selection of n elements from a list, which is equivalent to drawing from a multinomial distribution. This may require a large number of passes over the data and is challenging to run these computations in parallel. For large values of n, the Poisson bootstrap is an efficient method of generating bootstrapped data sets. When generating a single bootstrap sample, instead of randomly drawing from the sample data with replacement, each data point is assigned a random weight distributed according to the Poisson distribution with \\\\lambda=1. For large sample data, this will approximate random sampling with replacement. This is due to the following approximation: :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to \\\\infty} Binomial(n,1/n) = Poisson(1) This method also lends itself well to streaming data and growing data sets, since the total number of samples does not need to be known in advance of beginning to take bootstrap samples.  Bag of Little Bootstraps  For massive data sets, it is often computationally prohibitive to hold all the sample data in memory and resample from the sample data. The Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) provides a method of pre-aggregating data before bootstrapping to reduce computational constraints. This works by partitioning the data set into b equal sized buckets and aggregating the data within each bucket. This pre- aggregated data set becomes the new sample data over which to draw samples with replacement. This method is similar to the Block Bootstrap, but the motivations and definitions of the blocks are very different. Under certain assumptions, the sample distribution should approximate the full bootstrapped scenario. One constraint is the number of buckets b=n^\\\\gamma where \\\\gamma \\\\in [0.5, 1] and the authors recommend usage of b=n^{0.7} as a general solution.  Choice of statistic  The bootstrap distribution of a point estimator of a population parameter has been used to produce a bootstrapped confidence interval for the parameter's true value, if the parameter can be written as a function of the population's distribution. Population parameters are estimated with many point estimators. Popular families of point-estimators include mean- unbiased minimum-variance estimators, median-unbiased estimators, Bayesian estimators (for example, the posterior distribution's mode, median, mean), and maximum-likelihood estimators. A Bayesian point estimator and a maximum- likelihood estimator have good performance when the sample size is infinite, according to asymptotic theory. For practical problems with finite samples, other estimators may be preferable. Asymptotic theory suggests techniques that often improve the performance of bootstrapped estimators; the bootstrapping of a maximum-likelihood estimator may often be improved using transformations related to pivotal quantities.  Deriving confidence intervals from the bootstrap distribution  The bootstrap distribution of a parameter-estimator has been used to calculate confidence intervals for its population-parameter.  Bias, asymmetry, and confidence intervals  *Bias: The bootstrap distribution and the sample may disagree systematically, in which case bias may occur. *:If the bootstrap distribution of an estimator is symmetric, then percentile confidence-interval are often used; such intervals are appropriate especially for median-unbiased estimators of minimum risk (with respect to an absolute loss function). Bias in the bootstrap distribution will lead to bias in the confidence-interval. *:Otherwise, if the bootstrap distribution is non- symmetric, then percentile confidence-intervals are often inappropriate.  Methods for bootstrap confidence intervals  There are several methods for constructing confidence intervals from the bootstrap distribution of a real parameter: *Basic bootstrap, also known as the Reverse Percentile Interval. The basic bootstrap is a simple scheme to construct the confidence interval: one simply takes the empirical quantiles from the bootstrap distribution of the parameter (see Davison and Hinkley 1997, equ. 5.6 p. 194): :: (2\\\\widehat{\\\\theta\\\\,} -\\\\theta^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)},2\\\\widehat{\\\\theta\\\\,} -\\\\theta^{*}_{(\\\\alpha/2)}) where \\\\theta^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)} denotes the 1-\\\\alpha/2 percentile of the bootstrapped coefficients \\\\theta^{*} . *Percentile bootstrap. The percentile bootstrap proceeds in a similar way to the basic bootstrap, using percentiles of the bootstrap distribution, but with a different formula (note the inversion of the left and right quantiles!): :: (\\\\theta^{*}_{(\\\\alpha/2)},\\\\theta^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)}) where \\\\theta^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)} denotes the 1-\\\\alpha/2 percentile of the bootstrapped coefficients \\\\theta^{*} . :See Davison and Hinkley (1997, equ. 5.18 p. 203) and Efron and Tibshirani (1993, equ 13.5 p. 171). :This method can be applied to any statistic. It will work well in cases where the bootstrap distribution is symmetrical and centered on the observed statistic and where the sample statistic is median-unbiased and has maximum concentration (or minimum risk with respect to an absolute value loss function). When working with small sample sizes (i.e., less than 50), the basic / reversed percentile and percentile confidence intervals for (for example) the variance statistic will be too narrow. So that with a sample of 20 points, 90% confidence interval will include the true variance only 78% of the time. The basic / reverse percentile confidence intervals are easier to justify mathematically \\"Although this direct equation of quantiles of the bootstrap sampling distribution with confidence limits may seem initially appealing, it’s rationale is somewhat obscure.\\" but they are less accurate in general than percentile confidence intervals, and some authors discourage their use. *Studentized bootstrap. The studentized bootstrap, also called bootstrap-t, is computed analogously to the standard confidence interval, but replaces the quantiles from the normal or student approximation by the quantiles from the bootstrap distribution of the Student's t-test (see Davison and Hinkley 1997, equ. 5.7 p. 194 and Efron and Tibshirani 1993 equ 12.22, p. 160): :: (\\\\theta - t^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)}\\\\cdot \\\\widehat{\\\\text{se}}_\\\\theta,\\\\theta-t^{*}_{(\\\\alpha/2)}\\\\cdot \\\\widehat{\\\\text{se}}_\\\\theta) where t^{*}_{(1-\\\\alpha/2)} denotes the 1-\\\\alpha/2 percentile of the bootstrapped Student's t-test t^{*}=(\\\\widehat{\\\\theta\\\\,}^{*}-\\\\widehat{\\\\theta\\\\,})/\\\\widehat{\\\\text{se}}_{\\\\widehat{\\\\theta\\\\,}^*} , and \\\\widehat{\\\\text{se}}_\\\\theta is the estimated standard error of the coefficient in the original model. :The studentized test enjoys optimal properties as the statistic that is bootstrapped is pivotal (i.e. it does not depend on nuisance parameters as the t-test follows asymptotically a N(0,1) distribution), unlike the percentile bootstrap. *Bias-corrected bootstrap – adjusts for bias in the bootstrap distribution. *Accelerated bootstrap – The bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap, by Efron (1987), adjusts for both bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution. This approach is accurate in a wide variety of settings, has reasonable computation requirements, and produces reasonably narrow intervals.  Bootstrap hypothesis testing  Efron and Tibshirani suggest the following algorithm for comparing the means of two independent samples: Let x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n be a random sample from distribution F with sample mean \\\\bar{x} and sample variance \\\\sigma_x^2. Let y_1, \\\\ldots, y_m be another, independent random sample from distribution G with mean \\\\bar{y} and variance \\\\sigma_y^2 # Calculate the test statistic t = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x}-\\\\bar{y}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_x^2/n + \\\\sigma_y^2/m}} #Create two new data sets whose values are x_i^' = x_i - \\\\bar{x} + \\\\bar{z} and y_i^' = y_i - \\\\bar{y} + \\\\bar{z}, where \\\\bar{z} is the mean of the combined sample. # Draw a random sample ( x_i^* ) of size n with replacement from x_i^' and another random sample ( y_i^* ) of size m with replacement from y_i^' . # Calculate the test statistic t^* = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x^*}-\\\\bar{y^*}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_x^{*2}/n + \\\\sigma_y^{*2}/m}} #Repeat 3 and 4 B times (e.g. B=1000) to collect B values of the test statistic. # Estimate the p-value as p = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^B I\\\\\\\\{t_i^* \\\\geq t\\\\\\\\}}{B} where I(\\\\text{condition}) = 1 when condition is true and 0 otherwise.  Example applications   Smoothed bootstrap  In 1878, Simon Newcomb took observations on the speed of light.Data from examples in Bayesian Data Analysis The data set contains two outliers, which greatly influence the sample mean. (The sample mean need not be a consistent estimator for any population mean, because no mean need exist for a heavy-tailed distribution.) A well-defined and robust statistic for central tendency is the sample median, which is consistent and median-unbiased for the population median. The bootstrap distribution for Newcomb's data appears below. A convolution method of regularization reduces the discreteness of the bootstrap distribution by adding a small amount of N(0, σ2) random noise to each bootstrap sample. A conventional choice is \\\\sigma = 1/\\\\sqrt n for sample size n. Histograms of the bootstrap distribution and the smooth bootstrap distribution appear below. The bootstrap distribution of the sample-median has only a small number of values. The smoothed bootstrap distribution has a richer support. File:MedianHists.png In this example, the bootstrapped 95% (percentile) confidence-interval for the population median is (26, 28.5), which is close to the interval for (25.98, 28.46) for the smoothed bootstrap.  Relation to other approaches to inference   Relationship to other resampling methods  The bootstrap is distinguished from: * the jackknife procedure, used to estimate biases of sample statistics and to estimate variances, and * cross-validation, in which the parameters (e.g., regression weights, factor loadings) that are estimated in one subsample are applied to another subsample. For more details see bootstrap resampling. Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is a meta-algorithm based on averaging the results of multiple bootstrap samples.  U-statistics  In situations where an obvious statistic can be devised to measure a required characteristic using only a small number, r, of data items, a corresponding statistic based on the entire sample can be formulated. Given an r-sample statistic, one can create an n-sample statistic by something similar to bootstrapping (taking the average of the statistic over all subsamples of size r). This procedure is known to have certain good properties and the result is a U-statistic. The sample mean and sample variance are of this form, for r = 1 and r = 2\\\\.

This generally relies upon the problem having some special form or symmetry. In this way, the PDE can be solved by solving a set of simpler PDEs, or even ordinary differential equations (ODEs) if the problem can be broken down into one-dimensional equations. The most common form of separation of variables is simple separation of variables in which a solution is obtained by assuming a solution of the form given by a product of functions of each individual coordinate. There is a special form of separation of variables called R-separation of variables which is accomplished by writing the solution as a particular fixed function of the coordinates multiplied by a product of functions of each individual coordinate. Laplace's equation on {\\\\mathbb R}^n is an example of a partial differential equation which admits solutions through R-separation of variables; in the three-dimensional case this uses 6-sphere coordinates. (This should not be confused with the case of a separable ODE, which refers to a somewhat different class of problems that can be broken into a pair of integrals; see separation of variables.)  Example  For example, consider the time-independent Schrödinger equation :[- abla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{x})]\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}) = E\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}) for the function \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}) (in dimensionless units, for simplicity).

If the function V(\\\\mathbf{x}) in three dimensions is of the form :V(x_1,x_2,x_3) = V_1(x_1) + V_2(x_2) + V_3(x_3), then it turns out that the problem can be separated into three one- dimensional ODEs for functions \\\\psi_1(x_1), \\\\psi_2(x_2), and \\\\psi_3(x_3), and the final solution can be written as \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\psi_1(x_1) \\\\cdot \\\\psi_2(x_2) \\\\cdot \\\\psi_3(x_3).

There are a variety of views about what constitutes mobile equipment. For US licensing purposes, mobiles may include hand-carried, (sometimes called portable), equipment. An obsolete term is radiophone.Cited in many references including on escutcheons and silk-screened face plates on 1960s Motorola products including early HT-200 and Dispatcher-series mobiles. Later HT-200s dropped the term.It was also seen on some Kaar Engineering mobile products. One example is the title on a special products service manual Model T31BAT-3100B-SP3 'Dispatcher' Radiophone 25-54 MC 12 W RF Power 12 VDC, State of California Radio Communications System, (Chicago: Motorola Communications Division, 1965).The Oxford English Dictionary conflicts with some uses, saying radiophone is interchangeable with radiotelephone.The 11th edition of Newton's Telecom Dictionary says radiophone is an, \\"obsolete term.\\" A sales person or radio repair shop would understand the word mobile to mean vehicle-mounted: a transmitter-receiver (transceiver) used for radio communications from a vehicle. Mobile radios are mounted to a motor vehicle usually with the microphone and control panel in reach of the driver. In the US, such a device is typically powered by the host vehicle's 12 Volt electrical system. Some mobile radios are mounted in aircraft (aeronautical mobile), shipboard (maritime mobile), on motorcycles, or railroad locomotives. Power may vary with each platform. For example, a mobile radio installed in a locomotive would run off of 72 or 30 Volt DC power. A large ship with 117 V AC power might have a base station mounted on the ship's bridge. Nomenclature: Two- way versus telephone The distinction between radiotelephones and two-way radio is becoming blurred as the two technologies merge. The backbone or infrastructure supporting the system defines which category or taxonomy applies. A parallel to this concept is the convergence of computing and telephones. Radiotelephones are full-duplex (simultaneous talk and listen), circuit switched, and primarily communicate with telephones connected to the public switched telephone network. The connection sets up based on the user dialing. The connection is taken down when the end button is pressed. They run on telephony-based infrastructure such as AMPS or GSM. Two-way radio is primarily a dispatch tool intended to communicate in simplex or half-duplex modes using push-to-talk, and primarily intended to communicate with other radios rather than telephones. These systems run on push-to-talk-based infrastructure such as Nextel's iDEN, Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR), MPT-1327, Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) or conventional two-way systems. Certain modern two-way radio systems may have full-duplex telephone capability. History Early users of mobile radio equipment included transportation and government. These systems used one-way broadcasting instead of two-way conversations. Railroads used medium frequency range (MF) communications (similar to the AM broadcast band) to improve safety. Instead of hanging out of a locomotive cab and grabbing train orders while rolling past a station, voice communications with rolling trains became possible. Radios linked the caboose with the locomotive cab. Early police radio systems were initially one way using MF frequencies above the AM broadcast band, (1.7 MHz). Some early systems talked back to dispatch on a 30-50 MHz link, (called crossband). Early mobile radios used amplitude modulation (AM) to convey intelligence through the communications channel. In time, problems with sources of electrical noise showed that frequency modulation (FM) was superior for its ability to cope with vehicle ignition and power line noise. The frequency range used by most early radio systems, 25–50 MHz (vhf \\"low band\\") is particularly susceptible to the problem of electrical noise. This plus the need for more channels led to the eventual expansion of two-way radio communications into the VHF \\"high band\\" (150–174 MHz) and UHF (450–470 MHz). The UHF band has since been expanded again. One of the major challenges in early mobile radio technology was that of converting the six or twelve volt power supply of the vehicle to the high voltage needed to operate the vacuum tubes in the radio. Early tube-type radios used dynamotors - essentially a six or twelve volt motor that turned a generator to provide the high voltages required by the vacuum tubes. Some early mobile radios were the size of a suitcase or had separate boxes for the transmitter and receiver. As time went on, power supply technology evolved to use first electromechanical vibrators, then solid-state power supplies to provide high voltage for the vacuum tubes. These circuits, called \\"inverters\\", changed the 6 or 12 V direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) which could be passed through a transformer to make high voltage. The power supply then rectified this high voltage to make the high voltage DC required for the vacuum tubes, (called valves in British English). The power supplies needed to power vacuum tube radios resulted in a common trait of tube-type mobile radios: their heavy weight due to the iron- core transformers in the power supplies. These high voltage power supplies were inefficient, and the filaments of the vacuum tubes added to current demands, taxing vehicle electrical systems. Sometimes, a generator or alternator upgrade was needed to support the current required for a tube-type mobile radio. Examples of US 1950s-1960s tube-type mobile radios with no transistors: * Motorola FMTRU-140D (dynamotor powered) * Motorola Twin-V, named for its \\"universal\\" 6 or 12 Volt power supply * General Electric Progress Line (Early models without \\"T-Power\\" power supply) * Kaar Engineering Model 501 Equipment from different US manufacturers had similar traits. This was partly dictated by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The requirement that unauthorized persons be prohibited from using the radio transmitter meant that many radios were wired so they could not transmit unless the vehicle ignition was on. Persons without a key to the vehicle could not transmit. Equipment had to be \\"type accepted\\", or technically approved, by the FCC before it could be offered for sale. In order to be type accepted, the radio set had to be equipped with an indicator light, usually green or yellow, that showed power was applied and the radio was ready to transmit. Radios were also required to have a lamp (usually red) indicating when the transmitter was on. These traits continue in the design of modern radios. Early tube-type radios operated on 50 kHz channel spacing with ±15 kHz modulation deviation. This meant that the number of radio channels that could be accommodated in the available radio frequency spectrum were limited to a certain number, dictated by the bandwidth of the signal on each channel. In the early 1970s, the California Department of Forestry requirement for 6 frequency transmit, 3 frequency receive, scanning, and a 5 tone burst encoder was unusual, leading to this custom-built mobile radio. Solid-state electronic equipment arrived in the 1960s, with more efficient circuitry and smaller size. Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) provided a practical and economic solution for radio technology, and was used in mobile radio systems by the early 1970s. Channel spacing narrowed to 20–30 kHz with modulation deviation dropping to ±5 kHz. This was done to allow more radio spectrum availability to accommodate the rapidly growing national group of two-way radio users. By the mid-1970s, tube-type transmitter power amplifiers had been replaced with high-power transistors. From the 1960s to the 1980s, large system users with specialized requirements often had custom built radios designed for their unique systems. Systems with multiple-CTCSS tone encoders and more than two channels were unusual. Manufacturers of mobile radios built customized equipment for large radio fleets such as the California Department of Forestry and the California Highway Patrol. Examples of US hybrid partially solid state mobile radios: * Motorola Motrac * Motorola MJ IMTS Car Telephone (1963) * General Electric Transistorized Progress Line * General Electric MASTR Professional and MASTR Executive * RCA Super Carfone Today Custom design for a particular customer is a thing of the past. Modern mobile radio equipment is \\"feature rich\\". A mobile radio may have 100 or more channels, be microprocessor controlled and have built-in options such as unit ID. A computer and software is typically required to program the features and channels of the mobile radio. Menus of options may be several levels deep and offer a complicated array of possibilities. Some mobile radios have alphanumeric displays that translate channel numbers (F1, F2) to a phrase more meaningful to the user, such as \\"Providence Base\\", \\"Boston Base\\", etc. Radios are now designed with a myriad of features to preclude the need for custom design. Examples of US microprocessor-controlled mobile radios: * Motorola Astro Digital Spectra W9 * Kenwood TK-690 * PositionPTT mobile-radio-m94g As use of mobile radio equipment has virtually exploded, channel spacing has had to be narrowed again to 12.5–15 kHz with modulation deviation dropped to ±2.5 kilohertz. In order to fit into smaller, more economical vehicles, today's radios are trending toward radically smaller sizes than their tube-type ancestors. The traditional analogue radio communications have been surpassed by digital radio voice communications capabilities that provide greater clarity of transmission, enable security features such as encryption and, within the network, allow low band data transmissions to accommodate simple text or picture messaging as an example. (Examples: Project 25(APCO-25), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), DMR.) Details Commercial and professional mobile radios are often purchased from an equipment supplier or dealer whose staff will install the equipment into the user's vehicles. Large fleet users may buy radios directly from an equipment manufacturer and may even employ their own technical staff for installation and maintenance. A modern mobile radio consists of a radio transceiver, housed in a single box, and a microphone with a push-to-talk button. Each installation would also have a vehicle-mounted antenna connected to the transceiver by a coaxial cable. Some models may have an external, separate speaker which can be positioned and oriented facing the driver to overcome ambient road noise present when driving. The installer would have to locate this equipment in a way that does not interfere with the vehicle's sun roof, electronic engine management system, vehicle stability computer, or air bags. Mobile radios installed on motorcycles are subject to extreme vibration and weather. Professional equipment designed for use on motorcycles is weather and vibration resistant. Shock mounting systems are used to reduce the radio's exposure to vibration imparted by the motorcycle's modal, or resonant, shaking. Some mobile radios use noise-canceling microphones or headsets. At speeds over 100 MPH, the ambient road and wind noise can make radio communications difficult to understand. For example, California Highway Patrol mobile radios have noise-canceling microphones which reduce road and siren noise heard by the dispatcher. Most fire engines and radios in heavy equipment use noise-canceling headsets. These protect the occupant's hearing and reduce background noise in the transmitted audio. Noise-canceling microphones require the operator speak directly into the front of the microphone. Hole arrays in the back of the microphone pick up ambient noise. This is applied, out-of-phase, to the back of the microphone, effectively reducing or canceling any sound which is present both in front and back of the microphone. Ideally, only the voice present on the front side of the microphone goes out on the air. Many radios are equipped with transmitter time-out timers which limit the length of a transmission. A bane of push-to- talk systems is the stuck microphone: A radio locked on transmit, which disrupts communications on a two-way radio system. One example of this problem occurred in a car with a concealed two-way radio installation where the microphone and coiled cord were hidden inside the glove box. An operator tossed the mike into the glove box and shut it, causing the push-to-talk button to be depressed and locking the transmitter on. On taxi systems, a driver may be upset when a dispatcher assigns a call (s)he wanted to another driver and may deliberately hold the transmit button down (for which the owner can be fined by the FCC). Radios with time-out timers transmit for the preset amount of time, usually 30–60 seconds, after which the transmitter automatically turns off and a loud tone comes out of the radio speaker. The volume level of the tone on some radios is loud and cannot be adjusted. As soon as the push-to-talk button is released, the tone stops and the timer resets. Mobile radio equipment is manufactured to specifications developed by the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA). These specifications have been developed to help assure the user that mobile radio equipment performs as expected and to prevent the sale and distribution of inferior equipment which could degrade communications. Antenna A mobile radio must have an associated antenna. The most common antennas are stainless steel wire or rod whips which protrude vertically from the vehicle. Physics defines the antenna length: length relates to frequency and cannot be arbitrarily lengthened or shortened (more likely) by the end user. The standard \\"quarter wave\\" antenna in the 25-50 MHz range can be over nine feet long. A 900 MHz antenna may be three inches long for a quarter wavelength. A transit bus may have a ruggedized antenna, which looks like a white plastic blade or fin, on its roof. Some vehicles with concealed radio installations have antennas designed to look like the original AM/FM antenna, a rearview mirror, or may be installed inside windows, or hidden on the floor pan or underside of a vehicle. Aircraft antennas look like blades or fins, the size and shape being determined by frequencies used. Microwave antennas may look like flat panels on the aircraft's skin. Temporary installations may have antennas which clip on to vehicle parts or are attached to steel body parts by a strong magnet. Though initially relatively inexpensive mobile radio system components, frequently damaged antennas can be costly to replace since they are usually not included in maintenance contracts for mobile radio fleets. Some types of vehicles in 24-hour use, with stiff suspensions, tall heights, or rough diesel engine idle vibrations may damage antennas quickly. The location and type of antenna can affect system performance drastically. Large fleets usually test a few vehicles before making a commitment to a certain antenna location or type. U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines for non-ionizing radio energy generally say the radio antenna must be two feet from any vehicle occupants. (Read the OSHA guidelines before attempting to install an antenna.) This rule of thumb is intended to result in passengers being exposed to safe levels of radio frequency energy in the event the radio transmits. Multiple radio sets Dispatch-reliant services, such as tow cars or ambulances, may have several radios in each vehicle. For example, tow cars may have one radio for towing company communications and a second for emergency road service communications. Ambulances may have a similar arrangement with one radio for government emergency medical services dispatch and one for company dispatch. Multiple controls, microphones A mobile radio in a US ambulance often has two sets of controls: one in the patient area and another near the driver.US ambulances often have radios with dual controls and dual microphones allowing the radio to be used from the patient care area in the rear or from the vehicle's cab. Data radio Both tow cars and ambulances may have an additional radio which transmits and receives to support a mobile data terminal. A data terminal radio allows data communications to take place over the separate radio. In the same way that a facsimile machine has a separate phone line, this means data and voice communication can take place simultaneously over a separate radio. Early Federal Express (FedEx) radio systems used a single radio for data and voice. The radio had a request-to-speak button which, when acknowledged, allowed voice communication to the dispatch center. Each radio works over a single band of frequencies. If a tow car company had a frequency on the same band as its auto club, a single radio with scanning might be employed for both systems. Since a mobile radio typically works on a single frequency band, multiple radios may be required in cases where communications take place over systems on more than one frequency band. Walkie talkie converters in place of mobile radios Intended as a cost savings, some systems employ vehicular chargers instead of a mobile radio. Each radio user is issued a walkie talkie. Each vehicle is equipped with a charger system console. The walkie talkie inserted into a vehicular charger or converter while the user is in the vehicle. The charger or converter (1) connects the walkie talkie to the vehicle's two-way radio antenna, (2) connects an amplified speaker, (3) connects a mobile microphone, and (4) charges the walkie talkie's battery.For example, Motorola has trademarked the name Converta-Com for a system which accomplishes all three of these tasks. Some Converta-Com systems allow the attachment of signaling devices or external devices not usually compatible with walkie talkies. One historic example is the NLN-4470A for MT-500 series radios. The weak point of these systems has been connector technology which has been proven unreliable in some installations. Receiver performance is a problem in congested radio signal and urban areas. These installations are sometimes referred to as jerk-and-run systems.

The rule, in a criminal prosecution for conspiracy, was that the court, in deciding whether to allow the jury to consider a statement of conspiracy, cannot hear the statement itself: the allegation had to be supported by independent evidence. If the independent evidence convinced the court that a conspiracy probably existed, only then such a statement could be introduced into trial and heard by the jury. Allowing such statements of conspiracy to prove the existence of conspiracy was considered similar to bootstrapping. In the United States, the bootstrapping rule has been eliminated from the Federal Rules of Evidence, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Bourjaily case. For example, if a person is charged with four crimes, unless the evidence is connectable to each crime, each piece of evidence can be used only in each separate crime and not to link any crime to another.

She is named after Aldebaran, a star of the first magnitude in the constellation Taurus. Construction and commercial service Originally the SS Stag Hound was laid down on 28 November 1938 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. under a United States Maritime Commission (MC) contract (MC hull 27, Yard hull 374); launched on 21 June 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Martha Macy Hill; and delivered to the on 4 December 1939. The ship was one of three C-2 type ships, all named for famous American sailing ships, purchased or chartered by Grace Lines for service between United States Pacific coast ports and the west coast of South America. Stag Hound was the first of the three, Red Jacket and Flying Cloud to follow, for Grace and the first of the type to arrive on the West Coast arriving at San Francisco on 9 April and delivered by the MC to Grace Lines on 19 April 1940. In commercial configuration the ship was , Navy shows 13,910 ton displacement, , length overall, length between perpendiculars, beam with loaded draft of . The ship had refrigerated capacity in addition to regular cargo capacity. Power was furnished by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving a Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. trubine through a Westinghouse double reduction gear set. A single four-bladed propeller, in diameter, provided a loaded sea speed of . Navy acquisition The cargo ship served with Grace Lines for a year before the Navy purchased her on 22 December 1940. Renamed Aldebaran, classified a stores ship, and designated AF-10, she was placed in commission, in ordinary, on 26 December 1940. Comdr. Royal Abbott assumed command on 10 January 1941, and Aldebaran was placed in full commission at San Francisco on 14 January 1941. History World War II The stores ship embarked upon her first Navy mission on 26 January, departing from San Francisco on a round-trip voyage via Pearl Harbor to Pago Pago, Samoa. Following her maiden mission for the Navy, Aldebaran remained at San Francisco until 29 March when she put to sea with a cargo bound for Hawaii. The ship made a seven-day layover at Pearl Harbor between 5 and 12 April and returned to San Francisco on the 18th. Upon her arrival back on the west coast, she entered a civilian drydock at Oakland, California, to begin conversion to a fleet provisioning ship. Major modifications were completed by 21 October, and finishing touches were added over the next three weeks. On 14 November, Aldebaran departed San Francisco on her way to San Diego. Following a three-day stay at that port between 16 and 19 November, she got underway for Hawaii. The ship discharged cargo at Pearl Harbor during the last six days of November and, after an overnight stop at Maui, headed back to the west coast on 1 December. Aldebaran arrived at San Francisco on the 6th. On the following morning, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and plunged the United States into World War II. The ship embarked upon her first wartime voyage on 17 December. Over the next six months, Aldebaran completed four round-trip runs carrying provisions and passengers between San Francisco and Hawaii. She concluded the fourth of those Pearl Harbor shuttle assignments at San Francisco on 6 June 1942. Her next assignment took the ship beyond Hawaii to the South Pacific. She stood out of San Francisco on 23 June, stopped at Pearl Harbor early in July, and then spent the remainder of the summer of 1942 making calls at ports on the South Pacific circuit. Aldebaran visited Samoa, Tongatapu, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo before returning to San Francisco on 23 September. That first wartime series of port calls in the South Pacific established a pattern of operations for her that endured through the next 20 months. Aldebaran loaded cargo at San Francisco and then embarked upon long, circuitous voyages that took her back to New Caledonia, Samoa, and Espiritu Santo. In May 1944, during the run back to the west coast from Espiritu Santo, Aldebaran was diverted to Hawaii to load cargo bound for the Central Pacific. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 24 May, took on her cargo, and returned to sea on the 29th. The ship entered Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 5 June and spent six days issuing fresh and frozen provisions to ships about to assault the Mariana Islands. She headed back to Pearl Harbor on 12 June and stood into that port on the 18th. Aldebaran spent the next nine months carrying provisions to ships at forward bases in the Marshalls and Carolines. Her most frequent ports of call were Eniwetok in the Marshalls and Ulithi in the Carolines; however, she made one visit each to Kwajalein in the Marshalls, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, and Guam in the Marianas. At the conclusion of each supply mission, she returned to either Pearl Harbor or San Francisco to load additional cargo. On 29 March 1945, Aldebaran arrived in San Francisco to complete the last of her resupply missions to ships in the anchorages in the Central Pacific atolls. On 10 April, she departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor where she spent the period 16 to 21 April fitting out for a new mission, replenishing the fast carriers and their screens at sea. Aldebaran stood out of Pearl Harbor on the 21st and arrived in Ulithi on 2 May. There, she reported for duty with Task Unit (TU) 50.8.5, part of the underway replenishment group. She departed Ulithi in company with TU 50.8.5 on May and joined the rest of Task Group (TG) 50.8 at sea. The stores ship spent about five weeks at sea replenishing the warships engaged in the Okinawa campaign before putting in at Guam on 13 June to reload. For the remaining two months of hostilities, Aldebaran provided logistics support for the carrier task groups making air strikes on the Japanese home islands, returning periodically to either Guam or Ulithi to restock her larder. Cold War Hostilities ceased on 15 August 1945, but Aldebaran continued replenishment-at-sea operations during the initial stages of the occupation of Japan. She was present to Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 when Japanese officials signed the surrender document on board Missouri (BB-63). For the remainder of 1945, Aldebaran provided logistics support for forces occupying Japan and her former conquests. On 17 January 1946, the stores ship departed Taku, China, on her way back to the United States. She arrived in Seattle, Washington, on 31 January and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard a week later for a two-month repair period. Aldebaran returned to Seattle on 6 April and began preparations for her last voyage to the Far East. On 22 April, she put to sea bound for Japan. The ship reached Yokosuka on 8 May and, from there, continued on to Tsingtao, China, and Okinawa. On 15 June, Aldebaran departed Okinawa to return to the United States. Her ultimate destination was the east coast. After a stop at San Pedro, California, she resumed her voyage, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived at Bayonne, New Jersey, on 18 July. After a voyage to North Africa and western Europe in August and September, Aldebaran settled into a routine of operations along the east coast punctuated by voyages to the West Indies to provide logistics support to bases and ships in that region and to participate in exercises. Such pursuits occupied her time for almost 19 months, until the beginning of June 1948. On the 4th, she stood out of Chesapeake Bay to embark upon the first of many missions to the Mediterranean Sea. USS Aldebaran (AF-10) in 1960. For the next two decades, Aldebaran alternated between assignments to the Mediterranean Sea and operations in the western Atlantic. Unlike most other ships attached to the 6th Fleet, she did not normally serve extended periods of time in the Mediterranean. Instead, her cruises tended to be about six to ten weeks in duration, and she generally made two or three of them a year. She would remain in the Mediterranean as long as she retained a sufficient stock of provisions for issue. When those stocks began to run low, Aldebaran. returned to the United States. Turnaround time at home varied. Scheduled overhauls meant extended periods in the United States. In addition, other resupply missions, such as to forces operating in the West Indies, replaced voyages to the Mediterranean on her schedule. Occasional interludes in northern European waters also varied Aldebaran's itinerary. Twice during her postwar career, Aldebaran participated in operations for which she received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. During the summer of 1958, the United States landed marines in Lebanon to help restore domestic order in that country. The stores ship got underway from Norfolk just four days after the landings to provide logistics services to the ships supporting those troops. Four years later, in the fall of 1962, President John F. Kennedy surrounded the island of Cuba with a cordon of warships to stop the flow of Soviet missiles to that island and to force the removal of those already in place. Aldebaran's at-sea replenishment capabilities helped those ships maintain a constant vigil thereby contributing to the successful conclusion of the matter. Aldebaran continued her active service to United States naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea and in the West Indies until mid-1968. On 28 June 1968, she was placed out of commission at Norfolk. Four months later, on 29 October, Aldebaran was transferred to the Maritime Administration to be berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia. That transfer was made permanent on 30 June 1969. Aldebaran's name was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1973, and she was sold on 14 November 1974 to Andy International, Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping.

It was published in 1984 and written by then-Time Magazine reporter Michael Moritz. While Jobs initially cooperated with Moritz, he ended communication in the middle of the project and did not authorize the published final version. Moritz reissued an updated version of the book in 2009 as Return to the Little Kingdom: Steve Jobs, the Creation of Apple, and How It Changed the World. Steve Jobs contracted Moritz in the early 1980s to document the development of the Macintosh for a book he was writing about Apple. According to Andy Hertzfeld, Jobs stated that \\"Mike's going to be our historian,\\" a comment made in response to the fact that a year early a history had been written about another computer company. As he was close in age to many on the development team, he seemed to be a good choice. By late 1982, Moritz was Time Magazine's San Francisco Bureau Chief and working on the special Time Person of the Year issue. His work on that issue (which was initially supposed to be about Jobs) included a lengthy interview with Jobs' high school girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, in which she discussed the history of their child, Lisa. Moritz's follow up interview with Jobs on the subject led to denial of paternity on his part. The issue also contained negative commentary on Jobs from other Apple employees. The special issue was later renamed Machine of the Year prior to publication,Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in.

It is a machine: the computer.\\" Jobs cut off all ties with Moritz after the issue was published and threatened to fire anyone who communicated with him. According to Hertzfeld, \\"some of us talked with Mike again surreptitiously, as he was putting the finishing touches on his book around the time of the Mac introduction\\" and the resulting text, The Little Kingdom, \\"remains one of the best books about Apple Computer ever written.\\"Cocks Jay.

Steve made no secret of his anger and left a torrent of messages on the answering machine I kept in my converted earthquake cottage at the foot of San Francisco’s Potrero Hill. He, understandably, banished me from Apple and forbade anyone in his orbit to talk to me. The experience made me decide that I would never again work anywhere I could not exert a large amount of control over my own destiny or where I would be paid by the word.

History Rasshua was inhabited by the Ainu, at the time of European contact, and the remains of over 40 dwellings have been discovered. The island appears on an official map showing the territories of Matsumae Domain, a feudal domain of Edo period Japan dated 1644, and these holdings were officially confirmed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1715. Subsequently, claimed by the Empire of Russia, sovereignty initially passed to Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Shimoda, but was returned to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg along with the rest of the Kuril islands. At this time, the remaining Ainu inhabitants (eight families) were forcibly relocated to Shikotan, and the island became uninhabited. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushiru District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō. After World War II, the island came under the control of the Soviet Union, and is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation.

Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case that was argued on January 11, 1978 and decided on May 1, 1978.Floyd Abrams, Speaking Freely, published by Viking Press, Page 65. The court reversed a lower court's conviction of the publisher of Norfolk's The Virginian-Pilot for illegal disclosure of confidential proceedings before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission about a judge's misconduct.Landmark Communications v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978). Background Floyd Abrams represented Landmark Communications, which owned The Virginian-Pilot. The Pilot had reported on October 4, 1975, that Judge H. Warrington Sharp, who sat on the Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, was under an investigation by a judicial fitness panel. They were deciding whether or not to begin disciplinary proceedings against Sharp. Under Virginia statute, each complaint against a judge was to be reviewed in secret; it would be announced only if it deemed serious enough to require a public hearing. All states had confidentiality requirements to avoid use of the disciplinary inquiry as retribution against a judge, but only Virginia and Hawaii provided for criminal penalties for disclosure. There was a quick trial and conviction of the publisher of a misdemeanor and a $500, fine plus the costs of prosecution. Landmark appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which affirmed the conviction by 6–1. The court concluded that the \\"requirement of confidentiality in Commission proceedings\\" served three purposes: # protection of the judge's reputation; # protection of public confidence in the judicial system; and # protection of complainants and witnesses from possible recriminations. Arguments Abrams wrote that his primary argument was straightforward: the newspaper published a true account and had obtained the information legally, and the alleged offense was simply reporting a complaint about how a public official performed his civic role. In his brief, Abrams argued that the case raised \\"anew a question which penetrates to the core of our concept of self-government: whether the press may be punished for printing the truth about a public official with his public duties.\\" In his memoir Speaking Freely, Abrams stated that it was the first case he argued by himself before the Supreme Court. He continued that he devoted most of their preparation for the case with three overlapping issues, \\"ones that have consumed my attention in every later Supreme Court argument as well.\\" The first was jurisprudential: what rule of law would they urge the Court to adopt? What would be its effect as stare decisis and its impact on the First Amendment. The second was tactical. Justices are known for taking up the 30 minutes of allotted argument time with question-and-answer sessions. Abrams felt he needed to figure out his core message. The Third question was what the court might ask that would be exceptionally difficult to respond to, and what should such responses be? Assistant Attorney General James Kulp defended the Virginia Supreme Court opinion with the above-mentioned three reasons for the statute. Justice Byron White questioned Kulp about whether the case was really about not criticizing public officials, a constitutional right, and whether he would defend a statute calling for confidentiality for protection of the judge. \\"No, sir,\\" responded Kulp. \\"I think the cases from this Court have been clear in that respect, that, in other words, a judge, as any public official, may certainly be criticized, the administration of justice may be criticized, and we don't have any argument about that.\\" White said if that was so, his arguments about protection the judiciary and the system held no weight. Kulp agreed. Virginia's time before the Court dealt with the scope of the statute. Abrams declined his rebuttal time, as he was confident in Landmark's victory. \\"During one exchange, Justice William Rehnquist asked a question for which Mr. Abrams said he was \\"totally unprepared,\\" but Justice Potter Stewart came to his rescue. Of all the justices, Mr. Abrams found Justice Byron R. White the most unnerving. White \\"invariably asked questions that were both pointed and powerful,\\" he recalls, and Mr. Abrams never once \\"had the sense that anything I said pleased him.\\" He confides that during oral argument he often felt like a mouse with \\"a tormenting cat.\\" Nonetheless, he won a unanimous victory.\\" \\"It had been quite an introduction for me to arguing for a complete thirty minutes in the Supreme Court: fifty-four judicial questions and comments. Years later, when I saw Albert Brooks play a television journalist in Broadcast News who perspired so much when on the air that his shirt looked like he had just returned from a swim, I wondered if I had presented the same appearance after my Landmark argument.\\" Decision The Court held unanimously in favor of Landmark. Chief Justice Burger wrote the opinion for himself and the other five members (Justices Brennan and Powell recused themselves). The Court did not adopt Abrams's categorical approach (all truth reporting in reference to public duties was insulated from criminal sanctions by the First Amendment). However, the Court rejected the argument that these interests were sufficient grounds for criminal sanctions on nonparticipants in proceedings. In its conclusion, the Court wrote: \\"the [clear and present danger] test requires a court to make its own inquiry into the imminence and magnitude of the danger said to flow from the particular utterance and then to balance the character of the evil as well as its likelihood against the need for free and unfettered expression.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 435 References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:United States Free Speech Clause case law Category:History of mass media in the United States Category:1978 in United States case law Category:Legal history of Virginia Category:History of Norfolk, Virginia Category:Judicial misconduct ","title":"Landmark Communications, Inc. v.

They were influenced by jazz, hardcore punk, speed metal and country music. They were one of the most prominent Alberta bands in the second wave of performers that came out of the Canadian west coast DIY scene that was first ushered into Alberta by the iconic hardcore punk band SNFU in the mid-1980s. Overview Formed in 1989, the band featured original members Derek Bevans and \\"Carigh\\" Brown until 1990. Later on, the line-up consistently included vocalist Mike Caldwell and bassist Corb Lund from the town of Taber, Alberta, guitarist Dug Bevans from Leduc, Alberta and drummer Terry Johnson from the northern Alberta town of La Glace. The four met while attending Grant MacEwan College in Edmonton, where Caldwell, Lund and Johnson were taking classes in music, and Bevans was taking art courses. The band showed unusual technical ability right from its inception, and was known for the buzzing speed guitar attack of Dug Bevans and arching vocal style of lead singer Mike Caldwell, whose wide vocal range is well showcased in the band's cover of Natural Woman as it appeared on their last release, My Dear Little Angle. Caldwell was known for his considerable vocal skills as well as his unassuming stage manner and refusal to banter with audiences. Corb Lund is more recently known for his work with his roots and country project Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans. The band was probably best categorized as a hard rock or metal band, but because of its association with the DIY punk rock scene of the 1980s and 1990s, the band never shook the punk rock label. In spite of this label, every album featured a straight jazz number or faithful covers of rock standards such as Middle of the Road (Pretenders, Chrissie Hynde) and songs featuring a variety of styles including country, swing and salsa style jazz breaks, that were embedded in the band's signature hard rock/metal sound. Near the end of their career Corb Lund had this to say about the band's eclectic style: :\\"We’ve outlived a bunch of different scenes that people have tried to lump us into, but we’ve never seen ourselves as part of a ‘scene;’ we’ve never been really into the punk scene, or the speed-metal scene, or the rap-metal scene. People just try to fit us into whatever music happens to be playing at the time, but we’ve never really paid too much attention to that.\\" Career highlights The band sold over 40,000 albums over twelve years and built \\"a rabid fan base, particularly in western Canada\\", almost entirely independent of any label or industry support. They were friends with and toured Quebec several times with GrimSkunk. In western Canada the Smalls' high energy shows made the band a touring success and could be counted on to fill large halls when headlining at venues such as Vancouver's legendary Commodore Ballroom, but were also known for extensive touring in outlying areas—In Kamloops, British Columbia they were banned from performing after a riot that took place after a promoter severely overfilled a small venue and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police attempted to clear the hall.CBC Radio :\\"The Smalls - these guys tore up the underground scene for years 90's and sadly never got their just due. These guys were notorious for starting riots, not because they were instigators (they were all pretty passive and shy guys), but because their music was so high energy people would loose [sic] their minds. As a matter of factly the last time I saw them as we were leaving cause things were right out of control the riot squad was showing up to gain some order.\\" In 1999,the Smalls became the first Canadian act to perform in the Balkans after conflict engulfed the area in the mid-nineties. Bassist Corb Lund said, \\"Not many North American bands reach these places. We think it's as important to play in these areas because it's a good opportunity for real cultural exchange.\\" In 2001, the band announced that it was disbanding and finished its career with a farewell tour with a two-night send-off in Calgary on October 19, 2001 at MacEwan Hall, and Edmonton on October 20, 2001 at Red's. Recording history The Smalls garnered significant industry interest at the beginning of their career with the release of their first self-produced recording the smalls in 1990. The band soon became associated with S.L. Feldman & Associates, a major Canadian touring and management agency. Their second album To Each a Zone (1992) was produced by noted Vancouver punk rock producer Cecil English, who was very often an engineer and sometimes producer on records by NoMeansNo (The Day Everything Became Isolated and Destroyed) and DOA (Win The Battle) -- including a collaboration between Jello Biafra and DOA (Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors). Videos for the singles Payload and On the Warpath from To Each a Zone went into steady rotation on MuchMusic. Their first recording the smalls was remixed and remastered again with the help of Cecil English and re- released with three new tracks in 1993. With their third album Waste and Tragedy (1995) the band moved to a new producer, Joel van Dyke (Wide Mouth Mason, Colin James) and a much cleaner sound. The band produced two videos for this release, one for the track It's Gonna be Fast and one for the lead single of the album, Pity the Man with the Fast Right Hand, a song that incorporate country themes into the hard rock/metal format. The band never signed a recording agreement with a major label but released Waste and Tragedy through Cargo Records, signing a production and distribution deal with label owner Randy Boyd in 1995. Boyd had been successful in capitalizing on the expanding \\"indie rock\\" music scene including becoming the first distributor for many Sub Pop artists and the Epitaph Records label in Canada. Shortly thereafter Boyd sold Cargo Records Canada to Alan Fox a successful entrepreneur with no music industry experience. Three years later the company went bankrupt and the smalls were one among many creditors who went out of pocket when the company began to default on payments as it collapsed. The smalls moved their catalog to Outside Music. Despite ongoing problems with Cargo Records the band secured distribution in Europe and embarked on its first European tour during this period, scenes from which can be found in the documentary called The Smalls... Er Whatever, directed by John Stiles and edited by Ian Harvey.

Cheese makers from all around the world including Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Germany, and so many others compete for having the most exceptional quality, artisan mountain cheese. In previous years, the festival has been held in Appenzell, Switzerland, and it was originally intended to help promote the economic interests of the mountain regions of Switzerland. Currently, the festival is held in Galtür, Austria, a small ski resort village. Some popular tourist attractions in Galtür include [1]hiking, biking and open-air thermal spas regularly enjoyed by tourists and natives alike. Many people love the mountain air and crystal-clear lakes, but it is high-altitude sun, not snow, that is the new obsession. and will be celebrating the 25th annual event in September of 2019. The festival is centered around the qualities of mountain cheeses. Mountain cheeses are particularly important to this festival and actually differ from mass produced cheese sold all around the world. The festival focuses on \\"mountain cheese\\" because they have separate and more distinct qualities that other kinds of cheese don't. Mountain cheeses are most often made from sheep or goat milk, and tend to be softer than most other types of cheeses.This cheese focused on in the International Mountain Cheese Olympics, can also be known as Alpine cheese. [2]The term “alpine cheese” simply means any cheese indigenous to the Alps, the European mountain range marking the borders of Switzerland, France, Austria, and Italy. These cheeses have achieved global fame and replication, however, because of the centuries- old recipes and methods that make these cheeses so special. This particular group of cheese is made from animals such as sheep and goats, that have grazed in the high elevation pastures. These cheeses are important because they have a rich and complex flavor, which is why people from around the world come to compete for the best mountain cheese. The cheese makers allowed to compete in this event have to be cheese artisans, [3]making cheeses at altitudes over 600m (1,970ft) are allowed to compete in the Cheese Olympics, with prizes for taste and quality. The 2019 International Mountain Cheese Olympics will be held in Galtür, Austria, which is a small, well known ski resort village located in the upper Paznaun valley in the state of Tyrol. [4]The Mountain Cheese Olympics founded in 2002 \\"to promote the mountain region economy\\" and the festival itself consists of many events. This annual celebration allows festival goers to be able to purchase all different types of mountain cheeses by the competitors themselves and explore international cuisine. The competition is the main highlight of the entire annual event, centering around how the mountain cheese is shaped, displayed, as well as taste. [5]According to experts, the cheese industry is affected by several factors; economic factors like marketing, and sales, and cultural factors related to the areas where the cheese is manufactured. This is why at first, Switzerland started this competition to help both their economic interest, and allow individuals from all around the world to be able to share their appreciation for mountain cheeses. This year, competitors will be competing for the Galtür Dairyman Harp[6].Though it was started primarily by Switzerland- France, and Italy, happen to dominate its awards, and there are typically over 100 entries, from all over the world, including Japan, Mexico, and Ethiopia. There will be over 100 competitors, and over 600 types of cheese ready to be consumed by both the judges and the festival goers. [7]The event begins at 11:00am at the Galtür Sports and Culture Center. Visitors are invited to sample and purchase the fine artisan cheeses between 11:00am and 6:00pm.

Its name is derived from the Ainu language for \\"hot spring\\". Geology Ushishir consists of two islets connected by a narrow spit of land with an area of . These islets are the tops of a partially submerged volcano. The southern island, Yankicha (), consists of the summit caldera and has a maximum width of . The caldera has a diameter of , and is breached on the south, forming a sea- water crater bay. The bay has an estimated depth of , and there is strong evidence of ongoing underwater volcanic activity, as evidenced by frequent bubbles, altered water chemistry and the presence of bacteria mats. Two small lava domes form small islands in the central lagoon, and numerous fumaroles and hot springs are along the southeast caldera shoreline. The island's highest point is high, and is on the eastern shore. The northern islet (Ryponkicha ) is the larger of the two, and consists of a portion of the volcano's flank, with sheer cliffs rising up from the sea. Ushishir is still an active volcano with the last known eruption in 1884. Fauna In the spring and summer some of the largest colonies of crested and whiskered auklet in the Kuril Islands are found on the island; least auklet also nest here.Kondratyev, A. Y., Litvinenko, N. M., Shibaev, Y. V., Vyatkin, P. S., & Kondratyeva, L. F. (2000). \\"The breeding seabirds of the Russian Far East\\". Seabirds of the Russian Far East, 37-81. History Ushishir had no permanent habitation prior to European contact, but was visited in summer by the Ainu tribes from Rasshua, who regarded the island as a sacred land, which they identified as the home of the thunder god. Remains of Ainu huts have been found on the northern slopes of Yankicha's crater bay. Claimed by the Empire of Russia, sovereignty over Ushishir was passed to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg along with the rest of the Kuril Islands. Approaches to the island are difficult due to frequent fogs, rapid ocean currents and the presence of numerous small offshore rocks. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushiro District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō. After World War II, the island came under the control of the Soviet Union, and is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation.

Its primary tenant is the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, but it is also used for other functions, such as NCAA basketball, NCAA hockey, concerts, professional wrestling and more. In a typical year, the facility hosts about 175 events. Industry trade publication Pollstar has previously ranked Enterprise Center among the top ten arenas worldwide in tickets sold to non-team events, but the facility has since fallen into the upper sixties, as of 2017. The arena opened in 1994 as the Kiel Center.http://www.enterprisecenter.com/about-us It was known as the Savvis Center from 2000 to 2006, and Scottrade Center from 2006 to 2018. On May 21, 2018, the St. Louis Blues and representatives of Enterprise Holdings, based in St. Louis, announced that the naming rights had been acquired by Enterprise and that the facility's name would change to Enterprise Center, effective July 1, 2018. Current tenants It is the home of the St. Louis Blues of the NHL. In addition to the NHL franchise, the facility has hosted the annual Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament since 1995, commonly referred to as \\"Arch Madness\\", with the winner receiving an automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament. The University of Illinois and University of Missouri play their annual men's basketball rivalry game at Enterprise Center each season, typically on the Saturday before Christmas. Enterprise Center also hosts a variety of non-sporting events each year, including concerts, ice shows, family events, professional wrestling, and other events. On average, the facility sees about 175 total events per year, drawing nearly two million guests annually to downtown St. Louis. The facility is frequently chosen by the NCAA to host championship events, including its men's hockey \\"Frozen Four\\" in 2007, the women's basketball Final Four in 2001 and 2009, wrestling championships in 2000, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2017, and several men's and women's basketball Midwest Regional tournament games. After the Missouri Tigers joined the SEC in 2012, St. Louis was added to the list of cities that could serve as hosts for the men's SEC Men's Basketball Tournament, doing so for the first time in March 2018, at the completion of the 2017–2018 regular season. The building is operated by SLB Acquisition Holdings LLC, owner of the St. Louis Blues, under its chairman, Tom Stillman. Former tenants Former tenants of Enterprise Center include the Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team from Saint Louis University, St. Louis Vipers roller hockey team, St. Louis Ambush and St. Louis Steamers indoor soccer teams, the St. Louis Stampede arena football team, and the River City Rage indoor football team. History As the Scottrade Center The arena opened in 1994 to replace Kiel Auditorium, where the Saint Louis University college basketball team had played, which was torn down in December 1992. The Blues had played in the St. Louis Arena prior to moving into Kiel Center in 1994; however, they would not play in the arena until January 1995 due to the lockout that delayed the start of the 1994–95 season. The first professional sports match was played by the St. Louis Ambush, an indoor soccer team. The building is currently known as Enterprise Center, after naming rights were sold in May 2018 to Enterprise Holdings. The Kiel name still exists on the adjoining parking structure and the building cornerstone. Signs for the nearby MetroLink stop have been changed to read \\"Civic Center\\", since the building has been renamed four times in its history. The Opera House portion of the building was not razed when the original Auditorium was but remained closed since 1992, as members of Civic Progress, Inc., who promised to pay for the renovation of the Opera House, reneged on that promise, while opposing all outside efforts to achieve that renovation. In June 2009, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen voted 25–1 to subsidize the renovation and reopening of the Opera House under the direction of its new owners, Sports Capital Partners (who also own the Blues). The subsidies were funded by municipal bonds and state/federal historic tax credits. On July 12, 2010, it was announced that the name of the opera house would be changed to the Peabody Opera House, named after the company Peabody Energy. On October 1, 2011, the Peabody Opera House opened for the first time since the $79 million renovation. Through its history, the arena has been known as Kiel Center until 2000, Savvis Center from 2000 to 2006, Scottrade Center from 2006 to 2018, and Enterprise Center since July 2018. The largest crowd to attend an event at the arena was 22,612, which happened twice during the 2007 Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. The largest non-sporting event crowd was for a Bon Jovi concert in May 2011 as part of the Bon Jovi Live Tour with 20,648 in attendance. A three- phase renovation of the arena began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, with all building works being done in the hockey off-season to minimize schedule disruption. The first phase was largely composed of engineering upgrades (new lighting, sound, HVAC, and ice plant) and dressing rooms, as well as a new scoreboard and replacement of some lower-tier seating on the west end (where the Blues shoot twice) with \\"theater boxes\\". Phase two will see the replacement of all upper-tier seats, \\"theater boxes\\" added to the east end, and a re-built lower-tier concourse with new club areas for premium ticketholders as well as a beer garden opening onto 14th Street. The third and final phase will include the replacement of lower-tier seats and renovations to private boxes. Naming rights Blues management decried its former naming-rights deal with tech company SAVVIS, as much of the compensation was in Savvis shares, then riding high. However, when the tech bubble burst, the team was left with nearly worthless shares. In September 2006, Scottrade founder Rodger O. Riney and chief marketing officer Chris Moloney announced a partnership with the St. Louis Blues hockey club and arena. The new name of the arena, Scottrade Center, was revealed in a joint press conference. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but were described as \\"long-term and significant\\", by Moloney. Both Scottrade and the Blues said the agreement was \\"equitable\\" to both parties. Most of the signage and other promotions were changed to Scottrade Center prior to the first home game of the Blues on October 12, 2006. The Sports Business Journal in March 2007 described it as \\"one of the fastest naming rights deals in history.\\" Scottrade announced on October 24, 2016 that it was being sold to TD Ameritrade for $4 billion. It was originally believed that once the deal closed, Scottrade Center would become the TD Ameritrade Center in a naming rights deal set to run until 2021. However, less than a year later, TD Ameritrade announced that it would give back its naming rights upon the closure of the Scottrade acquisition. On May 21, 2018, Enterprise Holdings, based in St. Louis, and the St. Louis Blues announced that beginning July 1, the facility would be known as Enterprise Center. The 15-year agreement calls for interior and exterior signage featuring the Enterprise logo. Seating capacity The facility's seating capacity for hockey has varied since opening. {  - ! fff; border-top:#002F87 5px solid; border-bottom:#FCB514 5px solid;\\"Years ! fff; border-top:#002F87 5px solid; border-bottom:#FCB514 5px solid;\\"Capacity -  style=\\"text- align:center\\"1994–2000  19,260 -  center\\"2000–2007  19,022 -  center\\"2007–2017  19,150 -  style=\\"text- align:center\\"2017–2018  18,724 -  center\\"2019–present  18,096 } Events Sports *Since 1995, Enterprise Center has hosted the Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, commonly referred to as Arch Madness. *The PBR has hosted an Unleash the Beast Series (formerly Bud Light Cup Series and Built Ford Tough Series) event at this venue annually since 1997, making it one of the longest-running events on the tour.

The East Calcutta Wetlands, (22 0 27’ N 88 0 27’ E), are a complex of natural and human-made wetlands lying east of the city of Calcutta (Kolkata), of West Bengal in India. The wetlands cover 125 square kilometres and include salt marshes, as well as agricultural fields, sewage farms and settling ponds. The wetlands are also used to treat Kolkata's sewage, and the nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture. The name East Calcutta Wetlands was coined by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, Special Advisory (Agricultural Ecosystems), Commission on Ecosystem Management, IUCN, who reached this incredible but neglected part of the city when, while working as an engineer for the Government of West Bengal's Water & Sanitation Department, he was searching for an answer to the question: What exactly happens to the city sewage? These natural water bodies which were known just as fisheries provided the answer. Devised by local fishermen and farmers, these wetlands served, in effect, as the natural sewage treatment plant for the city. The East Kolkata Wetlands host the largest sewage fed aquaculture in the world. .  Protecting the East Kolkata Wetlands  In 1991 the West Bengal Government accepted an offer by a non-resident Indian to build a World Trade Centre and allotted 227 acres of wetlands for this purpose. As a result, the NGO People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC) filed a public interest litigation in the Calcutta High Court arguing for the importance of the wetlands and why they should be left as they were. The All India Reporter 1993 Calcutta 215of Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee on this matter is considered a landmark judgment. Not only did it go into the definition of wetlands and a review of their status in countries such as Australia and the US, he also brought to bear his own research on their functional values and role in \\"maintaining micro-climatic conditions, absorbing pollution...habitat for aquatic flora fauna... providing a spill basin, and the fragility of the ecosystem.\\" The outcome was that the proposal for the World Trade Centre was turned down in its original form and strict conditions were laid: \\"I do not find any justiciable reason to disagree with the opinion expressed by the environmentalists that wetland should be preserved and no interference or reclamation should be permitted AIR 1993 Calcutta 231.\\" Following the order of the Calcutta High Court in 1992,to its credit, the State Government did not appeal but accepted the ruling. In fact, the Environment Secretary, Kalyan Biswas, applied for the East Calcutta Wetlands to be designated a \\"wetland of international importance\\" under the Ramsar Convention. This was obtained in 2002. Finally, in 2006, as a reflection of state and civil society partnership, the East Kolkata Wetlands (Management & Conservation) Act was passed - the first such case of a major environmental legislation being enacted by a state - as distinct from the central - government. Over the years, these wetlands have faced continuing threats and encroachment. In many instances, the original petitioner, PUBLIC, has had to go to court (High Court, Supreme Court, the National Green Tribunal) to argue on the basis of the 1992 judgment and the later EKW Act to ward off project proposals that were in fact disguised attempts at land-grabbing. While minor encroachments continue even today, the East Kolkata Wetlands still survive. Conservation Methods: 1\\\\. To demarcate the boundaries of the East Kolkata wetlands on the field. 2\\\\. To take measures or make an order to stop, undo and prevent any unauthorised development project in, or unauthorised use of, or unauthorised act on, the East Kolkata wetlands. 3\\\\. To make an order directing demolition or alteration of any hoarding, frame, post, kiosk, structure, neon-signed or sky-sign, erected or exhibited illegally for the purpose of advertisement on any land within the East Kolkata wetlands. 4\\\\. To make an order to prevent, prohibit or restrict any mining, quarrying, blasting, or other operations for the purpose of protecting or conserving the East Kolkata wetlands. 5\\\\. To take measures to abate pollution in the East Kolkata wetlands and conserve the flora, fauna and biodiversity in general. 6\\\\. To prepare action plans conforming to the resolutions taken and recommendations made, from time to time, under the Ramsar Convention and to update the land use maps of the East Kolkata wetlands. 7\\\\. To implement and monitor the activities specified in the action plans. 8\\\\. To promote research and disseminate findings of such research among the stakeholders; 9\\\\. To raise awareness about the utility of the wetlands in general and the East Kolkata wetlands in particular. 10\\\\. To promote basic conservation principles like sewage fed pisciculture and eco- tourism in the East Kolkata wetlands. 11\\\\. To enforce land use control in the substantially water body-oriented areas and other areas in the East Kolkata wetlands. 12\\\\.

To do such act, or pass such order, which may be necessary and expedient for the purpose of conservation and management of the East Kolkata wetlands. Flora There are about 100 plant species, which have been recorded in and around the East Calcutta Wetlands. These include Sagittaria montividensis, cryptocoryne ciliata, Cyperus spp., crostichum aureum, Ipomoea Aquatica, etc. The Sunderbans used to extend up to patuli in the 1950s. Several kinds of water hyacinths grow across these wetlands. Local farmers and fisher folk use water hyacinth to create a buffer between land and water to minimise erosion. The area is also home to large numbers of coconut and betel nut trees. Many varieties of vegetables are farmed here, including cauliflower, eggplant, pumpkin, sunflower and sacred basil. Tracts of land are dedicated to paddy cultivation as well. Fauna Numerous species of fish are farmed in the sewage fed ponds called bheris in the East Kolkata wetlands. These include silver carp, tilapia, The area is also home to marsh mongoose and small Indian mongoose. Palm Civet and Small Indian Civet are significant in and around East Calcutta Wetlands. Approximately 20 mammals are reported from this region. Snakes found in the East Calcutta Wetland include Checkered keel back (Fowlea piscator), Smooth water snake (Enhydris enhydris), Buff striped keel back (Amphiesma stolata) and Bronze back tree snake (Tendrelaphis pristis) It is the Type locality of a mammalian species, called Salt Lake Marsh Mongoose. Over 40 species of birds can be spotted at the wetlands. The process of urbanisation however, is leading to the disappearance of many bird species from the area.(Ghosh,A,K, 2004)  Sewage treatment  Kolkata is an example of how natural wetlands are sometimes being utilised in developing countries. Using the purification capacity of wetlands, the Indian city of Kolkata has pioneered a system of sewage disposal. Originally built to house one million (10 lakh) people, Kolkata is now home to over 10 million (over 1 crore) people, with nearly one-third of them living in slums. But the 8,000-hectare East Kolkata Wetlands Ramsar Site, a patchwork of tree-fringed canals, vegetable plots, rice paddies and fish ponds – and the 20,000 people that work in them – daily transform one-third of the city's sewage and most of its domestic refuse into a rich harvest of fish and fresh vegetables. For example, the Mudially Fishermen's Cooperative Society is a collective of 300 families that lease 70 hectares into which wastewater from the city is released. Through a series of natural treatment processes – including the use of Eichhornia crassipes and other plants for absorbing oil, grease and heavy metals – the Cooperative has turned the area into a thriving fish farm and nature park. Controversy Recently illegal landfills are on the rise and the wetlands are being slowly assimilated in the stream city. This unprecedented land development and urbanisation are creating concerns about the impact on the environment. Wetlands are under threat due to exponential expansion of real-estate projects in eastern Kolkata especially in the Salt Lake and Rajarhat sectors. Nowadays, land encroachment and land alteration are the important aspect of threats for East Kolkata Wetland (EKW). Transformation from wetland to fishing pond, i.e., aquaculture field are become a potential threat to EKW (Ghosh et al. 2018). Microbial Biodiversity Microbial Diversity is an integral part of biodiversity which includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, protozoa and protists (Ghosh, A., 2007). East Kolkata Wetland shows an immense diversity of flora and fauna both at the macro and micro level. Microbial richness of a region is its unseen asset that needs to be explored and conserved. Soil samples collected from ECW shows the presence of various new strains of microbes which are not only ecologically important but also have commercial value (Ghosh, A., 2007). These include Actinobacteria which are responsible for the degradation of nitrophenol, nitroaromatic compounds, pesticides and herbicides; Proteobacteria related to the bioremediation of heavy metals, degradation and recycling of woody tissues of plants, oil contaminated soil and toxic compounds and nitrogen fixation along with the cyanobacters; other bacteria playing important roles in metal accumulation, oil degradation, antimicrobial compound production, enzyme production etc. (Ghosh, A., 2007). Role in climate change mitigation Sewage fed aquaculture based artificial wetland, like East Kolkata Wetland (EKW), is a robust example of potential carbon sink and spin-off. EKW can sequester ~1.9 Mg C/ha/year, mitigating at least ~118 Gg atmospheric CO2/year. Plus, carbon uptake by harvested fish crop corresponds to ~61 Gg CO2/year - rewarding USD 3.6/kg blue C harvested. Conservation and Management Act The East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act, 2006 represents an important landmark as it paved way for establishment of the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority (EKWMA) for conservation and management of the EKW. The EKWMA is constituted under Section 3 of the Act, 2006. In 2017 Section 3(2) of the Act, 2006 has been amended and the composition of the EKWMA has been changed. The EKWMA is a thirteen (13) member body with the Chief Secretary, Government of West Bengal, Secretaries of different Departments of State Govt. as well as four experts nominated by the State Govt. under the chairmanship of Minister-in-Charge, Department of Environment, Government of West Bengal. The EKWMA is guided by the East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act, 2006, the East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2006, and the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017.http://ekwma.in/ek/ Sources 1\\\\.

The scheme comprises various methods to reduce traffic speed including cameras and Variable Message Signs which flash the speed limit when a driver is going too fast. The cameras do not issue fines or penalty points to the driver, but record the number plate, speed and time of vehicles. The scheme has been very effective on keeping general traffic speeds below the limit of the road. Each Watchman System comes standard with high-speed communications allowing access to live and recorded video images without having to physically visit the unit. This feature allows traffic managers remote access from a PC, laptop or dedicated control room. Each unit can be programmed to take appropriate automatic action upon detecting a certain speed of vehicle, for example, automatically issuing a letter to the owners of vehicles traveling in excess of 50 mph on a particular stretch of road, or to capture on video the passage of vehicles driving above a certain speed. In addition to recording the information of speeding vehicles, a Watchman System can also be used for long-term analysis of traffic movement by counting each passing vehicle and registering its speed. Details of up to 2 million vehicles can be stored into its hard disk, in essence creating a traffic census for the stretch of road. It can also be used to track suspect vehicles after crimes.

Main objective The First World Congress on Communication for Development was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized by The World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, and The Communication Initiative. It intended to clearly demonstrate to policy and decision-makers the effectiveness of \\"Communication for Development\\" in helping meet today's most pressing development challenges and to advocate among them for the systematic inclusion of communication in development policy and practice. Communication for Development — as a process of dialogue, information sharing and building mutual understanding — is a powerful tool to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of development interventions, to assess and mitigate the political and social risks of those interventions and to build social ownership and sustainability.  Participants The WCCD, the first event of its kind, brought together more than 500 policymakers, development practitioners, NGO and CSO representatives, and academics/researchers active in the field. Thousands more from around the world were able to participate via webcasting and broadcasting.  Organization and structure FAO and the World Bank spearheaded this event, and involved more than 75 key institutions, including multilateral and bilateral partners, media institutions, academic and research institutions, and NGOs to help organize the Congress. The three party governance structure consisted of a steering committee (to provide overall advice and guidance to the planning), a Scientific Committee (to conduct the paper review and the Mainstreaming study) and an Advisory Body.  Invitees profile Nobel Prize Keynote Speakers, Highest Level of Representation from the UN and The World Bank, Italian Authorities, High Profile Public Figures, Ministries and Authorities from Developing Countries, Prime International University Representatives and Academicians.  Themes and structure The Congress was structured around four broad thematic areas: Health, Governance, Sustainable Development, and Communication Labs. During the Policymakers Forum leading policy and decision-makers discussed and debated the opportunities and constraints they envisaged vis-à-vis the proposed recommendations for mainstreaming communication in development policies and programs. A Mainstreaming and Policy Recommendations Study commissioned by the Scientific Committee served as the basis of discussions at the Policymakers' Forum, integrated the outcomes of the Forum and was then published, together with the proceedings of sessions and papers.  Media partners Media Partners included Inter Press Service-IPS, RAI (Italy), BBC (UK) and CNBC (Germany). Additional media outlets were Al-Jazeera (Qatar), Reuters, CNN Español, and major Latin-American media; Rome-based correspondents of the international press, together with major Italian newspapers covered the event. The BBC broadcast from the Congress site its flagship program, World Debate, while CNBC broadcast the show, Global Players.  Expectations This event generated an enormous amount of interest around the world with more than 600 papers submitted through the call for papers, more than 1,700 registered through the Congress website, more than 600,000 hits on the site, and more than 2,000 people participated in pre-Congress e-discussions on Congress- related topics and themes. One of the most extensive efforts previous to the Congress was the latinamerican seminar \\"Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo\\" (Without Communication No Development), held on August, 2006 in the city of Lima (Perú) with participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Perú, Uruguay, Venezuela, Germany and Italy.Calandria, 2007 - Source: Official Publication from the Seminar \\"Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo\\" (Without Communication No Development) It reunited the following Peruvian (PE) and international institutions (I - International / LA - Latinamerican): Asociación de Comunicadores Sociales Calandria (PE), CESIP (PE), CNR (Perú), Colectivo Radial Feminista (PE), DEMUS (PE), Equipo Uno (PE), Voces Nuestras, PUCP (PE), Red Científica Peruana (PE), ILLA (PE), IEC (PE), MINSA (PE), CONAM (PE), CONCORTV (PE), IDL (PE), IUCM, Mesa de Comunicadores de Agencias de Cooperación, FELAFACS (LA), OCLAC (LA), OPS (LA), ANDI (LA), ALER (LA), AMARC (LA), Observatorio de Imprensa (LA), World Bank (I), AVINA (I), Broederlijk Delen (I), CAMECO (I), Communication for Social Change Consortium (I), FAO (I), Iniciativa de la Comunicación (I), ONU (I), OXFAM (I), UNICEF (I), USAID (I), WACC (I).Iniciativa de la Comunicación, 2006 - Source: Resume and list of presentations from the Seminar \\"Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo\\" (Without Communication No Development)  Further reading * FAO.org: World Congress on Communication for Development — \\"Lessons, Challenges, and the Way forward\\" * Consenso de Roma — \\"Consenso de Roma (reproducción íntegra en Revista Canalé, 2007 - p. 4-6)\\" References Category:Food and Agriculture Organization Category:United Nations conferences Category:Communication Category:History of international development Category:World Bank Category:2006 conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in Italy Category:2006 in Italy Category:2000s in Rome Category:October 2006 events in Europe Category:Italy and the United Nations ","title":"World Congress on Communication for Development"},{"id":"6886041","text":"Ian Stephen is an Australian/American musician. In 1984, with bass player Mark Ferrie, guitarists Terry Doolan and Andrew Pendlebury, and drummer Des Hefner, Ian formed the Slaughtermen in Melbourne, a mid eighties post-punk alternative Southern gospel group (albeit 12,000 miles away from their original source of inspiration, America's Deep South Bible Belt). Around this time Ian began private voice lessons with vocal coach Eve Godley and later at the Melba Conservatorium. Much earlier Ian had studied piano at the Andrios School of Music in Footscray, which was also attended by Mark Ferrie, although not at the same time. Prior to the Slaughtermen, Ian's checkered career included The Armchairs, a satirical four piece outfit co-founded with Johnny Topper which had its debut in 1979 at the infamous Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda. Other members included guitarist Pierre Jaquinot, Andrew Snow, drums, and Fred Cass, bass. Later incarnations featured Rod Haywood, guitar, and Sue Parncutt, bass. The Armchairs released a 7-inch Ep, Ski Lo Lo, and a 12\\" album, Party Time, on Missing Link Records with the entire B side taken up by a 20-minute version of \\"La Bamba\\". The Armchairs, later with the help of Stephen Cummings, who in the early 1980s Ian had struck up a songwriting partnership with, morphed into the mildly successful, yet short lived 11 piece group, Go Wild in French, which featured songs of Elvis Presley, as well as original compositions. Fed up with the claustrophobic Melbourne scene, Ian moved to Sydney in 1989 and recorded a solo album with some members of The Danglin' Bros and others, entitled Workin' on The Nightshift, which was released on Agape records through EMI. This was followed in 1996 by King of the Cross, released on the Massive label. A collection of original and Southern gospel songs. In 1998, he recorded and self-released Cementville, the title inspired after visiting the town of the same name while driving through Indiana en route to Memphis, Tennessee. in 1997. The album contained bleak and acerbic observations of Australian life. In 2000, Ian moved to San Francisco and while living in the Mission District continued recording and releasing a number of left of center albums. In 2003 Ian, together with Broadway and cabaret star, Houston Allred, (the son of James Allred, 33rd Governor of Texas), \\"Genetically Challenged Drag queen\\" Anita Cocktail, her partner Sharon Boggs and Norman Anderson collectively known as The Shakers, performed at various venues in San Francisco, Millbrae and their hometown bar, in Brisbane, California, the infamous 23 Club. The group split somewhat acrimoniously in 2006, and Ian returned to creating new music in the Brisbane environment. In 2004, Ian, along with Brisbanite Sharon De Milo and Australian singer/guitarist, Sally De Jesus recorded and released the self-titled album Capital Expressway. Capital Expressway was recorded in four days and largely improvised. The CD contains original compositions, and has been described as \\"The Shaggs meet The Stooges\\". A San Francisco Indie Music Festival review panel described it in so many words, \\"It seems as though the band is purposefully singing and playing badly, so if this is the intention, why not make it worse?\\" Since 2006 a compilation series, Eden vol 1 and Eden vol 2, featuring Ian Stephen musical highlights from the past 25 years has also been commercially available. In June 2006, Ian moved to Orange County, in upstate New York recording and releasing a new CD, Singing Is A Hobby and a Waste of Time, which featured music]al content such as \\"Amish Man\\", \\"U Two Suck on Wheels\\" and \\"Welcome to the New Fascism\\" under a musical banner described as Psychedelic existential urban alternative rock. In Nov 2009 Ian released \\"War is Peace\\" an album psychedelic comedy music, featuring the musical and instrumental contributions of fellow Australians now residing in the USA, Keith Glass and Randy Bulpin. John Cobbin and MaryAnne Slavich from Sydney, Australia contributed as well. In Dec 2006, at Federal Hall National Memorial in New York City Ian became a United States citizen. In 2010 Ian released \\"Tea First Then Sex\\", a 13 track CD of original compositions recorded at Granite Fortess an 1895 Romanesque style Frank Estabrook designed house, in Upstate New York. Several of these compositions were the result of an earlier project, with Keith Glass involving the poetry of John Laws, which was terminated for reasons unknown. Players on the CD include Randy Bulpin, and Keith Glass, who co-wrote several of the songs. In January 2011, under the nom-de-plume of Sabrage, Ian released \\"This is Very Gay\\", a nine track Electronica/Dance CD on the IAW label. Tracks included \\"Frostcreep\\", \\"Velvet Cough\\" and \\"Strollermeat\\" In January 2012 saw the release of \\"Great Wall of Sound\\", a completely instrumental project, recorded in Sydney Australia in 2000, and unreleased until the present time. August 2013 saw the release of \\"Per Sempre\\" Ian's 9th album. An album of \\"love\\" songs described as \\"like looking at a Diorama in a natural history museum\\". To coincide with its release, Ian Stephen and the Imperfectionists. (Johnny Moonlight-guitar, Barry Divola -bass, Mary Anne Slavich -vocals and Tony Slavich- keyboards, and 'Bird' David Two Hill – drums), played a one-off show on 15 August 2013, at the Green Room Lounge in Enmore, NSW. In 2014 Ian Stephen and the Imperfectionists featuring the 2013 line up, minus MaryAnne and Tony Slavich, played a one-off show in August at the Petersham Bowling Club in Sydney Australia. This show was replicated in 2015 with the addition of Graham Osborn on guitar and vocals. On March 6, 2015 Ian released 9, his tenth solo album. 2016 saw the release of Ian's 11th solo album, Uncivilization recorded at the Granite Fortress. Randy Bulpin played guitar on a two of the tracks. In November 2016, a limited pressing, live recording was made available by mail order only. \\"Far Out Man - Live at the Fortress\\" Featuring Ian Stephen on guitar and vocals, along with Randy Bulpin on guitar, Scott Kenyon, keyboards, Patrick O'Gorman drums, and Gary Ferraro bass. In 2017 it was decided that all further Ian Stephen releases for the foreseeable future would be under the Far Out Man name. This coincided with the release of Far Out Man - Far Out, a ten track album of original songs, recorded at \\"The Fortress\\" in Upstate New York. In 2018 Far Out Man was effectively mothballed, and Ian Stephen returned to eponymous releases with Insanity in 2019 and International Excellence in 2020.

The goalkeeper in Gaelic football and hurling also usually has the role of kicking or pucking the ball out to the outfield players. A good goalkeeper most often has great agility and bravery as well as strength and height. In Gaelic football a keeper's shot stopping ability is of great importance alongside blocking. There is no limit to where on the field the goalkeeper can travel, although once they are outside the penalty area, they are subject to the same rules as all other players. A goalkeeper in men's football may touch the ball on the ground within his own small parallelogram, and is the only player permitted to do so. It is not permitted to physically challenge a goalkeeper while inside his own small parallelogram, but players may harass him into playing a bad pass, or block an attempted pass. The substitute goalkeeper usually wears the number 16 jersey and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31. Full backs Right and left corner back The role of the right and left corner back who, respectively, wear the number 2 and number 4 jerseys, is to defend against opposing attackers – in particular the left and right corner forwards. They will play most around the 20-metre line. The positions require the players having decent speed over short bursts and good hand eye co-ordination, and agility is required. Full back The role of full back who wears the number 3 jersey is one of the most important in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the full back is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The full back plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the full back requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and good hand eye co-ordination. In playing either cornerback or full back positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner backs, the full back is needed to make short burst sprints both away from and into the goal area. Half backs Right and left half backs The role of the half backs who wear the 5 (right) and 7 (left) jerseys is less defensive than that of the corner backs. The half backs operate most often in between the 45-metre line and the midfield. The half backs are expected to defend against the opposition's half forward line but also has a responsibility to make runs from the 45-metre line to advance the play to the half forward and full forward lines. Sometimes referred to as right/left wing back. Centre half back The role of the centre half back who wears the number 6 jersey, is less defensive than that of the full back. The centre backs operates from the 45-metre line and forward to the midfield. The centre back will help win the breaking ball in the midfield and can be used as a third midfielder. The centre half back generally marks the centre half forward. Sometimes referred to as centre back. The required agilities of a centre half back are strength, height, speed and a good catching game. Midfield The role of the midfield who wears the number 8 or 9 jersey is to catch kick outs / puck outs from either team's goalkeeper, and to act as the main link between the defending and attacking sections of the team. Midfield is often described as the most important role on the pitch. If the opposing goalkeeper is kicking the ball to the middle of the field, the midfielder has the responsibility to retrieve the ball and therefore prevent the opposing team from taking advantage and bringing the ball forward. This then gives a new responsibility to the midfielder to get the ball moving forward to the half forward and full forward lines. The position requires the player to have strength, height, speed, good catching ability, a good kicking game and, most importantly, endurance. It is important for the midfield to have a good understanding of their goalkeeper. They must anticipate where their goalkeeper will place the ball and therefore take advantage and bring the ball forward. Note that there is rarely a \\"left midfielder\\" and \\"right midfielder\\" – both play 'off' each other as a combined unit. If one midfielder is attacking, the other always goes up the field with him in support. Both midfielders always attack or defend at the same time. Half forwards Right and left half forwards The role of the right and left half forward who wear, respectively, numbers 10 and number 12 jerseys is to build up attacks and to feed the ball to the full forward line and also taking shots on goal or above the bar when opportunities present themselves. The half forwards will cover much ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. They operate from the midfield to the opposition's 45 meter line. The right half forward's main opposing player is the left half back and vice versa. Sometimes referred to as right/left wing forward. Centre half forward The role of the centre half forward who wears the number 11 jersey, is to build up attacks and feed the ball to the full forward line. The centre half forward is responsible for taking shots on goal and points when opportunities present themselves. The centre forward will cover much ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. The centre forward also helps win breaking ball in the midfield, helping to win the possession to bring the ball forward. The centre forward operates from the midfield to the opposition's 45-metre line. Sometimes referred to as centre forward. Full forwards Left and right corner forward The role of the left and right corner forwards, who wear the number 15 and 13 jerseys respectively, is to watch the full forward's breaks and to score points and goals. The full forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The corner forwards are generally marked by the corner backs. Full forward The role of the full forward who wears the number 14 jersey is to score goals in particular although points are usually the outcome of their attempts on goal. The full forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The full forward is generally marked by the full back. It is common for teams to employ a tall full forward to pluck high balls from the sky and to challenge the size and strength of the full back. Substitute Substitutes wear jersey numbers 16 upwards (usually up to 31). 16 is usually worn by the substitute goalkeeper, and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31 jersey.

As the traditional feudal elite, Nambudiris owned a large portion of the land in the region of Malabar until the Kerala Land Reforms starting in 1957. Nambudiris have been noted for their unique practices such as the adherence to srauta ritualism and orthodox tradition. Cyriac Pullapilly mentions that the dominating influence of the Nambudiris was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture of Kerala. History The Nambudiri associate their immigration to Kerala with the legendary creation of the region by Parasurama. Origin Nambudiri mythology associates their immigration to Kerala from the banks of Narmada, Krishna, Kaveri rivers with the legendary creation of Kerala by Parasurama, the 6th avatar of Vishnu. According to this legend, the region was created when Parasurama threw his axe into the sea Although it is known that the present-day region of Kerala was once governed by the Chera dynasty, little information exists regarding its early ethnography. Brahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the Sangam period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are Pūrvaśikhā Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the Kalabhra interregnum. This sets them apart from the later Aparaśikhā Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil Iyers. According to T.P Mahadevan, the Nambudiris brought with them a very early recension of the Mahabharata which became the basis of the Malayalam language version of the epic. Anthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families. According to the historian Romila Thapar, local kings and chiefs encouraged them to move to the area by offering such tax-exempt land grants in return for them officiating in Vedic rites that would legitimise the grantors' status as rulers. They also gained land and improved their influence over the socio-economic life of the region by helping rulers during the wars between the Chola and Chera dynasties when Vedic schools were turned into military academies. Early history Operating from their illam houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they \\"established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste\\". The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on Malayalam, basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language. Medieval Kerala has been characterised as an oligarchy which was dominated by the Nambudiris, who owned all the temples and their subsidiary villages. The Nambudiris had influence with the ruling class through the practice of sambandam, where younger Nambudiris used to have relationships with Kshatriya women or women from the upper sections of the Nair caste.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.39815/page/n7 The children of such unions were not considered Nambudiris, but a part of their matrilocal lineages. As a result of such unions, many kings and ruling chiefs in Kerala would be the offspring of Nambudiri fathers. These arrangements allowed the Nambudiris to gain political power in addition to religious and cultural dominance. The Nambudiri's grip on land was maintained through the practice of strict primogeniture and patrilineal inheritance. Despite their younger members having hypergamous relationships with Nairs, whose caste traditions were matrilineal, Nambudiri families remained aloof from general society. Although the historian E. K. Pillai has claimed that the Nambudiris from the 1100s enforced matrilineal polyandry on the previously patrilineal communities of the area, sociologist Randall Collins thinks it is unlikely that such a change could be imposed and says that \\"more probably it was the result of a process of marriage politics spread by emulation in the decentralised situation of status competition.\\" Some other scholars believe that the matrilineal customs predate the period entirely and cite the queens of the Pandyan dynasty as evidence for this. Modern history The unwillingness of Nambudiris to adapt to changes in wider society persisted until the early years of the 20th century but Susan Bayly believes that their decline in significance can be traced to the period 1729-1748 when Marthanda Varma established the Kingdom of Travancore and chose to use Deshastha Brahmins from Tamil Nadu in his civil service. She believes that decision undermined the relationship between the Nambudiri Brahmins and royalty in the region, although others have said that Varma's influence was short-lived and that the main cause of change was the arrival of British colonial administrators, such as Colin Macaulay and John Munro, from the early 1800s. After the passing of the Charter Acts of 1833 and 1853 in the British Parliament, the British encouraged the work of Christian missionaries, notably in provision of education, and began the introduction of a judicial system that would have a significant impact on the landholdings, inheritance customs and marriage arrangements of both the Nambudiris and Nairs. The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the Ezhavas and the Syrian Christians. Religious customs Nambūdiri Brahmin performing śrauta rites Vedic learning The following Vedic recensions are attested among them. # Rigveda, the Śākala recension which is the only extant recension of the Rigveda across India. The Nambudiris follow both the Āśvalāyana and Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtras. The latter, called the Kauṣītaki tradition among Nambudiris is restricted to them. # Yajurveda, the Taittirīya śākhā with the Baudhāyana, Vādhūla and Āgniveśya srauta sutras. # Samaveda in the Jaiminīya recension, which is elsewhere found only among the Śōḻiya Brahmans. Agnicayana The ancient Vedic ritual of Agnicayana (the altar of fire), which spans a 12-day period and which Frits Staal and Robert Gardner claim to be one of the oldest known rituals, was maintained by Nambudiri Brahmins until at least 1975. Although it may have largely died out elsewhere in India and thus be symptomatic of the community's resistance to change, David Knipe notes that it is still performed regularly in Andhra Pradesh and has been for centuries. Domestic culture Attire Traditionally, they wore a simple cloth around the waist called a thorthu (or thortumundu), in domestic settings. When they had to travel, they wore two sets of cloth in addition known as a vasthram. Nambudiris wore their traditional hair tufts (kuṭumi or śikhā) on the front like the Dikshitars of Tamil Nadu. Marriage customs Nambudiri Brahmin families practised a more strict version of primogeniture than Brahmin communities elsewhere in India. Under this custom, only the eldest son could marry a Nambudiri woman and thus produce an heir to the family property. Younger sons were restricted to sambandam relationships with non-Brahmin women, whom the Nambudiris considered to be concubines and whose offspring could not inherit. This tradition limited the extent of marriage within their own caste and led to the practice of hypergamy with the Nair community. Kathleen Gough notes that: The disparity in caste ranking in a relationship between a Brahmin man and a Nair woman meant that the woman was unable to live with her husband(s) in the Brahmin family and so remained in her own family. The children resulting from such marriages always became Nairs. K. M. Panikkar argues that it is this type of relationship that resulted in the matrilineal and matrilocal system. It has also been argued that the practice, along with judicious selection of the man who tied the thali, formed a part of the Nair aspirational culture whereby they would seek to improve their status within the caste. Furthermore, that: Although it is certain that in theory hypergamy can cause a shortage of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved would have been very small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups and the Nambudiris had mostly stopped the practice by the 1920s. Koodiyattam (artform) The form of Sanskrit theatre known as Koodiyattam, which is native to Kerala, was traditionally patronised by Nambudiris.

It is owned by LAA 1, LLC, composed of the owners of the Los Angeles Angels baseball team, held separately from the baseball club. Studios and offices are located on the grounds of Angel Stadium of Anaheim. The transmitter is in Chino, California, off McCarty Road.Radio-Locator.com/KLAA KLAA broadcasts by day at the maximum power permitted for commercial AM stations, 50,000 watts. But because 830 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which WCCO in Minneapolis is the dominant Class A station, KLAA must reduce power to 20,000 watts from sunset to sunrise. KLAA mostly carries the ESPN Radio Network, except for coverage of Angels games and a local afternoon sports show, \\"The Sports Lodge\\" with Roger Lodge. On weekends, paid brokered programming is heard. Los Angeles has another ESPN Radio Network affiliate, AM 710 KSPN, which is owned by ESPN's parent company, so the two stations sometimes air the same programming. As of 2014, President Dennis Kuhl carries out the duties of the General Manager. History AM 830 first signed on the air on January 9, 1986 as KSRT, a Spanish-language news and information station. The station was directional day and night, with a daytime power of 2,500 watts and 1,000 watts night. Former NFL placekicker Danny Villanueva was co-owner and general manager. The transmitter site was at Oak Flat in the Santa Ana Mountains near Santiago Peak. While mountain tops are good for FM transmission, AM stations need low, flat land for the best signal propagation. The poor ground conductivity yielded a less-than-optimal signal for KSRT. (Today, KSRT is a Regional Mexican music station in Cloverdale, California.) In 1991, the station was sold to the Children's Radio Network, switching to a children's radio format, becoming KPLS \\"Radio AAHS.\\" It was part of the first nationwide network of radio programs for children. The downfall of Radio AAHS came when The Walt Disney Company established a competitor, Radio Disney. After the sign-off of Radio AAHS in January 1998, the parent company, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, needed programming for the network of stations until they could find buyers. KPLS and the other nine CBC-owned and operated Radio AAHS stations flipped to \\"Beat Radio\\", which broadcast electronic dance music 12 hours a day. KPLS was sold in late October 1998 to Catholic Family Radio and adopted a Catholic talk format.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-63 During this period, the station was owned by John Lynch, father of the veteran National Football League cornerback of the same name. Lynch was former CEO of Noble Broadcasting of San Diego. In 2000 the station was granted a power increase by the FCC, allowing it to operate with 50,000 watts during the day and 20,000 watts at night, giving it a signal comparable to the major AM stations in Los Angeles. It also moved to its current tower site in Chino. Despite the power increase, KPLS' programming foundered. It transitioned to a conservative talk radio format as \\"HotTalk 830 – LA's Conservative Voice\\" which featured nationally syndicated shows from Laura Ingraham and Michael Savage. KPLS had close ties to the Orange County business community and was the flagship station of the Anaheim Ducks hockey team. In 2003, the station was sold to Radiovisa Corp. for $37.5 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-83 It flipped to KMXE, with a Spanish-language talk format. KMXE was the Angels' flagship station in that language. Its slogan was \\"¡Así Se Habla!\\" or \\"Well Said!\\" (KMXE is now a classic rock station near Billings, Montana.) The station sold again in February 2006 for $42 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2007 page D-88 The new owner was LAA1, LLC, headed by Angels Baseball owner Arte Moreno. The call letters switched to KLAA for Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The station added English-language programs in the summer of 2006 and gradually phased out Spanish-language shows except for some sporting events. The general talk format lasted from fall of 2007 to April 4, 2010, when the station went to full English-language programming, mostly sports talk, live sports and some paid programs. Talk show hosts included Rusty Humphries, Glenn Beck, Dr. Roy Masters and Michael Savage. The brokered shows included Ridin' Dirty, ROEX Health Show, which sold natural health remedies, and The American Advisor, which offered the sale of gold coins and bars. On April 5, 2010, KLAA added additional programs from ESPN Radio, shows hosted by Scott Van Pelt and Doug Gottlieb, which were previously unavailable in the Los Angeles radio market. In exchange, 710 KSPN agreed to simulcast about 60 Angels games in the 2010 season. KSPN replaced AM 980 KFWB as the team's simulcast partner. KLAA carried some game broadcasts from ESPN Radio when KSPN could not air the games due to conflicts with a local team or talk show. Also heard on KLAA are the Anaheim Ducks, as well as additional sports talk shows. Weekend shows include programs about horse racing, bass fishing, motorcross and NASCAR. Other talk shows include seasonal programs about the Angels and Ducks and a weekend interview program hosted by former Angel player and broadcaster Rex Hudler. Sports File:AM830ExteriorStudiosWide.jpg In 2006–07, the station assumed the broadcast rights for the Anaheim Ducks, a National Hockey League team. That team went on to win the Stanley Cup in June 2007. In October 2007, the Angels announced that KLAA would carry Angels games in English starting with the 2008 season. Some Angels games had already been aired in English, the first of which was on September 16, 2006. The station aired the team's Saturday games during September and October when AM 710 KSPN, the flagship from 2003 to 2007, carried USC Trojans football. Before that, it aired Angels games in Spanish, as well as some games of the pro soccer team the Los Angeles Galaxy, to fulfill contractual obligations to both teams. KLAA was believed to be the only station in the U.S. to broadcast play-by-play of sports events in two languages. (In 2008, Angels and Galaxy games in Spanish moved to AM 1330 KWKW, and the Dodgers relocated from KWKW to AM 930 KHJ.) On September 10, 2007, KLAA began carrying games of the NFL on Westwood One on Monday nights. However, it did not carry the full schedule because of some conflicts with the Ducks. KLAA aired selected NFL Sunday games in 2009 KLAA is the flagship station for UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball. In 2020, KLAA became the Los Angeles affiliate for the Las Vegas Raiders. Signal KLAA operates from a three-tower facility in Chino. It broadcasts as a full-power 50,000 watt station during the daytime from a single tower, using a non- directional signal. However, at sunset it drops to 20,000 watts and feeds power to all three towers in a directional pattern, projecting most of the signal westward in order to protect WCCO. It is the only Orange County- licensed station that covers Los Angeles County to any significant extent.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination deficiencies are characterized by elevated serum Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels and a considerable deficiency in Immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA) and E (IgE). As a consequence, people with HIGM have decreased concentrations of serum IgG and IgA and normal or elevated IgM, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.update 2013 Signs and symptoms Among the presentation consistent with hyper IgM syndrome are the following: Pneumocystis pneumonia * Infection/Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which is common in infants with hyper IgM syndrome, is a serious illness. PCP is one of the most frequent and severe opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems. Many CD40 Ligand Deficiency are first diagnosed after having PCP in their first year of life. The fungus is common and is present in over 70% of healthy people’s lungs, however, Hyper IgM patients are not able to fight it off without the administration of Bactrim) * Hepatitis (Hepatitis C) * Chronic diarrhea * Hypothyroidism * Neutropenia * Arthritis * Encephalopathy (degenerative) Cause Class switch recombination Different genetic defects cause HIgM syndrome, the vast majority are inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait and most sufferers are male. IgM is the form of antibody that all B cells produce initially before they undergo class switching due to exposure to a recognized antigen. Healthy B cells efficiently switch to other types of antibodies as needed to attack invading bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In people with hyper IgM syndromes, the B cells keep making IgM antibodies because they can't switch to a different antibody. This results in an overproduction of IgM antibodies and an underproduction of IgA, IgG, and IgE. Pathophysiology CD40 is a co-stimulatory receptor on B cells that, when bound to CD40 ligand (CD40L), sends a signal to the B-cell receptor. When there is a defect in CD40, this leads to defective T-cell interaction with B cells. Consequently, humoral immune response is affected. Certain insults, usually from encapsulated bacteria and toxin, then have a greater opportunity to damage the body. Diagnosis The diagnosis of hyper IgM syndrome can be done via the following methods and tests: * MRI * Chest radiography * Pulmonary function test * Lymph node test * Laboratory test (to measure CD40) Types Five types of hyper IgM syndrome have been characterized: * Hyper-IgM syndrome type 1 (X-linked), characterized by mutations of the CD40LG gene. In this type, T cells cannot tell B cells to switch classes. * Hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 (autosomal recessive), characterized by mutations of the AICDA gene. In this type, B cells cannot recombine genetic material to change heavy chain production * Hyper-IgM syndrome type 3 characterized by mutations of the CD40 gene. In this type, B cells cannot receive the signal from T cells to switch classes. * Hyper-IgM syndrome type 4 which is a defect in class switch recombination downstream of the AICDA gene that does not impair Somatic Hypermutation.subscription needed * Hyper-IgM syndrome type 5 characterized by mutations of the UNG gene. Treatment In terms of treatment for hyper IgM syndrome, there is the use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Additionally, anti-microbial therapy, use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, immunosuppressants, as well as other treatments, may be needed.

Love without locks campaign, Passerelle Debilly, Paris A love lock or love padlock is a padlock that sweethearts lock to a bridge, fence, gate, monument, or similar public fixture to symbolize their love. Typically the sweethearts' names or initials, and perhaps the date, are inscribed on the padlock, and its key is thrown away (often into a nearby river) to symbolize unbreakable love. Since the 2000s, love locks have proliferated at an increasing number of locations worldwide. They are now mostly treated by municipal authorities as litter or vandalism, and there is some cost to their removal. However, there are authorities who embrace them, and who use them as fundraising projects or tourist attractions.  History  Removing love locks at Charles Bridge in Prague The history of love padlocks dates back at least 100 years to a melancholic Serbian tale of World War I, with an attribution for the bridge Most Ljubavi (lit. the Bridge of Love) in the spa town of Vrnjačka Banja. A local schoolmistress named Nada fell in love with a Serbian officer named Relja. After they committed to each other, Relja went to war in Greece, where he fell in love with a local woman from Corfu. As a consequence, Relja and Nada broke off their engagement. Nada never recovered from that devastating blow, and after some time she died due to heartbreak from her unfortunate love. As young women from Vrnjačka Banja wanted to protect their own loves, they started writing down their names, with the names of their loved ones, on padlocks and affixing them to the railings of the bridge where Nada and Relja used to meet. In the rest of Europe, love padlocks started appearing in the early 2000s as a ritual or epidemy. The reasons love padlocks started to appear vary between locations and in many instances are unclear. However, in Rome, the ritual of affixing love padlocks to the bridge Ponte Milvio can be attributed to the 2006 book I Want You by Italian author Federico Moccia, who made a film adaptation in 2007.  Notable locations and controversies  One of many purpose-built iron trees on a bridge across the Vodootvodny Canal in Moscow completely covered in love padlocks. In many cities, love locking has been classified an act of vandalism. In several countries, the local authorities and owners of various landmarks have expressed concern often have the padlocks removed: Love padlocks in Algiers have been removed by youths * In Algiers love padlocks were added in September 2013 to a bridge that was previously known as the \\"suicide bridge\\" in Telemly, a district of Algiers. Some youths brought tools to remove them by night a few days later,Alger : le pont \\"d’amour\\" redevient le pont des \\"suicidés\\" Algérie focus.2013-09-10 after a video was made by an imam saying that love padlocks are forbidden in Islam. *In Winnipeg, Canada, in 2015 a woman biking on a bridge was seriously injured by a love lock that snagged her forearm, requiring a trip to the emergency room and 21 stitches. Love locks in Suseong Lake, Daegu, South Korea * Authorities in Canberra, Australia, decided in February 2015 to remove love locks from a bridge that was becoming a popular location to affix them, and from other locations in Canberra. Justifications given for the decision were the possibility of future threats to public safety from eventual overloading of the bridge with a mass of padlocks, and structural interference resulting from corrosion. A bridge in Paris was mentioned by authorities as an example of an overloaded bridge, a probable reference to the Pont des Arts. * On 20 May 2015, council authorities in Melbourne, Australia, began removing love locks from Southgate footbridge due to safety concerns. Around 22,000 love locks were reported to have been fixed to the railings, causing cables to sag. * In Toowoomba, Australia, love locks have been appearing at Picnic Point, a heritage-listed tourist attraction featuring a park and lookout at the top of the Great Dividing Range. * On Vancouver Island, Canada, love padlocks appearing along the Wild Pacific Trail in Ucluelet on Vancouver Island, have caused controversy as some regard them as a distraction from nature. * Love padlocks were removed from the Humber Bay Arch Bridge in Toronto, due to concerns over aesthetics and structural concerns if the Bridge were to become a love padlock destination. Love padlocks attached to the railing of Corktown Footbridge * In the United States, in Norfolk, Virginia, from 2015-2017, citizens removed many padlocks from a scenic pedestrian bridge over The Hague inlet in Ghent, a historic neighborhood in Norfolk. They then went to the Norfolk Circuit Court and forced the Norfolk City Council to remove the remaining locks and to cease encouraging such locks.

Visitors are told not to throw the key from the tower and locks sold in the lobby are opened and provided for a fee without a key to prevent this practice. * People are actually encouraged to leave their locks on chains strung between posts at Lover's Lock Plaza in Lovelock, Nevada. The name of the town is unrelated to the love locks; it was named after a family that settled in the area in the 1860s. The town didn't adopt the practice until much later. * In San Angelo, TX, the city has erected a sculpture \\"Forever Love\\" inspired by other \\"love locks\\" such as (formerly) the bridge in Paris. * In Discovery Bay, a small town in Northern California, a lover's bridge was created by newlyweds Carolyn and Anthony George in 2011. The couple was married on 11-11-11, and after seeing the movie \\"Now you see me\\" got the idea to create a location for lovers to be \\"locked in love\\", by putting a love lock on the bridge and throwing the keys into the California Delta waterways that surround Discovery Bay. Love padlocks on Pont des Arts, Paris Love padlock prohibition sign at the Eiffel tower to avoid fatal danger * In France, in May 2010 the city of Paris expressed concern over the growing number of love-locks on the Pont des Arts, Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor, and the Pont de l'Archevêché bridges, stating: \\"they raise problems for the preservation of our architectural heritage\\". The lovelocks of the Pont des Arts disappeared during the night of 11 May 2010; they had been removed by a student of the nearby École des Beaux-Arts to make a sculpture.« Où sont passés les cadenas du pont des Arts », Les Nuages Bleus, 20 July 2010. Love locks immediately began appearing on the Pont de l'Archevêché and have since spread to at least 11 Seine bridges, the Canal Saint Martin footbridges, and to parks and monuments all over the city. Many tourists mistakenly believe this is a longstanding Parisian tradition, not realizing the practice only migrated into Paris in late 2008 after affecting cities in Italy and Asia. In January 2014, a campaign and petition, No Love Locks™, was founded by two Americans living in Paris in an effort to save the city's historic bridges and monuments from the overwhelming number of locks. The international media attention the campaign received has been credited with the actions begun in the summer and fall of 2014, when the city began seeking alternatives to love locks and asking the public to stop placing locks on Parisian bridges and monuments. On 9 May 2014, the weight of the padlocks on the Pont Des Arts bridge was blamed for the collapse of part of the parapet. The city began an experiment in September 2014 on the Pont des Arts, replacing three panels with a special type of glass that would prevent locks from being attached. On 1 June 2015, the locks were taken down due to the collapsing of the bridge. A website called Passion Locks exists, a tribute to Pont des Arts, where users can send others a virtual love lock. * In Bamberg, Germany, after inviting the public to attach love locks on the Kettenbrücke in 2011, officials threatened to remove them during the same year due to rust. After public outrage and several township meetings, the locks remain. In Berlin, applying a lock to a bridge is a misdemeanor and can generate cautionary fines up to €35. Historical bridges are especially affected, as it disturbs the visual impression, and can even cause an electrolytic corrosion of noble brass of the locks against the baser iron bridges, leading to rust damage. Rust damage was noted in Lübeck at the Obertrave bridge. In addition, damage in removing the locks is seen by municipalities as a problem. Deutsche Bahn, the bridge's operator, threatened to have the locks removed from the Hohenzollern Bridge in Cologne, but in the end relented in the face of public opposition. Lovelocks are now embraced on the bridge, and visitors are directed to them on the city tourism site. In Hamburg this ritual was also spread among bridges and lighthouses. * In Florence, Italy, 5,500 love padlocks affixed to the Ponte Vecchio bridge were removed by the city council. According to the council the padlocks both pose an aesthetic problem in addition to scratching and denting the metal of the bridge. * Venice is among cities where affixing padlocks to bridges is strictly prohibited. This is enforced particularly earnestly for Venice's Rialto Bridge, which led to violent controversy in September 2011. Locks were removed, and adding new ones can result in up to a €3,000 fine. * In Dublin, Ireland, padlocks on the Ha'penny Bridge over the River Liffey were removed by the Dublin City Council in early 2012. The padlocks could damage the protected structure, the Council has said. \\"This seems to have only started happening in the last few months and we're asking people not to do it,\\" said a spokesperson for Dublin City Council. Some locks have also been removed from the Millennium Bridge, close to the Ha'penny Bridge in the city centre, the Council said. The padlocks have been criticised for being an eyesore on public structures. They can also cause further damage when they have to be removed, the Council said. The spokesperson confirmed that the Council will continue to remove the locks from any bridges they appear on in the city centre. * In Scotland, a \\"Mark your Spot\\" campaign was launched by the Edinburgh City Council on the Forth Road Bridge. 4 sets of panels on the bridge itself were dedicated to Lovelocks, with both locals and tourists buying and affixing locks to them. This was a charity initiative that raised £10,300 for the Queensferry RNLI, a local lifeboat service. Also in Scotland, Lovelocks can also be found at the Courtship Maze at Gretna Green. Couples are welcome to affix padlocks to the bridge there. * To celebrate their meeting in Japan, Jonathan Montagu and Nathalie Daoust commissioned artist Clare Grotefeld to design and create a giant bonsai love lock tree for their wedding on 4 October 2014. The tree is located at Beaulieu Palace House, UK, where couples are invited to help the tree flourish by adding their own love locks. * The 125-year-old delicate cast-iron Listed Ferry Bridge, Burton-on-Trent was refurbished (2015-2016) at considerable expense. Within days a love lock was affixed to the bridge, but it was quickly removed, as such items are unsightly, a hazard, add to the load on the structure, and are not allowed under the Listing Regulations. Any that do get affixed are removed at once. *In Tampere, Finland, in 2012, two artists removed hundreds of love locks from Patosilta bridge that overlooks Tammerkoski rapids. They melted the locks into a work of art, a 150 kilogram cube, called One Love. The removal of the locks caused a great controversy. Love lock tree, Beaulieu Palace House. * In Recife, Brazil, a love lock project initiated by Diego Lima was on a fence on Aurora Street; however, after it was stolen and sold for scrap metal a second time he decided not to give the installment a third chance.  Legends and superstitions  On some locations the padlocks have been given almost legendary or superstitious character: * In Fengyuan, Taiwan, love padlocks affixed to an overpass at the city's train station are often affixed in pairs. These locks are known as \\"wish locks\\" and local legend holds that the magnetic field generated by trains passing underneath will cause energy to accumulate in the locks and fulfill the wishes. * On a fountain in Montevideo in Uruguay, a plaque is affixed to the front of the fountain that provides an explanation in both English and Spanish. The English version of the text reads, \\"The legend of this young fountain tells us that if a lock with the initials of two people in love is placed in it, they will return together to the fountain and their love will be forever locked.\\" References Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage Category:Locks (security device) Locks Category:Symbols ","title":"Love lock"},{"id":"6886179","text":"Syed Sibt-e-Hasan (Urdu: سید سبط حسن) (31 July 1916 – 20 April 1986) was an eminent scholar, journalist and political activist of Pakistan.

The affected individuals are virtually always male, because males only have one X chromosome, received from their mothers. Their mothers are not symptomatic, even though they are carriers of the allele, because the trait is recessive. Male offspring of these women have a 50% chance of inheriting their mother's mutant allele. Signs and symptoms A patient presenting with hyper IgM syndrome may be affected by simple infectious organisms in exposed regions like the respiratory system. Vaccination against pathogenic organisms may not help these individuals, because vaccinating them does not properly stimulate production of antibodies. Symptoms can include: * Fever (recurrent infections) * Low counts of IgA, IgG and IgE antibodies * CD40L not reactive in T cells * Recurrent sinopulmonary and GI infections with pyogenic bacteria and opportunistic organisms, and cutaneous manifestations including pyodermas extensive warts. Pathogenesis This variant of the hyper IgM syndrome is caused by mutation of the CD40LG gene. The genetic locus for this gene is Xq26. This gene codes for the CD40 ligand, which is expressed on T cells. When the CD40 ligand binds CD40 on B cells, then the B cell switches from producing IgM to producing IgA or IgG. In these patients a biopsy of a lymph node may show poor development of structural and germinal centers because of the lack of activation of B cells by the T cells in them. Diagnosis Treatment Patients presenting with this disease undergo antibiotic treatment and gammaglobulin transfusions. Antibiotics are used to fight off the pathogenic organisms and the gammaglobulin helps provide a normal balance of antibodies to fight the infection.

The company dates from 1908 as a parking garage in New York City, but became a Studebaker dealer, then, finally in 1958, a Mercedes-Benz dealer. It was the addition of the Mercedes line that prompted the owner to branch out into rental vehicles. Due to Mercedes' insistence that buyers come to the factory in Germany to buy the vehicles at a discounted price, once there, the customers usually had to wait while the vehicle was being built. Most of these clients needed transportation, so the idea to branch out into car rentals was born and implemented. In 2001, Kemwel moved to Portland, Maine. It is a sister company to Auto Europe. Kemwel focuses now on low-cost and student car rentals, Peugeot short term car leasing, and budget airfare.

Unlike other hyper-IgM syndromes, Type 2 patients identified thus far did not present with a history of opportunistic infections. One would expect opportunistic infections in any immunodeficiency syndrome. The responsible genetic lesion is in the AICDA gene found at 12p13.  Hyper IgM syndromes  Hyper IgM syndromes is a group of primary immune deficiency disorders characterized by defective CD40 signaling; via B cells affecting class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation. Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination deficiencies are characterized by elevated serum IgM levels and a considerable deficiency in Immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA) and E (IgE). As a consequence, people with HIGM have an increased susceptibility to infections.update 2013 Signs and symptoms Hyper IgM syndrome can have the following syndromes: * Infection/Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which is common in infants with hyper IgM syndrome, is a serious illness. PCP is one of the most frequent and severe opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems. * Hepatitis (Hepatitis C) * Chronic diarrhea * Hypothyroidism * Neutropenia * Arthritis * Encephalopathy (degenerative) Cause Class switch recombination Different genetic defects cause HIgM syndrome, the vast majority are inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait and most sufferers are male. subscription needed IgM is the form of antibody that all B cells produce initially before they undergo class switching. Healthy B cells efficiently switch to other types of antibodies as needed to attack invading bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In people with hyper IgM syndromes, the B cells keep making IgM antibodies because can not switch to a different antibody. This results in an overproduction of IgM antibodies and an underproduction of IgA, IgG, and IgE. Pathophysiology CD40 is a costimulatory receptor on B cells that, when bound to CD40 ligand (CD40L), sends a signal to the B-cell receptor. When there is a defect in CD40, this leads to defective T-cell interaction with B cells. Consequently, humoral immune response is affected. Patients are more susceptible to infection. Diagnosis The diagnosis of hyper IgM syndrome can be done via the following methods and tests: * MRI * Chest radiography * Pulmonary function test * Lymph node test * Laboratory test (to measure CD40) Treatment In terms of treatment for hyper IgM syndrome, there is the use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Additionally, anti-microbial therapy, use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, immunosuppressants, as well as other treatments, may be needed.

The symptoms are similar to hyper IgM syndrome type 2, but the AICDA gene is intact. These three patients instead had mutations in the catalytic domain of uracil-DNA glycosylase, an enzyme that removes uracil from DNA. In hyper-IgM syndromes, patients are deficient in the immunoglobulins, IgG, IgE and IgA types since the antibody producing B cells can not carry out the gene recombination steps necessary to class switch from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to the other three immunoglobulins types.

It was released as a single on 2 November 1982, the third to be taken from her album The Dreaming. It was released as a 7-inch single in the UK and Ireland only. Background \\"There Goes a Tenner\\" is often considered to be something of a \\"lost single\\" because when it was released, the single gained no interest from any radio stations nor did the song's video on music television programmes. Due to this lack of media interest, the single did not sell well and became Bush's first single to miss the top 75 in the UK, peaking at number 93. It was originally intended to be Bush's first 12-inch single, but its disappointing sales performance caused plans for the 12-inch to be cancelled. The song's lyrics are about a bungled bank robbery as told by a fearful and paranoid perpetrator. As Bush stated; > \\"It's about amateur robbers who have only done small things, and this is > quite a big robbery that they've been planning for months, and when it > actually starts happening, they start freaking out. They're really scared, > and they're so aware of the fact that something could go wrong that they're > paranoid and want to go home.\\"Gaffaweb - Kate Bush in her own words Towards the end of the song, the lyrics and tone take on a dream-like state, which is reflected in the video. A review in Record Mirror commented that despite the comic tone of the song, the end left a rather unnerving effect.Record Mirror single review, November 1982 Bush sang it in what has been described as \\"a curious accent that seemed to veer from an aristocrat to an East End villain\\" (see mockney).Lorne Murdoch (1985). \\"Kate Bush\\".

Fort van Nassouwen) was the first Dutch settlement in North America, located beside the \\"North River\\" (the modern Hudson) within present-day Albany, New York, in the United States. The factorij was a small fortification which served as a trading post and warehouse. History Henry Hudson explored what would be known as the Hudson River for the Dutch in 1609, including Castle Island which was at the center of Native American fur trading routes from the interior. Hendrick Christiaensen chose Castle Island to build Fort Nassau, in 1614 or 1615 as a dual warehouse and military defense structure and named the fort in honor of the stadtholder of the United Netherlands, who was of the House of Orange-Nassau. Nineteenth and early- twentieth century historians claimed that around 1540, French fur traders built a stone \\"castle\\" or fortified trading post on Castle Island in the location where Fort Nassau was later built.Albany Chronicles, J. B. Lyon Company, Albany, NY, 1906 However, modern scholars have found no evidence to support this claim.\\"Debunking The 'French Fort' On Albany's Castle Island\\", Stephen T. McErleane, 2014. Fort Nassau was the first Dutch settlement in North America. Jacob Eelkens became commander on Christiaensen's death in 1616. In 1617 a freshet damaged the fort to such an extent that it was abandoned and rebuilt on more secure ground at the mouth of the Normans Kill (called the Tawasentha by the natives) with the Hudson River. This new fortification was built by Eelkens on a prominence called Tawass-gunshee by the natives. Once the new fort was completed, the Dutch completed their first treaty with natives of North America. In 1618 a freshet destroyed the new fort, and it was abandoned for good. In 1624, the Dutch built Fort Orange nearby. Geography Fort Nassau was built on what is now called Westerlo Island and was formerly called Castle Island. The island was part of the town of Bethlehem until 1926 when it was annexed to the city of Albany. It has been part of the Port of Albany-Rensselaer since 1932. Structure Fort Nassau was a long by wide building enclosed by a square stockade surrounded by an wide moat. The fort was defended by two large cannon and eleven swivel guns. The fort was garrisoned by 10-12 men.

Service history Norwich got underway 2 January 1862 for Port Royal, South Carolina where she joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She was stationed off Savannah, Georgia and blockaded that important port during the following two months. On 10 March 1863, she and escorted troop transports up St. Johns River and shelled Confederate positions defending Jacksonville, Florida, clearing the way for Union Army landings. After destroying much of the city, Union forces evacuated the Jacksonville area late in the month. On 19 August, a boat expedition from Norwich and destroyed a Confederate signal station near Jacksonville. Early in February 1864, Major General Quincy A. Gillmore advised Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren of his intention \\"... to throw a force into Florida on the west bank of St. Johns River.\\" He requested the support of two or three naval gunboats for the operation. Dahlgren promptly detailed steamers and Norwich to convoy the Army troops to Jacksonville and ordered screw steamer and side wheelers and up the St. Johns. The Admiral himself went to Florida to take a personal hand in directing his forces to \\"... keep open the communications by the river and give any assistance to the troops which operations may need.\\" With the gunboats deployed according to Dahlgren's instructions, the soldiers, under Brigadier General Truman Seymour, landed at Jacksonville, moved inland, captured fieldpieces and took a large quantity of cotton. On 7 February, Norwich trapped blockade runner St. Mary's in Me Girt's Creek, above Jacksonville where she was scuttled and her cargo of cotton destroyed to prevent capture. A strong Confederate counterattack commenced on 20 February and compelled the Union troops to fall back on Jacksonville where the gunboats stood by to defend the city. Naval howitzers were put ashore in battery, manned by seamen. Commander George Balch, senior naval officer present, reported: \\"I had abundant reasons to believe that to the naval force must our troops be indebted for protection against a greatly superior force flushed with victory.\\" Seymour expressed his appreciation for Balch's quick action \\"... at a moment when it appeared probable that the vigorous assistance of the force under your command would be necessary.\\" Norwich continued to perform blockade duty along the coast and in the rivers of Florida and Georgia through the end of the Civil War.

After Yugoslavia, he continued working as a national team coach, this time for Cyprus and his team finished 4th in the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying, collecting 8 points and some criticism began for Vukotić. The bad beginning for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification where at the first five matches, Cyprus won only one point – and that in a home tie match against Faroe Islands – was enough for him to resign as a coach. He has been in charge at FC Farul Constanța since January 2006. Under his guidance Farul reached the semi-finals of the Romanian Cup, finished 7th in the Romanian First Division (then known as Divizia A, now known as Liga 1) and most important reached the 3rd Round of the UEFA Intertoto Cup losing to AJ Auxerre (4–1 away and winning home 1–0).

In 1955 he stood at the head of this Institute and made it one of the most prolific centers of ecology in the world. He also kept a professorship at the Ural State University. Shwarts contributed into the evolution theory and chemical ecology of the sea fauna and proposed his own definition of the notion of population which enriched the ecological niche theory. He studied the relation between a human and the biosphere, he developed special methods for investigations in the ecology and was one of those scientists who argued the necessity of human ecology as a part of biology. In particular he developed the morphophisilogical indicators method in population ecology having incorporated the ecology into the evolution theory. Shwarts owned a horse named Horsington.

Salk Institute CIMS also undertook the digital reconstruction of the famed Salk Institute in La Jolla, California as part of a real-time demonstration in collaboration with the National Research Council Canada, Communications Research Centre Canada and CANARIE at iGrid 2005. In efforts to showcase the 10Gb User Controlled Light Path, the model of building was used to assess and confirm digital content production processes and the exchange of large data sets in real-time over long distances. Documentation of existing conditions of the Salk Institute was used to enhance and make more accurate the original model built in Ottawa. Eucalyptus Technologies concerning virtual classroom-type scenarios are not a new invention, however with the onset of intelligent network infrastructure and user controlled lightpaths, there is now an opportunity to make the collaborative process truly participatory. Partnered with the Communications Research Centre of Canada (CRC) and the National Research Council, Broadband Visual Communication research group (NRC-BVC), this CANARIE funded research program strives to develop the tools necessary to allow architects and designers at multiple locations to collaborate in real-time by sharing computational resources, geometry datasets and multimedia content utilizing the UCLP on CA*net4 and Service Oriented Architecture that provides on-demand simultaneous shared access to visualization, modeling, and visual communication tools.

Its main claim to fame was an early and somewhat contentious software patent lawsuit filed against Apple Computer's HyperCard and similar products. Zoomracks, introduced in 1985, represented data in a form that was visually represented by filing cards, known as \\"QUICKCARD\\"s. Cards could be designed within the program as \\"templates\\", using general-purpose data fields known as \\"FIELDSCROLL\\"s, which could hold up to 250 lines of 80 characters.Zoomracks II For the ST Cards were collected into a \\"RACK\\", which was essentially a single database file. The display was character-based and did not make use of the Atari's GEM interface even though this was the primary platform for the product. Unlike similar database programs of the era, Zoomracks did not support different types of data internally; everything was represented as text. When a rack was opened the cards were displayed as if they were in a sort of linear rolodex, and the user could \\"zoom in\\", non-graphically, on any particular area to see more details of the cards in that area, and then zoom in again to see all of the fields on a particular card. The racks could display their cards sorted in a variety of ways, making navigation much easier than with a real-world rolodex, which is sorted only by a single pre-defined index (normally last name). Data could be moved from database to database simply by cutting a card out of one stack and pasting it into another. Up to nine racks could be opened at one time. Zoomracks II, introduced in 1987, added support for report generation and some basic mathematics. In order to extract a certain subset of the information in a rack and lay it out for printing, the original Zoomracks required the user to cut and paste the desired cards into a new rack. In Zoomracks II a report (possibly only one per rack?) could be defined, laid out as needed complete with headers and footers. Zoomracks II also added a rudimentary \\"macro\\" system that allowed the user to assign a series of commands to a letter on the keyboard. A series of programming commands could be added by the user to the resulting macros, including basic loops, if/then and data input. Macros were physically stored as cards in a separate rack, and could be used \\"against\\" any other rack, although the usefulness of this seems questionable (since code is generally tightly bound to the data it works on). Zoomracks was well received and won \\"Best Database\\" by Compute! magazine in January 1989.Zoomracks Author Sues Apple for HyperCard (Google cache of text-format UseNet postings) This does not appear to have translated into widespread use or sales, however, although much of this is likely due to Atari's deteriorating sales in the late 1980s. Zoomracks' author, Paul Heckel (formerly of Xerox PARC), received US Patent #4486857 for \\"Display system for the suppression and regeneration of characters in a series of fields in a stored record\\", describing the basic on- screen operation of the system.Display system for the suppression and regeneration of characters in a series of fields in a stored record After allegedly attempting to license it for some time, in 1988 he filed a series of lawsuits against Apple, Asymetrix (makers of the HyperCard clone ToolBook), IBM (who used ToolBook) and others,The Real Deal as well as offering licenses to end-users of these products in case their uses infringed. Zoomracks itself seems to have disappeared, even by this point in time, and many commented on the lawsuit as a way to make money off a \\"dead\\" product, a theme that is very common today.Software Patents and their Effect on Innovation (Google cache of Microsoft Word document) References External links *Zoomracks II - review and description Category:1985 software Category:Atari ST software Category:Shareware ","title":"Zoomracks"},{"id":"6886528","text":"Still Feel Gone is the second album by American alternative country pioneers Uncle Tupelo.

History The square is first mentioned in 1755 and is named after a theatre that burned down in 1785 and 1855. The Place became the focal point of the city when, in the mid-19th century the railway station Gare de Montpellier Saint-Roch was built some south of it. At that time, a smaller train going to the nearby beach at Palavas-les-Flots also had its provenance on the Place.

He was described by Rodney Milnes of Opera magazine as \\"one of the most formidable figures in the arts world of the UK for 40 years\\".Milnes, R. \\"Obituary: Sir John Drummond\\". Opera, November 2006, pp. 1311-1312.  Early life and career  Drummond was born in London, the son of a Scottish master mariner in the British India line and an Australian lieder singer. He spent much of his childhood in Bournemouth, spending hours in the public library absorbing all he could on creative arts, and also attending concerts by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. He was educated at Canford School and, after his National Service in the Navy (where he studied Russian), read History at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1955 to 1958. At Cambridge he organised cabarets for the Footlights Society and in 1956 wrote a musical about Regency Brighton titled The First Resort.The Daily Telegraph obituary 8 September 2006, accessed 24 January 2014 His contemporaries included Derek Jacobi, Peter Cook, Michael Frayn and Ian McKellen, and he was also a member of the Marlowe Society, performing in Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, which was broadcast on the Third Programme in 1958 with Jacobi in the title role. That year he had already gained a BBC general traineeship,Carpenter, p. 316 and his early career at the BBC was as a foreign correspondent (Drummond spoke fluent French and Russian). In 1961, he went with Richard Dimbleby, Robin Day and David Attenborough to make a series of documentary films in the Soviet Union, selected with his Russian language skills in mind. Later that year he began a two-year assignment for news and current affairs in Paris as assistant to Robin Scott. In 1964, he was part of David Attenborough's launch team for BBC 2, and he went on to direct/produce of arts programmes for BBC Television, including The Golden Ring, a documentary about Georg Solti's Decca recording of the complete Der Ring des Nibelungen (Ring Cycle) by Wagner, a biography of singer Kathleen Ferrier, programmes about Diaghilev, a series on architecture Spirit of the Age, and masterclasses by French cellist Paul Tortelier. His interest in ballet and dance was reflected in many of the programmes he produced for the BBC, and he appeared as presenter in many of them.British Film Institute page for John Drummond, accessed 24 January 2014. Ultimately he became Assistant Head of Music and Arts before becoming director of the Edinburgh International Festival at the end of 1977. Drummond's period at the Festival was particularly successful, and Norman Lebrecht commended him in a tribute for his multi-disciplinary approach in a celebration of 'fin de siècle' Vienna in 1983.Drummond Won Plaudits, Enemies at BBC, Proms: Norman Lebrecht, accessed 18 January 2014. In his Guardian obituary, Humphrey Burton listed several highlights from his tenure in Edinburgh: operas in 1980 including Peter Maxwell Davies' The Lighthouse, for international theatre 1979 with the Rustaveli Company, Georgia, and 1980 for Bill Bryden's adaptation of the York and Wakefield mystery plays for the National Theatre, and starting a book fair and commissioning the Queen's Hall as a festival chamber music venue.Sir John Drummond, obituary in The Guardian, 8 September 2006, accessed 24 January 2014 Radio 3 and later life After leaving his post in Edinburgh in 1983, he returned to the BBC and was appointed Controller, Music (in tandem with his predecessor Robert Ponsonby for a year as Controller, Designate) in 1985 and then Controller of Radio 3 (1987–92) when the two posts were merged. He was succeeded by Nicholas Kenyon as Controller of Radio 3, but Drummond continued to be responsible for the Proms until his last season in 1995. His programming included Panic by Harrison Birtwistle which was premiered at the Last Night of the Proms. While Controller of Radio 3, Drummond introduced the co-ordination of interval talks with the evening concert, doubled the length of the Saturday morning Record Review programme and scheduled the first Jazz concert at the Proms with Loose Tubes in 1987. He also devised 'weekends' covering all the arts in a particular city (Minneapolis, Berlin). Humphrey Carpenter wrote that Drummond viewed Radio 3's audience as consisting of \\"thirty minority tastes, each of which is characterised by its intense dislike of the other twenty-nine\\".Carpenter, p. 335 Drummond attacked Nigel Kennedy in 1991 for wearing a black cloak and 'Dracula' make-up while performing Berg's Violin Concerto,Tainted by Experience, A Life in the Arts, 2000, Faber, pp. 394-395. and comparing Kennedy's usual punk clothing to the vulgarity of Liberace. Having chosen not to renew his contract as Radio 3 Controller for a second five-year term in 1992, he became openly critical of the Birt regime at the BBC, for its managerial and populist instincts. For Drummond, the BBC \\"has been an organisation which has seen itself as leading society, not following taste. If it no longer wishes to be that, I can't see any reason for its existence.\\" At about the same time, he called Tony Blair a \\"professional philistine\\" and attacked the Blair government for destroying \\"the national sense of culture\\".Kennedy hits back at arts elitism, accessed 18 January 2014. At the very end of his autobiography he attacked what he saw as trends in the arts: \\"The lowest-common-denominator, accessibility-at-any-price, anti- intellectual laziness of so many of today's leaders [...] is a form of appeasement. Failing or refusing to differentiate between the good and the indifferent, while sheltering under a cloak of spurious democracy, is simply not good enough. It is a betrayal of all our civilization has stood for\\".Quoted in editorial \\"Piece in our time\\". Opera, October 2006, p. 1159. Other activities and honours John Drummond was chairman of The Theatres Trust near the end of his life (1998–2001). He had also been on the Council of Management of the new music group, the Fires of London. In 1998 he made the annual Royal Philharmonic Society lecture with the title \\"Taking Music Seriously\\".John Drummond at the Royal Philharmonic Society website accessed 24 January 2014. He was appointed a CBE in 1990 and knighted five years later. When approached by the French Ambassador in London (Jean Guéguinou) to offer Drummond a Légion d'honneur, the Foreign Office refused it on the grounds that as he worked for the BBC he was a Crown servant; the year after when he had left the BBC, he was offered directly, and accepted the honour.Tainted by Experience, A Life in the Arts, 2000, Faber, p. 456.

It is located in the city centre of Paderborn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Mary, Saint Kilian and Saint Liborius. The official German name is Hoher Dom Ss. Maria, Liborius und Kilian. History Previous structures Today's cathedral is located in a position that has been occupied by churches for hundreds of years. Charlemagne had a Kaiserpfalz built near the sources of the Pader river. As early as 777 this palace had an attached church, dedicated to Christ (Salvator Mundi) and Brigit of Kildare. This church, located north of today's cathedral, served as chapel to the court as well as a basis for missionary work among the Pagan Saxons. Rebellious Saxons repeatedly destroyed this first church. After the locals converted to Christianity, the first cathedral was built. Pope Leo III met Charlemagne at Paderborn in 799 and consecrated an altar to Saint Stephen, depositing some relics of that saint in it. The first cathedral of the newly established bishopric was a three-aisled basilica, dedicated to Mary and Saint Kilian. After the See was initially administered from Würzburg, in 806 Hathumar became the first Bishop of Paderborn. The second bishop, Badurad, asked the Bishop of Le Mans for the remains of a saint, to help with consolidating the faith of the local Saxons. In 836, the remains of Liborius of Le Mans were handed over to a delegation from Paderborn and translated back to the cathedral. A fire destroyed the first cathedral in 1000 AD. Bishop Ratherius began with rebuilding, but his successor Meinwerk had the previous work destroyed and started over, building a three-aisled church with a transept and crypt in the east. This (second) cathedral was consecrated in 1015, but destroyed in a city fire in 1058. Meinwerk's nephew, had the cathedral rebuilt on a significantly larger scale (third cathedral). This building, with two transepts, already was very similar to today's cathedral. Today's crypt was built around 1100 AD. Similarly, a chapel to St. Bartholomew, connected to the cathedral,The Place of Byzantium in the Medieval World, Steve Runciman, The Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. IV., Part II, ed. J.M. Hussey, (Cambridge University Press, 1967), 361. would be built after 1015 by Greek monks.Krijna Nelly Ciggaar, Western Travellers to Constantinople: The West and Byzantium, 962-1204, (E.J. Brill, 1996), 208. Another fire in 1133 damaged the church, but its core survived. Bernhard I. von Oesede had the building strengthened and extended (fourth cathedral); it was reconsecrated in 1144/45. The current cathedral In the 13th century, the cathedral was reconstructed, not due to damage but to bring it up to then current artistic and ecclesial standards. Construction likely began at the western end of the building (late Romanesque basilika, before 1220). The nave followed in the form of a hall church (i.e. with three aisles all reaching to the height of the central roof) in early Gothic style. It was completed in the late 13th century with High Gothic elements. In the 17th century, Prince-Bishops Dietrich Adolf von der Recke (1601-1661) and Ferdinand von Fürstenberg (1626–1683) replaced the Gothic interior features with Baroque artworks. In 1930, the Diocese of Paderborn was promoted to Archdiocese. Repeated Allied bombing of Paderborn in 1945 resulted in severe damage to the cathedral and the loss of irreplaceable works of art, including all the historic glass windows. On 22 March 1945, fourteen people were killed by a blockbuster bomb in the cloister. Reconstruction took until the 1950s. From 1978-81, a major restoration was undertaken. Architecture External dimensions * Length: 104 m * Width: 52 m * Height: 28 m * Height of the western tower: 93 m Points of interest * Paradiesportal (Paradise Portal), from the first third of the 13th century. It combines late Romanesque and early Gothic statuary. * Pietà, from around 1360, probably made in Hesse. * Alabaster relief showing the veneration of the Magi, made in Nottingham c. 1360. * Doppelmadonna (Double Madonna), hanging from the ceiling in the nave, from round 1480. * Reliquienrentabel, the former Gothic high altar (made circa 1420 from light sandstone and designed to hold the St. Libori reliquary shrine, which was stolen in the Thirty Years' War) was replaced in the 17th century by a Baroque high altar (destroyed 1945). It is now once again located in the cathedral's choir. * Tomb of Bishop Rotho (in office 1036-51), circa 1460. * Margarethenaltar, the only remaining medieval wooden retable, painted by (c. 1465-1521). * Tomb of Prince-Bishop Dietrich IV von Fürstenberg (d. 1618), a Mannerist work made of black and white stone, rising almost 18 m. * Pulpit in Régence style, white and gold (1736), gifted on the occasion of the 900th anniversary of the translation of Saint Liborius. * The baptismal font dates only from 1924, but the Mannerist screen surrounding it is from the 17th century. Crypt The relics of Saint Liborius are kept in the three-aisled crypt, which is (with a length of 32 m) one of Germany's largest crypts. Towards the west are the tombs of the Archbishops of Paderborn. An antechamber features a 1935 mosaic on the walls and ceiling and in the centre of the floor the tombstone for Bishop Meinwerk, dating to the 13th century. Window of Three Hares (Dreihasenfenster) Window of Three Hares (Dreihasenfenster) One of the cathedral's, and the city's, most recognisable features is the Dreihasenfenster (\\"Window of Three Hares\\"). It depicts three hares in motion, arranged in a triangle. Each hare is shown as having two ears, although only three ears are visible in total. The original 16th century carving can be found in the cloister's inner courtyard, and has been duplicated on numerous buildings and a number of shops throughout the city centre.

In 1828, after the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, by which Iran lost the khanates (provinces) of Erivan and Nakhchivan, Iranian crown prince Abbas Mirza invited many of the Turkic tribes who would be otherwise subjected to rule by the Russian Empire to move inside Iran's newly established borders. The Ayrumlu were one of those, and they were settled in a district to the west of Maku. They are associated with numerous villages in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, and are completely sedentary in contemporary times. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some more migrated to Iran, as well as to Turkey. According to Olson et al., the Ayrums also live in the westernmost reaches of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan, where they live as a semi-nomadic people.Olson, James Stuart; Pappas, Lee Brigance and Pappas, Nicholas Charles.

The song has become a fan favorite over the years and was often played live. On the Beat tour, for example, it closed all of the shows and began with a Bill Bruford drum solo. As with \\"Elephant Talk\\" and the spoken story in \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\", Adrian Belew would sometimes improvise small parts of the dialogue. Structure The song starts off slowly, primarily driven by Bruford's drums. After a short time, the guitars and stick are added in; these parts are fairly fast and very loud. They are also polymetric with 4/4 drums against 15/8 guitar. After a while, the instruments all but stop, and Belew recites the verses. They are only spoken, never sung. The song returns to the driving drum/guitar/bass part before returning to vocals. This alternation occurs once more, with the instruments stopping only at the end of the track as Belew proclaims loudly \\"I like it!\\" The song appears as the last track of the first side of the LP, creating a sort of a pun; the first side ends with \\"Indiscipline\\", the second side with \\"Discipline\\". Meaning The lyrics of the song are based on a letter Belew received from his then-wife, Margaret Belew, about a sculpture she had constructed. Live versions Due to the song's structure, it was not uncommon to find that, during the life of the 1980s band, it was performed as the second and final encore, after Elephant Talk, especially on the Beat tour. As evidenced by the many live versions from DGM issues and concert videos, the song typically began with a Bruford drum solo, or Bruford improvising on Simmons drum pads and other percussion instruments while Belew (a former drummer) played a drum kit himself. Some of the lyrics were improvised. The \\"jamming\\" between verses was often extended, and the song, along with Bruford's drum solo, often hauled in at ten minutes or more and would be the longest song on many of the Beat tour shows, the closest competitor being \\"Waiting Man\\". The song and the drum solo on the August 13, 1982 show, currently available for free download in either MP3 (192 kbit/s) or FLAC formats at DGM,DGM . Retrieved February 16, 2007. lasts for 11:07. This is how the song was performed on the Beat tour; on the Discipline tour, the song saw a similar live structure, with some performances of the song peaking at over twelve minutes. On the Three of a Perfect Pair tour, the song was usually a bit shorter (On the June 27, 1984 show, it lasts for approximately 9:22). Several live versions are posted on YouTube and illustrate the various approaches the band took with this song. Since the re- introduction of the song in the band's setlist in 2016, it has been performed with the verses sung by Jakko Jakszyk rather than chanted, with the guitar doubling the vocal melody. The drum solo intro has been retained, with now the three drummers sharing the spotlight. Releases On two of the album's major singles, \\"Elephant Talk\\" and \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\", the song appeared as a B-side. Several live versions have been released through Discipline Global Mobile. Covers Transatlantic covered the song on their album Kaleidoscope.

The seller receives the premium cost of the put price, and hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or rises modestly, in which case the seller retains the premium. A put option buyer is hoping for a decrease in the price of the underlying equity, and upon exercise or expiration will collect cash representing the difference between the strike price of the option and the price of the underlying equity. If the seller has sufficient cash to purchase the equity position, the risk of selling a naked put is somewhat less than the risk of holding the underlying stock or equity (considering the premium gained and the loss from a decrease in the underlying stock price), while the benefit of the naked put sale is limited to the amount of premium gained. Persons considering purchasing a stock for a short term may instead sell a put on the stock because of reduced commission costs and the benefit of the premium received. If the seller does not have sufficient cash to purchase the underlying equity, selling a naked put becomes a riskier proposition. In the event of a decrease in the price of the underlying equity, the seller will be obligated to provide cash that could in theory equal the entire strike price of the derivative. Other stocks held by the seller will not satisfy the cash settlement required upon assignment of the option, and the result could be a margin call by the seller's broker. Due to the risks involved, put writing without holding covering cash is rarely used alone. Investors often sell puts in combination with other options contracts such as for put spreads to limit downside risk. References *Mark D.

This technique is known in both Scotland and Italy, but there are numerous differences between the Scottish and Italian variants, which likely developed independently. Italy The Italian dish of pizza fritta (plural pizze fritte) originates in Southern-central Italy, and is usually made by frying a disk of pizza dough before applying toppings and serving. Alternatively, the fillings may be enclosed in a pocket of dough like a calzone, which is then fried; this is known as a panzerotto. Frying allows one to prepare a pizza without a pizza oven, for example from a street food cart where an oven is impractical. Scotland Deep-fried pizza is available in many chip shops in Scotland. The basis is an inexpensive fresh or frozen oven-ready pizza consisting of a thick parbaked base with toppings already applied. This is then fried until crisp. The dish can be served as a \\"pizza supper\\" (with chips) or single (without chips), in whole and half pizza portions. The dish may be served with salt and vinegar, or with \\"salt and sauce\\" (a mixture of brown sauce and vinegar) in Edinburgh and the surrounding area per local chip shop custom. Often the chips will be poured onto one side of the pizza, and the pizza then closed around them. This pizza is deep fried without batter, although another variation known as a \\"Pizza Crunch\\" consists of a large, battered pizza/half-pizza deep-fried, usually served with a hearty amount of chips and vinegar (which is then called a \\"Pizza Crunch Supper\\").

From 2009 to 2016 he was the Governor of Bangkok. He was removed from the post in October 2016 by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha who used Section 44 of the interim charter to remove the elected official. The reason given for his ouster was \\"...because he was involved in many legal cases.\\" He was replaced by Police General Aswin Kwanmuang. Family Sukhumbhand was born in Bangkok to Prince Sukhumabhinan and his commoner wife, Mom Dusadi Na Thalang. Prince Sukhumabhinan was himself a son of Prince Paribatra Sukhumbandhu, the Prince of Nakhon Sawan, a son of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) with his Queen Consort Sukumalmarsri and an important minister of the royal government from 1926 until the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Sukhumbhand was a first cousin once removed or nephew of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (because Bhumibol's father Prince Mahidol Adulyadej and his paternal grandfather, Prince Paribatra Sukhumbandhu are half-brothers, while Prince Sukhumabhinanda was an indirect first cousin of Bhumibol), in addition to being related to the current King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his sisters as a second-degree cousin. The title Mom Rajawongse reflects his royal descent as a great-grandchild of a monarch. Sukhumbhand is divorced from Nuchwadi Bamrungtrakul. His second wife is Savitri Paribatra na Ayudhya. He has two sons, one from each marriage. Since 1986, Sukhumbhand has chaired the not-for-profit Chumbhot-Pantip Foundation. Education and academic career Sukhumbhand attended Cheam School and Rugby School in England. He studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at the Pembroke College of University of Oxford, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1977. He added post-graduate studies of international relations at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, which he completed with a master's degree. From 1980 to 1996, he worked as an associate professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. From 1987 to 1995, he directed the university's Institute of Security and International Studies. He served as advisor to the Thai House of Representatives' committee on foreign relations from 1987 to 1992, as policy advisor to Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan from 1988 to 1989, and as advisor to the house committee on parliamentary affairs from 1989 to 1991. From 1992 to 1993, he chaired the Ministry of Commerce's advisory board on international trade. He has taught as a visiting professor at Georgetown University and Columbia University. Sukhumbhand was a member of the Asia Society International Council and the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Political career Poster for Sukhumbhand's 2009 electoral campaign Sukhumbhand started his political career in the short-lived Nam Thai Party of which he was a founding member in 1994. He soon switched over to the Democrat Party. He was elected member of parliament for Bangkok in 1996 and 2001. In 1999, when he was deputy foreign minister, he volunteered with a couple other Thai officials to take the place of 82 hostages taken at the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by armed gunmen from the \\"Virulent Burmese Student Warriors\\". All of the hostages were released unhurt because Sukhumbhand went in the helicopter with the gunmen so they would release all the hostages.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/463569.stm From 1997 to 2001, he served as deputy minister of foreign affairs. From 2002 to 2004, he chaired of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats. From 2005 to 2008, he was the deputy secretary-general of the Democrat Party. In 2007, he was re-elected to parliament on the party list. Bangkok Governor Apirak Kosayodhin stepped down in late 2008, after the National Anti-Corruption Commission initiated proceedings against him.

It is the oldest auction company of its kind in North America. The company has offices in Lexington, Kentucky, Elkton, Maryland, Grand Prairie, Texas, Saratoga Springs, New York, and Ocala, Florida. In 2008, Fasig-Tipton Co. was purchased by Synergy Investments Ltd., a Dubai-based company headed by Abdulla Al Habbai. Of the 13 Triple Crown winners, two of the three which were offered at public auction were sold at Fasig-Tipton: 2015 winner American Pharoah, sold at the 2013 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga Sale and 1975 Seattle Slew, sold at the 1973 Fasig- Tipton July Sale in Kentucky. History 1903 \\"Old Glory\\" Sale Catalog The Fasig-Tipton Company, Inc. is an auction house for Thoroughbred horses founded in 1898 by William B. Fasig and Edward A. Tipton. It is the oldest auction company of its kind in North America. Its first headquarters were in Madison Square Garden in New York, and Fasig-Tipton initially sold high-class road and carriage horses in addition to Thoroughbred and Standardbred racing stock. Fasig-Tipton's main horse auction in the early 20th century was referred to as \\"Old Glory.\\" Held annually in late November or early December, the Old Glory sale offered a \\"Grand Aggregation of Thoroughbred Stallions, Mares, Racehorses, Yearlings, and Weanlings,\\" as well as Standardbreds. Shortly after the Old Glory sale of 1907, New York suffered a severe economic downturn, and bank closures threatened the sustainability of the horse sales business. Fasig turned the company over to his assistant, Enoch James Tranter, who brokered a deal with the banks which allowed the young company to survive the financial instability. Tranter's also made dramatic changes to the format of the sales catalogue: originally, the page for each horse offered might list up to 30 generations of pedigree with limited or no produce record, as well as subjective descriptions written by the individual consignors. Tranter changed this so emphasis was placed on the performance and production history of the horse's closest relatives, limiting the page to three to four dams with detailed information about the horse's dam's performance. Tranter also insisted on health certificates for all horses entered into his sales and pregnancy certificates for broodmares offered in foal. Fasig-Tipton was the first horse sales company to do this. Saratoga Humphrey S. Finney Pavilion After World War I, Fasig-Tipton established a satellite office in Saratoga Springs, New York. The new pavilion was host to the Saratoga Selected Yearling Sale, which was held during the Saratoga race meet beginning in 1917. Due to cargo limitations imposed on breeders during World War II, the Saratoga Sale was suspended from 1943 through 1945. In 1959, Fasig-Tipton was honored as the Saratoga Firm of the Year. In 1968, the Humphrey S. Finney Sales Pavilion was built, named after an individual who worked for the company from the 1930s through the 1960s. In 2010, the pavilion and sales grounds were renovated to improve amenities for buyers, sellers, and horses. It is located approximately a quarter of a mile from the Saratoga Race Course. The Finney Pavilion, the center of the sales during the month of August, is a small auditorium with seating on the bottom in front of an oblong walking ring, where the horses are shown and the auctioneer and spokesperson sit during the sales. The balcony area contains more seating and a press box, around which is an art exhibition put on by the Cross Gate Gallery, which is not affiliated with Fasig-Tipton. The grounds also hold a restaurant, a snack bar, eight large barns, an office and tool room, and a large walking ring attached to the pavilion for warming up and viewing the horses. Two alleys that front parts of the property are named Fasig Lane and Tipton Lane. Sales held annually in Saratoga include the Saratoga Sale (selected yearlings), the New York Bred Sale (preferred yearlings), and the Saratoga Fall Sale (horses of all ages). The Fasig-Tipton auctions in Saratoga are typically held in early August. Historically the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga Sale kicks off the summer yearling sales in North America, preceded only by their own Kentucky July yearling sale. There are two nights of Select Sales where only the top yearlings in the country are selected to be sold. During these sessions one can only sit inside the pavilion if a reservation is made in advance. The public is allowed on the grounds and inside the pavilion to view the horses and artwork inside, but cannot sit unless prior arrangements are made. The New York Bred Preferred Yearling Sale is offered annually the weekend after the Saratoga Sale. During the Preferred sessions only selected New York bred horses are shown, and the public is invited to sit where they wish. The sales grounds and seating are open to the public throughout the sale but seating is limited during the Selected sessions. Kentucky Havre de Grace selling for $10 million at the 2012 Fasig-Tipton November Sale In 1972, Fasig-Tipton established its now-permanent headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky. The Kentucky office operates year-round, offering five sales. Sales held annually in Kentucky include the Kentucky Winter Mixed Sale (horses of all ages), the July Sale (selected yearlings), the Summer Selected Horses of Racing Age Sale, the October Sale (Kentucky fall yearlings), and the November Sale (selected weanlings, two-year-olds, racing prospects, and broodmares). Each November, the November Sale annually produces the highest average price of any breeding stock sale worldwide. The November Sale currently holds three world records for horses offered at public auction: top-priced broodmare, Broodmare of the Year Better Than Honour, who sold for $14,000,000 in 2008; top-priced broodmare prospect, champion Havre de Grace, who sold for $10,000,000 in 2012; and top-priced juvenile filly, Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies (G1) winner Stardom Bound, who sold for $5,700,000 in 2008. Expansion The Florida Sale, Under Tack Show Fasig-Tipton began holding sales in Florida in the 1950s. At first, the Florida Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale alternated between Calder Racecourse and Hialeah Park. In 2015, the selected sale moved permanently to Gulfstream Park. The Florida Sale produced the most expensive Thoroughbred ever to sell at public auction, a colt which sold for $16,000,000 in 2006, later named The Green Monkey. In 1986, Fasig-Tipton established a Midlantic division, based in Timonium, Maryland. The Midlantic Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale holds the record for most expensive Thoroughbred sold at public auction in Maryland, a filly which sold for $1,250,000 in 2015. 2008 acquisition In 2008, Fasig-Tipton was purchased by Synergy Investments Ltd., a Dubai-based company headed by Abdulla Al Habbai. The acquisition added international representatives in Australasia, Europe, and South America. In addition, Fasig-Tipton modernized its sales facilities in Lexington, Saratoga, and Timonium, as well as made considerable technological upgrades.

Drugs are also related to crime as drug trafficking and drug production are often controlled by drug cartels, organised crime and gangs. The statistics on this page summarise various ways that drugs and crime are related in the United States. Links for other countries are provided below. Some drug-related crime involves crime against the person such as robbery or sexual assaults.  U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics  In 2002, in the U.S. about a quarter of convicted property and drug offenders in local jails had committed their crimes to get money for drugs, compared to 5% of violent and public order offenders. Among State prisoners in 2004 the pattern was similar, with property (30%) and drug offenders (26%) more likely to commit their crimes for drug money than violent (10%) and public-order offenders (7%). In Federal prisons property offenders (11%) were less than half as likely as drug offenders (25%) to report drug money as a motive in their offenses. In 2004, 17% of U.S. State prisoners and 18% of Federal inmates said they committed their current offense to obtain money for drugs. These percentages represent a slight increase for Federal prisoners (16% in 1997) and a slight decrease for State prisoners (19% in 1997). Drugs and crime Drug abuse and addiction is associated with drug-related crimes. In the U.S. several jurisdictions have reported that benzodiazepine misuse by criminal detainees has surpassed that of opiates. Patients reporting to two emergency rooms in Canada with violence-related injuries were most often found to be intoxicated with alcohol and were significantly more likely to test positive for benzodiazepines (most commonly temazepam) than other groups of individuals, whereas other drugs were found to be insignificant in relation to violent injuries. Research carried out on drug-related crime found that drug misuse is associated with various crimes that are in part related to the feelings of invincibility, which can become particularly pronounced with abuse. Problematic crimes associated include shoplifting, property crime, drug dealing, violence and aggression and driving whilst intoxicated. In Scotland among the 71% of suspected criminals testing positive for controlled drugs at the time of their arrest benzodiazepines (over 85% are temazepam cases) are detected more frequently than opiates and are second only to cannabis, which is the most frequently detected drug. Research carried out by the Australian government found that benzodiazepine users are more likely to be violent, more likely to have been in contact with the police, and more likely to have been charged with criminal behavior than those using opiates. Illicit benzodiazepines mostly originate from medical practitioners but leak onto the illicit scene due to diversion and doctor shopping. Although only a very small number originate from thefts, forged prescriptions, armed robberies, or ram raids, it is most often benzodiazepines, rather than opiates, that are targeted in part because benzodiazepines are not usually locked in vaults and or do not have as strict laws governing prescription and storage of many benzodiazepines. Temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary in Australia. Benzodiazepines have been used as a tool of murder by serial killers, and other murderers, such as those with the condition Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Benzodiazepines have also been used to facilitate rape or robbery crimes, and benzodiazepine dependence has been linked to shoplifting due to the fugue state induced by the chronic use of the drug. When benzodiazepines are used for criminal purposes against a victim they are often mixed with food or drink. Temazepam and midazolam are the most common benzodiazepines used to facilitate date rape. Alprazolam has been abused for the purpose of carrying out acts of incest and for the corruption of adolescent girls. However, alcohol remains the most common drug involved in cases of drug rape. Although benzodiazepines and ethanol are the most frequent drugs used in sexual assaults, GHB is another potential date rape drug that has received increased media focus. Some benzodiazepines are more associated with crime than others especially when abused or taken in combination with alcohol. The potent benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), which has strong amnesia-producing effects can cause abusers to become ruthless and also cause feelings of being invincible. This has led to some acts of extreme violence to others, often leaving abusers with no recollection of what they have done in their drug-induced state. It has been proposed that criminal and violent acts brought on by benzodiazepine abuse may be related to lowered serotonin levels via enhanced GABAergic effects. Flunitrazepam has been implicated as the cause of one serial killer's violent rampage, triggering off extreme aggression with anterograde amnesia. A study on forensic psychiatric patients who had abused flunitrazepam at the time of their crimes found that the patients displayed extreme violence, lacked the ability to think clearly, and experienced a loss of empathy for their victims while under the influence of flunitrazepam, and it was found that the abuse of alcohol or other drugs in combination with flunitrazepam compounded the problem. Their behaviour under the influence of flunitrazepam was in contrast to their normal psychological state.  Criticisms  The concept of drug-related crime has been criticized for being too blunt, especially in its failure to distinguish between three types of crime associated with drugs:Drug-Related Crime, The National Center for Victims of Crime * Use-Related crime: These are crimes that result from or involve individuals who ingest drugs, and who commit crimes as a result of the effect the drug has on their thought processes and behavior. * Economic-Related crime: These are crimes where an individual commits a crime to fund a drug habit. These include theft and prostitution. * System-Related crime: These are crimes that result from the structure of the drug system. They include production, manufacture, transportation, and sale of drugs, as well as violence related to the production or sale of drugs, such as a turf war. Drug- related crime may be used as a justification for prohibition, but, in the case of system-related crime, the acts are only crimes because of prohibition. In addition, some consider even user-related and economic-related aspects of crime as symptomatic of a broader problem.

It was founded in a conference held in Chicago on August 11–13, 2006, attended by about 700 people, most of whom had been involved in the Great American Boycott earlier in 2006.Joaquín Bustelo, \\"700 Immigrant Rights Activists Form National Alliance, Set Protests for Labor Day Weekend and September 30\\" The National Alliance for Immigrants Rights was also a series of coordinated local actions. The first local actions took place in Labor Day. The protests pressure the congress in order to enact an immigration reform. The results were to reach a compromise which was later denied by the Republican House leadership due to the repressive form of writing the reform.  History  Before the Great American Boycott in 2006, there were many protests that targeting a punitive bill that was passed by the United States House of Representative in December 2005. This bill gave the illegal immigrant a label being \\"aggravated felons\\". This criminalized and dehumanized the undocumented immigrants. This sparked the spread of the immigrant rights movement which was followed by march protests in 2006. These protestors demanded justice for immigrant workers working in extreme measures and supported legislation allowing undocumented immigrants the opportunity to regulate their immigration status.  Great American Boycott  The Great American Boycott became an iconic protest that urges illegal immigrant and supporter to stay at home to protest the businesses across American on May 1, 2006. It became one of the biggest US protests in history against the reinforced immigration laws. Most of these protestors were Latino immigrants, documented and undocumented immigrants, children and agricultural workers. This became the Great American Boycott of 2006. Friedman, an author of the book Consumer Boycotts expresses his emotions towards the American Boycott. The real purpose of the \\"Great American Boycott\\" is not to squeeze the U.S. economy, Friedman said, but \\"it's really a day to call attention to ... some of the concerns that immigrants have had over the years.\\"  Frame Resonance & Deprivation Theory  Frame resonance is also something that needed to be taken into consideration when leading this social movement. Frame resonance is the ability of a collective action frame to resonate or appeal to a targeted audience, which is an important tool when social movements intersect and do not want to be perceived as having undesirable notions. Irene Bloemraad, Fabiana Silva, and Kim Voss (2016) explain with the 2006 immigration rallies, saying, \\"Indeed, opponents of the 2006 immigration rallies sought to portray protestors as anti-American, criticizing the display of \\"foreign\\" flags by marchers and underscoring nationality-based us/them distinctions\\".Bloemraad et al., 2016, pg. 7 A suggested replacement term for future protests may include human rights, for example, because this offers an alternative framing, bringing moral values rather than appearing \\"anti-American\\".

The Hydro chain had been created in the early 1990s when Norsk Hydro acquired the Mobil gas stations in Norway and Sweden and the operations of Uno-X in Denmark. In the mid of 1990s Hydro Texaco started business in the Baltic countries under brands of Hydro Texaco and later Uno-X. Texaco's ownership in Hydro Texaco was transferred to Chevron as a result of the two companies merger in 2001. In 2003 Hydro Texaco took over the operations of 35 Rema Bensin in Norway from Reitangruppen and changed them to the brand Uno YX. The chain was acquired by the Norwegian Reitangruppen in 2006. The gas stations chain in the Baltic countries was bought by Estonian company Alexela Oil. From October 1, 2006 the chains were owned by Reitangruppen, who rebranded to YX. At the same time Coop NKL announced that it would withdraw the membership bonus on YX stations, due to REMA 1000, also owned by Reitangruppen, being a major competitor to Coop's stores. In 2007 an agreement was made between Reitan and Shell, converting 91 Norwegian and 63 Danish YX outlets to Shell with 7-eleven stores, still owned and operated by Reitan. It has been announced that the remaining YX outlets in Denmark will be converted to Uno-X, some will still have a convenience store attached but apparently in the future with no possibility of paying for petrol in the store. As of 1 January 2009 there's 69 YX outlets and 250 Uno-X outlets in Denmark with apparently only one more to be rebranded 'Shell'. As Shell at the same time rebranded their unmanned Metax gas-stations 'Shell Express', 12 poorly performing outlets were switched the other way to Uno-X.

United States, 524 U.S. 399 (1998), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the death of an attorney's client does not terminate attorney–client privilege with respect to records of confidential communications between the attorney and the client.. The case concerned the efforts of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to gain access to notes taken by Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster's attorney, James Hamilton, during a conversation with Foster regarding the White House travel office controversy shortly before Foster's suicide. Background On July 11, 1993, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster visited James Hamilton at his home to discuss the possibility of retaining Hamilton as counsel to deal with a potential congressional probe regarding the White House travel office controversy. Hamilton later testified that Foster asked if what he told him would be confidential and Hamilton assured him that it would be. Foster committed suicide nine days later. Starr subpoenaed the notes from this conversation in December 1995. Hamilton refused to turn them over, and a District Court judge, after reviewing the notes in camera, upheld his decision. A Federal Appeals Court then ruled 2-1 against Hamilton, saying that posthumous client-attorney privilege needed to be weighed against the importance of having information for a criminal investigation. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the resulting appeal with unusual quickness. Before the Supreme Court During oral argument, the United States as respondent was represented by Brett Kavanaugh. Hamilton argued pro se for the petitioners. The decision Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, noting the long tradition of attorney-client privilege and stating that, \\"The great body of this case law supports...the position that the privilege does survive in a case such as the present one.\\" In response to Starr's argument that posthumous exceptions had been granted before, and that interest in whether a crime had been committed was sufficient reason to do so, the opinion noted that exceptions had been granted based on an implied waiver in order to fulfill the client’s testamentary intent (and necessarily implied the posthumous survival of attorney-client privilege), such as in estate disputes among heirs, and that there was no reason to suppose that \\"grand jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the client’s intent.\\" Rehnquist wrote that attorney-client privilege cannot be reduced to the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but is broader, encompassing concerns about reputation and civil liability. Rehnquist noted the potential chilling effect on attorney-client communications if an additional exemption were granted, writing that \\"[u]ncertain privileges are disfavored.\\" The dissent Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the dissent, agreeing with the Court of Appeals decision that posthumous exceptions to attorney–client privilege were permissible when there was a \\"compelling law enforcement need for information.\\" O'Connor proposed a balancing test, which would weigh the client’s posthumous interest in confidentiality against a defendant’s right to exculpatory evidence and the needs of law enforcement. Subsequent developments Starr's decision to subpoena the notes provoked spirited opposition from lawyer's groups and representatives of the terminally ill, who warned that people would be deterred from speaking candidly with their attorneys if their confidence could be breached after their death. American Bar Association president Jerome Shestack applauded the Supreme Court decision, saying: \\"I think it's good for clients. It's important for the legal profession; and I think it's good for the country that people will have confidence in that what they tell their attorney will remain in confidence.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 524 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * Attorney–client privilege References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:1998 in United States case law Category:United States attorney–client privilege case law ","title":"Swidler &amp; Berlin v.

Founder George E. Bennett (October 6, 1852 – July 3, 1907), chartered the company as the Acme Pressed Brick Company on April 17, 1891, in Alton, Illinois, although the company's physical location has always been in Texas. The company grew to become the largest American-owned brick manufacturer by the mid-20th century and was the first of its type to offer a 100-year limited guarantee to its customers. Acme Brick Company was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway on August 1, 2000. History *In 1890, Acme Pressed Brick Company was established fifteen miles (24 km) southwest of Weatherford, Texas near present-day Farm Road 113, in southwestern Parker County, Texas. The company town that evolved from the establishment of the manufacturing plant was called 'Bennett'. The community included Acme Brick homes (for 100 employees and their families), a church, a public school, and a general store. *In 1916, Acme Pressed Brick stockholders elected new officers, applied for a Texas charter, began doing business as Acme Brick Company, and dissolved the company chartered in Illinois. Walter R. Bennett (George E. Bennett's son) was elected the first president of the newly renamed Acme Brick Company. *In 1968, a merger of the Acme Brick Company and the Justin Boot Company resulted in the formation of the First Worth Corporation. *In 1972, First Worth Corp. changed its name to Justin Industries, Inc., a 'parent' corporation who would grow to acquire many 'children' companies. *In 1976, Featherlite (then known as Kingstip- Featherlite) was acquired. Featherlite began as a Texas-based, privately held company in 1949. Featherlite began acquiring concrete block companies in 1953 and continued its expansion over the years - now operating 7 block producing facilities and 2 cement bagging facilities in Texas and 3 other locations. *In 1981, as housing starts hit a 35-year low, Acme built inventory: 400 million brick were manufactured by the year's end. *In 1984, record housing starts propelled Acme to record sales years in 1983 and 1984. Acme Brick stamps its logo into the end of select bricks. *In 1987, Acme began stamping its logo on one end of select residential brick. This tradition in brand recognition continues today. *In 1993, Troy Aikman, Hall of Fame quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys football team, became an Acme Brick spokesperson - initially in radio and print advertising, and later on television. *In 1994, American Tile Supply, a tile distributor and retailer in Texas, was acquired. *In 1997, Fort Worth-based Innovative Building Products, developer and manufacturer of a mortarless installation system for glass block windows, skylights, shower enclosures, and floors, was acquired. *In 2000, the Justin Industries Board of Directors approved the sale of the publicly traded company to Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. The boot companies and the building companies were split to form Justin Brands and Acme Building Brands as separate entities. At the time of the acquisition, Acme Building Brands was 'parent' to the following four 'child' companies: **Acme Brick Company, the leading domestically owned United States manufacturer of face brick. **Featherlite Building Products Corporation, the leading Southwest producer of concrete masonry products. **American Tile Supply Company, a major Texas distributor of ceramic and marble floor and wall tile. **Justin Brands - Justin Boot Company, Nocona Boot Company, Tony Lama Company, and Chippewa Shoe Company. *In 2001, Acme Brick set a new company record for shipments - exceeding 1 billion company-manufactured bricks shipped. *In 2003, Acme Brick's residential products started carrying the Good Housekeeping Seal. Brick mock-up panels are sometimes created to aid commercial customers in the selection process. These bricks are likely candidates for the new Acme Brick Company Headquarters building. *On October 6, 2006 (October 6 was also the birthday of Acme's founder, George Bennett), Acme Brick broke ground for the company's new headquarters building to be located in southwest Fort Worth. The , three-story building was completed in 2007. *On January 24, 2011, Acme Brick agreed to purchase Jenkins Brick headquartered in Alabama with stores in four southeastern states. Manufacturing plants Acme Brick manufactures brick (primarily for U.S. customers) at plants located in seven states: *Clarksville, Arkansas (known as Acme's Eureka Brick Plant) *Fort Smith, Arkansas *Jonesboro, Arkansas (known as Acme's Wheeler Plant) *Malvern, Arkansas (Acme has 3 plants in Perla; Perla Westgate, Perla Eastgate, and Acme's Ouachita Plant) *Castle Rock, Colorado (known as Acme's Denver Brick Plant) *Kanopolis, Kansas (Currently Closed) *Holly Springs, Mississippi *Oklahoma City, Oklahoma *Tulsa, Oklahoma (Acme also operates a brick engraving facility at this location) *Bridgeport, Texas (Currently Closed) *Denton, Texas *Elgin, Texas (Acme has 2 plants in Elgin) *Garrison, Texas (Currently Closed) *Malakoff, Texas (known as Acme's Texas Clay Plant - Acme has 2 plants in Malakoff) *McQueeney, Texas (Currently Closed) *Millsap, Texas (Acme's first plant - also known as the 'Bennett Plant', Acme has 2 plants on this site) *Sealy, Texas *Springfield, Minnesota (known as the 'Acme Ochs Plant') Sales offices Acme Brick sells manufactured and purchased products from sales offices located in ten states: *Arkansas (Fort Smith, Jonesboro, North Little Rock, Russellville, and Springdale) *Colorado (Castle Rock) *Kansas (Olathe and Wichita) *Louisiana (Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Monroe, New Orleans, and Shreveport) *Mississippi (Holly Springs) *Missouri (Joplin, Maryland Heights, and Springfield) *New Mexico (Las Cruces) *Oklahoma (Oklahoma City and Tulsa) *Tennessee (Jackson and Memphis) *Texas (Abilene, Amarillo, Austin (Round Rock), Bryan, Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Denton, El Paso, Euless, Houston, Lubbock, Longview, Midland, San Antonio, San Angelo, Temple, Texarkana, Tyler, Waco, and Wichita Falls) Acme Brick Technical Center Acme Brick's Exploration Department, Quality Management, and Laboratory are based in Denton, Texas at the Acme Brick Technical Center.

He was a younger son of the 7th Duke of Alburquerque, and brother of Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 8th Duke of Alburquerque, who served as Viceroy of New Spain. \\"Baltasar de la Cueva Enríquez\\" at Biografías y Vidas He married Teresa María Arias de Saavedra, 7th Countess of Castellar. Administration He was welcomed upon his arrival in Peru at the port of Callao on August 11, 1674 with the celebration of a corrida. There were also bullfights in Lima on November 6, 1674. \\"Historia de las Ferias Taurinas en Perú\\" On November 15, 1674 he reported to the Spanish Court that it was necessary to reduce the number of holidays in the viceroyalty, because the number then \\"exceeded 35, that, together with religious holidays, almost means that the greater part of the year is a holiday\\". On May 14, 1676 the Court issued a decree approving a reduction. During his period of administration, the laws of the Indies were compiled. Pueblos Indíginas de Bolivia Defense of the Pacific coast Viceroy Cueva took steps to protect the Pacific coast from English and Dutch incursions. At the time there were various indications and rumours indicating that the English had established bases in the fjords and channels of Patagonia. Following orders issued by Cueva Bartolomé Gallardo led in 1674 an expedition from Chiloé that reaching as far south as the Gulf of Penas (47° S).Gallardo 1886, p. 525 In this expedition an indigenous Chono named Cristóbal Talcapillán served as guide.Gallardo 1886, p. 533 In 1675, Cueva sent a new and larger expedition led by Antonio de Vea to western Patagonia. The Antonio de Vea expedition of 1675–1676 dispelled rumours about English bases as it found that Cristóbal Talcapillán had been fabricating stories to please the Spanish. While the expedition was away 8,433 men were mobilized in Peru to face an eventual conflict with the English. The military in Peru had also received large donations for the defense expenses. As sixteen men had disappeared at Evangelistas Islets in February 1676 during the expedition to Patagonia, Cueva ordered the governments of Chile, Chiloé and Buenos Aires to inquire about their fate. However no information about their fate came forth and it is presumed that the boat they travelled in wrecked in the same storm that forced the remaining party to leave the area.Barros Arana 1884, p. 119 According to Cueva, Talcapillán was condemned to two hundred lashes in addition to a lifetime sentence of penal labour of quarrying stone in San Lorenzo Island for use in the walls of the local presidio.Barros Arana 1884, p. 120 Uprising of Pedro Bohórquez During this time a curious fraud occurred, resulting in an Indian uprising. Rumors of enormous wealth hidden generations earlier by the indigenous in caves and lakes circulated widely. A campesino born in Quito (some sources say he was born in Spain) named Pedro Bohórquez took advantage of these rumors. He announced that he was Inca Hualpa, a descendant of Atahualpa, and a prince of the Andes. He spoke perfect Quichúa and had been accepted as a prince by the Andean tribes of Tucumán (Argentina). He claimed that his subjects knew the locations of the hidden treasures, and with that claim he was able to take in the governor of Río de la Plata, Alonso Mercado y Villacorta, marqués de Villacorta. Inca Hualpa told the governor that for him to be able to get the information from the few subjects who knew it, the governor would need to recognize him as Prince of the Land. Only that would give him the authority to take possession of the hidden treasures. The governor did allow the Indigenous to proclaim him prince, and he even left with an entourage to greet and congratulate Inca Huallpa. The latter set out to meet the governor. They met in Tafí and exchanged compliments. When Viceroy Cueva heard of the fraud, he ordered that Bohórquez (Inca Hualpa) be arrested. Bohórquez returned to his followers in the Andes, where he denounced the \\"treason\\" of the Spanish and incited the Indigenous to revolt. The Calchaquíes took up arms, but they were disastrously defeated. The survivors were distributed to encomiendas. Other associated tribes were removed from their mountain valleys and transported to distant places. The Quilmes were transported to Buenos Aires, where a town still bears that name. Bohórquez himself was taken to Lima and hanged. Other reports claim that Bohorques had earlier duped Viceroy Cueva, making him think that he had discovered the \\"fabulous country of Enin, and visited its gold palaces and precious treasures.\\" The viceroy was deceived, and gave him 36 soldiers. Bohórquez then disappeared. Removal from office A conflict with the powerful merchants of Peru led to Cueva Enríquez's removal from office. \\"Biografía de Baltasar de la Cueva Enríquez\\" On July 7, 1678 Archbishop Melchor Liñán y Cisneros replaced him as viceroy. He died in 1686. Ilyas ibn Hanna al-Mawsili Ilyas ibn Hanna al-Mawsili (Elias, son of John of Mosul), a Chaldean Christian of Assyrian descent, departed from Cádiz, Spain for Peru on February 13, 1675. He was almost certainly the first Assyrian to visit the New World. His mission was to raise money for the repair of an Assyrian church in Baghdad and to gather alms for the Chaldean community. Ilyas traveled to many places in the viceroyalty, and met the viceroy in Lima. The two became friends. Notes For the conflict with the merchants cf. Margarita Suárez, Desafíos transatlánticos, p. 374 y ss.

Today its traditions are carried on by the 1st Cuirassier Squadrons Group of the 1st-11th Cuirassier Regiment. History Origins The regiment was a part of a small army raised by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar in 1631 to help Gustavus Adolphus against the emperor during the Thirty Years' War. The regiment fought together with the Swedish Army at Breitenfeld, Rain and Lützen. With the death of Gustavus Adolphus and the disaster at Nördlingen the army of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar entered French service on 26 October 1635. During this time the regiment was commanded by Colonel Trefsky and carried his name: Trefsky-Cavalerie (Trefsky Cavalry). With Saxe-Weimer's army France began involving itself directly into the war, instead of only subsidizing the Swedes. The Trefsky regiment took part in the victories of Rheinfelden and Breisach, but with Bernard of Saxe-Weimer's death in the summer of 1639, the army loses its leader. Some of the Trefsky Cavalry and other regiments wished to return to Swedish service, but Guébriant, a future Marshal of France, persuaded the army, with the incentive of increased pensions, to remain permanently in French service. At the time of the Revolution the Trefsky Cavalry was the only regiment was the only French regiment still to be equipped with cuirasses. It had been renamed Colonel-General in 1657. In 1791 it was again renamed as the 1er Régiment de Cavalerie; in 1801 renamed 1er Régiment de Cavalerie-Cuirassiers and in 1803 1er Régiment de Cuirassiers. With the first Bourbon restauration in 1814 the regiment became Cuirassiers du Roi, but it was restored to 1er Régiment de Cuirassiers by Napoleon during the Hundred Days. It was disbanded on 24 December 1815 at Loches after Napoleon's defeat. Re-raised in 1816 it was named Cuirassiers de la Reine (Queen's Cuirassiers). The regiment was a part of the great cavalry charge in the Battle of Eylau.

Restoration When Louis XVIII returned to France again after the second abdication of Napoleon I, one of his first acts was to dissolve the entire French Army. The 1st Cuirassier Regiment was disbanded in Loches. According to General Suzanne its manpower went into the two new created Royal Guard cuirassier regiments and its depot was taken over by the 4th Cuirassier Regiment. The Count of Béthune formed a new regiment on 27 September 1815. it was named the 1st Cuirassier Regiment or The Queen's Cuirassiers (French: Cuirassiers de la Reine). The regiment was organized with four squadrons and received its new standard on 28 August 1816 from the Duchess of Angoulme, in Compiegne. Between 1816 and 1828, the regiment was successively garrisoned in Dijon (1819), Toul (1823), Sedan (1824), Nancy (1825), Joigny (1826), Vendôme (1827) and Tours (1828). When the 1830 revolution against the Bourbon monarchy broke out, the regiment was sent to Angers to ensure the maintenance of law and order, but did not have to actively intervene. July Monarchy The end of Bourbon rule in France also meant changes for the French Army. The regiment received a new commander: Colonel Count Ordener, on 5 August 1830. Several officers, who had been retired on half-pay since 1815 because of their Napoleonic sympathies, were able to return to the regiment. The regiment also lost the name: \\"Cuirassiers de la Reine\\" becoming simply the 1st Cuirassier Regiment. Between 1830 and 1848, the regiment was garrisoned in various cities: Vendôme, Meaux (1830), Versailles (1831) and then Lille. The 1st Cuirassiers left the latter garrison to take part in the short campaign in Belgium in support of Belgian independence. When the regiment returned to France it was garrisoned in Compiegne (1832), Nancy (1833–1836), Paris (1837), Haguenau (1838–1842) and finally in Vesoul from 1843 to 1848. During the French Revolution of 1848, the regiment was sent first to Mantes, then to Paris, to ensure law and order. Second Empire Under the Second Empire the cuirassier regiments of the French Army entered a period of relative neglect. As slow-moving heavy cavalry they were poorly suited for overseas warfare in Algeria, Mexico and China.Louis Delperier, pages 3 and 16 Les Cuirassiers 1845-1918', Argout- Editions, Paris 1981 Accordingly, the 1st Cuirassiers remained in peacetime garrisons for most of this period, intended for use as shock troops in a future European war. The regiment's opportunity for active service came in 1870 with the Franco-Prussian War. The 1st Cuirassiers, forming part of the 2nd Cavalry Reserve Division, took part in a major but very costly charge at the Battle of Froeschwiller on 1 August 1870. Between the World Wars The twelve French cuirassiers that had existed in 1914 were reduced to six in 1919. As a regiment which had remained horse mounted throughout the war, the 1st Cuirassiers had had little opportunity to distinguish itself on active service after the opening stages of the conflict. It was accordingly amongst the cuirassier regiments disbanded.Louis Delperier, page 72 Les Cuirassiers 1845-1918', Argout-Editions, Paris 1981 The regiment was however recreated as a mechanised unit in 1940.
